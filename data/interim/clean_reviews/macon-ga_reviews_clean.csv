2024-06-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"The hosts are responsive and accommodating. This spot would be good for a single person or a couple just passing through for a night. The bed was very comfortable. Due to the fact that the apartment was once the porch for the house, it is not insulated well & the windows are original. While this adds character, it also allows for insects and also the Georgia heat to seep in. The apartment was too warm for us to get comfortable and have a good nights sleep. For this reason, I don’t think it would be comfortable stay for longer than a 1 night stay."
2024-06-01,4.0,Stayed one night,Nice possibility for a stopover on your way to Atlanta.
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Exactly as described and a solid value
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The property was really well maintained and had a lot of historic charm. We were only there for one night, but would gladly have stayed for longer. The bed was like sleeping on clouds--perfect after a long road trip. The property is in a very nice neighborhood and within walking distance of downtown Macon and lots of delicious places to eat. Scott and Megan were excellent hosts. I accidentally left my Kindle behind when we checked out and they were kind enough to reach out to me and arrange to mail it to me. Thanks Scott and Megan!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Super cute apartment. We were in town for my brothers Law School Graduation. The location is perfect for Mercer College and a quick uber to restaurants and bars. The apartment is very spacious and has so much charm. Would definitely stay again.
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great Stay. Great Hosts.
2024-06-01,4.0,Stayed one night,We felt like we had stepped back in time for a while in this historic place. We jokingly expected it to be haunted but we were so comfortable and slept great. Scott was very quick to respond and understanding when I had an issue. Thank you for the overall experience of our first stay in Macon.
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Haven't stayed at many Airbnb's but this one is my favorite. It's an apartment within an old Macon mansion and was formerly the porch. Plenty of space for two with a great bedroom and a very funky bathroom. You can even do your laundry in there. Just about every place we wanted to visit was 5 minutes or less by car. Would definitely go back.
2024-05-01,4.0,Stayed one night,much cheaper than local hotel. pretty close to downtown.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This was a great apartment in a great location! The apartment was very cute, clean, and had everything we needed. Scott and Megan were very quick to communicate with us and even let us check in a little early. We will definitely be back!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,The home is just as listed. It’s beautiful inside. We were here for just a fast overnight stay for a convention. The area is quiet and it’s an easy walk to a few restaurants.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We had a wonderful stay when we were on our trip from Florida. The apartment is so comfortable and spacious. The kitchen has everything you could possibly need and the bed is perfection! We already can’t wait to return.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,It was a quick visit. The bed was so comfortable! Nice hosts too.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I really appreciate that Scott and Megan were open to a same-day reservation. Their place is beautiful, comfortable and easy to access. Having laundry facilities in the apartment is what sold me - so much better than using a laundry room in a hotel. The parking behind the house, which is accessed by the driveway to the left of the house, felt very private. Thanks!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Scott and Megan were wonderful hosts! Every question and concern was answered immediately and clearly. We loved the check-in directions! They were clear and easy with added pictures that helped a guest arrive and enter easily. The living space was lovely. Although we didn’t use the washer and dryer, those appliances were readily available. The big sleigh bed was comfortable and the kitchen dishes were charming! Restaurants were within walking distance and the community folks were very friendly. Macon is a beautiful town. It was the perfect place to stay over at on our way to Florida. We will definitely stay again when heading north or south along the I-75 corridor. Thank you for sharing your beautiful home with us!"
2024-04-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,"The place is a piece of history. The hosts were able to keep the old design and renovate it. The bed was clean and comfy. The kitchen area was clean and I liked how they put flyers of near by restaurants for people who are not familiar with the area. It's a quiet area and the hosts are really nice.
However, the shower area was a bit crammed and small so if you are clusterophobic then you might not like it. The TV is small and laggy so just be aware of that."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Loved staying at Scott & Megan’s beautiful airbnb! Comfortable bed, charming decor and convenient location. And the laundry and kitchen are so great to have should you need it! Highly recommend."

2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We only stayed for one night, however, it was pleasantly no muss-no fuss. The photos and info on Scott and Megan's listing were accurate and clear, which is just what you want for a short term stay like this.
The neighborhood and house were peaceful and quiet. It was a very enjoyable stay!"

2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We love old houses and character. The parking area and neighborhood felt really safe. The apartment is cozy and comfortable and has everything you need.

Their directions were helpful and included pictures, making it easier for us to find the rental location.
The place was very quaint, historic and cozy as described, and they even provided a delightful and very helpful local guide on the location’s app page. We chose to eat at one of the restaurants, which was very good indeed!

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We stayed at Scott and Megan’s place a week earlier on our way down to Florida and loved it so much we stayed there again on our way back home. Great place, checks all the boxes. Super comfortable and walkable to downtown Macon."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This apartment is in such a lovely neighborhood of grand old homes, with nearby restaurants within a couple of blocks., The place itself was uplifting, with grand high ceilings, and rustic at the same time. Part of it used to be a back porch, as they say, but it's very comfortable and authentic. The bed was comfortable. The parking behind the building was great. We only stopped over for a night on a cross country trip."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We stayed at Scott and Megan’s place for just one night on our way down to Florida and wished we could’ve stayed longer. The place was super cozy, a great mix of modern amenities but still retaining its old historic home feel. Bed was very comfortable and it was in a great neighborhood super close to downtown. We would (and probably will) stay there again"

2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I loved that they were quick to respond and made sure I knew they were available for any further information. Didn’t need to bother them because EVERYTHING was listed on the app! ☺️. Down to the picture of the bushes along the driveway 😆 which I actually recognized and knew where we had to pull in!! 😄
My son and I had a wonderful stay. Highly recommend their location 😁"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Beyond all expectations! Worth so much more than the price. Exquisite home built in the late 1800s. Lovingly restored with thoughtful touches that make it delightful for travel - full length mirror, washer dryer !Beautiful historic section in the downtown area. I got to meet one of the owners when I arrived. He was gracious, charming and helpful. Gorgeous area for walking and sightseeing, local parks. I wish I had more time to explore while I was there!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"this place is absolutely adorable! authentic and warm and every way. Scott and Megan are wonderful hosts and respond quickly to any needs that you may have.

2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was a charming place to stay. The apartment is very cute with ample parking.

2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We found ourselves needing an overnight stay in Macon at the last minute. Scott and Megan's place was available and they responded immediately. It was perfect!

Bed was comfy, kitchen had what we needed, very clean. we would definitely stay again!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"This is a quaint place near Atrium Navicent Hospial near downtown Macon. It was perfect for my husband and I while he was having a procedure done at the hospital You certainly could walk on a nice day! I loved the fact that it was once a porch on the old house!!!!

I dont require fancy....this was clean, so comfortable and had absolutely everything I needed!!!!"

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I loved this cute little apartment! It was perfect for two people. It was also within walking distance of almost everything we did. I appreciated how easy it was to find, and the ample parking behind the building so we didn’t have to park on the street."
2023-07-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,Nice area with things to do.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,What a lovely experience. We were traveling from Florida to North Carolina and needed a place to stay on the way up. Rather than staying at a sterile hotel we decided last minute to check air bnb. We were so thankful to find this gem. The hosts were responsive and friendly. Check in was easy and the place was pristine. And to add to the experience it had a historical element that we enjoyed learning about. We will come back next time we visit Macon. Thank you for a great experience.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"So glad people like Scott and Megan are not just restoring old homes but offering them on airbnb. Photos can't quite capture this space. You can feel the history as you walk around inside, and around the neighborhood. I'm glad I booked this place again on my return trip."
2023-07-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,"Pictures were accurate and location was perfect for me. The rooms were large and I understood in advance old historic house and remodeled. I like the quirkiness however I would have liked for the shutter doors on windows to open so the blinds could be utilized in the living room, by not doing so felt closed in. The bed had lumps and humps. Mattress definitely needed updating. The shower was tiny yet functional."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,this is an adorable little place that was perfect for a quick work trip. well appointed with lots of thoughtful touches. The hosts are very professional and highly communicative. I recommend it to you both as a guest and as a fellow host.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The apartment was cozy and clean. We really enjoyed our stay. I would definitely recommend to anyone looking for a nice place to stay.
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Really enjoyed staying here and had no issues. The hosts were communicative and personable. I think it’s a great value for the amount of space and amenities.
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Scott and Megan’s place was exactly what we were looking for. Fantastic location in Macon’s historic district. We would definitely return.
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We really enjoyed our stay at Scott and Megan's place! They were very friendly and communicated well.
Their home is a cute little apartment in a great location close to everything downtown! It is quiet and private and they allowed our pups which was a major plus! The yard is big enough to walk the dogs and away from the street.
There isn't a lot to cook with as far as pots and pans, but the kitchen was well stockked with plates, bowls, and such. There are plenty of other amenities such as shampoo, conditioner, laundry soap, cleaning products, and more. The AC ran great the entire time!
We will definitely book again on our next trip to Macon!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,I really enjoyed my stay! The hosts were very responsive! All was as described!
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,My wife and I loved this older home. It had a lot of character and plenty of room for the two of us. It was also a short drive to our convention and the dining/restaurants in the area. We would definitely stay here again if we had to plan another stay in Macon.
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I love Scott & Megan's apartment. It is nice and quaint, and perfect for one or two people visiting Macon. You can walk to a few restaurants - you can walk to downtown (but it is a little bit of a walk). The historic house is beautiful, and the furniture and decor go along with the original architecture of the house."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great hosts! Super cute unit! Would stay again!
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Scott and Megan were great hosts! They were very responsive and answered all my questions, replying in a timely manner as too. The apartment was great. Everything was easy to locate and what wasn't obvious was noted in the guestbook and information previously provided on check-in. Parking was more than ample behind it and really the only comment I have was the driveway was a little difficult to spot. But, I was looking at all the OTHER beautiful houses on the street and missed it! Directions are spot on and the neighborhood was very quiet. If you're going to be in Macon, it's hard to beat the location and space that Scott and Megan have to offer, especially for the rate. Will definitely be back!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Lovely, unique space with lots of character! Everything was well organized and comfortable."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Lots of space, great value, handy location! Quirky old house, yet very homey!! It’s really a whole apartment, with full kitchen. Hosts were very clear on what to expect and how to check-in/out, and friendly."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We enjoyed Scott and Megan's place! It's a great location to explore all Macon has to offer. The area is full of beautiful historic homes, natural beauty, art and great food (H&H)! Our draw to Macon was to visit The Allman Brothers Museum. The museum and and private tour exceeded our expectations! John was a wonderful guide. We will be back!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Loved Macon and the area around this Airbnb - nice walk to downtown. The Airbnb itself was cute and clean. Loved the vintage feel.
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"It was a pleasure to stay here. The apartment looks exactly like the photos, and everything in it is quality. The location is amazing, as well. The street is beautiful and it is less than a 15 minute walk of breweries and restaurants. I will definitely stay here again."
2023-05-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is convenient to our daughter’s. It was a roomy 1 bedroom., easy parking. It is about 7 steps up."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Scott and Megan's place was super clean and perfect for our overnight stay in Macon. Would definitely recommend to anyone planning a trip there.
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Easy to find, located in a beautiful neighborhood, and quirky-interesting in the best of ways, we really enjoyed staying here. It has everything you need. The place we usually stay when we travel was booked so we thought we’d give this place a try—we will definitely be back! Thanks Scott & Megan!"
2023-04-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,Great stay.
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,What an incredibly unique stay! I loved all the small details still kept with the original home and the location was PERFECT. Scott and Megan were kind and helpful. Would definitely recommend.
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This was our second stay at this location, and we enjoyed the charm of this house once again."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Enjoyed staying at Scott & Megan’s place. It was as described and host was very helpful and personable with communications and instructions. Enjoyed downtown Macon, as well."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We loved the location and loved walking around the area every morning and evening. We could walk different self-guided tours starting from our doorstep. Driving to any place we wanted was quick and easy. We enjoyed the ""in-town"" experience and walk-ability.
The house and area were quiet. The apartment was quirky and cute. Being a fan of old architecture, I was in heaven. The decorating was tasteful and kept the feel of the vintage house, while being comfortable and inviting. I could easily make this apartment my home.
My only negative observations are minor. The bathroom is understandably retro-fitted, so there's little usable room for toiletry stuff. The bedroom needed someplace to place suitcases and clothes without putting them all over the furniture. A couple wooden luggage racks and some empty drawers in the dresser would work well. Again, these were minor and wouldn't keep us from staying here again."
2023-04-01,4.0,Stayed one night,Great stay.
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This apartment was great - very pretty and spacious. Loved the retained historical features.
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Scott and Megan provided an easy rental from beginning to end. They were quick to reach out after the request to stay was submitted and provided clear and helpful instructions.
The small quirky porch apartment is exactly what they advertise. It was plenty spacious for me and my husband. We only stayed one night but could have comfortably stayed a few more. The high ceilings, massive door frames, and huge king-sized bed are amazing. You can almost feel the history in the walls, floors, and creaks.
if you're okay with what you see them advertising, then you won't be disappointed. it is exactly that!
We walked down to the Brick and tried some local beer. The food, beer, and service were fantastic. They were also having Monday night trivia, so it was loud, but that's to be expected.
All in all, a 10/10 experience! Thank you, Scott and Megan."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We were pleasantly surprised by the charm and uniqueness of the house. Our living space had more than enough room! The kitchen had everything we would have needed if we could have stayed longer.
Our parking space was well lit. The neighborhood was beautifully historic.
Breakfast at Famous Mike's was very good.
We will stay again when passing thru town!"
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,The apartment was great! The shower was a little short for my boyfriend but that’s his fault for being so tall 😂 but it was lovely and only 5-7 minutes to get to anywhere we needed to go! Loved it! Would definitely stay again!
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This is a beautiful historic home. Scott and Megan are highly responsive and made the whole process easy. I would definitely stay here again.

2023-03-01,2.0,Stayed one night,"Large but needs much more refurb. Kitchen ceiling flaking paint. Shower cubicle to basic. Bed lumpy mattress needs replacing.
Outside unkempt.
Needs a lot more work but has potential. Over priced."
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This is our second stay at Scott and Megan’s place. We love it! And appreciate their southern charmed space. We come to Macon every year and hope to always stay here or one of their other properties. We highly recommend these hosts!

2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great place to stay!
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Had a quick stay here but overall really cute space and easy for an overnight.
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"My husband and I stayed at Scott and Megan's place on our way to Florida. It was the half-way point from our house to our final destination. The location was perfect. It was within walking distance of Tattnall Park that had 24 pickleball courts. We also had dinner at Yollah, which I highly recommend. The unit was part of what once was a single family home but has since been sectioned off into separate apartments. Despite this, it was very quiet and private. The bed was very comfortable. We had an issue with the HVAC unit during our stay, but Scott and Megan had someone at the apartment within an hour of notifying them. They were very responsive and easy to communicate with."

2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I love historical homes so this AirBnB was just perfect. It’s very cozy and clean. It’s located in the perfect location near other beautiful historical homes. It’s quiet and safe. I was able to walk the area for 2 miles with no issues. Less than a mile away you’ll find great restaurants and bars. I came here alone and I had so much fun. The hosts recommended some great restaurants such as Oliver’s Corner and Dovetail, delish. I will definitely stay here again in the future."
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"I am from Macon and needed a place to stay while visiting with family. The apartment is in a great location, very quiet and the off-street parking was very convenient. I wanted to comment on one of the issues mentioned in another review- the bed does look noticeably lumpy, but we gave it a chance anyway and it was incredibly comfortable, and we had a great night sleep. We will definitely stay here again the next time we need a place to stay in Macon."

2022-12-01,4.0,Stayed one night,As described the unit is a repurposed porch with a spacious bathroom and comfy bed. I appreciated the vintage furniture that nodded toward the age of the house. The floors were wood slats with the super cool 2-3 in baseboards. I grew up in a 100 yr old house so seeing all the smartly designed storage spaces was nostalgic. I did not find an iron though there was an ironing board. Ok. I used the dryer. Clean towels sheet and spacious kitchen with the necessities provided - so helpful. I was thankful for the spacious parking in the back.
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This place was wonderful to rest our heads for the night! Scott and Megan were great at providing instructions for check-in, and the place is spacious and in a calm and safe neighborhood (and just a short walk to the town center). Also, the bed is like sleeping on a cloud! So comfy!"

A great stay. Thanks Megan and Scott."
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We stopped here as our halfway point to Florida and were so pleased with our stay. Finding it was easy (even in the dark) and I thought it was even better in real life than the pictures conveyed. The bed was SO comfortable that my husband and I had to ask what brand it was because we slept better there than at our house! I rarely sleep well when traveling so that was a huge place. Overall, this apartment was perfect for us and we would definitely stay again."
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"A+++ as always! I'm a frequent guest, which says it all. Unfortunately I travel for work a lot but fortunate, Scott and Megan's place is home away from home!"
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This is a really nice place! It is easy to find and there is plenty of easily accessible, off street parking on the property. Check-in/entry is easy. The rooms feature high ceilings, wonderful character in the floors, tasteful decor especially in the kitchen. Bed is super comfy. Location is on a street of old mansions and very walkable. I walked into town in 10min where all kinds of restaurants and bars are located. Macon offers a lot to see and do and I hope to return soon! I had a wonderful stay."
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"what a beautiful place. I loved the ambience, the quiet, the comfort. perfect for one or two people with ample parking in the back. Though I didn't spend much time there, while I was there it felt so peaceful. Thanks"

We were able to do laundry and catch a great night’s rest before heading back out. Easy to find, well lit and safe neighborhood. Would definitely recommend."
2022-10-01,2.0,Stayed one night,"The pictures didn’t look anything like the place when we got there. The bed had a HUGE hump on the left side of the bed.. the shower was gross and looked like rat poop in the bottom of it. I’ll be honest, we didn’t even stay. We walked in, saw the bed, the rat poop in the shower, and turned and walked out. We ended up going to a hotel. We just were upset that the photos of the place didn’t relay to the actual place."
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I stay at Scott & Megan's place(s) regularly and plan to in the future as well. Great hosts and every place I've stayed has been great. Quiet, private, and seemless communication!"

2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Very cute plce to stay. Convenient to downtown area.

2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Scott and Megan’s place is conveniently located near I-75 and this made the perfect spot to rest up for the next leg of our driving trip. The neighborhood is quiet, and we were able to get a good night sleep. There were a decent number of nice restaurants in the area.

2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great location walking distance to Mercer, downtown and the hospital. Charming apartment converted out of the former back porch and a few rooms of a beautiful old house. The apartment feels larger inside than the pictures conveyed. Well equipped kitchen, safe off-street parking, fast Wi-Fi, strong AC and lots of thoughtful touches by the host. (Spare batteries for the remote, sharp knives, and plenty of soaps, plus many others) Hosts were super responsive and allowed me to extend my stay easily. The bed was the softest mattress I’ve ever slept on. These hosts truly care about the experience of their guests, I hope to stay here again the next time I’m in Macon."
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Love this place.
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This has everything I need for while working in Macon for a few days! It’s unique and quaint, with a functional kitchen and a cozy bed. And the location in historic downtown Macon is so great. It’s quiet, even with other people in the other apartments and there’s plenty of parking. I’ll stay here whenever I have work in Macon!"
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"VERY CLEAN! As soon as we walked in we could smell how clean it was. It was a very cute place. The only thing is if you plan to cook, bring a fan because it got very hot with the stove and oven on but definitely worth it. They had everything we needed to cook. The bed was very comfortable which is always a plus. Communication was outstanding. Definitely would stay here again for a ""stay-cation!"""
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Enjoyed our brief visit here in beautiful downtown Macon. Very easy checkin and an especially comfy bed.
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This older home is in the process of being restored/fixed up and the apartment I stayed in is a nice place for an overnight/extended stay. I especially loved the feel of this apartment - the feel of an older/historic home with all the modern conveniences (great shower, washer/dryer, great internet and television, and a full kitchen!). Lovely touches through the apartment were very welcomed to this traveler, as well.....soap and hair care products in the shower, coffee/creamer/sugar in the kitchen, oatmeal for the morning if I chose to partake, laundry products if I wished to do laundry. The internet was fast and reliable, too! All the conveniences of home while traveling, can make all the difference for weary folks. This weary soul appreciated it all! If I am passing through again, I will definitely stay here.
One note - if you are driving an SUV or hauling a trailer (as I was), the driveway is very narrow. There are bushes on the left side of the driveway as you enter, and your bigger vehicles WILL brush along the bushes. However, after checking both sides of my vehicle (the left was drug along the bushes on the way in, and the right on the way out), there were NO marks at all on my vehicle. If you are in anything smaller than a large SUV (I have a Ford Explorer), you should be perfectly fine.
The parking lot at the back of the property has Plenty of room to turn around if you are hauling a trailer (like Uhaul, or something else under 10 ft long). The parking lot in the back of the property also has a light on all night for security (a definite plus!)"
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Hosts were very responsive and courteous. The place was absolutely gorgeous. My wife and I are looking forward to visiting again!

2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I needed a place for a last minute overnight stay and found this cozy little apartment. It was very clean and had everything I needed.

Also, it's in a great location if you need to be near downtown Macon, Mercer University or Atrium Navicent Health."

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Another great stay at Trace’s apartment! Still challenging to drive to but he is totally up front about that. Luckily we park and walk pretty much everywhere. Also the parking garage is nearby and very reasonably priced (cash only!). Don’t gamble with the parking meters on the streets. You’ll lose! Great stay.
2024-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The loft is located in downtown Macon with live music venues, restaurants, shops, and bars all around. Once you park you won't need to drive anywhere."

2024-04-01,5.0,Group trip,It was a pleasant stay.
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"No complaints. Great one night stopover on the way to Blue Ridge. Excellent breweries within walking distance. Wish we had more time to spend there. Agree, the loft is challenging to find, remember turn left into the next to impossible alley way in the alley (left right before the sushi restaurant). I unfortunately didn’t judge the turn properly at night in the rain and will be taking home a nice dent 😂 that’s my problem. Property was great! I appreciate the amount of space!"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We enjoyed our stay. I highly recommend this location.
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Stayed with me on phone until I was settled

2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Great stay
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We had a wonderful time at Trace's place. It is a very nice and clean place and look just like the pictures. It was great to sit out on the patio and enjoy the night time view and enjoy all the great smells of the restaurants close by. We also like that we were able to walk to an event and a restaurant that was close by. Trace is very responsive in a timely manner. Our visit was short and wish we could have stayed a little longer but overall we had a great time while in Macon and at Trace's place.
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"If you are looking for a place to stay that's not far from Downtown Macon, then this is your place!"

!"
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,We were only there for a night. We were able to park our suv in the parking spot provided. We found it easily but we stayed in a unit on the second floor before. The place is huge. Very cool!
2023-11-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"What a wonderful location! We were closely located to many downtown Macon restaurants and sights. It was totally easy to get a pizza, a deli sandwich, coffee or a cocktail. We were pleased to walk over to Grant's Lounge to see and hear the Macon Music Revue. The Christmas lights were a treat!
The instructions to access the loft were explicit and easy to follow. The place itself was spacious! I was pleased with the two full bathrooms."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great Location . Close to everyplace we were going. Plenty of space. Private shared Garage. Kinda tight but accessible. Hope to stay again.

2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Top floor loft downtown Macon was beautiful. Last minute trip due to hurricane in Florida. Directions were clear and very affordable for last minute reservation. Parking was a bit tight, but we made it work. Thank you for the lovely stay."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"great place to stay! little tight getting in the entrance but it's doable with a small suv, I'd definitely stay here again!!"
2023-08-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"Location. Location. Location! Fabulous. Walkable to restaurants and breweries. Comfortable unit with all the amenities. Communication was outstanding. Needed a little help finding the place and they were working on a new cleaning crew. Overall, well worth it."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"What a wonderful place to stay!! Yes, the alley is narrow, thankfully my son was driving. It’s a large spacious top floor apartment. Elevator was very helpful, beds were comfortable, lots of restaurants and bars around and a coffee shop 300 ft away from this apartment. I’m traveling with my dog and there were several green spaces to walk her. It was a last minute pick and we were thrilled. Definitely recommend and would stay again."
2023-07-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,"I enjoyed the loft ir is beautiful. The elevator is great, i was able to stay on 3rd floor, although im in a wheelchair."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Code for garage door did not work correctly but worked fine for the patio door. Everything else was perfect.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Very clear instructions for entry (which was good bc it could have been pretty tricky without them). Well stocked bathroom linens and toiletries. Minimal kitchenware but met our needs. Very specious place and convenient location for walking to restaurants for dinner and breakfast. Was actually pretty quiet at night despite being in the middle of downtown. There were a few stragglers outside in the alleyway in the morning but they seemed harmless. Still felt safe walking with my young kids.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Very cozy and spacious loft as described. We managed to fit my f150 into the alley and back it up into the garage but it wasn’t easy. Took lots of patience and maneuvering. It was an overnight stay otw to the mountains. Wouldn’t recommend staying in Macon for pleasure. Downtown was mostly homeless people/ drug addicts and smelled like trash. Hopefully this city will be cleaned up soon. That being said the loft was very nice and the host was great!
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"WOW! Totally exceeded expectations. The elevator was so scary and so amazing! The loft was enormous and gorgeous. The alley is tricky to get into, but once you are in, getting to the loft is easy. We really appreciated the garage and elevator, made loading and unloading great and it felt super safe. The view was amazing. Wanda and Clyde (?) were very kind and proactive in making sure everything was perfect at check in and out. I absolutely loved this place and would love to stay here again."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We received great help as we were lost trying to find the place but he explained it well for us. Located nicely in downtown.
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Really enjoy staying at Trace place, it was close to were we needed to be and it had everything we needed."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Loft is in great location. Walking distance to everything in downtown Macon. It's spacious and airy, clean and well supplied.  Beds are comfortable. Showers are huge! Loved the artwork! Loved looking out over the rooftops and chimneys of old Macon. Trace is very accommodating and communicates promptly. Resolved an issue, that was totally my fault, very quickly. Like others have said, it is a bit hard to find and the alley is narrow. But it was no big deal and in no way would prevent us from staying again. And the elevator was ""fun!"" LOL It was a great stay in a beautiful old city. Thank you!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The condo is in a perfect location. There are several live music venues, restaurants, and bars within two to three blocks and easily walkable. When planning a trip to Macon, I check availability with Trace first. His places are nicely renovated, comfortable, and consistently clean."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Trace's are always top notch. Perfect location, clean, and comfortable."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Restaurants, breweries and live music all within walking distance. Finding the access drive wasn't easy but reached out to Trace and he immediately called and provided assistance. He was right in the area and came by to make sure we found it. Getting to the garage upon arrival was a bit challenging due to the alley way being filled with cars and people so there was a lot of maneuvering to get our Ford Escape into the access ""driveway"". But other times when it was less busy was quite a bit easier. The loft was pretty quiet and peaceful during our time there and it had everything we needed during our long weekend stay."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This was our second time staying here, still highly recommend! Great location and space! Plenty of room to spread out with large common space, bedrooms, and bathrooms. Want to stress the main alley to access the apartment is busy with restaurants and this time we ran into issues with road construction in the alley but were luckily able to still get out. So just account for access and other parking solutions especially if you have a larger car. But minor piece compared to the value and location of the apartment. Great stay in Macon!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Had a great short trip in Macon on our way you to the GA mountains from Florida. We loved the location, walkable to Z Bar and the Rookery. The place is a lot bigger than I expected, looks like the kitchen and baths were recently remodeled and even nicer in person!
It was a bit tricky to find, although Trace was proactive in letting us know how to set our GPS. We were able to get our SUV in the narrow drive and appreciated having an enclosed garage to park in. The AC was super cold and slept great! Thanks for the stay!!"
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This Airbnb list is amazing! Definitely had a great time and everything looks up to part! Loved it !
2023-04-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Loved the location. Apartment was bigger than the photos made it appear. Beds were very comfortable. Bathrooms and kitchen were fantastic. Porch was wonderful.
Place could have been cleaner. Lots of fingerprints and dust.
Used the stairs as the elevator was a bit scary."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,The loft is immaculate! Location is ideal if you are looking to enjoy downtown Macon. I did have a little issue finding the place but nothing to knock the spot! Will book everytime I’m coming to Macon!
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Very unique and great location.
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Awesome location, and the garage is a nice amenity. Could not ask for a more convenient location, in the middle of all the spots in Macon!"
2023-04-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Great location downtown Macon. Furniture needs updating but the location is great.
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Thanks buddy.
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Great location in downtown Macon. We loved the place, it was very spacious and clean. The elevator was especially convenient to load/unload our luggage. The alley was well-lit and I felt safe walking our dog around the area, even at night. Vibrant nightlife and lots of restaurants within walking distance. 10/10"
2023-03-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"Wall AC leaked. We sent a message saying as such and the only response was ""thanks for letting us know"". We turned it off as no indication it would be fixed."
2023-03-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,Mix up with housekeepers but they came and took care of everything.
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The place is right in the middle of everything Macon.
Very spacious and clean with a great upstairs patio."
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Cool place. Loved the location!
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,This was a great place for a short trip to Macon. We were in the middle of a lively part of Macon. We walked around a good bit and enjoyed our time.
2023-03-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"I really wanted to like this place. It was large and spacious. It will be a great place if you come in and out during daylight or are with someone.
I made the mistake coming in after dark. By myself, down a thin alleyway was already uncomfortable. The instructions were detailed but in the dark and rain, I could not see the numbers on the door pad. I texted the owner and she let me in. Problem was I then needed to move my vehicle and do the walk and doors all over again!
There is no parking unless you have a tiny car. There is a van that parks in the alley and if he was not cognoscente that a car was in the garage could easily park you in.
House was fine. Great paintings. Spacious and bathrooms were lovely.
I hope the owner will consider replacing the awning over the entrance door and some lighting."
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great Stay . Would love to come back
2023-02-01,5.0,Group trip,My friends and I love staying here because it is close to so many great restaurants and music venues. You can walk almost anywhere in the downtown area in a few minutes.
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great location in downtown Macon! You could walk to most things. Navigating down the alley to park can be an adventure but once you get into the alley, parking in the garage is easy! I would stay here again if I'm in the area!"
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Trace’s apartment was amazing ! It was huge ! The pictures don’t do it justice . Perfect location , the garage parking space was super convenient, the alleyway was narrow but we managed to get our Tahoe thru with no problems. The beds were comfy , the bathrooms were perfectly clean , the shower pressure was great ! We will stay here again next time we’re in Macon for sure ."
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This loft is very spacious and perfect for our group. We enjoyed the deck immensely and the location is perfect. During our stay, we were able to walk to the Grand Opera House and several restaurants with ease. We have already booked again for another visit to Macon."
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,I love this place.
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Excellent location in the middle of town! Walking distance to most everything to do in the area. Well appointed, spacious, and comfortable."
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Wow! Trace’s Loft is exceptional! Spotless, Spacious and perfectly located right downtown! We definitely will have to come back!"
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Every thing was great!
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,awesome place to stay. so close to everything downtown
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We loved staying at this beautiful location! Have stayed in his other wonderful properties but this may be a new favorite. Walkable to great restaurants and music, but didn’t hear any noise from inside the loft. We loved the open layout and the great patio! Will stay again when back in town."
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Although finding the loft was a little tricky, the directions were perfect. It’s just that it really is in between roads. BUT, once in, we couldn’t have been more pleased- VERY spacious and inviting, clean, and very modern. The bathrooms and kitchen were my favorite aspects of the property. I will DEFINITELY look for this property first when coming to Macon again!"
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a great time in this loft. It is located right in the middle of downtown Macon within walking distance to multiple restaurants, bars & attractions. The self check in process is a little different but not difficult. Plus, it adds some security to your stay."
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We really enjoyed our stay here in downtown Macon. Great location and was surprised with how large the condo really was. Plenty of space to spread out for larger groups. The host provides lots of details for easy check-in, I would recommend reading in advance to know where you are going because the access alley is a very busy place with multiple restaurants. Highly recommend!"
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Amazing space!!
2022-10-01,5.0,Group trip,Great location. Nice place! Garage and alley are very tight to fit in as described. The elevator was very slow and kinda weird but we just used the stairs most of the time. Overall great place.
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,this spot was just perfect. It was close to everything and easy to get to! while right in the middle of the downtown area it seemed so private and tucked away! i will be back!
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great space
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The location is amazing. Once you find it, which did take us a second, it is perfect. Can’t really think of anything bad, it was great."
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This place is awesome, 5 stars"
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,If you want to stay in downtown Macon..This is the spot...
2022-09-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,"Large, well equipped apartment in a good location in downtown Macon, but when we stayed some areas of the apartment were very dirty and obviously had not been cleaned for some time (floors, outside area and outside access stairway). We also found the alleyway entrance blocked on more than one occasion because of vehicles parked by the entrance. I wouldn’t recommend this property if onsite parking needed. The outside seating area is very noisy due to number of loud aircon units surrounding it. To sum up, its good value but not very pleasant to stay in."
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great location that is close to good restaurants, coffee shops and breweries. Will definitely book again!"
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"The third story loft is amazing it’s got the neatest architecture inside and you can tell there was a lot of thought put into that- the elevator is convenient from the private garage and as long as your car can navigate the alley, it is a really nice stay , with beautiful views at night of the city from the private patio and the Sunset and moon are beautiful across the top of the landscape of the city which can be seen easily and lit by the moon 😊I’ll definitely stay again when in Macon!"
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Perfect location for our reunion!
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"The location was great. There are a lot of restaurants walking distance from here. The view from inside is awesome. You can see the Sun set sitting at the kitchen table, very nice. It was very clean, and it’s very spacious. It’s one of Macon’s hidden gems. Great host good communication skills. I highly recommend"
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Had an amazing time! Great Loft! Communication was Excellent! Super Clean! Great area! Will definitely try and stay here in the future.
2022-08-01,4.0,Stayed one night,Beautiful and very clean and spacious.
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Perfect spot for a trip to Macon!
2022-07-01,5.0,Group trip,It is a hidden gem. Took a minute to locate but was in the perfect spot!!! Will definitely return.
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"This is a really special downtown space, very roomy and charming. It was nice being able to walk to the restaurants and bars in town and yet enjoy a clean, quiet space. The alley is tight, but we were able to navigate it and figure out the elevator. There are instructions inside the elevator that help as well. We would definitely stay here again!"
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Very hospitable host. They are quick to respond and very willing to help with any issues.
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,We loved this place! Walking distance for food and shopping. Live music just a block away. We will definitely stay again!
2022-07-01,4.0,Group trip,"What a spacious place! We couldn’t believe how much space our family had to spread out and enjoy. As others have commented, entering and leaving the rental is challenging because of the narrow alley and the elevator system and even with great directions on the owner’s part, it is a little challenging to find. We decided to embrace all of that, investigated the alley before we navigated it and used the stairs to burn calories and avoid the elevator. It alleviated any stress we may have encountered otherwise. The owners were super helpful when we had questions. We would definitely stay here again. The location worked perfectly for us. We enjoyed being right downtown, appreciated the value of the place and again…couldn’t believe how spacious it was."
2022-07-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,It's always a pleasure staying at one of Trace properties.
2022-06-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,"Awesome loft in a great location. The unit is very spacious and comfortable. And it's in a fun part of town with a lot of downtown perks.
It was a little hard to find - and although there is a parking garage, the alley to get there is very narrow. So street parking is more realistic. Trace was very responsive and helpful when we couldn't find the entrance. Great space overall!"
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This place is awesome! Right downtown and centrally located to everything you could need. The loft is clean and super large. I highly recommend staying here. In my opinion, there is not a finer spot in Macon."
2022-06-01,3.0,Stayed with a pet,"Upon arrival we had not received our code to enter the apartment, after a couple of calls trying to get a code the cleaning lady happened to walkout of the garage. After explaining our situation she called someone and told us that they were going to text us a code. Thankfully she let us into the apartment. It was at least an additional 30 minutes before we received the code. Once in the apartment we discovered one of the AC units was not working. We informed them and did not hear back from them. At least the bedrooms and kitchen had A/C and after a long day of driving we laid down to take a nap. Upon waking up we noticed someone had entered the unit without our knowledge and left a fan. You would have thought someone would have called or knocked on the door.
Overall the unit is on the third floor and has a small elevator that is a little scary. The kitchen and bathrooms are very nice. We found some of the dishes in the cabinets dirty. The furniture in the TV room is filthy as well as the rug in the living room. The unit would be a great stay if the owners took a little time and went thru the unit,it needs some TLC and a good cleaning. They did get the A/C fixed the next day. The location is great for downtown. If you have a large vehicle you might not be able to get down the alley…very tight."
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,This was the perfect downtown location. walking distance to everything. comfy beds as well.
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"You will want to stay here! The home is very spacious and creative and it's in a location close to all the activity. It's also very quiet and the furniture is extremely comfortable. The hosts are responsive, friendly, and helpful.
One of many highlights include the 2 bathrooms. The showers are delightful and there's plenty of space to lay things out. People mention the tight alley to get to the garage, but we had no problem at all with our CR-v. The garage also had room for the 2 kayaks we brought.
I'd recommend this home to anyone, and we hope to stay again soon."
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Great spacious loft in downtown Macon. Alley way was tight but we were able to get our minivan in and out with no trouble. Would definitely stay here again.
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Hard to get to but it was a cute place.
2022-05-01,5.0,Group trip,Very nice place with excellent finishes. Entrance was a little sketchy if not entering through the garage and fold out couch was a futon in a room that did not get as cool as the rest of the apartment. Excellent communication.
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Trace, The condo was GREAT !! We really liked it and hope we can get it again when we work a show in Macon again !"
2022-05-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Really nice property - wide open layout with huge dining area. Host was very responsive to questions.
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Friendly host with great communication and service!!
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,The room was great. Trace was very helpful and quick to respond.
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The apartments were perfect. We rented the 3rd floor and one on the 2nd floor. Clean, great location and plenty of space. We will be back!
Thank you!
K.E"
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a great stay here! The location is great to walk and see all Macon has to offer. The communication from the management team is great, perhaps the best and most responsive we have dealt with. As mentioned before, while it is great having a garage to park in, navigating the alley is somewhat challenging. But parking and walking is the way to go."
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,!
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Excellent place, location and value!
Thank you Trace"

2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The Loft is exactly like the pictures, very clean, have everything you needed, is in the downtown of Macon and everything is walking distance. Very nice decoration! I really recommend it!!!"
2022-03-01,4.0,Stayed one night,Great location and neat space in downtown Macon. We rented the third floor unit which allowed for roof access and a pretty neat view of downtown.
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The accommodations were spacious, well appointed and in a great location downtown near many restaurants. We enjoyed our stay."
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Fantastic location. Perfect for two couples and easy to walk to several locations. The alley was tight but we got back there fine in our car. I can see why some people didn't dig the elevator, but there are outdoor stairs that can easily be used instead. I'd definitely recommend staying here."
2022-03-01,4.0,Stayed one night,Love this loft and the views from the roof! Very clean and private. Would stay here again :)
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great place to stay in the heart of downtown macon . Very spacious ! Host were awesome .

2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Really cool property, in a great location. Second time staying here and really glad we did."
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I hope to have another reason to go visit Macon so we could stay again. Albeit, finding it through the allies was a little tricky, and you can’t really use the garage unless you are on a 2 wheeler, no complaints."
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Great place tucked away from main streets. Large and clean. We were a bit confused on finding the garage...at first, we were thinking it was the large parking garage on the corner. The alley to the building is tight...its the smaller alley off the Mulberry St Ln alley, (turn left into it, just before the Ninja restaurant). I was able to get my 4Runner down it. Again, great place and location. Would definitely stay again."
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We had a great stay. Lots of space and great location.
2022-02-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"The loft was beautiful , very clean and easy access to the inside . I loved the view of the city , I will definitely book again . Communication was great as well ."

2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful loft! Had an amazing time. Was in walking distance of so many cool places downtown
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Very Nice
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,expect a dope viewing experience. you get to see Macon from a different perspective.
2021-12-01,2.0,Stayed with a pet,"The owner was lovely and stayed on the phone while I searched for the place (and cried) late at night. He has also made quite an effort to decorate and provision this home.
Alas:
1. Access to this home is unmarked and unsafe. We arrived late, after bars had closed. The stench of stale bar trash prevailed. Only with the owners guidance did we find the spot. It is tucked behind alleys and dumpsters and not accessible by car.
2. We were followed and in fear of bring robbed during much of this. This is not a safe nightime place to be without use of your car and lost (two conditions that will attend most rentals, in my view).
3. This third floor unit has elevator only access. The elevator is terrifying and does not appear to be professionally installed. There was a worrying gap that is not suitable for pets or children.
4. We stayed for less than an hour and went to a Red Roof Inn.
5. The dining rug is stained and I did not get the sense that bedding is laundered between each guest.
6. My advice is to avoid."
2021-12-01,3.0,Stayed with a pet,Great location. Very nice layout of unit. The futon is really only good for a small child so four can sleep comfortably. Our Jeep could fit down the alley with no issues.
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Older building but very clean and updated. Great stay
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This loft was just perfect for our purposes. Perfect location, well appointed, and clean. It really was perfect. Highly recommend."

2021-11-01,5.0,Group trip,Super convenient to downtown Macon everything. Very spacious and well appointed…needs nothing.
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This airbnb is amazing! It was walking distance to so many great places (arcade bar, dueling piano bar, all the restaurants). It was also very spacious and clean! The hosts were very responsive and I felt safe. It was kind of hard to find (off an alleyway, which is off an alleyway), but the instructions sent were perfect. 10/10 would stay here again"
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Wonderful!! All the things we were looking for in accommodations, location and more. Clean as a whistle; comfortable beds, lots of room to roam, cool touches throughout. Communication was spot on. We look forward to staying with this host again."
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great location, near everything, very clean."
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Great location and easy to walk to restaurants & more downtown. The loft has a ton of space and accommodated our family perfectly. As mentioned in the posting, the parking in the attached garage can be tight. There were also a few times that parked cars were blocking the alley, which forced us to use street parking.
Would recommend!"
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great location and easy access.
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Everything was great and as advertised.

2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The location is great, it’s close to all the shops and restaurants downtown and walking distance to the Macon City Auditorium. We had an issue with the air conditioner which they got repaired the next morning and I was given monetary compensation for the inconvenience. Trace, Mike and Christine are great hosts. This is the 2nd unit we have rented from Trace and we look forward to staying in one of their rentals in the future. My only suggestion would be to put a television in the bedrooms. Thank you all again."
2021-07-01,3.0,Stayed one night,It was an okay stay!
2021-07-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,Great location in downtown Macon. Easy walking to all our favorite restaurants and breweries! Great hosts who were very quick to respond with messages! Love this place!
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We were in Macon for business. Trace's Airbnb is in a great location Across the street from the courthouse and very convenient to several restaurants. The unit we stayed in was very clean and spacious. Loved the decorations. We will definitely stay there again. Next time for more pleasure than business so we can checkout the downtown night life.
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"My friends and I are road tripping and although we didn’t get to check in until 4 AM, this air bnb was a sight for sore eyes! Very clean and great location. Trace did a great job with telling us how to access this location and the town is quaint and quiet. Thank you for the hospitality!"
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great location and very nice host. Very responsive. Beautiful loft
2021-07-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"The loft is a stunning apartment, decorated beautifully and very comfortable and spacious. The location is extremely difficult to find and a challenge to get into in order to take advantage of the ""off street"" parking. On the other hand, the location is perfect for taking advantage of all of the things that are fun to do in Macon. It would not have been a problem at all if I had not been on crutches.
Overall, the stay was great and once we got a handle on the idiosyncrasies, we really enjoyed ourselves."
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,.
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We loved our stay at this fun, unique loft. It’s quiet and clean, and the location is super convenient for shopping and walking downtown. Excellent communication from the owners… Will definitely stay there again!"
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,The pictures don't do it justice as it's way bigger than the pictures make it seem. Just a wonderful place to stay tucked away in downtown Macon.
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Stayed at Trace’s place twice and loved it both times! Would definitely recommend.
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,this place was perfect for my family of 5 (plus our old dog) as a stopping point on our way to florida. the space is huge and everyone loved it. thanks again!

2021-06-01,4.0,Stayed one night,Great location and huge!! Trace’s place did not disappoint. This hidden gem is tucked away in the middle of town and you wouldn’t know it’s there unless you went looking for it. Very clean and much larger than it appears in photos. Highly recommend.
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place was cool! It's in the middle of the action in macon's downtown. Entering from the back alley, you have no idea what a beautiful, spacious condo awaits you on the third floor. The elevator directly from the garage into the condo was a cool feature."

2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Great location and loft is well appointed. The elevator gave us some issues, but the stay was otherwise enjoyable! Is tucked away quite a bit, so be patient in trying to locate the property."
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This loft is ADORABLE! Great location, walking distance to all the bars/nightlife. Space was very clean and comfortable. Note to finding it: Turn down the alley by the pizza place. The ally is VERY narrow, but was able to get our 4Runner down and parked.

2021-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful place right in the heart of everything downtown. Really difficult to find. But once you do, it’s worth it!"
2021-04-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Trace lives up to the AIRBNB protocol. We plan to stay here again in a few months, as I cannot imagine a more perfect location for downtown Macon. There are about 10 great restaurants within a 5 minute walk. The spacious garage offers convenient free parking, a real plus. I could go on and on, but succinctly, this is a 5 star place. Book it. A little hard to find so I suggest setting your GPS for the Tokyo Alley Japanese restaurant, and eat there, its delicious."

2021-03-01,3.0,Stayed with kids,"My daughter received a nasty cut while staying here because of glass that wasn’t cleaned before we arrived. Maybe from the prior guest. Trace responded back quick and refunded our cleaning fee. Overall, it’s a really nice place. Uniquely put together."
2021-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Trace and the loft did not disappoint. We had a great stay,, loved the location and the personal touches that Trace provided! The location is perfect ,,, close to great food and fun. We especially liked hanging outside at fall line brewery and their yummy beer!
The loft had everything you would need for a long stay and the newly covered patio was a great place to hang out and eat some lunch or have a drink at night. The showers were incredible if you like a lot of water pressure (which we do) ,, it’s better then my house.
So basically the first day of getting into the ally to the garage was a bit hectic,, not knowing what to expect and reading the reviews made me a little nervous. I have a 4 door Jeep Wrangler which isn’t small by any means ,, let’s just say by the end of the week I was a pro at getting in and out of there without problems ,,, just take your time and you’ll be fine ( maybe not drink a ton and try it lol)
Other then that , if we ever come back to Macon we would for sure look up Trace and his loft! Thanks for the good time and good place!
PS,,, I forgot to mention the bed was comfortable as well!"

One thing to note, the listing says 4 queen beds but two of the rooms are actually full beds. Not a huge deal, but our group was 4 couples and the queen beds were one of the main reasons we chose the house!
Otherwise, everything was great and we felt very safe in the neighborhood- so easy to get downtown!"

Ample space, plenty of bathrooms, a well-equipped kitchen. And a pool table! We didn’t bring the dog, but can see that it would work well for her being here. No notes!
Great location in the heart of downtown: 1 block to Tatnall Square Park (a pickleball hotbed, apparently). 2 blocks to Mercer’s campus (the historic side), and the new restaurant row adjacent to it. Across the street from a great dog park. 1.5 miles from Kroger, Ingleside Village Pizza, Hay House and more.

We all thought the beds were very comfortable, The house was fully stocked and had good WIFI, all the streaming services, tastefully decorated, good heating and air. Newly remodeled so it was like staying in a new house. It's pet friendly so next time we are planning to bring our dog with us. The hosts were great, very responsive, and flexible as one of our guests was a musician and requested a late check out, just an hour extension but they didn't hesitate to allow this and were even willing to reschedule the cleaning crew if we needed that.
It was a great value for our dollars, much nicer than almost any hotel for less money when you have 4 or more guests."

The kitchen is well stocked and it has an open concept. Lots of places to sit in the kitchen and living room. The bedrooms are cozy and the beds are very comfortable. The house is on a hill and there are a lot of concrete steps to get to the house which was not a problem for us - this is just an fyi if you are concerned about steps.

The hosts gave detailed instructions to find the house, park and get into the apartment. We didn't have any trouble finding our way.
The beds were comfy and the space is just like the listing photos. It was nice to stay downtown and have parking on site.
There was not much to do before checkout. I really appreciated that the hosts only asked us to gather the towels and turn everything off. The area was safe and well lit."

Richard was a wonderful host. He showed me around the kitchen and made me feel very welcome to use it whenever needed. We enjoyed our food outside on his back patio. The bed was really comfortable. The sunporch was a nice place to sit and relax. As mentioned in other reviews, there is train that comes through at night but it didn't bother us since we have a train that comes through our hometown and we are used to the sound of the train horn. The space is clean and comfortable in a lovely setting and their dog is really sweet. We will definitely come back on our next drive to Florida."

2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We were so glad to find Richard & Elaina's place. We were travelling from Indiana to Florida and found ourselves in the middle of a torrential rain and wind storm at the end of a long day of driving. Tired of the commercial hotels that line the Interstate we checked Airbnb and Shady Rest Farm popped up. We made the reservation, communication was instantaneous, and an hour later we were snug, safe, and cozy in a nice private room in a lovely rural area of Georgia. Just what we were looking for and at a great price. The only downside was the storm. Otherwise we would have spent time exploring the outdoor surroundings that no doubt makes this a charming and enjoyable place to stay. If we hadn't had a deadline to meet we also would have stayed in the morning for the coffee offered in the host home's kitchen. All in all, storm notwithstanding, we had a good rest and found this to be a great place to spend the night. We hope to visit again. Thanks Richard & Elaina!"

2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,The bed is worth it all. Never had a bed that was as good as our own back home. We slept like a log each time we stayed in Richard's place. There may be not much extra space but the bed is everything that really matters.

2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Our stay at Richard's was pleasant one. He was very responsive, courteous, and the room was exactly as described. I told Richard our ETA, which was in the evening, and he made sure to have plenty of lights on for us which was helpful. Coffee was ready in the morning and I definitely appreciated it. Upon checking out, Richard wished us safe travels. I forgot to thank him so, Sorry! Thank you Richard!"
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Being a horrible estimator, I was super grateful at how gracious Richard was as my arrival time kept being pushed back later and later into the night.
I was overjoyed once I arrived to be able to use a private entrance to the unit, heat up leftovers, and just go to sleep in Richard's beautiful space.
A couple passing trains did wake me up overnight, but it was easy to fall back asleep / be fully rested for an early rise and departure.
Normally a very jocular and jovial soul, I was driving solo this go 'round / glad to just dip in and out of a great place on my way to my next travel destination."

2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This place was wonderful and absolutely perfect for my overnight stay. Very comfortable and I loved everything about it! The price was great and I appreciate the affordability, there are so many on AirBNB that add on a bunch of extra fees, and I’m so thankful this one was a straightforward cost. I drove down the night before for an annual company meeting instead of driving three hours from home and back in one day. I was thrilled to find this place and it was so nice! Everything was super clean, the linens were fresh and smelled great, the bed was comfortable, and the lights around the ceiling were awesome! I watched tv and relaxed before going to sleep, and I slept so good. I highly recommend this place and I look forward to staying there again! Thank you!"

2023-12-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,I enjoyed staying in this little room for two days. It was very easy to find and Richard is easy to get in touch with.

The grounds are right beside a train track but I found it peaceful when it went by and my fiance didn't even wake up. The flexible check in time was phenomenal as we got in alot later than expected. The room was so cute and tidy, it was a little chilly but there was a tiny space heater that worked great to heat the place. Such a fantastic host and extremely responsive as well."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This was just what my husband and I needed - beautiful room, private bathroom, private little sunroom, and access to the hosts” kitchen, at a great price.

2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Richard's spare room was the coolest place ever! There is a small porch where I could read while hubby slept. The bedroom had lots of pictures that we enjoyed looking at. Richard had great recommendations for restaurants. The train came through in the middle of the night but we went right back to sleep. It was a very peaceful home. Little touches of hospitality were everywhere. I can't recommend this Airbnb enough. A++++

2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Richard is a great host, he gave us clear information about check in and house organization. The room is not so spacious but it's perfect clean and very comfortable.

2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,I sooo enjoyed my second stay at this wonderful and peaceful retreat! It is exactly as pictured and so warm and welcoming! Great hosts!!
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Great place to lay your head- cozy and comfy. The room is small but charming and everything is provided that you might need. Bed is great and the tv is fully loaded. The room and bathroom are clean and the family is very hospitable.
The house is next to a RR and trains whistle as they go through. Loud but it didn’t bother me.
I read a complaint that the room is small, and yes, the bathroom door blocks the foot of the bed- but I was only there to sleep. It shouldn’t be a problem - not sure what was expected.
There isn’t a lot of space to hang, but there is a lovely indoor porch area with one chair to relax in. Perfect overnight on my drive from Fl to north GA.
I didn’t see the host- but he was very responsive and provided for everything. I would definitely stay again. Great price, easy to park (although I was sure to come before dark) and comfortable to stay in. (did I mention it was comfortable;)!)"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Thank you for your Southern hospitality ! I do apologize for not asking first before using the washer & dryer . I don’t normally do this , but we were very desperate with limited time and an unscheduled work commitment. All the best ."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Exactly like the photos, very comfy bed, and nice linens/towels! The space is very cozy and comfortable with beautiful surroundings! Great hosts also! I had a wonderful stay and will definitely book again!"
2023-07-01,3.0,Stayed one night,Outside surrounding needed attention. The private entrance door steps dirty and not for the elderly. Very small room. On the plus side it was quite . Don’t know who Richard is. No one to answer questions about the area. The nice picture is of another part of the house not your entrance. Beautiful white picket fence.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"What a great little place to stay!! My husband & I were on a weekend getaway & this place was perfect and a great value!!! Richard was very accommodating & friendly and even provided snacks.....he and my husband hit it off immediately over morning coffee!! EL, Richard's dog was the best greeter :) The bed was super comfy and the reading nook was my favorite part!! We will definitely book with Richard again as we hope to come back in cooler weather to explore some Georgia state parks. A++++ Richard & Eleana!!!!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We stayed at Richard's for one night. It was everything we needed, and it fully met our expectations based on the listing description and photos. We arrived late evening, but there was no difficult navigating to the house through the local roads with map apps. The room and bathroom were both very clean, and small snacks and water were also much appreciated after a long road trip. The bed was very comfortable and apart from the train at night (which may bellow a few times, but we've had much worse noise issues), the whole place is expectedly very quiet. I may be wrong, but the room decor seems to tell an interesting personal story; that's something to appreciate compared to some places that may otherwise give you a bare minimum. El greeting us in the morning was an added and welcome bonus - she's well behaved and a great companion to hang around with if she's outside and you're staying longer. We would stay here again if we found ourselves passing through. Thank you, Richard!"

Private entrance, easily accessible.

Easy off/on to the Interstate but far enough away to avoid road noise.
Just what we needed!

2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Booked Richard’s room by accident (different city from where I was headed) he graciously refunded me the maximum amount Airbnb will allow. (I believe it’s 75% of the total price)
I chose 5 stars for that reason alone. Didn’t actually stay at Richard’s place but Airbnb wouldn’t allow me to leave a review without closing a star value for each possible facet of the stay."

It was a VERY stressful and emotional visit for me, but Richard and his family made us feel very welcomed and right at home! I wish I could have stayed another night. The room was absolutely cute and perfect for a quick visit! They also had a nice back porch / sitting area with strung up lights that had a warm glow at night. My boyfriend and I sat out there for a bit to unwind and it was so relaxing!
I can't thank you guys enough for your hospitality and allowing us into your home! It was a perfect get-away for a stressful time and I can't thank you guys enough!

2024-05-01,5.0,Group trip,"The cottage was exactly as described and was full of history. We enjoyed our stay, the walks to the grotto and hidden pool, and congregating downstairs in the kitchen for coffee in the morning. We all agreed that it was an extremely cool property and the master bath was a huge draw. Looking out at night from those windows was magical. The highlight for the kids was the two cats outside; Silver and Rosie. The kids loved that they were so sweet and would go for walks with us."

2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We had a fantastic stay at this cabin! it was perfect for the holidays and is so unique. Super clean and the hosts were responsive. We will gladly stay again!

2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,The house was Amazing. The host was superb and down town christmas lights were beautiful. A storybook Christmas with our daughter and grand daughter. THANK YOU!
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We loved the place. What more can I say.
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place was just what the kids and I needed after losing my husband and father of my children on July 24th, 2022. The kids and I spent Thanksgiving in this magical place. We walked the trails behind the cabin and enjoyed the Grotto. The kitty’s that come with the cabin, were friendly and led the trail. The cabinet self was very historic, and it felt like. home. I played Noel on the piano for the kids. This place is all that and more! 5 star in my book! Perfect for family get together. We loved it so much, thinking of making this an annual affair! Thanks for the great stay! The Owners were lovely people!"
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Our family of 5 really enjoyed this lodge. The property was very peaceful and we had a great time exploring the trails that are right behind the house. The home was very spacious yet cozy. Perfect place to relax and unwind. We even got to explore downtown Macon which was really nice and decorated for the holidays. Overall excellent place and we look forward to returning in the future!!!
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Thank you
2023-11-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"My family and I had a nice stay at this VERY UNIQUE, HUGE Historic Lodge. The property is GORGEOUS with trails wrapping around to the Grotto and back behind the house. This is a historic lodge/house so it has an older house smell and lots of creaky noises from the wooden floors. The Master Bathroom is SO beautiful, but you have zero privacy to undress/take a shower in there, especially with the lights on. It has large windows that look out to the beautiful woods. My concern was other guests who rent the 2nd cabin on the property and perhaps a trespasser has an excellent view of whomever uses the bathroom. The owner also told me her family member lives on the property, so I wouldn’t say the woods are private even tho it’s privately owned, because of those factors. We ended up taking sheets and throwing them over the shower area to provide some privacy to undress/dress in there after our shower. I spoke with tntbnb, who were kind/caring, and professionally responsive to my feedback."
2023-11-01,5.0,Group trip,Very comfortable and all guests felt right at home. The kitchen had a wonderful area that became the center of our socialization. We booked the home for our tennis tournament which was held 2 miles away. It was the absolute perfect situation and the hosts were very welcoming and responsive to any questions. Would recommend and stay here again if the opportunity presented itself.
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,This historic house is beautiful inside and out. We enjoyed the stay and the walks along the trails that are right outside the house.
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We rented this place for the bathroom to be a getting ready spot for myself and my few bridesmaids/our moms & for my husband and I to stay after the wedding- I messaged TNTBNBS before booking & they were extremely hospitable and responsive!
The house is older and felt like each door lead to another room at first but it was easy to get the hang of it after one go around.
The over all vibe feels like you’re not in Macon but in the mountains - all while being less than a 2-5min drive to a grocery store & a 15min drive to downtown.
The bathroom views, outdoor spaces, kitchen, spacious interior, cleanliness, hospitality & quick responses all made it worth the cost.
p.s. the kitchen is downstairs (if you have anyone that has mobility restrictions)"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We WILL be back! If this home was for sale, we would seriously consider purchasing. It’s perfect. Love the Lodge, the lower level kitchen, the master bath was heavenly! It rained during our time so we were unable to explore the back yard and trails. Next time for sure!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Group trip,Beautiful accommodations. Comfortable in a beautiful setting.
2023-10-01,5.0,Group trip,Great historic home with walking trails. Perfect for family get away.
2023-10-01,5.0,Group trip,Wow! This place was gorgeous. My family felt right at home. Thank you!
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Only stayed their for a night while traveling to FL but wish I could have stayed longer! We loved it so much. Beautiful place. Would love to come back again.
Host is also amazing! Super helpful and responsive with whatever you need."
2023-09-01,5.0,Group trip,"Very nice lodge with a rustic feel, modern conveniences, close to all the GABBA music festival activities, beautiful grounds. The hosts responded promptly to the few questions we had. We want to stay again next year!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Me and my fiance's one night stay was so peacful. Looked like something out of a fairytale! Everything was perfect and the hosts were very kind & sweet. Will definitely be coming back for a longer stay in the future!
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We stayed here while we were in town for a concert! the kitchen area was a perfect place for hanging out after the show. Highly recommend!
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,The cabin was awesome. We had a great time. It was close to the location that we wanted to be near. Our granddaughter had a good time crawling around.
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Overall a great stay. Had a couple minor issues that were handled quickly. Looking forward to staying at this property again
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,This is a gem of a listing in Macon! We came to town to visit family and it was the perfect location. It only took about 3 minutes to get to a Walgreens for milk and necessities. I would recommend bringing a sound machine if you bring kids as it is an old home that carries noise. There are 2 cats that hang around and are very sweet. The house has great character and we will definitely be back!!
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,The place was very spacious and all the wood made it feel like it had a lot of history. It was a cool experience staying in an old house with all the modern updates and amenities. The kids loved the 2 friendly cats that would come say hello on the porch. Very private space and the nature was nice in the backyard. The whole family enjoyed our stay and would definitely stay again
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We had a great stay, the house is very unique (it's a restored older home) , with the double bedroom some steep stairs and the kitchen in the downstairs. We only stayed one night and were not able to use the outdoor patio in the back due to the weather but it looked like a great space. Just and FYI there are 3 very friendly cats that hang out at the place (they were on the entry porch pretty much every time we came in our out), so if you are bringing a dog make sure they like cats. I would stay again with the right group."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Wow! Incredible cabin! Great hosts. Will definitely book again.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I rented this home for 5 nights over my God-daughters wedding weekend. First, it was used day of wedding for the bridesmaids and her mom and I to get ready and have photos all day. The kitchen was fabulous and we stocked it day before…it is a cook’s kitchen with an enormous island and a big table with seating. Perfect to serve lots of people! The photographers loved it inside and out and the pics are gorgeous. The master bath is huge with tons of natural light! The makeup artists called it a dream with the huge live edge counters facing the windows. Then the couple came here for their wedding night. We had it reset with flowers and tea-lights twinkling and the bride sent me a video and said “this is a fairytale…” It felt totally different and romantic and private for their first two nights until they left for their honeymoon. The grotto and trails are amazing - and in the heart of town, almost unbelievable. Try this place - you won’t be disappointed."
2023-07-01,3.0,Stayed with a pet,Beautiful piece of property.
2023-07-01,5.0,Group trip,What a beautiful property. Close to the main road but you feel like you are in the country. Loved the historic history surrounding this property. The hiking trails in the back are some of the best of Georgia. Would highly recommend it.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Most magical barn ever .. felt like Yellowstone with a mix of Edward house from twilight ✨
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,What a beautiful unique place to stay! Very clean and comfortable and a beautiful view!
2023-07-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"This house does give you complete privacy and the shower is the highlight of this house. The mattress was very comfortable to sleep in. Everything was clean and did have a bit of old cabin smell when entering. The place is darker that shown in the photos with a mysteriously strange ""alone in the woods"" vibe, and the kitchen is in the basement. There is also an adjacent storage room next to the kitchen that has a microwave next to the cat food and washer/dryer. You will see two cats running around outside. The host was extremely friendly and responsive when contacted."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We wish we had more time to enjoy longer! My son spent all his time calling for Bigfoot!?
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Thank you for the wonderful stay. The place was outstanding, the view from the top to bottom windows that showed the beautiful wilderness was enchanting and relaxing. The feel and the style of the place was well put together. Thank you again for the stay! Blessings"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We really enjoyed our stay. The cabin was beautiful and inviting. The location had trails for walking and the owners were really nice and helpful. Would definitely visit again.
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,This was the perfect stop for our family on our way from NC to Florida. Our kiddos loved playing outside and exploring the property. The cabin was so unique and well appointed. We enjoyed an evening by the fire and the quiet and peaceful surroundings. Thank you for a wonderful stay.
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Literally the pictures do this home NO justice! If you want a beautiful place to stay and relax with your loved one or family definitely book this home!! I will be back! Lol
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Loved this home! Gorgeous inside and out!
2023-06-01,5.0,Group trip,"Beautiful setting. Clean and comfortable. We had a very busy weekend scheduled during our stay, so we didn’t get to explore the property but we would definitely stay here again."
2023-05-01,5.0,Group trip,"This is the most beautiful AirBNB I've ever had the pleasure to stay in!!!! I grew up in Macon and my parents live very close by, but I rented it for myself and my bridesmaids so we would have a shared space to get ready, have our hair and makeup done, and get photos taken the day before and the day of the wedding. It served us PHENOMENALLY well!!! The beds were comfortable and plentiful in number, the house was spacious and well appointed, the grounds of the estate were BEAUTIFUL and full of lovely scenery, and the parking was generous. Everyone we showed the location to had nothing but words of highest praise. A true hidden treasure in Macon!!!!!!!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Rejuvenating retreat for my family of 5! The beds were very comfortable and everyone had their own space. Best shower ever!!! Romantic and peaceful ambiance. Great Hosts!
2023-05-01,5.0,Group trip,"Historic house in a beautiful setting, with a great downstairs kitchen that is conducive to hanging out with friends. Would definitely stay here again."

2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,lovely home great area loved it
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Beautiful cabin! Perfect for what we needed.

2023-04-01,5.0,Group trip,Lovely historic home full of character. Loved the master bathroom and kitchen! We walked the trails to a a grotto…very cool!
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Such a beautiful respite! The kitchen is in the bottom floor, so if stairs are an issue that could present a challenge...but if not...it's well worth the stay and such a beautiful historic property. We spent hours in the sunroom enjoying the beauty of the property. HIGHLY recommend coming for a visit. Comfy beds and one of the most beautiful master bathrooms I've ever seen. Book it! You'll love it! Fountain of Juice restaurant and Fresh Market only a couple blocks away...and Okmulgee Mounds National Park about 15 minutes. Great stay with friendly and responsive hosts. Photos and descriptions are accurate"
2023-04-01,5.0,Group trip,A gem in the heart of Macon. This place is secluded yet close to everything. We had everything we needed and lots of space. Would definitely recommend.
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Great place to stay. Very private and Qwaint. Will most certainly stay again.
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"My husband and I were just passing through and decided to break up our long drive by staying at this wonderful home. We were only there for the night, but I will definitely be coming back. This house is historical and amazingly unique. The property itself is gigantic and has a lot of trails and things to explore. Although it is located near restaurants, shops, and the highway, it quickly becomes very private and serene once on the property. This house is huge and has everything you could want or need for a relaxing staycation. We enjoyed our short stay and will be back to explore for sure."
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,My friend and I visited Macon for a girls weekend get away and absolutely loved staying in this home! The photos are accurate and the house is beautiful (and clean!). The owners were also great to deal with - very fast to respond to any messages I sent and helpful giving recommendations during our trip. We would gladly book this house again if ever we are in Macon.
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"My daughter and I loved the house. she really enjoyed the shower, she kept kicking me out of it. she kept taking over the whole bed and again kicking me out of it. We had alot of fun. Thank you so much for allowing us to stay."
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Amazing home! rustic and modern all in one!
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Had a wonderful time! Very cool house!
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Very clean rustic house and beautiful property!
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Great place and location
Host’s we’re great!"
2023-02-01,4.0,Stayed one night,The place looked exactly like the photos and the bathroom was beautiful. Host was responsive when encountered issues.
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Thank you so much for another lovely stay at another amazing TnT home! We loved the home and decor itself, the location, the surroundings, and the crazy awesome views from the spacious master bath and sunroom! Wow, there is no other Airbnb place like this! Completely original! Thank you again for accommodating us at check in, ensuring a great stay, and easy check out procedures! Y'all are truly wonderful hosts!"
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This cabin is very nice. It’s been updated but kept the historic qualities of the property. Unfortunately, it rained the night we stayed so weren’t able to take advantage of the outdoor space like we hoped but it fine anyway. The only thing I could complain about was the upstairs light and fan. They are on the same switch but two separate units, so you can’t have the light off and the fan on. The upstairs can get quite warm too. That was a minimal issue, overall, we were very pleased."
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Wonderful old house with exceptional upgrades to bathrooms and kitchen. Huge spaces, artfully decorated. Nice linens and soft towels. Many nice touches. The property is huge as well, with old growth trees and great trails. One leads to the Grotto, which looks like it has been restored recently. Was a chilly Macon night so we wanted to have a cozy fire. We asked if we could get some firewood, and a very friendly gentleman arrived shortly thereafter with a wagonfull. Made our night. A great, peaceful stay on our trip south."
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"My husband & I were looking for a quiet, peaceful change of winter environment to pursue our creative endeavors, a place of seclusion in a natural environment. This was it. The beautiful massive wood burning fireplace was the clincher. This 1933 home was lovingly renovated with an over-the-top added bathroom surrounded in glass with an xtra large glass shower all looking onto the forest. The house was as pictured: simple in design, tastefully decorated, well appointed & sparsely furnished. Master bed was quite comfortable. We counted 41 camelia bushes in the front yard alone! This house sits on 85 truly beautiful acres of forest with walking paths thru it! Not your typical suburban home.
We stayed for 1 month & loved our stay!"
2022-12-01,5.0,Group trip,hidden treasure with an amazing history. would highly recommend
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The hosts were amazing and the cabin was absolutely stunning. We had an amazing time. A Christmas we shall never forget!
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Beautiful charming home.
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Such a cozy stay! Beautiful just like the pictures. Easy check-in and great location. You can get bored here.
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Our recent stay was wonderful in almost every way. Our only disappointment was not being able to watch the college football playoffs because I didn't have an account with Hulu or You Tube. The owners were extremely accommodating on a special request I made. The property is beautiful and gives you a feeling of privacy. We will certainly stay here again.
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Great location with access to many of Macon's attractions. Great yard for kids (unfortunately it rained during our stay). Nice quiet neighborhood. The beds were comfortable, and there was plenty of space to spread out. I would recommend for anyone except those with mobility challenges since the house setup involves some stairs/uneven surfaces and the kitchen/dining room are downstairs. Very responsive hosts."
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This is an amazing house that exudes history and comfort! We wish we could have stayed longer!
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Great cabin vibe spot! Everything inside is very well kept and high quality. I was also expecting for a cabin vibe place for the mattress to be uncomfortable, but the mattresses are very comfortable! It was also really nice being right to a semi private trailhead (didn’t see anyone else, but I think it connected to other trails)"
2022-11-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Unique airbnb stay in Macon! The living room was spacious and beds were comfortable. Only 10 minutes from downtown and Mercer University. Host was responsive and very accommodating. Great for our group visiting Mercer for the weekend.
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"They renovated this beautifully. everything feels quality down to the rugs and towels. The view out the bathroom is amazing. endless hot water in the showers, great big kitchen for cooking meals. nothing but good words to say about this place!"
2022-10-01,3.0,Stayed with a pet,It was good but a little bit dangerous to take care baby especially when you go to the 2nd-floor bedroom
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This place has a cabin feel while in the city! Very cozy with a ton of space to relax. Great place to have a fire and hang out. Also the bedding and beds were very comfortable. Definitely would stay here again.
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"From the sun streaming into the sunroom in the morning to laying your head down on the pillow at night (in a very comfy bed made up with lovely scented sheets), you will love this eye catching, updated historic property. For those who like whimsy, so many interesting light fixtures!
Big fluffy towels. Great (big) shower, and two large soaking tubs. Interesting live edge counter in the bath.
Nicely equipped kitchen. Humongous island (fashioned from an old door) makes for more than ample food prep space. Very nice double wall oven.
Bonus: parking our car in the garage. And large outdoor flagstone patio.
Hosts made a special effort to make sure our stay was extra special. Highly recommend the hosts and property. We will look forward to a return, sooner rather than later."
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,One of the coolest houses we have ever rented! Pictures don’t do it justice!
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,This is way better then expected!! Absolutely amazing experience!!! So cool to stay in such an old home while still having the updates!! The magical forest in the back of the house was so cool to explore. And the updated bathroom was UNBELIEVABLE!!!! Would highly recommend to anyone to have this experience!!!!
2022-10-01,5.0,Group trip,Beautiful place
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Wonderful experience in a historic home! Beautiful woodland setting in the heart of Macon's historic district.
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Really nice hosts and the place was beautiful. It’s a well equipped home and the hosts are quick to respond. One thing that for sure stood out was that they thought of kids and have a little play area with them. I did a lot of cooking in the kitchen and didn’t have any issue with finding anything as it’s very well equipped. Highly recommend!
2022-09-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Nice place for a quick stay in Macon!
2022-09-01,5.0,Group trip,Great place to stay. Nice and cozy. I recommend anyone to come and see for yourself!
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Wonderful home.
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Beautiful restored home with spacious layout. Gorgeous master bathroom. Nice quiet neighborhood. We did see some ants and the furniture around fire pit needs to be replaced.
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We stayed here for 3 nights leading up to our double house closings with our 4 & 2 year old, along with our two pups. The cabin has an amazing layout, very spacious and home away from home feeling. Decorated with rustic and modern items that blend perfectly. The owners had awesome communication and would definitely love to stay here with a group of friends for the weekend!! Thank y’all for having us!!!"
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,What a cozy farmhouse. We loved this historic renovated home with such neat features. My kids loved the trampoline on the property as well as the little play area.
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Beautiful home with amazing views!!
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We stayed at this property on our drive from Oxford, MS to Ft Myers. We will be making this drive many times over the next few years as our son attends college in Oxford. It was a perfect halfway stopping point for us. This was the most unique air bnb we have stayed at and we loved everything about it. This home has so much character and the design was off the charts. We also had dinner at Dovetail in downtown Macon which our host recommended to us. It was a fantastic restaurant. We will be booking this home many more times over the next three years and can’t wait to return for a longer stay."
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,As described. Clean and unique location.
2022-07-01,2.0,Stayed with a pet,"We arrived at 440 on Saturday Aug 6. The cleaning lady was still there and not finished yet, we waited outside for 30 minutes until she was done. When we got in I checked the hot tub as that was one of the main reason for renting the place. The temperature was 65 degrees, I emailed the owner and his reaponse was it can take 24 hours to heat up do you want a later check out.
The main issue was the cleaning lady being there so late she filled the hot tub and did not turn it on untill 430. When I went to bed at 12 it was 79 degrees and when I left at 8am it was 89 degrees.
Hot tubs should heat up about 5 degrees an hour that hot tub was no where close to that.
If you are going to rent this place for just a day or 2 and want a hot tub I would suggest another cabin. They will charge you 25 an hour to check in early but do not communicate if the cabin wont be ready by check in."
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We loved the cabin!! So nice for a weekend getaway, and even better than the pictures. Would absolutely visit again!! :)"
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Fabulous historic lodge in the heart of Macon. The house is very clean and conveniently located in midtown. Hosts are super easy to communicate with and available if needed. Highly recommend!

2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Beautiful house and property close to everything. Very relaxing for a family trip.
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,The photos in the listing are fantastic but to see this home in person is on another level! The details and character of the home are hard to describe so I’ll just say I loved it and would highly recommend to anyone. Thank you for allowing us to stay in your beautiful home and we hope to be back.
2022-06-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,I enjoyed my stay at this airbnb. The home was lovely and full of character.
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Great experience! Sooo nice!
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Super cute place, easy to find and access to everything. Kitchen is “downstairs” which is a little less convenient, but very well done. Basic cooking and grilling can happen, but no baking-which is not uncommon. Beautiful grounds, nice outdoor fire pit, and chairs. Super comfy beds, we will be back!"
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Spectacular home, an oasis close to everything in the area. Pics are accurate and the master bath feels like your living as one with nature. The walking paths are expansive and great for a morning walk!"
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,The house was great. Truly a unique oasis in the South. The trail is right outside the backyard and the woods are magical. They did a great job renovating what looks to be a historic home. The kitchen and amenities are great while keeping the historic nature of the home in tact. Would recommend for a family.
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"This is an amazing cabin and I highly recommend it for a stay in Macon. I wish I could have stayed longer! The views from the sitting room and bathroom are unbelievable and the cabin is beautifully and comfortably decorated. It is close to anything you could need in Macon, but is feels like a secluded nature retreat."
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This was a great place that really felt first class. The walking trail in the back was a very pleasant find
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,This place is a must!! The home (although historical) is so fascinating and amazing! So comfortable. So lovely!!
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,This property is just beautiful and relaxing!
2022-04-01,5.0,Group trip,"Cutest cabin, close to everything ! The Renovations that have been done were absolutely gorgeous !!!"
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Book this! Perfect for a long weekend that feels tucked away but is really close to things to do. The charm of the home makes it feel cozy but the updated kitchen adds a bit of glam. You can access a trail from the back of the property that is great for a peaceful walk in the trees.
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This spacious cabin home is conveniently located in a beautiful wooded setting. Large, well-appointed kitchen /dining area on lower level opens onto a patio surrounded by mature trees and access to walking trails. Comfortable beds, quality linens and decor. TnT are wonderful hosts, responsive and helpful. We will be back."
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"The house is beautiful, well appointed and so are the grounds. Wish I could have extended my stay. It was lovely. Wish I could have learned the history of the house itself. It’s clearly a home with a story. I thoroughly enjoyed the stay and had everything I needed."
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"This place is absolutely stunning inside and out! The details of this historic home were truly eye catching. A perfect blend of modern upgrades and a classic luxurious lodge nestled in a charming historic area of Macon. So close to town but is very secluded and private. Also, the views from several rooms in the house were incredible (Including the master bathroom, a first in my Airbnb stays!). Lastly, the host was very responsive and helpful which is an added plus. I won't be surprised if the living room photo of this home is on the homepage of Airbnb one day!"

2024-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very nice place and right amongst the action! Live music across the street and many restaurants step away. Streets are a little noisy up until 10:00 and then silence!!! Awesome place you won’t be disappointed.

Loved the location, place was so beautiful i could see myself living there and i felt literally like “home”. Very clean, comfortable bed and the high ceiling windows brought so much sun inside i felt like i was on tropical vacation. Communication with Luke was amazing, i ended up extending my stay. If i ever travel to Macon again this would be my to go place. Everything is close by walking distance.
Thank You Luke for making my travels so much better."

2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,10/10 would recommend
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"The space is amazing and beautifully decorated. We loved walking through Macon for dinner, yoga class, church and the rock climbing gym. Great for people who enjoy the night life as there is music playing next door and across the street until 10 pm. The windows are also great to people watch. We really enjoyed ourselves."
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Really nice loft with great sleeping accommodations. Parking was a little bit of a challenge but after hours and early could park right out front and not drive again. It’s in a great, walkable location. I’m from Macon and people are friendly and characters abound. Many unique fun restaurants with craft beer and cocktails that are not “cookie-cutter”."
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful inside. Perfect location if you are in town for business or at Mercer for events. Right in the middle of everything downtown Macon. Excellent loft and design. Definitely will stay again
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"This is a beautiful loft—great light, well decorated, has everything you need, and the record player was a nice bonus. Luke was communicative—provided all necessary instructions and was responsive.
I visited on a weekend/holiday so parking was free, and spots were available right out front. However during normal weekdays/weekends parking would not be free."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I would highly recommend Luke’s place to family & friends alike. It’s walking distance to so many great restaurants, shops, and bars. Incredible view. Spacious, well themed, and fun!"
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"This has to be the best Airbnb downtown as far as walkability, comfort, decor and cleanliness goes. It couldn't be any more centrally located from restaurants, bars, shops, etc. I used to live and work in downtown Macon, and carefully chose this Airbnb because while there were other units that appeared similar, they just didn't have the prime location which is important as I planned to walk my dog as well as meet up with friends and family at night. I felt very safe and at home here, and can't imagine staying anywhere else next time I'm in town."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We loved our stay. It was wonderful. We felt we could live there. It was beautiful and hip feeling. Loved the swing in living room and floors ceilings and bathrooms and beds. All that said it was perfect.
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We're so pleased with our experience in this loft. Immaculate, pristinely styled, comfortable and centrally located, we're sure to return!"
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The loft was better than the pictures!
Plenty of room. Large living room with beautiful windows to fill the space with light.
The bedrooms were
Comfortable and the kitchen had everything we needed.
We were in town for a concert which was close by so this property was perfect for us.
The area of town was not that great as there were few quality restaurants with in walking distance and there were random people loitering outside the entrance.
We could hear music from the street or nearby bar until late at night.
Communication was quick and we had everything we needed .
I would definitely stay here again!"
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Beautiful loft with great location! Parking was easy, walkable to shops, restaurants, and museums. Be sure to stop downstairs to find your favorite vinyl at the the local record store. Enjoy The Beach Boys album we added to the collection!"
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Accomomodations were WONDERFL! Great location, pleasing aesthetic, everything comfortable, Luke's place has a door at street level, inside nice sturdy stairs up to the loft apartment with big windows overlooking the street. We came to Macon for my granddaughter's concert. She walked the tiny distance from ""our"" place to the auditorium, we stayed behind and wandered the neighborhood with cool shops, big trees, interesting architecture. WE took Luke's advice and had dinner NEXT DOOR at the DOVETAIL which was just outstanding, then walked the few steps back to Luke's place and made ourselves comfortable til granddaughter returned from her concert. Decor included lots of Macon music memorabilia (even a sampling of vinyl LPs and a turntable!) (a vinyl music store right below us), totally in keeping with the focus of our trip. This great loft apartment enhanced every aspect of our trip from convenience to comfort to ambiance. Already we're planning a return visit. Thanks Luke"
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Perfect downtown location! Such a beautiful space! Will definitely stay again when I’m back in Macon!
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We drove up to Macon with another couple for a concert. We were able to walk to the venue. Luke's place was spacious
and very comfortable for two couples. If we ever return to Macon, we will definitely stay here again."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The loft was amazing. It was beautifully decorated. The host was amazing and responded very quickly to all messages. The location was great and the place is very well kept and cleaned. I will definitely be staying here again. 10/10 would recommend.
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We had a great time staying in Downtown Macon! The loft was clean, spacious and packed with everything you need for an enjoyable stay. Super walkable location."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Luke’s place was a great spot to recharge for a night and only 5 minutes off the highway. It is very clean and well thought out. The beds are super comfy and the record player was an awesome touch. Everything is walking distance. We ate at The Rookery, had drinks & delicious beignets at Parrish on Cherry St while enjoying live music and played games at Reboot Retrocade, which was literally across the street from his place. Will definitely stay here again, as there’s a few more places we’d like to try out."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We enjoyed our stay at Luke's apartment. Understand there are 24 steps up to the apartment and no elevator/lift so be prepared for that. The amenities were great and Luke was always helpful and responsive. The place has a great kitchen and is very roomy and comfortable. The back bedroom was great since we didn't hear any of the street noise at night.
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place in downtown Macon above a cool Record shop close to restaurants and local Shops. Parking is metered at 3 hours only but info provided by host gives options. Recommend downloading the parking app I use it wherever I go that required metered parking. The space is awesome with a warehouse loft vibe and two bedrooms with full baths. Well stocked kitchen with kuereg coffee
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Loved the location!
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Absolutely love this place! Walkable to some fantastic restaurants and other things. The layout and decor of the apartment was beautiful. Would definitely stay here again.
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"If you're looking for a stunning place to stay downtown that is walkable to all the restaurants and things to do, book Luke's place! I felt like everything in Luke's place was intentionally designed and placed. Such a unique loft and vibe. Beds were super comfortable and just an overall lovely place I look forward to coming back to next time I'm in Macon. Thank you Luke!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,The Loft was a great place to escape from the impending hurricane. Enjoyed our stay.
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great experience! We will book again .
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great place. Immaculate. Luke (and I think Tracy) were very responsive to anything and very prompt with their replies. I loved the location, right on Cherry Street. The place is beautiful. The WiFi works well, the TV's were excellent and big. The place is gorgeous and has plenty of space and light. Washer and dryer are also first class and worked great. This place is worth it and the people take care of you. I give it 5 stars and highly recommend it."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place is great especially if you want to be downtown. The place was an updated space with two very spacious bedrooms and all the amenities you could ask for in a flat. You have a full-sized kitchen and dining area which has ample seating and room. The living area is comfortable and cozy. The days were hot and the place felt like a modern day hotel room. The air conditioning was perfect and quiet.
There are some things to consider. First, you are downtown and this place is dead center of the action. It is loud at night and even louder on the weekend. I slept fine, but if you are a light sleeper, beware. Parking is on the street and you pay during the daylight hours. There is a 3 hour max time so you have to be aware of that. The place is also up a decent flight of stairs. So, if you have any challenges going up and down stairs, this may not be the right fit.
In summary, this is a great modernized space in a cool older building right in the middle of the action of downtown Macon."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Loft was beautiful and extremely comfortable stay for anyone looking to travel through the Macon area.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Wonderful stay. Centrally located and nice place.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Luke was a GREAT host! This apartment is well-appointed and located in the heart of downtown Macon. It's close to many restaurants and nightlife activities. Some close early, so research beforehand to know what's available. We were VERY pleased with our stay! The apartment was extremely clean, very spacious, and was so much better than staying at a hotel. Why pay the same price for a hotel when Luke has you covered? This was our very first Airbnb and Luke has definitely set the standard for our future vacations."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Had a great time and the central location of Luke’s place made our one night stop in Macon great. The space is clean and comfy. Loved the big windows to people watch. Thanks for everything!
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We really relaxed and enjoyed our stay. Thank you for the record player, hanging swing and music! It was a wonderful location and your guide to the area was terrific.
Hope to return again!
Best-
Kathy and Shannon"

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We had a great stay in the loft. We loved the location on Cherry St. It was convenient with multiple restaurant options. We walked everywhere.
The loft itself was a great place to relax. It has comfortable furniture, temperature control, and a ton of space. The decor created the perfect vibe for a musical Macon trip.
Would stay here agin"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,was perfect for a few nights out on the town! well priced and extremely worth it!
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Nice modern spacious loft. Bed was very comfortable. Wish we could have stayed longer to explore the area more.
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We truly enjoyed our stay! Luke was very helpful and responsive. The place is gorgeous with lots of natural light. The furniture and decor are beautiful! If we are ever in the area this will be our go to place! I completely recommend a stay at this beautiful home.
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Location was perfect for our needs and the place was just as described. Very comfortable, well stocked, and clean. Access was super easy with the key pads and very detailed instructions on how to get in and where to park which was super helpful.
We were there for a work project and the layout in the living area made it really easy to work - love the windows and light. The place has a lot of charm.
The beds were really comfortable - just know that one of the bedrooms has a skylight so it gets really bright really early!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Fabulous stay. Looks just like the pictures. The loft was easy to find, clean, and well decorated. Stay here if you're in Macon!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Amazing place owned by an amazing person ! Wish I booked longer!!
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Loved the location and the energy in the home. Restaurants and bars in walking distance and close to I-75. Looking forward to booking this loft during my next visit!
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great stay!
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We love Macon and this loft is right in the middle of everything. This was our second time staying in this building and is now our go to stop when road tripping north from Florida.
The restaurant across the street is awesome and the owner is very friendly, in fact everyone in Macon is!
Don’t forget to hit the record store downstairs!"
2023-05-01,4.0,Stayed one night,The loft was architecturally beautifully done. Quite impressive. We only stayed one night because we were passing through but I’m sure there is plenty of historic and culture things to see and do.
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Luke's was the perfect place for us to stay for an event at Capricorn Studios in downtown Macon. We parked our car and could easily walk to the event, to restaurants .... The area was architecturally interesting, too. The apartment could not have been cleaner or more comfortable. Instructions were clear, all amenities provided. We're likely to be repeat visitors."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,WOW this place is a gem!!!!!!!!! a real life retreat in the middle of Macon. I didn't realize how beautiful Macon was until this trip. This loft made me feel really safe and in deep peace.
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Luke’s loft was a great place to land in downtown Macon! The bed(s) are very comfortable and the towels fluffy!Morning coffee from the Keurig was a plus! The loft is a beautiful space, with everything you’ll need for a relaxing stay. A very walkable neighborhood with several museums and many restaurants! Would definitely stay again!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We loved this place!! So well done with everything you need and want, with a fun modern vibe. Would definitely come back! There is noise associated with being downtown, but the location was well worth it. Everything you could want was right at our finger tips"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"A really impressive apartment, tastefully furnished and wonderfully spacious, overlooking an attractive tree-lined street in central Macon. The one issue with Internet was resolved swiftly by Tracy. Also, very comfortable beds ... Couldn't have been happier with our overnight stay."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Gorgeous place! Wow!
Afternoon sun through the enormous window w a view.....delicious!"
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Wonderful place , right downtown ."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place and location. Will come back for sure.
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This is a great loft and around everything you could want during your stay.
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We love staying at this loft. Always a nice and enjoyable experience.
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"It's in a great location for walking around Macon. We stayed one night and were able to park on the street right outside the building. I can see where parking could be an issue on certain days. The apartment is spacious and gets plenty of natural light. The ceilings are very tall and makes it feel wide open. A note about the space - the walls do not go all the way to the ceiling in some rooms and that can lead to increased noise/light throughout the apartment. It's not a deal-breaker, but just know that it is not very private from room to room. The apartment is also near a performing arts theater. There was a concert the night we stayed, and it was fairly loud until the concert ended at 1030 pm, which wasn't unreasonably late. It's also above a record store which is open during the day and you can hear music from that establishment. If you want pure peace & quiet, this is not your spot, but if you want clean, bright, and a central location - it's worth it. Host was very helpful!"
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great place. Glad I stayed here. Would stay here again. Very spacious.
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This place is as beautiful in person as the pictures. It is clean, and the host is responsive.
A few gripes that I had:
1. The soap dispensers are battery operated and were not working during our stay. Had to buy soap at the grocery store.
2. The paper towels were depleted upon arrival.
3. Both rooms have sunlight that beams in that you cannot prevent. If you like to sleep in, you may find it difficult.
4. Parking is a bit of a hassle, you have to park in a garage that is a few blocks away.
5. There is no pack N play for those who have kids.
Most of these things can easily be fixed, I hope they do, because this place is really nice otherwise."
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Wonderful place to enjoy a weekend in this musical rich city. You’ll enjoy stay!
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Luke, was very helpful and quick to respond. He has a great place in the heart of town."
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Had a almost time and a great view
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Luke was great! The unit is amazing, spacious, modern, with great light, a strong music vibe, super big screen TV with all the streaming channels and centrally located. This unit is a gem. The best restaurants in the city are within walking distance and the area is full of energy. The only challege was with the parking infront of the building which you have to watch closely. We had a problem with an attempted break-in where the person shattered the driverside window. This coupled with the city closing down parking on the street and the signage not being close to the car, resulted in the car being towed. However, the staff, was responsive and available and helped me find the place where the car was towed. They offered to pay the towing fee which was beyond nice and professional.
Overall Luke and team were kind and offered the highest level of professionalism. That coupled with a truly amazing unit earns them the highest rating. I strongly recommend staying here."
2023-03-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"Prime location, easy parking, cool space."
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Great loft style location. We were just passing through town, and it was great. Parking close to place took a few attempts, but it worked out."
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great well appointed loft in the middle of town. Host is very responsive and listing was as advertised. Be aware that the loft is right above a record store and in the middle of a few bars/restaurants. Expect to very clearly hear records from downstairs and music from the bars well into the evening. Once they close, it is super quiet. You are right in the middle of the action of this little town, which is perfect for many, less so for others depending on what camp you fall into!
I enjoyed it and would stay again!"
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,always a great experience with this host!
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We were in town for a concert and Luke's place was more than perfect. Everything was within walking distance and it was easy to find what we needed. The loft is bright and spacious. We really enjoyed the sunny mornings and the soft bedroom linens. Would definitely return back to this charming space.
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Beautiful place-very unique! Spacious - very comfortable. Instructions concerning parking were very helpful - no problem at all.

Highly recommend this cool loft"

2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Lovely place and very convenient to great restaurants. Right above a neat record store!
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,A great experience! I highly recommend:)

2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Luke’s loft was perfect - exactly as pictured (better!), clean, and comfortable beds. The swing was so charming and the afternoon light in the loft is killer. The space is central to so much to do in Macon to boot. I came for work and was pleasantly surprised by all the cute restaurants and bars. While it was normal city sounds during the day, nights were quiet and peaceful when I was there during the week."
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Luke’s place was perfect for us. The location was fantastic. The place was clean, stylish, and comfortable. Everything was easy. Will definitely stay again."
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"In Macon for one night for a conference in Warner Robbins. Disappointed that we didn’t have a little more time to enjoy the area. Cute shops, restaurants, and bars steps away from the loft. The loft itself was beautiful and comfortable and welcoming and spacious. I cannot say enough good things about it. It’s tucked away, felt very safe and private….like a hidden gem. Luke was very responsive and kind and warm in his communication, felt like we were old friends. If you’re in Macon for a week or just passing through, the loft will be perfect for your stay!"
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Staying at this Airbnb was nothing short of amazing. The location was fantastic as it was right down town Macon and walkable to everything. The interstate was also very close. The stay itself was very nice as well. The home was very clean, staged nicely, and overall created am ambiance that would for sure allow me to book again. I loved the sheets, and there plenty of towels to use! I seriously couldn’t have picked a better place to stay. 5 stars for sure!"
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Such a beautiful place. Definitely would come here again and most certainly worth its booking price!!
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Awesome location to stay if your visiting Macon GA. I enjoyed the design of the house. Everything was well thought out right down to the record player and selection of albums.
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Great loft right in downtown Macon. The parking instructions were very clear and easy to navigate. Able to walk to lots of great restaurants.
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Luke’s place is a very hip remodel loft in Downtown Macon. Designer touches throughout and looks like could be in a magazine . Spacious, well thought out, and provided everything you need. Great location for our Allman Brothers tour"
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Luke’s loft is simply breathtaking—even nicer than the pictures if you can believe it. It was a perfect destination for my Macon stay—so nice that if anything it was hard to leave!
His spot achieved a level of luxury I wasn’t expecting from an Airbnb. I would enthusiastically recommend to anyone."
2023-01-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"The loft itself was perfect. Very nice, modern decor with music theme. Well furnished with everything we needed. There were 3 of us who met there as a central location for a girls weekend away and we thoroughly enjoyed ourselves!
Host fully explained parking in listing; however, parking almost two blocks away in a parking deck was more of a challenge than was expected. The steps to the loft were steep for anyone with physical limitations. However, neither of these issues could be changed by the host, as they are simply situational and unavoidable facts as determined by the location."
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,I wished I replace booked it longer! It was amazingly beautiful
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Nice and cozy modern place conveniently located to the highway. Also close to yummy restaurants!

2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Great place to stay and experience downtown Macon. I got there, unpacked, went for. 45 minute run around downtown, then record shopped downstairs, and went to the vintage arcade bar across across the street. Relaxed in front of the large tv and giant windows facing Cherry St. Slept great in a very comfortable king bed. Will rent again for sure"
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We really liked this place- would definitely use again. Very clean, had everything we needed. Host quick to respond to any questions.
Very close to all the downtown breweries, gastropubs, and restaurants."
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Such a nice and quaint place. Felt very cozy. Only thing I’ll share is that it is in the heart of downtown so expect a lot of traffic and noise outside
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This was our first time in Macon, GA - and we completely fell head over heels in love! Luke’s loft was absolutely stunning - and super comfortable. The swing in the living room was a favorite of my family! The loft is absolutely stunning and incredibly spacious - great views of downtown with metered parking right out front. We were right near everything we could need - and we highly recommend Oliver’s Corner Bistro for dinner, especially for the holidays - as downtown has a Christmas Light Extravaganza going on! This was one of the best Air B&B’s we’ve ever stayed at, and if we are ever in the Macon area again - we wouldn’t hesitate to rebook!"
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Our stay was delightful and the downtown was very walkable with lots of good restaurants. I think this is our favorite Airbnb we have ever stayed in! Loved the downtown loft vibe and the decor was what you’d see on HGTV.

2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,This is my second time staying here and it was great! I love the comfort of everything there and I highly recommend Dovetail nextdoor if you are looking for some amazing food (it is fancy so it is on the pricier side for sure). Thanks again Luke!

2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,We loved Luke’s loft! It was so clean and was exactly as depicted on the photos; the hanging chair was my favorite. This stay was perfect for me driving through town with a friend and my dog. Luke was very accommodating and responsive as it was a last minute decision to evacuate from a hurricane in Florida. I highly recommend this stay! I only wish it had been longer!

2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We really enjoyed our stay in the loft. It was beautifully done - we loved the high, exposed ceilings, large windows and loft style. The living space was really roomy and the decor featured the Macon music scene- even with a record player. We enjoyed the convenience of being downtown and enjoyed hearing the street sounds from below - we enjoyed being a part of the city. There is activity outside of the building - restaurants, shops and people. We felt very safe. Was surprised by Macon - what a cool place with nice museums and an incredible amount of old buildings still downtown."
2022-08-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"This home is spacious, beautiful and an awesome location in Macon. Some minor cleaning issues but perfect for a couple's trip or friends' getaway. We were able to park in the garage during the weekend and walk to most places we were interested in. Loft is above a record shop so good music plays throughout the day and street noise during the evening/night. The loft is beautifully designed, and I would stay here again!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great host. Flexible check in and out. Host was very responsive and always responded. Only downfall was the neighbors dogs barked constantly. Couldn't do anything in the backyard due to the constant barking of the dogs. Over all a very nice place
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We enjoyed our stay so much at Daniela’s home! The bed and linens were super comfy, and the renovated bathroom was a delight! There are really nice accents throughout the house from the live plants to the cute ceramic frogs, the modern updated fixtures to the at-home office, we enjoyed it all! Daniela’s response time was unparalleled and there was even a bottle of wine for us waiting when we arrived. We will definitely be staying here again if we come back to Macon."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We absolutely loved this place! The bathrooms are just as outstanding as they look. The kitchen and living room were clean and offered all we needed. The outdoor furniture and fire pit with fire wood and all we needed for s’mores was rare to find. Daniela was very friendly and offered me a yoga mat when she learned I needed one. It’s very quiet. A gated community is a nice touch. The kayak offered a great way to explore after morning coffee!
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"My family and I had the best stay at Daniela’s lake house! She was the best at communicating with us. The home was clean, warm, and welcoming. The paddle board and kayak were greatly enjoyed by my sons:) Also, there is a nice board game collection to choose from. We definitely didn’t want to leave. If we ever visit Macon again, I’ll definitely be looking up this home again. Thank you so much! 😊"

2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We stayed at Daniela's house while visiting family who live in the area, and the property and the experience were just great. Daniela was proactive and helpful, and the house was super clean, well-appointed, and nicely updated (especially the bathrooms!). Due to the weather and family plans we weren't able to enjoy the backyard as much as I would have liked, but we were still able to take in the sunrise over the lake from the dock. We would absolutely plan our next visit around booking this house again."

Very responsive as well!"
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Daniela was a great host. We asked to rent a day before and she managed to fix a problem in the house and have it all cleaned before our arrival. She kept in touch all that time and even left treats and a bottle of wine to welcome us. The property sits at en end of a lake and we were able to see a lot of wildlife. The backyard deck and grill were a plus. The location of the house made it very easy to miss early Macon morning traffic when heading to Atlanta. There were 2 grocery stores close to the house and a kitchen offering so many extras to make meal prep easy. Would happily stay again
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The host was super nice and communicated from the time of the booking all the way up to the check-in day. The home was beautiful. We loved it.
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"There was no heat the first night got a little cool, it was nice of the host to bring us two electric heaters, although we were afraid to ride them all night. A little cool, other than that everything was OK. Thought maybe we could get a discount on another couple of nights sometime later this year, when there are some vacancy."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Daniela is the perfect hostess.
I was traveling with two teens for a family funeral. (If you have teens you know how difficult they are to please.) They both LOVED the house. There was room to spread out inside and out. After the funeral, the serenity was much needed.
We would absolutely love to stay here again."

2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Words can’t express how enjoyable my stay was at Daniela’s. She thought of everything! It truly felt like home. The place was spotless.

Daniela’s place has to be one of the best, if not the best listings I have ever stayed at. Thank you again Daniela."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Omg! This place is beautiful! I felt like I was walking into serenity. The house is beautifully decorated. Love the artwork and plants.

The bathtub with the view of the lake was perfect to relax in. We would definitely stay here again if in the area."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"May be the nicest Airbnb we have stayed in, and we have stayed in a lot. Everything is done up nicely. Access to the lake. Quiet and peaceful and comfortable. Couch is so comfortable we are shopping for one just like it."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"Daniela was a SUPERHOST. She was extremely accommodating, extremely pleasant, and extremely responsive. The house was pristine, her taste in decor was top notch, and the home made me feel at home. I have had several rentals in the past and have never had a host as attentive, kind, and welcoming as Daniela. I have already booked my next stay at this house and look forward to many others. 100% recommended Danielas property over any others in Macon, GA.
PS. She contacted me from WalMart asking if there was anything I needed for the house that she may have missed. This is who Daniela is. Superb!!!"

2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This place was just what we needed. Very clean and neat. Nice, secluded location. Far enough away from the main house that you don't feel like anyone is nearby.

Betsy's place is in a safe, upscale neighborhood surrounded by beautiful nature in an exclusive setting with deer grazing in the woods. We had total privacy in the well-equipped, spotless Red Barn. Almost every piece (furniture and decorations) in the home had a story to tell and we really appreciated this charm. A classy home indeed. The bed is very comfy, the bed linens are soft. This was one of the quietest nights of our life. The bathroom and kitchen are well equipped. The fridge has a decent size freezer section to make ice. Betsy kindly left us bottled water, milk and half-and-half in the fridge. The car parking is clearly marked and the directional sign guiding guests to the front door came very handy. - We just wish we had more time to spend in the Red Barn. Thank you for the one of a kind experience Betsy!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,I found the home to be cozy and located in a beautiful spot—I enjoyed being surrounded by trees. Betsy was responsive and friendly. I’d stay there again if I was going through Macon.
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"The red barn was a perfect halfway rest stop on our way from Kentucky to Clearwater, FL. Although surrounded by woods, it’s actually in the middle of an upscale subdivision with manicured Bermuda lawns. The setting was both peaceful and secure. The red barn would also be great for someone in Macon on business for a few days, as it has a small dressing room complete with an ironing board, full-length mirror, etc. The complimentary coffee and water was much appreciated! Betsy even had a small first aid kit in the bathroom that saved the day, as I had cut my finger pretty badly in Florida and neglected it. Check-in was super easy and flexible, and our toddler especially enjoyed the Hershey’s kisses, and watching Curious George on YouTube TV in “our Georgia house”. Thumbs up all the way around!"

2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Betsy's place was perfect! We only stayed one night, and it had everything we needed -- small kitchen, a comfy living room with an easy-to-use TV thanks to her instructions, and it was extremely clean. Beautifully laid out. It was esp nice to be surrounded by trees in a quiet, safe area (AND to hear an owl calling in the night!)
The bed was very comfortable, and we had a great sleep for our mega-drive between Florida and Massachusetts.
Thanks Betsy, hope to stay there again in the future!

2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This cabin was beautiful, inside and out. It seriously blew me away! It was well supplied with all the needful, and wantful, items, even right down to things you’d not think of when packing your luggage. It’s quiet and secluded inside a pocket of woods, even though it sits in the front of the owner’s property inside a subdivision! (Owner allows you complete privacy, but is there if needed.) It can accommodate for 4 people, if you don’t mind sleeping 2 to a bed. However there were only 2 of us so we each took a bed, which were so comfy. It does get dark inside the cabin when all lights are out, but thankfully there’s a night light to chase away some of it if you choose to use it. I personally loved to darkness! There is history to the cabin, which I loved! There are pics on the wall that show its progression from little to now. Extraordinary!!! It is very roomy and comfortable. All the comforts of home!!! In the very near future we will return back!!! I would def suggest this little cabin to anyone, especially if you just wanna get away and enjoy time to yourselves! ❤️"

2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was an amazing stay and location. You are close to downtown and shopping and still secluded and have that “tucked away cabin in the woods” feel. The little porch was such a delight, as we were able to have coffee and enjoy the sounds of the birds. We stayed four nights and have no complaints at all."

It has all the comforts of home surrounded by peaceful, beautiful woods. You have complete privacy and still availability to the welcoming hosts if needed. This is a 5 star winner!"
2020-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Second stay at this conviently located immaculately clean and comfortable well furnished property. Lots of little extras making for an easy road trip. Coffee/tea pods /creamers/sweeteners and basic toiletries like soap + shampoo- are provided making dragging in lots of things from the car easier. The bed is super comfortable as well as the spacious living area. Hosts are wonderful giving you privacy + space (but we also get the sense they'd be there for you if wanted/needed.) Don't hesitate to try this self contained 'red barn' ; you won't be disappointed. It's a good value as well!

2020-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We love staying at The Red Barn. It is so comfortable clean, relaxing and peaceful. All the small ""above and beyond"" amenities makes it extra special. Feels like home...better than home"

2020-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Betsy's place is beautiful! Very spacious, charming & comfortable. Peaceful & secluded setting, yet she's available if you need anything. Quickly responded to all my messages. We had everything we needed & then some. Really appreciated that everything was labeled so we didn't have to fumble around to find things or figure things out. It made our stay even smoother. We had a surprise visit of 3 deer near our car watching us pack up in the morning. We stayed at 6 different places through Airbnb on this road trip & all 4 of us voted the Red Barn stay was the favorite!"

2020-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"If you are stopping in Macon Georgia this is your place. The house is nestled in a wooded area in a neighborhood of gorgeous huge homes. It must be one of the nicest upscale neighborhoods of Macon. The home has everything you need even though it doesn't have a true kitchen it still has a refrigerator, microwave and supplies. Cathedral ceilings and clean comfortable bed and bath.Betty, the host, was helpful guiding us in as it was secluded. We hope to stay again."
