The extra touches like toiletries, k-cups/coffee creamer, extra towels/pillows/blankets & a bottle of wine at arrival set this home apart.

The house was perfectly equipped for all of the small group family gatherings we held there with space for entertaining as if in my own home. Nice sized bedrooms and bathrooms with high end furnishings in the home. John was the perfect host- the experience was a flawless airbnb experience. We had a small hiccup which was our fault and John worked with us in a kind and compassionate manner -we greatly appreciated having someone so nice as a host.

2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,John is an amazing host who communicates in a timely fashion and he is very reasonable. His home was absolutely gorgeous and kept well. It was in a nice peaceful community just minutes away from everything. It was also comforting to know there was surveillance out doors so if something happened we were safe and our car was safe. Overall it was an amazing stay and my family and I plan to come back every year

John has a fabulous single-level home with open kitchen layout, lots of space, and a ton of sunlight, all surrounded by greens. The home is close to many gardens, playgrounds for kids, close to downtown, to grocery and shopping … all fantastic in terms of comfort and convenience. Our kids enjoyed museums and parks near downtown and Market Street. We hope to return soon and would recommend to any families of young kids in a heartbeat!"
2021-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,Wonderfully beautiful home. Great locatio
2021-07-01,5,Group trip,"This place is even better than the pictures. We couldn't have asked for a nicer place to stay.

2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great location and super nice house. Great host to work with as well.
2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Close to everything and a beautiful neighborhood!
2021-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This house is so chic. The schuffle board is such a fun addition. Its located in a beautiful neighborhood in Greensboro. If you're new to visiting the area the welcome sheet with recommendations was also a nice tough.
I will definitely stay here each time im in town.
John was very responsive and easy to deal with!"
2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Everything was nice and clean and John was friendly and quick to respond
2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Where do I begin with this AWESOME place?! I booked this adorable home as soon as it became available for me, my mother, her best friend, and my assistant during High Point's spring Market and took a bit of a chance as we were the first guests to ever stay here... and I'm SO GLAD we did! I cannot imagine our stay could have been any better. This home is undoubtedly located in one of the prettiest, most serene neighborhoods in the area on such a quaint street covered in shade from all the mature foliage around where the birds greeted us every morning as we left for Market. John's excellent communication made everything SO simple and convenient and he truly gave us the royal treatment. After a 13 hour drive, coming 'home' to the porch light on and a bottle of wine waiting for us on the counter was just what we needed! As an interior designer, I was so impressed by the thoughtful staging and beautiful decor throughout every room and the layout itself made for a perfect getaway with friends and family. As if the open kitchen/dining and front TV room wouldn't have been enough to entertain, there was an entirely separate game room (fully stocked!) with a fireplace as well as a beautiful sunroom with shuffleboard and comfy lounge chairs to enjoy as well... and we did enjoy them ALL! The rooms were incredibly spacious, comfy, and each one had its own TV with Netflix. The master bath is a thing of dreams and even the hall bath has separate vanities for 2 guests to feel like they still have their own space. Beds were comfy, too! There's nothing we didn't love and would absolutely stay here again. This will be my go-to booking each year. We did not want to leave!"
2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"AMAZING!! OUTSTANDING!! PERFECTION!! Where to begin..first let it be known we are a family that lives and travels abroad & most often staying in AIRBNBs. But this beautiful home is truly the very best AIRBNB experience we have ever had! The home itself is gorgeous; brand newly remodeled, honestly a dream home. We felt spoiled the entire time by the perfectly thought out decor. The kitchen was absolutely perfect with brand new pots, pans, utensils; everything you need. The bed linens, towels, soaps, lotions all provided were high end and lovely. And one of our top favorites was the location. It is tucked away in a beautiful neighborhood surrounded by other gorgeous homes; yet only a less than 5 minute drive to groceries, shopping & restaurants. Better yet, is the access to parks & trails for walking & running. We are a family of runners and honestly have never had such great access right outside our door. Last but not least was the fabulous communication and just pure “goodness” of the owner. Can not thank him enough for everything!! Truly perfect!!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"10/10 stay!! Bed was a little squeaky, but if you aren’t a Rolly-Polly at night you won’t notice. Plus, the bed was super comfortable. We enjoyed our time and would come back in a heartbeat, if in the area again!"
2024-06-01,4,Stayed one night,"Amazing surroundings, description is to the T! , Clean, has everything you need and the outside is absolutely beautiful! I had the time to go out and prayer and watch the beautiful birds in the lake. Worth every penny!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"The suite was wonderful! Designated space for bags, comfortable bed, lots of thoughtful touches, very clean, and opens up to a beautiful backyard. We only stayed a night, but we would love to stay again if we’re ever back in the area."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Beverly and Mark are lovely hosts. They went above and beyond in their service to ensure we had a great stay. I would definitely book with them again !
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great stay! Beautiful in-law arrangement. Bed comfortable. Clean bathroom with large shower! Perfect location. Highly recommend!
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,Bev and Mark were such great hosts. Definitely my favorite ones so far! I had forgotten my cheese at home and they went into their fridge and kindly gave me some so i could proceed to make my lunch. Talked with both of them for a few minutes about the job I work and told them whats coming close to their hometown. THEY ARE THE BEST HOSTS AROUND!!
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"Where do I start? The room was spotless for starts. Bev and Mark were very welcoming and I spoke with Bev in the back yard, overlooking a beautiful pond. The shower was spotless and probably the best shower i’ve been in ever. The only possibly negative thing I can think of is the bed which is extremely soft. It was no problem for me but could be for others, which there is a couch/bed that was more firm if it happened to be a problem for you. beautiful and quiet neighborhood. If i’m ever back in town I will 100% book here again. Thanks again for the hospitality!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,The 'refresh' at Bev's place elevated a great space to an even higher level of comfort and convenience. I hope to stay at this location on future trips to GSO.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,Cozy and clean stay ! Bed was super comfortable ! Loved the shower
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"This is a beautiful property. Sit by the dock. Walk outside and enjoy the landscaping and listen to the quiet and the birds. The inside is also lovely and has all that you need. While attached to their home, we had complete privacy and quiet. We would stay here again."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Very well managed, clean and beautifully decorated"

2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is one of the nicest places we’ve stayed. Several things: It’s absolutely beautiful inside and outside. It was peaceful yet so close to all shopping/restaurants. The unit was pristine in terms of cleanliness, the bathroom was nice. Mark and Bev were soooooo friendly, welcoming, and quick to respond! It’s very private, next to a beautiful walking trail with some wildlife (a family of deer came right up to us). The bed was extremely comfortable and everything was so quiet. We truly loved our stay."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Beverly’s place is a lovely and welcoming spot while spending time in Greensboro. Immaculate, quiet and beautifully appointed, we could not have asked for more gracious hospitality. Would not hesitate to return!"

2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I have stayed with Bev annually for more than 5 years. She has recently updated the room - it is now even more pleasant. I especially enjoyed a late-night popcorn snack and granola bars. The new showerhead is quite enjoyable too - it's a bit of a massage. Overall, everything about this accomodation is A+."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Wonderful place for a short stay in Greensboro. Beautifully decorated and cozy with everything you could possible need provided. While there isn’t a dedicated kitchen we found it easy to warm up prepared food we brought and appreciate the supplies available to accomplish the task. Mark and Beverly are friendly and accommodating. The neighborhood is lovely and close to our relatives so it worked perfectly for us.
We hope to book again when in town!
Thanks for sharing."

2024-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"Absolutely gorgeous! This property has been recently remodeled and everything is pristine! I was blown away when I walked in. The airbnb is located in a nice, safe residential community close to Guilford College and only about 3.5 miles from the Greensboro Science Center. A great location for many local attractions. As a solo female traveler, I felt very safe here. There is also a nice lake in the back yard with gorgeous swans! The room is spotless clean, very relaxing, and the Ugg comforter is so warm and cozy! Just stay here :)"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We had a lovely stay! The space felt comfortable and cozy. It was all we needed! Beverly is very responsive. We hope to stay here again!
2023-12-01,5,Stayed one night,Bev and Mark have one of the most beautiful and comfortable airbnb suites my wife and I havery experienced in 10 years of AirBnb experiences.
2023-12-01,5,Stayed one night,Had a good night and a bed to come back to that’s all I could ask for
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,everything was great!
2023-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"This is my go to place. It’s hard to find a place that offers a one night stay. Because of this I have stayed here several times. It is very clean, meets all my needs, and is in a good area. I highly recommend this place."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We had a wonderful stay. Everything was exactly as described and exceeded our expectations! The location was perfect for getting into downtown and the surrounding area. The neighborhood was gorgeous and we loved the walking trails. Highly recommend staying with Bev!
2023-12-01,5,Stayed one night,Had a short but very restful and relaxing stay. Would book this room again in the future. Check in was a breeze.
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The in-law suite was perfect for us, the energy inside was calming & peaceful. Great hosts, great communication; an overall positive experience. We will stay again."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"This place was very nice and clean. The place met all my needs. The location is great to walking trail and shops, stores, and restaurants. This is my second time staying here. I will stay here again."
2023-11-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"I do recommend arriving during daylight hours. The home itself does have good front porch lighting and their house number is visible in the dark. However, the rest of the neighborhood is dark and you cannot see other house numbers. My GPS led me astray by about 7 houses and I couldn't tell where to go.
Also, there is a side pathway to the room which has irregular slate stepping stones that is much better to traverse during daylight hours the first time.
The room was well equipped and clean. Their dog is quiet --I never heard barking. It is a beautiful safe neighborhood to walk in for exercise."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"Beverly's place was as described! It is in a nice, golf course neighborhood. Felt safe, very clean. Flexible check-in and good instructions from the host. Coffee, snacks, mini fridge, etc. were provided. Very clean and pretty quiet stay! The bed is a bit squeaky and the only odd thing we encountered upon arrival was that there appeared to be no soap or towels in the bathroom (we had to hunt for items like that in cabinets and closets within the AirBnB). Wasn't a big deal to have to set those out on our own, but it might be worth mentioning to guests that those items DO exist in the unit...they just might have to do some browsing to find them! Which leads me to another positive point: There are small, laminated signs posted throughout the AirBnB to tell guests more about the unit (how to control the TV, what to do about temp/fans, etc.) -- very helpful. The unit does have some breakable decor (like china/plates hanging on the wall above the couch)... so watch your head if you are tall!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was my 2nd stay at the In-Law Suite, and as with my first visit, it did not disappoint. The location is convenient, the layout is well thought out and Bev has done an outstanding job of anticipating the needs of her guests. I will definitely check availability of this The In-Law Suite for future visits to Greensboro."
2023-10-01,4,Stayed one night,"Beverly's place is just as described and exactly what you see in pictures. The neighborhood is quiet and not very well lit so if your gps is not cooperating, it can be a challange to locate. Highly recommend to anyone looking to stay in the Greensboro area"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Located in a beautiful neighborhood with lots of trees and a lovely little body of water in the backyard. Bev and Mark were very friendly and made us feel very welcome. The space was large and comfortable and we had everything we needed. I had coffee in the morning sitting on the stone patio overlooking the water and it was heaven! BONUS: The water pressure in the shower was incredible! We would definitely stay here again and highly recommend!
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Beverly‘s home is exactly as the photos show.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The room is very lovely, and is located inside a beautiful woodland. Very quiet and calm. Bev and Mark are very friendly with good communication. Highly recommended"

2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"By far, the nicest place I have stayed with AirBnb. Beverly was very responsive, very helpful. The in-law suite was just as described. I really liked the location, as it was in area where I grew up. Since I travel to this city often, this will be “home away from home”. Thank you, Beverly, for your prompt responses.
Jeff"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,Excellent affordable place to stay at with private and safe parking spot and close to many things around such as the Greensboro Coliseum!
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"The lodging was very clean and comfortable with all the anticipated amenities! I was in and out for a local conference so did not get to spend much time in the back yard, but wish I had because it was so beautiful--right on the water!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"Beverly and Mark are passionate about their town and will talk about it with love. They also have verry good recommendations for activities, food, etc."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was just what we needed for a short weekend of moving our son down. Everything was just as its posted, and we had everything we needed. Beautiful home, and the outside setting was gorgeous! Location is perfect for getting around town and was close to just about everything you could want. Hosts were very friendly and easy to reach if needed."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"when we booked this, the app didn't update the hosts on our arrival so the room hadn't been fixed just yet. However they quickly cleaned up in less than 30 minutes and we were able to set up in the airbnb. The room is just like the photos and very cozy. I will say the internet did disconnect a few times but that's to be expected on a business connection. Otherwise than that, the whole place is very cute. I would definitely recommend this to others."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"Thank you, we feel at home."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"Wonderful stay! Pristine, quiet and beautiful neighborhood. Bed is comfortable especially if you like a softer mattress. Shower is perhaps worth the price of admission in itself. Nice coffee set up. Loved it!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We plan to be back. This is an awesome value. It’s also close to a lot of places in Greensboro that we are familiar with like Whole Foods. We love the location. The place was very clean. The bed was comfortable. The water pressure on the shower was great. Bev was responsive.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,Great stay! Will be back!

2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,An exceptionally exquisite environment that felt homely and private. Great exposure for relaxation as the environment has a small lake in backyard. Host offered me opportunity to use lake to kayak as I’m a kayaker. Location close in proximity to fine restaurants and convenient locations for shopping. It’s a quiet and private environment that affords run my case; a getaway from long week of management responsibilities to reflect while engaging in activities in/around Greensboro area.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"Very clean, nicely decorated room. House is in an upscale neighborhood on a lake. Would definitely stay here again if I’m in Greensboro."

2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What a lovely home and beautiful outdoor setting! We enjoyed spending mornings on the deck and sitting by the lake.
Everything is as pictured in the listing and outside is even more lovely. Beverly and Mark are great hosts. They were quick to respond to questions or requests. We enjoyed meeting them and chatting one morning during our stay.
We were there for a family event so didn’t get much time to explore the area. However we did have brunch at the Sage Mule as Mark highly recommend it. The food and service was awesome!
We hope to stay again and would highly recommend. A great stay for an unbeatable price."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Everything was perfect ! This was our 1st Airbnb experience. Bev & Mark 's warm hospitality was a pleasant addition to our stay at their beautiful home.

2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I could not have been more satisfied with my 7 day stay. The location, neighborhood, and my million dollar view of Lake Euphemia with geese and swans floating by and the sounds of nature could not be beat. I highly recommend this Airbnb."
2023-04-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"This place was amazing! The view was beautiful, it was close to stores and other things. There was different things to do there. I do wish they let me know the hot tub was not working because I was looking forward to it.

2023-01-01,5,Stayed one night,Really enjoyed our stay. First time we had tried this type of stay (i.e. non hotel stay). Was in a nice safe quiet neighborhood. Our hosts were friendly while greatly respecting their guests privacy.

The location is easy to find. Beautiful residential neighborhood. Check in is easy with a lockbox into our private entrance. Suite was very clean. Comfortable bed and very quiet and peaceful. No restaurants within walking distance but several within a 5 to 10 minute drive. We thought the charges were very reasonable. Enjoyed our stay and would certainly stay again anytime we are in the Greensboro area.
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Another lovely stay with Beverly. Perfect little ensuite in a quiet neighborhood. Communication was challenging at times but overall a good stay
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Always an enjoyable stay here in Greensboro.
2022-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"The property is tucked away in a nice neighborhood with mature trees and landscaping, backing onto a picturesque lake. The suite is cozy with a lot of thoughtful touches which make it feel more like you're a family friend. The bed sleeps well and the sitting areas and desk make it a great option for business or leisure travel. Highly recommended!"
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Wonderful little en-suite. It had everything I needed as a solo traveler. The bed is extremely comfortable and the water pressure in the shower in incredible. I would definitely recommend Beverly's place to anyone staying in Greensboro.
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Thank you for being super hosts!
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great accommodations, gorgeous neighborhood. Enjoyed our stay very much, highly recommended."
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We stayed a few nights for our son’s golf tournament at The Cardinal. Great quiet neighborhood with a walking trail right up the road. Clean space with all the thoughtful little touches you can imagine. It’s our second time staying here and we’ll choose this one every time if we are in the area!
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This place was amazing!
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very clean and comfortable! This was our second stay! Thank you!
2022-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"A nice, clean place with quiet outdoor spaces for relaxation/meditation. Hosts’ guidance was readily available—dinner spot was excellent. No issues at all during our quick overnight on a business trip."
2022-10-01,3,Stayed one night,"I didn’t stay here, my husband and son did. They provided me the feedback that I’m providing now.
Pros: Nice and safe neighborhood. The Lake was really neat. Check-in was easy. The price was good.
Cons: you have to physically move a cinder block when dealing with the fence gate. The bed was very saggy in the middle and not comfortable for two people as it made them lean towards each other. Had to kill two rather large bugs (palmetto bugs?) in the room, most likely due to being near a Lake but still unsettling."
2022-10-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Great stay. Everything was as advertised and the hosts were cordial and communicative. Convenient location for my activities at the Greensboro Cultural Center.
2022-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"One of the best Airbnbs I've ever stayed in! Bev was super helpful and communicated really well. The room itself was very spacious, beautifully decorated, and immaculately clean. The backyard was just gorgeous and I had a great time sitting on the little dock overseeing the lake. Perfect place to relax and unwind. Without a doubt, coming back here the next time I'm in Greensboro."
2022-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We had a great little stay! Everything was clean and all the little home like touches including water were great.
It was great for one night for my little family and we felt very safe in the area also."

2022-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"Beverly and Mark's place is located in a lovely neighborhood and it is comfortable, quiet and cozy. Everything you need and more, books, games etc. Internet is a little slow but that's never a deal breaker for us. Hosts are friendly and helpful. Would stay here again if in the area."
2022-09-01,5,Stayed one night,We could not have been more pleased with our stay at this property. The location is perfect and centrally convenient to all parts of town. The back yard overlooking the private lake is so picturesque! Beverly and Mark are very great hosts and communication was on point. We will return!
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Beverly’s place is clean and comfortable. I love staying there!
2022-09-01,5,Stayed one night,Everything was great. It was a very cozy space and equipped with everything you would need for an overnight or two. The directions to get to the back door entrance had literally step-by-step picture instructions. Couldn’t be more clearer.
2022-09-01,5,Stayed one night,We had a very comfortable stay in this house. It’s in a lovely location on a small lake. Swans and geese floated by. We’d stay here again.
2022-09-01,3,Stayed one night,Not much to say
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great little place to stay. It had everything we needed. Great backyard for relaxing ... including swans!

2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,My home away from home. I travel for my job and I stay at Bev’s place every time.
2022-08-01,4,Stayed one night,Nice neighborhood. Beautiful yard and landscaping. Plan to sit out by the lake and watch the swans. Great location.
2022-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"A very comfortable space and really friendly hosts, and the garden, pond, and porch were even more beautiful than I expected. The neighborhood is pretty and peaceful, too, and I discovered a nice woodsy trail right down the road."
2022-08-01,5,Stayed one night,I absolutely love this place. I want to move in and be their roommate.
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Beverly’s home and community were amazing. Very safe yet centralized. It is a perfect place for a couple nights. If traveling in the area again it will be our first choice.
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is a private suite that has it’s own entrance from outdoors accessed by a field stone walk to the back of the house. The house has a large yard and is in a quiet residential area. The suite very quiet, private and comfortable. There is a refrigerator, microwave, Keurig coffee maker and TV with Roku. it is convient to he airport and to the downtown area, and there is an excellent shopping area close by. I loved my stay here and host, Beverly, was very responsive to my requests. I would definitely stay here again!"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed one night,everything was great :)
2022-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"The description of the post is very accurate. The hosts allowed us to stay with our last-minute plans. The place is beautiful in the pics online and looks even better in person. It's clean and cozy, with lots of character. There was so much attention given to even the smallest details. There is coffee, tea, water, and snacks available. We were able to keep the fruit we brought inside of the mini-fridge. We ordered take-out and were able to use the plates and plastic utensils that were provided. Wineglasses and a corkscrew are available if needed. There are a ton of books for those who love to read. There are games available in case you'd like to take a break from watching tv. There are a few sitting areas inside and outside. The backyard is a great place to take some awesome pics. During our stay, it rained a bit but we were still able to go out to the lake. There was a swan in the water and it was very nice to see it. It was unbothered by our presence. The shower has great pressure and you will not be disappointed. There is body wash, shampoo, and conditioner available for use if you did not bring your own. There are plenty of towels and extra blankets/covers available. The bed sits high and overall is very comfortable. There is a charging area right next to the right side of the bed so you can keep your electronics close while resting. We did not get a chance to meet Beverly while we were there but did see and speak to Mark when we were getting ready to leave the property. He was very nice, welcoming, and had good energy. We enjoyed our stay and would recommend it to others as well."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"Communication was phenomenal anytime I had any questions or concerns replies we're quick. I wish it hadn't rained the day of my reservation I didn't get a chance to fully enjoy the patio, it was beautiful. The room was cozy and the views were amazing definitely would book here again."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed one night,Amazing 👏
2022-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"This is a very attractive and comfortable room plus bathroom attached to the owner’s home but with a separate entrance. We had a bit of trouble finding the place, but that was our fault, not Beverly’s. She and her husband were very helpful getting our luggage into the room and helping us out at the end of our visit. Not a full kitchen, but microwave, frig, coffee, and a few goodies. We found the binder very useful with needed info for our stay and tons of information about local restaurants. Thanks, Beverly, for a very nice stay."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I was thoroughly enchanted when discovering this mother-in-law suite and the beautiful flowers, ducks, swan, outdoor spaces and the pond. The pictures did not disappoint!
Beverly and Mark's place is a sweet, quiet respite in the midst of the city.
The suite is perfect for 1 or 2 people. The home's central location and access to so much is yet another plus!
Many thanks to our hosts for thinking of everything and being accessible for questions."

2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This place is nothing short of amazing! The hosts Beverly and Mark have created a comfortable and fully functional resting place. I have stayed in numerous Bed & Breakfast Inns and I must say their In-Law suite is on par with the best of them. They were so kind to create a loose-leaf binder with suggestions on restaurants and things to do. Their lakeside seating area is so tranquil and breathtaking. I cannot wait to go back.

Elizabeth and Drew both replied almost instantly. To EVERYTHING. I had trouble figuring out the thermostat and Elizabeth literally was there in less than 2 minutes. She got it working and we had an awesome chat. She was SOOOO nice. I will be visiting the area often and her place is going to be my GO to. Thanks Elizabeth and Drew for keeping such a great space. AND for keeping it TRULY pet free. Makes a WORLD of difference to guests like me who are allergic to animals. The place was absolutely adorable. Had everything I needed. Parking in the driveway which was REALLY nice compared to street parking. Can't say enough about it. Looking forward to going back. And feel like I made a friend in Elizabeth!

Check in was very well explained and was a breeze. Be aware that the house is in the backyard of other houses and within close distance to those houses and patios, so don't book if you are looking for seclusion or privacy. However, with that being said, it was a wonderful place and I would highly recommend!"

(And Starbucks is only two blocks away) My first morning after grabbing coffee I thought I would check out the comfort of the bed before my shower. Next thing I know I wake up and it is 5 pm. Definitely comfortable! it was a a great kitchen but I chose take out from the bar next store which had amazing hot sandwiches.

2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Future stayers: please read his directions accurately. (Where to park especially) Parnell is highly flexible and responsive.
This was my first experience with AirBnB and Parnell’s place has set the standard and he set it HIGH. The accommodations were accurate, in great working order and useful. Nothing was wasted. The location is beautiful and very tasteful. As an insomniac his place was perfect, I actually slept very peacefully and woke to it still being dark and felt so refreshed.
I had ZERO issues with the spot. I wish I could give more than 5 stars, it was a vacation I never realized I needed and yet I’m craving for it once more.
Thank you Parnell, your place is truly a castle fit for a king and queen.
First airbnb experience, hopefully I get better at putting my thoughts into words for future stays. Thanks you reader for your time."

Even with the downtown street-level location, we never really heard street noise. The bedroom (with a comfortable bed!) is located in the back of the building and it was very quiet at night.
For anyone caring about accessible access: from the front door of the building on Market Street, there are no stairs to get to the unit. From the parking lot in the rear of the building, there is a flight of stairs up to the unit's hallway. (A person could walk around to the building and go in the front door to avoid the stairway.)"

The mattress was super soft. Not really my preference but it did the job well.
Highly recommend!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"I had an incredible week long stay at Pernell’s place with my 3 year old son! My son spent all day at summer camp while I worked remotely at the loft. The location was absolutely perfect, right in the heart of the city. Being in such a central spot allowed me to easily explore everything downtown Greensboro has to offer. Coffee is within walking distance. The Wi-Fi was quick and I didn’t have any issues working from the loft.
The loft itself was spacious and clean, providing a comfortable and inviting environment. Access to the space was easy and when we walked in, I immediately felt right at home. The two large televisions made it easy to unwind in the evenings. The record player and pac man game were a fun touch!
I also greatly appreciated the parking situation. Having a designated free parking spot made it incredibly convenient to come and go without any worries.
Overall, my experience at Pernell’s loft was absolutely perfect. I’m already looking forward to my next visit."

2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I have to say for a few days in Greensboro - this place was A+. It's centrally located and whomever decorated it - deserves a hug. This is a smaller studio - but they have SO MUCH personality in the place -decent amenities like a record player - a video game console - and really fast internet. Given the 2 days plus cleaning fee -this was the same as a hotel price wise -and 10x better in terms of my own needs.
I would stay here again definitely. The only critical thing - the street you turn on to get down the alley to park - is narrow. And with cars on the one side- my heart stopped still trying to park my brand new 50K car and make the turn around the edge to get into the alley to park. I admit i thought about parking in a garage more than once just to avoid the anxiety - i had to come in and out a few times a day. Not exactly the host's fault -but bring the smaller car with the tighter turning radius. I had a Honda Pilot and it was anxiety inducing. Otherwise - loved it."

Very impressed with the turntable the apartment is equipped with, it made the apartment feel very homey; listened to quite a bit of MJ. Also a great location, pretty centralized and the downtown area is easily walked. Would recommend and would definitely consider staying again. Thank you Pernell!"
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Wow, this place was so peaceful and walkable to everything for date night. The vinyl record player very enjoyable while looking at the people walk on the street. During this time we were to see the Christmas parade. Pernell was very communicative with every step from check-in to check-out. Tytyty we will be back"
2022-11-01,5,Stayed one night,This place was fabulous! The host was fabulous with communicating and I look forward to hopefully staying again!
2022-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"Pernell’s Studio201 apartment / condo was the perfect stay in Greensboro. Right downtown - walkable to EVERYTHING. The actual place was gorgeous, pristine and had hotel style amenities. Will book this place every time we come to GSO."
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"LOVE this place!! The apartment was so clean and there is lots of fun things to do. There are games and a nice record player. You can tell that Pernell put a lot into making the place fun and comfortable for guests. I honestly didn’t want to leave. Really cool art inside and the location is perfect! Also, the bed is super comfy and the room was so dark and quiet."
2022-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This place was AMAZING! From check-in to check-out!
Once you figure out parking, it’s a breeze.
Mr. Pernell was the most pleasant host I’ve ever encountered on Airbnb. He was very quick with answering questions and offering help with anything I & my 4 year may have needed during our stay.
The aesthetic was immaculate! Very calm and serene. This loft doesn’t even feel like you’re in Greensboro, it’s giving “Manhattan Skyline” something like that lol
I love plants so much and the faux plants were my absolute FAVORITE! 😍
The bed was probably our favorite. Me and my toddler slept like pigs we could hardly enjoy the huge flat screen t.v that is perfectly placed on high above the bed. Very theatre-like. My son loved it!
The kitchen was very beautiful! Updated appliances and pretty marble countertops!
There was even a video game for my son!
The bathroom was spotless and very tasteful! There was a surplus of towels and wash cloths and even a, bath robe & make-up cloth 🥹
All in all, THIS PLACE IS EVERYTHING YOU NEED! Worth every penny and a breath of fresh air! We will definitely be staying again very soon!"
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This condo was perfect! It’s so cozy and inviting! Loved the way it was furnished and decorated. I was concerned that it might be a little noisy being right on the street, but I never heard a sound at night and slept like a rock on that comfortable bed. I loved the pillows! Great bars and restaurants just steps away. I would definitely stay here again!"
2022-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great spot, close to a lot of things. Trash compactor was broken but we were still able to throw things away."
2022-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"My stay at Studio 201 was excellent and situated in downtown Greensboro N.C. The place was nice and cozy and had everything I needed for my short stay. Will definitely book this place when I return to N.C. Also, thanks to the host for responding so quickly when I thought I couldn't get into the apartment."
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"As a person who travels a lot, I can honestly say Studio 21 is one of the best Airbnb's I've stayed at. It is in a safe area, immacuately clean and close to local restaurants, landmarks and my daughter's school in downtown Greensboro. Check in was a breeze and the decor is gorgeous with a mix of 80s pop culture and modern, hip stylings. I have found my home away from home whenever I'm in Greensboro. You absolutely will love your stay here!"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We really appreciated the communication provided by Pernell. The apartment has such a nice vibe; it definitely felt like we were on vacation in a luxury living space. The location is great; we were about 5 minutes from everywhere we wanted to be. Highly recommend.

2022-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"Love love LOVE this place! Studio 201 is so cute! It’s in the most perfect spot downtown. I was worried about parking but I had my own parking space. It was immaculate. I loved the design aesthetic as well. My most favorite part of my stay was the record player!!! I haven’t listened to records in years!! There’s also a gaming pad with old school games on it. I didn’t get a chance to play with it, but I will on my next stay. Thank you Pernell for being a wonderful host. I’ll be back!!"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Pernell is awesome! He was quick to respond to any question I had.

Her condos are immaculately clean and decorated. It is evident she cares by how well she takes care of her condos and how responsive she is to her guest. My husband is obsessed with neatness and cleanliness so we are very picky about where we stay. Karen’s condos surpasses the mark! The area is quiet, safe and walkable to restaurants and historic landmarks. The price is very reasonable, definitely worth the cost. Just in case I haven’t made it clear already we would definitely recommend staying here!"

2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"By far the cleanest AirB&B we’ve stayed in. Sometimes listing photos make the property look a lot more “clean/up-to-date” than the place actually is. Karen’s apartment was nicer than we were expecting. We were extremely grateful that there was not only coffee, but also a few different creamers to choose from. The filtered water and little treats were also extremely appreciated! I have a lot of trouble sleeping without a fan, and there actually was one in the closet!!! Karen was super quick to answer all of my questions. Friday night we did have trouble finding parking, but Karen told us about the parking garage that was within walking distance, so it all worked out.

You are in walking distance to many coffee shops and restaurants. I am very picky and I don’t have 1 complaint about the inside of the apartment and it’s cleanliness.

The parking situation was a little inconvenient but once the locals told us not to worry about feeding meters or getting tickets for parking between 8 am and 6 pm (as the signs indicate) we were cool.
The only other downside was the sound of footprints at 6 am was a bit annoying but manageable once the heavy walkers were gone for the day.
Karen was a pleasure to work with!"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I was so thankful that Karen’s place was listed after another airbnb fell through. I absolutely loved this place and felt right at home.

NEG: Strong cigarette smell which can affect sensitive people suffering from allergies or asthma like us : we had to take allergy meds and use inhaler. Although It might no be a problem for a person that smokes.
uncomfortable sofa bed in the living room for people that have back problems.
We thank the owner for comming to check the smoke smell issue which it can be probably solve with a couple air purifiers placed on the bathroom and the other kitchen. The other issue is the sofa bed mattress in the living room is VERY uncomfortable. A person can feel the metal coils while lying on the sofa.

2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I cannot say enough good things. I am horrible with directions and Camille made it super easy to find her place as well as the checkin instructions. She even went over and above and had cute little notes around for directions on anything I could have possibly needed. The personal touch with the welcome sign and personalized with my name made it so welcoming. It was like being at home. All I had to do was show up and bring clothes. She definitely goes above and beyond and would highly recommend her place to anyone. It will definitely be my go to when I’m in the area again.

2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"Camille's place was fantastic for my one-night stay, and I honestly wish I could have stayed longer! The space was sunny, colorful, and spacious, with lots of thoughtful extra touches like a coffee station, Bluetooth speaker unit, and fun and funky art throughout. The bed was also super comfortable! I really enjoyed walking a bit around the surrounding neighborhood as well — it was filled with historic home with lots of character. I wouldn't hesitate to stay at Camille's again if I return to Greensboro!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,My friend and I enjoyed the privacy of the space in addition to the comfortable bed.

2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is the spot in Greensboro! The Fisher Park neighborhood is quiet and beautiful. If you are looking for a cool place to lay your head...you've found it. The Sage Mule, a great cafe, is a short walk down the street. The nearby cemetery is a great place to stretch the legs and downtown Greensboro with its bars and restaurants is an easy walk. This rental is a cute little hideaway and the bed is super comfortable. Camille is very friendly and can give recommendations for what to do in the area. We used it as a home base during Elon's Family Weekend. It's an easy drive to Elon on back roads."

2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I stay in a lot of airbnbs and this was one of my favorites. Great location, all of downtown is a beautiful, safe walk. The neighborhood was very quiet, but some beautiful historic homes.. I went to a show downtown and walked back after midnight and never saw a person. The room, and bed were comfy. I didnt get to use the private outside garden area because it was 1000 degrees outside, but it looked beautiful. The A/C was very nice. If you want to cook a big meal this is not the kitchen for you, but i made some sandwiches and had some microwaved items..
A+ grade from me.."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We enjoyed staying here for a work event. It was comfortable, clean, with plenty of space for the two of us. We felt very welcomed and especially enjoyed using the outdoor space! The filtered water and coffee/tea amenities were a great surprise! The bathroom is a nice size. The main bed is comfortable. The sofa bed is small but worked well and had a good night's rest after long work days. Camille was awesome and very helpful when we thought our plans were changing. Would stay here again!"

2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great stay at Camille's! The studio was adorable, cozy and in a beautiful & peaceful neighborhood.

I definitely recommend this bnb if you're coming to Greensboro!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"Camille's place was why I like to stay in an AIRBNB. Clean, quirky, and everything you might need. Hope to stay again if I pass through Greenville."

2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My daughter and I stayed in Camille’s studio for two nights while we moved my daughter back to college in Greensboro. It was one of my favorite AirBnB experiences ever. The footprint is small, but the layout is very spacious, with a small second room with a sofa that converts into a twin bed. The bathroom is also spacious with lots of hooks for hanging towels and toiletry bags—and very modern. The entire space was pristinely clean! The decor has such personality! A big bonus is the garden just outside the front door. There are patio lounge chairs under an umbrella, a patio table with four chairs and another umbrella and at least two benches tucked away along a walking path through the garden. There is a small studio kitchen with a microwave and large dorm-style fridge (it held all our groceries!) and every little thing we could need for a great cup of coffee in the morning. The neighborhood is lovely, too! I am so happy to have found this BnB!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Excellent stay! Camille was a great host and her place was the same as pictured. I look forward to booking again.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Camille’s place is easy to find. Located in a lovely neighborhood. We liked walking the neighborhood and walking to nearby restaurants. Camille gave us great instructions and her place was clean and art filled. The small room off to the side was my favorite place to curl up and read a book. Very nice.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,What an adorable place to stay! Camille was responsive and willing to help in any way she could. The garden and large windows on the doors were awesome!!
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,Such a cute place! And the bed was so comfy!
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great, cozy spot in a really cool neighborhood!! Thanks for all the attention to the little details that made us feel so at home!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My husband and I had a wonderful stay at Camille's quaint little place. It's located in a beautiful, quite neighborhood, that's still close to everything. Loved all of the art work. The shower and the bed are amazing. Loved all of the attention to detail. If you get a craving for some tacos and margaritas while there, head on over to Taco Mama...yum!! Would definitely stay again."

2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The place was just as described. Very cozy, comfortable, and the separate room would be a benefit if more than on person was staying there. Everything was super clean and the neighborhood was very quiet (I stayed over a weekend). Be sure to read the directions about where to park and get in - it's around the corner from where it shows on maps. :)"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,We’ll be back! Very cute place.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"INCREDIBLE place to stay. so so so private and cozy, a home away from home. perfect location, adorable neighborhood and just overall so wonderful. the kindest hosts we could have asked for. we didn’t want to leave!"

2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Camille was an extremely excellent hostess. She responded quickly to anything we needed. We loved her location and especially the privacy.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The photos of this sweet property caught my eye and hooked me! Camille's instructions were spot on, letting us know just what to expect, but not so much that we had to spend the afternoon reading. This property seemed secluded and peaceful but so close to whatever you could want to do.
We have stayed in many rentals over the years and one of the things I have learned is that the small things are the big things when you are away from home. There was attention to detail in that there were plenty of hooks in the bathroom to hang towels, plenty of places to plug things in, good instructions for using devices in the property. There was also access to extra towels and linens if needed. The bed was comfortable!
Camille was not fussy. No laundry list of things to do before checkout. (I have stories!) She was responsive when we had a request, but was so careful to respect out privacy - we appreciated that. We loved our stay at Camille's property!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,An amazing stay. We loved the garden and outdoor seating. The card games and trivia located in the second room were lots of fun. We also appreciated the food recommendations inside the airbnb.

2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We had a lovely one night stay at Camille’s! Enjoyed checking out Greensboro and appreciated the local recommendations. Her spot is close to everything, and my kids loved having Lily visit!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"As former Airbnb hosts and regular airbnb guests, this is our favorite rental by far. It’s small but perfectly appointed and not cramped at all. It’s lovingly decorated and the cleanest space by far. Camille was very attentive to every detail and very responsive with communication. The extra fold out bed area is a great help for varying sleeping options and the queen size bed was cozy and most comfortable. The mini split a/c kept us perfectly comfortable and we enjoyed relaxing in this quiet neighborhood looking out through the large wall of windows onto her lovely garden. We appreciated this reasonably priced option when traveling on a budget. Thank you for keeping it accessible. We felt welcome and safe. We will definitely book again!!"

2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Charming cozy quiet retreat. The bed is so comfortable. I hated to get up each morning.
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We loved our stay. Cozy, charming decor, fantastic outdoor space, and very quiet neighborhood. My husband tends to snore so I always look for a place that has a separate “child” bed. Sometimes those are terrible but in this case that side room bed was super comfy. In fact he’s been having back trouble and since the main bed is on the softer side, he took over the more firm extra bed. There were plenty of towels, which was great because we got caught in a thunderstorm walking back from town (Camille provided an umbrella which for some reason we didn’t take). Really well equipped place and thoughtfully designed. We would happily book again."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"In the more than 6 years of using Airbnb this is by far the cleanest, prettiest, warmest and most welcoming place I’ve ever stayed. The street is quiet and tree lined. The cottage is in a sweet garden behind a picket fence. Inside is tastefully decorated with beautiful original art pieces and there was a sign welcoming me as well. So personal, so kind. I smelled and looked freshly clean. The temperate was comfortable. There was also a selection of local magazines and menus for those interested. After visiting with my local friends, when I returned to the property, a sweet kitty was in the sidewalk so I got some kitten cuddles as well. Absolute perfection."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"Super cute and eclectic space. Lots of different styles and decorations. A separate room included a huge bowl full of different card games, trivia, and other things to entertain you without needing a television. Right next to a beautiful cemetery in less than a 10-minute walk to a number of food options. Will easily book again."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,Very cozy place
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"Loved this place so much. Clean, cozy, boho, artsy place. We enjoyed coffee in the garden and had a great time visiting local breweries, shops and restaurants."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Such a cute and home-y vibe from this place! We will definitely be staying here again on our next Greensboro trip. Soooo appreciative of the water and ice provided. Love the quirkiness of this place!!
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"What an amazing stay! The garden and outdoor patio space is to die for!
She gives you everything you could possibly need. What a host!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,This garden cottage is a little gem! Awesome to have the second bedroom (floor level pull out sofa). Stayed here on a big road trip with my 69 year old mom and infant child and the three of us were absolutely comfortable. Thanks Camille!
2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"I absolutely fell in love with the Fisher Park Historic District! I only had two regrets: 1) I was only able to stay one night, and 2) I wasn't able to take advantage of the garden as it rained most of the time I was there. The apartment was cozy and fun, perfect for the privacy and quiet I desired. Though there's not a full kitchen, it was well-appointed/supplied and I did not lack for anything. The small fridge fit everything from my travel cooler. The coffee-drinker goodies were appreciated! The bed was very comfortable. Parking was easy and at-the-door. I also appreciated Camille's instructions for accessing the apartment, they were clear and simple to follow. I added a return trip to Greensboro to my bucket list, and I'll be staying at Camille's again! Thank you!"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great little spot in a super cute neighborhood in Greensboro!

2023-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"This was our second time staying at this cozy little place. It’s perfect for an overnight.

The garden is lovely and the neighborhood is walkable."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Highly recommend you give Camille's place a stay during your visit to Greesnboro! Not only was she incredibly kind and accommodating, the location is unmatched. Just a few blocks walk to the center of downtown, and lots of beautiful parks surround the area. Camille was a quick and thorough communicator and made every aspect of our stay easy. Thanks again for sharing your home with us!"

2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We highly recommend checking out Camille’s space! My husband & I stayed for 3 nights while finalizing details for an upcoming move. It was a perfect mini getaway. Her place was pristine with lots of games (like cards & trivia), her artwork makes it feel super cozy and she even provides lots of local recommendations for food, shopping and entertainment. The neighborhood is quaint and quiet with lots of history and friendly faces. The check in & out process was flawless. Parking was directly in front of the guest house and the garden/yard area was perfect on sunny days and cool nights. It was also well light at night but not too bright. Thank you so much Camille!"

Edith, did give me something back because of the Inconvenience .The other thing I didn’t like was the hand soap in the bathroom was mixed with water it was only a quarter bottle of soap and water and the same with dish detergent, but there was no supplies in the house. she had no hand lotion or even a bar of body soap just if you forgot to pack that. no coffee, no extra paper towels.

The home has been updated and has a modern look and colors yet still has its original charm. Pets are welcome here which was great for our pooch. The back yard is fenced in but don’t just let your dog roam free. The kitchen is fully equipped with tools and gadgets for anything you may want to make. The bathroom has been updated and the soaker tub was a pleasant surprise. We only used one bedroom but the bed was comfortable and extra linens were provided if needed. Cute breakfast nook in the kitchen and a stand alone bar table with stools makes for a great dining experience. The inspirational “I Am” sayings over the writing desk in the living room were beautiful. The desk was stocked with some basic office supplies if needed. The house was clean, and smelled amazing. It was raining most of our trip but there is a fire pit in the backyard. Will definitely return to this spot. Thanks Edith!"

The room felt very spacious and was exactly as pictured. Justin worked with me on a couple of things which was helpful. One of the best parts for me was that I never had to get in my car. I could easily walk to a nearby greenway, and a couple of restaurants were nearby as well as 30-min walk to a high-end grocery store. This was a personal retreat for me. I appreciated all the light in the room. Bed was comfy...always important."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed one night,Absolutely had a blast here! We loved how private this Airbnb was and whenever we’re in town we plan on coming back!
2023-12-01,5,Stayed one night,Parking right next to the entrance. Large studio. Comfortable queen size bed. Full bathroom with tub/shower. Comfortable loveseat. Very clean. Large windows looking out on a grassy yard. Quiet place and neighborhood. Questions answered quickly with text and immediately by phone.
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We enjoyed our stay overall. The space was very clean and looked just like the photos presented. The only thing I would recommend is updating the tv/remote. Other than that, everything was perfect. Thank you."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I really liked how they had a binder full of things to do and try in the surrounding area. I really enjoyed the backyard view from the bedroom windows. I felt very safe. If I was in need of anything, Justin was quickly to respond. There were other guests in the unit next to me, but they weren’t a bother at all, didn’t even hear them if they were making any type of noise. I would stay again in the future."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Absolutely loved our stay! Justin was very helpful and responsive. Clean, and had some of the best sleep of my life at this AIRBNB!!! will definitely be back!"

2023-11-01,5,Stayed one night,This was our second stay here and it’s our favorite for the area. The suite is very clean and nice. They have it well stocked with anything you need for your trip which stands out from other places we stay. Super friendly!
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Really enjoyed Justin's Plush In-Law Suite. It was exactly as pictured and it was a pleasant retreat from all the activities we were involved with. The location was easy to find with GPS map there was a much more convenient driveway at the rear of the property and was easier to access our unit. Great location.
Overall, great experience - clean, bright, nicely decorated accommodations with a little extra - breakfast snacks, coffee and soups. lOVED that we could control our own heat as the weather change was a little unexpected.
As very independent travelers, we never had to contact our host but knew that he and his family were nearby.
Will seek out this rental in the future as it had all that we wanted and needed for this trip to Greensboro. Highly recommend."

2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Gorgeous in-law suite in an amazing location close to shopping and entertainment that still felt quiet and peaceful. Thanks so much for a wonderful stay!
2023-09-01,3,Stayed with kids,"Cute setting. We enjoyed the privacy of Justin’s sweet and how well he detailed his listing. It was helpful for beforehand and during check in. The address was hard for my gps to find and address/ mailbox not labeled with house number which made it challenging at night. The photos looked immaculate however the place was average as far as cleanliness. There was someone else’s trash in trash can and the floor and rug wasn’t clean. We didn’t hear any house noise which was appreciated. Bed was clean and comfortable. Decorated quaintly. Couldn’t get the cable to work with the remote despite their detailed instructions. Clock on wall was dead.
Communication: check in and check out details clear. I received the check out information as soon as I checked in, which felt odd as the message was stated and had me wondering if someone else was going to check in while we were there. Unsettling.
It seemed I only got automated responses but when I messaged the host didn’t hear back."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Justin is a great host! This is a Great location. I recommend staying here!
2023-09-01,4,Stayed a few nights,I absolutely loved this Airbnb. It was perfect! However I did have trouble with the lock and the place wasn’t ready at check in time. Other than that it was super clean and cozy. Thank you!

Not easy to prepare any snacks or sandwiches. It worked well for our needs, and was convenient for the soccer fields"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,easy to get in contact with.Justin was very nice and respectful
2023-07-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Booking with Justin’s team was great! Very friendly and gave us a warm welcome. A few hiccups overall. We asked for early check in if possible, and they said they would let us know when it was clean. That didn’t happen. I messaged when we were an hour out like requested so they knew we were ready and to give us the all clear. Didn’t get a response, but no big issue.
The place itself was cute! Perfect size for two for the weekend. The pictures didn’t match the listing exactly, and those extra medicine cabinet things in the photo don’t exist. We brought all our own, so again no big issue. They AC seemed to work the first day as it was cool on there. It got warmer and we notice the AC air wasn’t blowing. Tried to turn it off and on again but nothing. The freezer was also very iced over and hard to put things in there. Mattress protector had stains on it when we stripped the sheets. Overall it was cute and issues were addressed by support."

Justin definitely was extremely helpful and kind as well as understanding. The place was beautiful , like a mini house. Everything was so clean. Best airbnb I been at so far.

2022-10-01,5,Stayed one night,⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Excellent little bedroom/bathroom suite. The bathroom is up two short stairs, which wasn't a problem for us. There's a microwave, mini fridge, and Keurig. The tavern that's a 5 minute walk down the road has excellent food. The floor in the suite is tiled, so you may want slippers or some other indoor footwear if you're someone who gets up at night. The keypad can be difficult to use during the day as you can't really see the backlight that indicates that the pad is ""woken up"" - It does beep once it is woken up, but it's rather soft.
While here, If you're driving, either in a rental car or your own car, I would recommend primarily accessing the driveway from the side street one house down from the drive. There is access directly onto the main road from the driveway, but the access on the side street is what I preferred. The main road can get busy at times."
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is such a great space; clean, with great attention to detail, and parking was right outside. I use airbnb a lot and this is the best place and host I've experienced so far! Although we did not frequent any of the areas dining since we spent most our time in Elon; there is plenty to choose from! Looking forward to going back!"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Everything was perfect about our stay. Very clean. The bed was comfortable. The location was ideal for us. We loved having the Keurig available in the morning. We would definitely stay here again.
2022-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"Beautiful, clean and comfortable stay. Spacious, too! Microwave and mini-fridge a plus. It’s in a “convenient to everything” location. Would definitely stay here again if in Greensboro."
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"ABSOLUTELY an amazing place to stay!!
It is in a nice, quite and safe area that is close to everything.
The place was nicely decorated with comfortable accommodations. We never slept as good as we did here compared to other Airbnbs and hotels. We will definitely stay here again.
And with all this, this host was the best and made the whole experience seamless. Such a great experience all around!!!"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"Very nice and clean place.
I enjoyed my stay here.
They had multiple snacks for you to enjoy!"

Justin was great at communication as far as the check in process. We had the pleasure of meeting him in person. He's such a super laid back chill guy! We would HIGHLY recommend this Airbnb, and can't wait to stay again!!"
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Clean and cozy property! We enjoyed our stay and our hosts were accommodating and welcoming.
2022-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"Fantastic suite-decor was appropriate, guest is totally in control of room temperature, big windows but also blackout curtains. So many little extras were provided-it’s obvious the host has attention to detail. Loved parking right next to the door! I have problems with my knees and the tub is fairly low so getting in and out was easy. The towels provided were better than hotel quality. The location is at the back of the house which helps with noise and there are cameras so I felt safe. The only problem I had was the code given to me to unlock the door didn’t work. Luckily the lady who cleans was still there and was able to let me in and give me the code. I will definitely go back when I’m in Greensboro again. Thank you so much, Justin!"
2022-09-01,5,Stayed one night,Great spot and hosts. Easy peezy!

2022-09-01,2,Stayed a few nights,Location seemed nice and rural. I was really looking forward to using the hiking trail. I couldn’t stay because of bugs and an overpowering floral scent. Justin worked with me as much as he could so I will give him credit for that.
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place was great! It was perfect for what I needed while traveling for work. Clean, spacious for an in law suite, comfortable, safe.

2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Perfect stay and getaway!
This guest home or ""mother's quarters"" is perfect for a quick stay or getaway. Equipped with mini fridge and coffee cart, kicking back and watching the smart TV will help you relax and unwind while you are there. Easy 2-way access right off residential street, this cobblestone drive leads to cozy quarters. Did I mention how comfortable the Queen sized bed is? You'll be sound asleep after a bite to eat.

2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"It’s always a pleasure to stay at one of Justin’s properties. Very clean, decorated so cute and full of charm. There are always wonderful extras to make your stay better cups, forks, plates etc. We will stay again when we return to NC!"
2022-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"This was a wonderful place to stay. It was clean, comfortable, and very accommodating. We would definitely stay again!"
2022-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Everything is how it said it was, if not better. Thank you Justin and partners!"
2022-06-01,5,Stayed one night,We had an excellent stay at this Airbnb and it was just as advertised. Conveniently located and great communication with the host. Highly recommend.
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Comfortable, roomy, clean room with necessities like coffee maker and mini fridge and microwave. Close to shops and fast food and grocery store. Very quiet with lots of light or window shades. Has two steps up to bathroom. Recommend this."
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great location. Justin also left tips for restaurants and other highlights. Easy to reach when I had questions.
2022-06-01,4,Stayed one night,"Nice space for a short stay. Very clean room and bathroom. Snacks were stocked and a book of recommendations was helpful to find places to explore in the area.
The only pitfall is there is little to no soundproofing and we could hear every word the occupants in the adjoining space were saying. Luckily they weren't loud or obnoxious, just something to be aware of while booking- in case you want a little more privacy."
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My entire stay had been a pleasant experience. The room was clean and I think it looks even better and more spacious than in the description. On top of all that, the price is very affordable. Justin and Sydnie are the nicest people and present when you need something. Highly recommended!"
2022-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Lovely space, very comfortable and cozy. It was a great spot for my boyfriend and I to crash for a night while traveling across the state. We would definitely stay again!"
2022-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"this airbnb was exactly as described and so cute! the host definitely took steps to make the experience smooth and comfortable. no contact check it, easy parking, small snack basket, coffee, and extra supplies in the bathroom. bed was comfortable and the room felt very private even though it was attached to a home. located in a nice area and close to town. would definitely recommend and stay here again if i’m the area!"
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"everything was as advertised. Quiet, private and convenient to many restaurants and parks."
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Definitely a beautiful and very relaxing place to stay. I will probably return in the future, thank you so very much Justin and partner."
2022-05-01,5,Stayed one night,This was a perfect place for us to stay while doing some furniture shopping. It was a great place in a cute neighborhood. Everything was very clean and exactly how it is pictured.
2022-05-01,5,Stayed one night,As described. Would stay again! Thank you.
2022-05-01,4,Stayed one night,Spacious and comfortable. Justin was very responsive.
2022-05-01,5,Stayed over a week,"Great place for me to visit home for a few days! Perfect location, close to most everything. Quiet area but not secluded.
The space inside was very comfortable. The bed & shower are amazing! Coffee area perfect, wish the fridge was a bit bigger (for left overs). Great tv selection. Justin communicated very well. I thought price was very reasonable.
I would definitely stay here again!"
2022-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"Justin was a great host, his place certainly meets expectations."
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place and location.
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great cozy spot, very quiet and slightly secluded"
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a great time at Justin's place! The plush in-law suite was private, clean and cozy for a quick getaway for me and my partner. The comfy bed and the air conditioned unit made it hard for us to want to leave the suite to go exploring in Greensboro!
Communicating with Justin was easy and quick! The check-in and check-out process was seamless. Justin's place is in a quiet neighborhood but also easy to access downtown and other popular areas in Greensboro.
My partner and I would definitely recommend staying at Justin's plush, in-law suite to anyone! Thanks for the hospitality, Justin!"
2022-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"We really enjoyed our stay! Although the room is in a shared house, we didn’t hear much noise at all and even had access to a private bathroom and heat/ac unit. Everything was clean and as described, we were happy to find some cups, plates and forks in the room as well."
2022-04-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Incredibly perfect location, everything you need within 10 minutes! Space was clean and exactly what we needed.
I will say, if you are expecting a completely private experience this may not be for you. It appears to be an addition to the main house off of what we can only guess is the kitchen so you do hear quite a bit of movement and sound at times but it wasn’t terrible!"
2022-04-01,5,Stayed one night,Justin's place was clean and in a lovely setting that wasn't far from anything in Greensboro. I would recommend staying here for any couple or individual traveler.
2022-04-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"This is an excellent location to everything, airport, downtown, shopping. Justin's property is beautiful, and in a lovely neighborhood. I did have a few questions when I arrived and got a response right away. The only thing that I was dissatisfied with was the lack of some simple amenities, like silverware, there were plastic knives and forks, no spoons, glasses, there were 2 wine openers, but no wine glass, and one ply toilet paper. The coffee maker also needs to be upgraded. These are small things that make a big difference and make the guest feel cared for."
2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Our stay was great! Good location, quiet area and clean, comfortable room, perfect getaway for a couple"
2022-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"Justin's place is even better than described. Your blown away by the decor and cleanliness from the minute you walk in the door. He has several special touches that really makes air bnb a true experience (I'll let you be surprised)...I have a thing for towels and his was soft, clean and large. He's about a 10 minute drive from the Greensboro coliseum. If I'm back in the area I'll definitely be booking again...no need to keep reading you should be booking before someone steals your date."
2022-04-01,5,Stayed one night,Nice accommodations and great hosting!
2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great location. Right off Bryan blvd
2022-03-01,5,Stayed one night,Just what we needed for a one night stay. Great communication with hosts and would stay here again!
2022-03-01,5,Stayed one night,Clean and comfortable apartment. Justin and Sydney were easy to communicate with. Thank you!
2022-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"My boyfriend and I had an amazing stay. It looked exactly like the pictures and was really clean, spacious and inviting. The bathroom was even really nice and the shower I took was amazing, which is high on my priority list. The bed was very comfortable as well. In addition, it was also close to the Coliseum which is one of the reasons we booked it in the first place. We had no problems getting into the unit with our code. However, when we first arrived we did pass the turn a few times since the address is only on one side of the mailbox. The hosts had everything you could possibly need. And Justin responded in at least 2 hours to our question. This was a really great home away from home. We don’t regret it at all. We would definitely come back again. Thanks again Justin."
2022-03-01,5,Stayed one night,An excellent stay!!
2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Clean, cute, and comfy!"
2022-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"Over all my entire experience with Justin’s place has been the best experience in Airbnb.
From then minute I walked in I felt at home, from the coffee, snacks, communication and location! It is exactly as listed. Definitely want to use his other places or even this same one the next time I’m in town."
2022-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great location in Greensboro. Would stay here again, everything was as expected and comfortable."
2022-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We loved staying here! The location was central to everything we wanted to do in Greensboro, and the mattress was incredibly comfortable. The only thing we would have appreciated is a luggage rack; however, our stay was seamless otherwise. Check in was easy, parking was ideal, and the room was incredibly well-kept. We will be staying here again!"
2022-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I travel for work and this is my second time renting from Justin and Sydney! Each time they are super easy to work with and accommodate my needs. This particular rental is only separated from main house by a door. if you're the type that wants your own space uninterrupted this might not be the spot for you. The positive though, they live on site so if you need anything he's right there. I, personally would not stay here again, but still would 100% recommend it for others."
2022-02-01,2,Stayed one night,"The walls are very thin. I could clearly hear normal talking volumes and especially when their daughter got highly upset after 10pm, that was especially off-putting. I can't remember how many times I heard toddler screams and parents counting to 2.. I honestly didn't feel comfortable taking phone calls because there was no privacy. Then after all that, getting a message at 1am that I needed to make sure to vacate by 11am (waking me up after keeping) added insult to injury. I traveled nearly four hours straight from work and wanted to rest to be ready for an early morning wedding. Definitely not what I was expecting from the ad."
2022-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Amazing place!! Host always made sure we had everything in check and kept us informed, overall great experience would highly recommend this host!!!!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We really enjoyed our stay! This home is even nicer than the pictures show. It is architecturally charming and tastefully furnished. The owners were very responsive and provided great recommendations for restaurants, breweries, grocery shopping etc… We were in the area for a college graduation and are hoping that we will find a reason to be in the area again so that we can book another reservation!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed over a week,Devin’s place is truly outstanding. This is where we always want to stay in Greensboro!!
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Very clean! Bath linens were very nice, even had black wash cloths for makeup."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Was a great stay for our weekend at High Point Market. Comfy beds, blankets, lots of items in kitchen. Wish we had more time to relax in the adorable backyard with a grill."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,This was our second stay at Devin's house and it was just as wonderful the second time! My family (4 year old and 1.5 year old) loved playing in the backyard and with the toys provided inside. The location was great for visiting family nearby and we even went for a long walk in Old Irving to see the lovely houses by the golf course. Thank you so much!
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Such a wonderful house, and a very convenient location of Greensboro. Mostly impressed with the little details throughout the house. I would highly recommend!"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed about a week,"We are return guests and will be again—great house, great location, great hosts."
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Thanks Devin! We’ll be back!
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was simply the cutest & coziest lil place, we felt so at home. The large, comfy sofa was a great place to kick back in front of the fireplace & watch movies. The mattresses & pillows were great! we had such a solid, good night's sleep on them. The house was clean, organized, user friendly & very conveniently located. The hosts were just as wonderful as the place itself. If we ever return to the area, we would definitely stay there again."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed about a week,We had a wonderful Christmas holiday visiting our family. It was a great location close to our family and friends. The home was very cozy and well organized for guest.We needed to stay an extra day last minute and they went out of their way to help out. I rent quite a few Airbnb’s and this was tops!!!!
2023-12-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Lovely home, great location! Beautiful renovation! Highly recommend!"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I had a great stay at Devin’s place. It’s a beautiful house in a nice part of town, convenient to everything! Would definitely recommend to a friend and would stay again myself."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Devins place was the beautiful decorated, very clean, and had all the things we needed for our stay. The house is located in a beautiful neighborhood and was close to lots of restaurants and stores! We’d definitely stay again if we’re in the area."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,What a lovely house in a great location. The beds were very comfortable and we especially loved the walkable neighborhood. We will be back!
2023-11-01,5,Stayed about a week,I travel for work weekly and have stayed in multiple AirBNB's and this is by far my FAVORITE of all! It was the homiest place. They had all the amenities you could think of and more. The best kitchen with the best cooking supplies (and spices galore!). The design of the house overall was just beautiful and was stylish yet homey. Wish I could stay here forever!
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful home that is immaculate, well stocked, and very organized. I didn’t get to enjoy the outdoor spaces, but they look welcoming and inviting. I can’t say enough good things about this house - it’s not often that an AirBnB feels like home, but this house felt that way. Highly, highly recommend!!!!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Devin and Jessie’s home in Greensboro was perfect in every way! It’s in a great, safe location and the home was impeccable. What we especially appreciated was their attention to every detail that makes a stay comfortable; no detail was overlooked. They were immediately responsive and we couldn’t have been more comfortable. What a gem! Thank you Devin and Jessie for a wonderful stay!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Devin was very fast when it came to communicating. They made sure our stay was as comfortable as possible! Great home! I would highly recommend and hope to stay there again when I’m back in town
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This was our second stay here. We loved it again. We will stay again for sure.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This was by far the best airbnb I've stayed at! The home was well stocked with high-quality amenities. The home is beautifully decorated, and the backyard is an oasis."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Love this place and can’t wait to return. It was perfect and Devin was excellent with communication.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,We loved everything about this sweet home. Our girls adored the toys and taking walks around the beautiful neighborhood. We loved the attention to detail and rich character of the home. Thank you for going above and beyond. Our favorite air bnb to date. Thank you!!
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Devins home is beautiful and I enjoyed my stay there. I also appreciated the EV charger.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The space was very clean and in a great location with lots to do close by (science center, Greensboro Grasshoppers, terrific restaurant options, etc.). Devin has the house generously stocked with travel essentials and more (our daughter was very appreciative of the toy bin in her bedroom).
Would definitely stay again. A+"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed over a week,I think this is our 4th or 5th visit to Devin's place. We feel so at home there.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"As a native of this area, I was particularly impressed with the tasteful décor and layout. These vintage homes have special amenities, i.e., breakfast area, porches, nooks and more. Just delightful. Attention to detail was obvious. Well thought out with everything a guest could need and more. The modern appliances beautifully complimented an updated kitchen. The location is perfect, the old Greensboro’s architecture is still intact, and the colonial flavor is strong. Devin was available, very polite, and professional. Plan to use this gem if available, really special."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Thanks, Devin! My wife and I enjoyed staying at your beautiful home. We’ll be back for sure."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Devin thought of everything. There were toys and plastic tableware for my toddlers, everything was easily labeled. Coziest couch and beautiful decor. Loved staying here and will definitely come back when we’re next in town."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great! You can’t go wrong with this booking.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Devin’s home was perfect for our weekend stay. It was extremely clean and well designed. The house had any and all amenities a guest could need. The sunroom was our favorite place to drink morning coffee! I highly recommended this home!

2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Very nice accommodations, was located in a great area and not far from shops and restaurants. Downtown is only a couple of minutes away. The house was very comfortable and neat."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This is probably one of the best air bnb’s I have stayed at since starting my Travel Nursing journey. The home was in a great neighborhood where I felt safe and my nanny and children felt safe. There was plenty of space for us and even a phenomenal kids room that allowed the kids to play in their own space and stay occupied. We enjoyed the space in the backyard and sprinkler , that made for a nice time cooling down after playing outside . There was even all kinds of toiletries, chargers, and other essentials . The host were very thoughtful and have a beautiful home. I would love to stay here again. They even had sparkling waters in the fridge for us!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,Another great stay at Devin’s Greensboro charmer. This will be my go to place for work travel!

2023-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,We slept wonderfully here! It is quiet at night and the kids felt comfortable and happy. The kitchen is set with everything you need. We made happy memories as a family. And we were able to easily drive to grocery stores and tourists sites. Do yourself a favor and book this place!
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very clean and beautiful house that is close to lots of restaurants and shopping. Would recommend when staying in Greensboro!
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My sister and I really enjoyed our stay! Such a beautiful old house filled with top of the line appliances,towels,sheets…etc. It has been done so tastefully….and the vintage furniture rocks! Spring was all around us…trees blooming, birds chirping. Heavenly"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The house was just the right size for what we needed over the weekend and the location couldn’t be beat!
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I had a wonderful stay at Devin's charming cottage. It is well maintained and located centrally to great restaurants. Irving Park is a safe and beautiful neighborhood with sidewalks great for walking. Devin was very accommodating and was extremely responsive to correct a check in blip. I will be booking with them again and would highly recommend Devin's place if you are travelling to Greensboro!
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"In the end I wasn’t able to go on this trip, but my experience communicating with Devin was great. My partner and kid, who did go, had only good things to say about the house. They especially loved the outdoor space and grill! Thank you, Devin!"

2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful house in a very nice neighborhood. Close to everything but, far enough away to feel safe and comfortable. If you like to take walks you will love the beautiful old mansion’s just a few blocks away. We also walked to some nice restaurants on Battleground Ave. We will definitely be back and stay much longer next time."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We had a wonderful stay in this lovely home. The house was exactly as described/seen in photos. The neighborhood was beautiful and such a perfect place to walk/run and spend time outside. Everything about the stay was great-- Devin was super responsive to every question we had and even let us check in a bit early when our flights changed. We would definitely love to come back again!
2023-03-01,5,Stayed about a week,This home is just lovely. Has everything we need and more. The hosts are super responsive and gracious.

Devin and Jesse were always quick to respond and very friendly to requests or questions.
I drive a Tesla and they have an EV charger which was extremely convenient.
Our daughter is at UNCG and we regularly come to Greensboro to visit, I'm certain we will be reusing this location regularly."
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This little house is so cute, comfortable and in a lovely neighborhood! Although on a main street there are sidewalks and the neighborhood is great to walk/run. The kitchen was well stocked with nice, new appliances and cooking items. Tableware for 8. One small bathroom, but very nicely updated and plush towels. Linens and beds were good too! Three large tv’s(no cable). Devin really is a Superhost and was always promptly responsive to any request! We were there over Thanksgiving and he sent a lovely floral centerpiece for the table!! Too cool to sit outside, but the backyard is very nice and private…a quiet family neighborhood. Would definitely stay here again!"
2022-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,We are Greensboro natives and thoroughly enjoyed our stay! We are a family of 4 with 2 small kids and the set up of the home and ideal location was exactly what we were looking for! The furnishings and linens were exceptionally comfortable! Will definitely be back!

Devin communicated with me in a timely and friendly manner and addressed any questions I had above and beyond my expectations. All of the cleaning products, appliances, linens, bedding, rugs, everything I can think of are of high quality (and products were non-toxic, which is especially important to me). The home is located in a safe and beautiful area, and access to food, shopping, etc. are within a 2-5 min drive from the home. The backyard is beautiful, quiet, and a lovely space to enjoy any meal, coffee, or wine to start or end the day. Nice outdoor lighting for front and back areas as well. Devin definitely takes pride in owning this home and being an AirBnB host, and it shows. Will definitely be returning when work brings me back to town!"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Loved staying here for my weekend trip. Everything was as described and both hosts were super communicable! Love it! Will be back!

2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"If you want to be welcomed in like family, Dassi is the host for you! If you want to be anonymous, I would recommend looking for a different spot. My bedroom was clean, comfortable, and roomy with everything you might ever need. Dassi provides snacks and drinks, and there is a whole wall of games! The common areas are the family living room and dining room. The garden is beautiful, and the house is close to everything in Greensboro."

2024-02-01,4,Stayed one night,"The overall stay was great and the hosts were friendly and welcoming. I would absolutely return.
The only two cons I can think of are thin walls, which limit privacy, and a lack of up-front clarity about bringing in food."

The most outstanding part though, is Dassi and another guest helped me escape the next morning, as we received a couple of inches of snow and my car was slightly iced in, and I was trying to make it to an event in another state. I slept very well. The bed and climate was comfortable, the room and house very cozy and immaculately clean. I got in a little later in the evening, and Dassi offered to feed me, and had lots of snacks and drinks available. I couldn't have asked for a better place to stay in the situation that I was in.

2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I would absolutely recommend Dassis Airbnb. My week long stay was a working one. Dassi took such good care of me, it made it that much easier & less stressful. I didn’t have to think about meals, or try to finagle doors with codes. She was always there. I felt safe & secure. The house has a beautiful energy that truly feeds the soul. I slept soundly in my room, had snacks, & hot or cold drinks available at the snack bar. All amenities were covered, I wanted for absolutely nothing. I had a vegan breakfast each morning, & had asked for a packed lunch each day. You can order an evening meal as well. Whatever I had was healthy & fresh & never disappointed.
My room & bathroom were spotless.
I am staying again for my next work trip, & the one after that as I cannot imagine any other place being as cozy, inviting or as comfy as Dassis place."

Just enjoy her delicious breakfast and snacks, super clean and beautiful house. You will have a safe parking lot there. She herself is super kind and you’ll enjoy talking with her. This host is 5 out of 5"
2021-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"Dassi is such a wonderful host. I felt at home right away. I felt like a princess, Dassi served my pressed coffee and was prepared to fix my breakfast with plenty of options. When I told her I wanted only coffee, she prepared a “pancake with peanut butter sandwich” to go. Now my favorite snack! Dassi was so kind and listened as I shared my concern over my family member in the hospital, the reason for my trip. Would definitely stay here again. All I can say is the world needs more Dassis’!"

2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Dassi's place is a great value. Her and her husband are very welcoming and friendly and available to assist you.

It is an easy 10 minute drive to downtown Greensboro, so the location is very convenient as well."

2020-08-01,5,Stayed one night,Highly recommend this cute bed & breakfast. Dassi was a great host! She had a snack bar & coffee/tea bar available and also offered to cook me breakfast as soon as I walked through the door. I’m a night shift travel nurse so I really appreciated that she was willing to adjust the check in & out times to give me enough time to recharge before my next shift. The favorite part of my stay was being able to sit on the back deck & drink tea in the morning. Will definitely be returning for future stays!
