I highly recommend her place for work or pleasure"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We LOVED this home! New home, spacious, well appointed. It was beautiful inside and out, near town but hidden away in a quiet development. Screened in back deck was amazing. We were attending a COM conference from North Carolina at the fairgrounds, yet saw deer, squirrels, raccoons, and a ton of birds. Tea, coffee, and water awaited our arrival. We stayed a week, even walked to town one day. We have had several Airbnb stays, and few 5’s but this is one. Confidently recommend."

2024-04-01,5.0,Group trip,We are a family of 8 adults. We have had two children attend Hillsdale College. It is an easy drive and a very lovely place. Wish we would have found it years ago! Well worth it!
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Wow. A beautiful home, excellently equipped. I stay in a log of Airbnbs, and I don't believe I have ever seen a kitchen this well equipped.
The historic (1900 or so?) home is in excellent condition, recently renovated in many details. It was perfect for our family gathering including married children and grandchildren.
An 8 minute drive to Hillsdale college."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We enjoyed our stay very much. The house was very beautiful and very comfortable. We will definitely use Phoebe again.
2024-02-01,5.0,Group trip,This is a great place and they so have everything you need and have thought of the little things that made it feel like home. They supply little things that are big things like water in every room coffee cream some snacks and other things. We loved it and stayed because of a funeral and the house and what was in it made it all better.
2024-02-01,5.0,Group trip,"We selfishly want to keep this gem in Jonesville a secret! Phoebe went above and beyond to accommodate us while visiting for a family funeral. The house is pristine and loved the old house feel. The house is beautifully decorated and the beds are very comfortable. Phoebe has thought about and provided everything you might need. The only minor issue is the first bathroom is right off the kitchen and not close to upstairs bath. But the 2nd bath is upstairs by the 4 bedrooms. The kitchen is beautiful and has everything you might need, including coffee pods, spices, oil and vinegar, etc. The house is only a little over a block from downtown Jonesville and close to the bakery, restaurants and park. We thoroughly enjoyed our 4 nights and look forward to coming back!"
2024-01-01,5.0,Group trip,"we had a great time staying with Phoebe. The house was exactly like the photos very charming. Took a tour at the Grovonor Home, which is just up the road from this location. Would definitely stay here again"

2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"This is a beautiful and comfortable place to stay in the small, historic town of Jonesville. Lots of thoughtful amenities provided by our hosts! Well stocked, comfy beds, spacious and elegant, with all the modern conveniences. We enjoyed walking the safe, quiet neighborhood with interesting old homes and buildings. Very short commute to Hillsdale College and a lovely, easy drive to Ann Arbor. (Fellow coffee snobs, Rough Draft by HC campus has you covered, less than 10 min away, we stopped there repeatedly.) We were very impressed to wake up after a good snow fall to find an excellent young man clearing the driveway and sidewalks first thing in the morning! Perfect house, neighborhood, and hosts; highly recommend, and we felt it was a great value."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"It was nothing short of a privilege to stay at the Wetmore house. Located walking distance from downtown,
this place was such a delight. The care and time that was put to restore this historic home is so evident. From the exquisitely chosen furniture to the hand painted art on the wall, this home was restored with such love. Every need you could possibly have is already anticipated — kitchen stocked with coffee, teas, and creamers; a welcome wine and snack basket; the washer complete with stain removers and sprays; bathrooms with extra toiletries; baby crib and accessories; and a large box of box of board games. The home easily and comfortably fits 8, complete with the most comfortable beds. The neighborhood is quaint and quiet and the backyard offers a great setup for evenings on the patio, should you visit in the summer. Phoebe was prompt to respond to every request and went above and beyond to make our stay absolutely wonderful. I could not recommend the Wetmore house more."
2023-11-01,5.0,Group trip,We absolutely loved our stay. It was the perfect house to accommodate everyone and the area was so peaceful. The house is beautiful and perfectly furnished with everything to make you feel at home. A true hidden treasure in Jonesville!
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Phoebe's place is big! And lovely. Lots of old-time charm coupled with modern convenience. Equipped with a large dining-room table; quality appliances; plenty of kitchen counter space, cabinet shelving, cooking gear & utensils. The four large upstairs bedrooms each have a luggage rack, hangers, dresser drawers, extra linens, and a mirror. Mattresses and pillows are very comfortable. Tub shower upstairs; stall shower downstairs. Good water pressure. Ten minute drive to Hillsdale College campus. Parking is secure. Owner is friendly and responsive. She solved a problem we had very quickly. Overall, a wonderful stay and would come again!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Phoebe's house was great, the entire place was just as described. They left a wine bottle, and snacks on the table, as well as water's in the bedrooms.

2024-06-01,5.0,Group trip,"Firefly was a great location for a long weekend family getaway. Everything you could possibly think of was provided by the host for our use. The kids enjoyed the kayaks and paddle boards, spending several hours exploring the area. We had fires at night to cook smores and then relaxed in the enclosed porch. The surrounding homes were close, but it was quiet and the one neighbor we met was very friendly. I have no complaints and would stay there again. This is probably one of my top stays due to all of the amenities provided."

2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This was a wonderful place to spend Spring Parents Weekend to visit our son. The view from the living room over the lake was peaceful and refreshing. The neighborhood was very private and felt safe. The home was supplied with so many thoughtful items that made our stay a breeze. Check in and check out were easy, and the commute over to the College and to everything we needed in town was a snap. Scott was a kind and proactive host, and he made sure we had everything we needed before we even thought to ask. We hope to stay again in the future!"

2023-05-01,5.0,Group trip,The Firefly Cottage was a perfect place for family memories to be made. The house is light and open with lots of comfortable gathering spots.

2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We’re so thankful for the foresight of the owner’s installing a generator. There was a winter store, and the electricity went off in the area, however we were very well cared for without any interruptions to electricity."

Fluffy towels, soft blankets, a kitchen filled with everything you need. Great selection of games, ping pong (adults loved this just as much as the kids!)
The lakefront is beautiful. So much fun with the kayaks exploring the lake, floating on inflatables, watching the swans and cranes. S’mores by the fire, watching the sunsets. The community was very friendly; great for walks and scooter/bike rides. (To the little store for popsicles)
Scott was an excellent host. Checked in with us to make sure all was well. Very responsive.
I could go on and on….just book it! You’ll be so glad you did."
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Our family had a great time! The lake was great for swimming, floating, fishing & boating.

Also the laundry room was a huge plus. Great place to relax & we would love to stay again!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The pictures don't do the place justice. The backyard was wonderful and really huge. We saw deer, lots of birds, some sandhill cranes and fishing jumping in the lake. It was so quiet (except for the wildlife noises) and private. The indoors were way bigger than they looked or were described and had lots of interesting architecture. Laura and Eric were SUPER helpful and very responsive. There is a nice little trail that leads right on to campus if you are there for an event. Great place."

Not only was the property exactly as the photos and descriptions listed, but the hosts had thought of every detail necessary, down to plastic baggies or spare hangers. It’s conveniently located between downtown Hillsdale and Hillsdale College, and on a quiet street. Plenty of parking! Most importantly, the hosts, Elizabeth and Russell, go well above and beyond to offer flexibility and hospitality to their guests. We visited town to be with a family member who was passing, and they went out of their way to make sure our every need was well taken care of. Could not recommend more highly!"

2024-06-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,"The home is great - very cute, nicely decorated, well-appointed amenities, etc.. The lake is just a short jaunt away and the neighborhood seemed friendly. We enjoyed a night at the fire ring with local friends and meeting the owners.
We really only had 1 issue specific to me only and it doesn't affect my rating of the home as it's so specific.
The specific issue I personally had is that the home is not furnished well for tall folks. I am 6'3"" which will be far above most folks' need to accommodate so this isn't at all a knock on the owners or the home, just a heads up for any other tall people that might be looking. The couches have short cushions and they are very narrow so I wasn't able to get comfortable there for movie, and the beds are relatively short as well. I ONLY put this in my review as to hopefully help anyone else long in the leg. It's a great spot!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Wonderful hosts! The cabin was equipped with everything you could possibly need. Their communication was above and beyond, alerting us to an internet outage, and even inviting us to a community ice cream social. I would recommend the cabin to anyone looking for a quiet getaway. Can't wait to stay again. Thank you!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"A very quiet, peaceful alternative to the Hillsdale Hotels."

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Had a great stay at the Bear's Den! Jamie was extremely polite, with great communication and helpful tips.

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The Bear’s Den was a great place for us to stay while visiting our family in Michigan. Accommodations were superb and all we needed was at our fingertips! Thanks so much!
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Good place. I was there for work so served my needs great. It is a couple blocks off the water. A quiet neighborhood. Thanks for the stay.
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"As usual (this is our third time here), Akrum and Jamie have provided an excellent, relaxing, clean, peaceful, cottage for us to stay in.

2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Nice Place
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Very clean and well stocked. Enjoyed the large deck. And loved that it allowed us to bring our dog.
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This is my second stay at the Bears Den. The TA quite and has plenty of space as I travelled with my twin boys who are 22 months old. They have available a crib and pack and play. The kids can play on the porch and have plenty of room inside as well. The owners are fabulous and are very responsive.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Just stayed for a couple nights, was a great relaxing getaway! Loved the dock, we swam and enjoyed the sunset. Brought our dog with and she loved it as well. Nothing bad to say!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Jamie and Akrum's place was nice and as described. Our hosts were supportive and excellent communicator. The lake was picturesque. Hillsdale and the other local communities were interesting and we may visit again in the future.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"This summer my kids requested a “do nothing” vacation which really meant they wanted to have unscheduled days to swim and play. The Bear’s Den was exactly that!
The cottage is clean and tidy. Everything we needed was available to us. We cooked/ate in most days, were easily able to do laundry as needed and were comfortable as a family of 5 at all times.
The location of the cottage is quiet and peaceful. The neighbors that were “home” while we visited were friendly and helpful. I felt comfortable allowing my kids (13, 11 and 8) to come and go as they pleased from the cottage down to the dock. They enjoyed swimming and floating at the dock, taking the kayaks around to explore and trying their hand at fishing for the first time.
Jamie and Akrum were on property the weekend we arrived and we’re so helpful in making coffee shop and restaurant recommendations, helped get us situated with the kayaks and gave us a thorough run down on the lake, how to get to Pike Lake, etc."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"The place was very quiet, cozy, and well decorated. Hosts were very friendly, responsive, and provided some great local recommendations. I would definitely stay here again."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We stayed here with our 3yr-old and 1yr-old for a week in the heat of summer, and it was delightful. The air conditioning worked extremely well (which we deeply appreciated), the kitchen was well-equipped (the electric griddle was fantastic--the kids LOVED having pancakes in the morning), there was plenty of pantry and fridge space for our groceries, and Jamie & Akrum even went out of their way to provide us with a high chair and a crib (let alone a few delicious ice cream sandwiches as an extra treat)! We didn't go out boating or anything, but the kids really enjoyed dipping their toes in the lake.
Worth noting: the house was so well sound-proofed that 4th-of-July fireworks and loud music blasting from next door late into the night didn't disturb the kids' (or our own) sleep in the slightest.
Jamie & Arkum were friendly, generous, kind, and responsive throughout our stay, and the price was an absolute steal for the space, let alone the lake at sunset and the fireflies. Just magic."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Jamie's place felt right at home! It was clean and comfortable and as described in the listing. We enjoyed taking our kayaks to the boat launch and floating by the dock. All of the neighbors were hospitable and made us feel right at home. We would come back in a heartbeat.
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Good place to stay. Will be back again, Jamie is a great host, communication is top notch on needs and wants."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"The lake was beautiful, wonderfully suited for our family. We had a great stay at Bear Lake."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,What we needed for a place to stay out of town for work. Not very modern but everything worked great made for an effortless stay at a small lakeside cottage. Would recommend for the price of everything else around
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very nice home. Updated and comfortable.
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Myself and my boyfriend had a great time using this place to stay for a week near Hillsdale, MI for a competition. The place actually looks bigger in person than in photos and the air conditioning in both bedrooms helped keep the house cool during the day. Highly recommend and I will definitely be booking here for future stays when needed!"

2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"What a cute place!!!
Organized, clean, and had all we were looking for plus more. Jamie/ Akrum had little extras set out everywhere to make our stay comfortable. They had coffee pods, microwave popcorn, oatmeal, cold waters in the fridge, as well as phone chargers in the bedrooms and living room. None of those things were listed on the site. I don’t come up this way much, and I will definitely recommend it to those who do!
Thank you again."
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"What a great time at the Den! Very well put together clean place with unique space saving items throughout. Made the place seem bigger than it was. Did not get to enjoy the lake, yet I walked down the dock to watch the sunset… it was simply breathtaking.
Had great detailed communications with Jamie to make our stay all the more enjoyable. Will definitely book again."
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great cottage mixing the old and the new!
Soooo very clean and comfortable just as shown in pics! Jamie and Akrum were great to work with! Highly recommend it!"
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,This is a great quiet place on the lake and the cottage has been remodeled and has everything you might need for a short or long stay. We stayed for two weeks and it was just perfect. While we didn’t partake in the lake their is lake access. We traveled with twins under a year old or I would have been in the water straight away. The internet was great as well if you need to work or bing watch some streaming videos or tv. The hosts are very responsive and happy to help. Would stay again.
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Very nice! Very clean and updated with all the extras that you need-air conditioning , big screen tv, charging stations, comfortable beds. Our hosts were very accessible with any questions. Would definitely go back!"

2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"You will definitely feel right at home here! Very comfortable and clean! Susan has done an excellent job with every detail. Coffee, tea and snacks are provided along with a generous amount of linens and kitchenware. Susan is very welcoming as well as accommodating. The house is very spacious and beds comfortable. Looking forward to staying here again in the future. It was truly home away from home."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Best air bnb in hillsdale!
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We loved our stay here. Susan was incredibly hospitable. This was the most beautiful Air B&B we have ever stayed at. We traveled all the way from Idaho to bring our oldest son to Hillsdale for his freshman year. I knew it would be an especially difficult weekend, so I found a place that seemed like it would be peaceful and comfortable. This home, and Susan as a host, far exceeded what we hoped for."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Elegant and immaculate but not fussy. Lovely, comfortable place to stay. Friendly, helpful, responsive host."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My husband and I rented Susan’s lovely home to stay locally for our daughter’s wedding. Upon arrival, the home was even more beautiful and meticulous in person. Susan has a keen eye for detail and every guest amenity has been considered.
Susan had separate coffee and tea stations (and fresh cream) for those of us needing a caffeine boost in the morning. The kitchen has every appliance, serving dish and kitchen tool needed to prepare gourmet meals. I was even able to host Sunday brunch with all the beautiful entertainer touches. Bedrooms and bathrooms are appointed with luxurious linens and stylish furnishings. We slept like babies in the midst of our hectic schedule.
After the wedding festivities wound down, my husband and I enjoyed a relaxing afternoon on the comfortable front porch recapping the weekend with a cocktail, watching the deer bed down in the nearby trees as the warm summer rain began.
We couldn’t have asked for a more perfect home or Host for the wedding weekend!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Susan was an amazing host with great communication even prior to arrival. The place was amazing and the bridal party loved the space and meeting Susan.
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Susan is a wonderful host! We greatly enjoyed our stay in Hillsdale, this was our second time staying at this house and we will definitely be back.

2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful “Hallmark” home. Felt like our home away from home. Host was helpful and went above and beyond to make our stay perfect. She even had it decorated with a tree for Christmas. Loved it!
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The house is even better in person. The beds are comfortable, the kitchen is amazing, the location is great for visiting Hillsdale college, but the best thing about Arbor View is Sue. She is a wonderful hostess and she really cares and wants her guests to have a wonderful visit. We can't wait to come visit again."
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at Susan's beautifully appointed house and look forward to returning. Susan herself is a expert host, professional and very welcoming. The site could not be better, with a quiet peaceful street in front and views of a deep forest glen behind, with deer traversing the trails below in the morning and evening light. All within a few blocks of downtown Hillsdale in one direction and the college in the other."
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This house is a sparkling gem! So beautiful, and conveniently located near town and college. Best of all, Susan is a super host in every way!"

2024-05-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,"The place was new and clean! It did feel a little sterile and empty though, it echoed a little when talking. It wasn’t the best stay we’ve had, but it wasn’t the worst either. Probably a little pricey with the high cleaning fee. Overall it was an okay stay."
2024-04-01,4.0,Stayed one night,A lot of space and brand new. Very modern.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very nice condo. We really enjoyed our time.
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Check-in through the garage code was super simple. We’d definitely stay again! The garage could fit two cars easily, which made it possible for us to load/unload out of the weather. The space is clean and clutter-free with a cozy remote-controlled fireplace. The big windows and sliding glass door let in nice light in the living room. This unit is in a quiet cul-de-sac, so very little traffic. There was a good bit of streetlight coming into the master at night, so bring an eye mask if you’re sensitive to that. It was a comfortable, affordable stay! If we’re back in the area, we’ll book again."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This new condo is beautiful, comfy, clean, & spacious. All modern appliances. The town has all amenities. We had a wonderful stay!"

2024-01-01,5.0,Group trip,Very easy to get in and get in touch with our host!
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"A lovely apartment in downtown Hillsdale. Step out the door and take a right for coffee shop or take a left for diner. Nice place to be for visiting or exploring downtown. Everything was in wonderful condition, and there were lots of extra added bits of hospitality!! Thank you!"
2024-01-01,5.0,Group trip,"This is the second time I’ve stayed here and loved it, it is cozy, clean, and in a great location"

2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I was SO pleased with my stay! The property was beautiful, comfortable, and instantly felt like home. The furniture and beds were comfortable. The kitchen had EVERYTHING you could need. Even the towels in the bathroom were thick and quality. It was so wonderful to wake up and walk 2 minutes to get coffee. Thank you for creating such a beautiful space in Hillsdale! I can’t wait to return in the spring!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a great last minute stay. It was nice to be in downtown Hillsdale for easy walking access to several restaurants. The apartment has awesome high ceilings and is nicely decorated. It would be nice to have a 2nd full bath, but we made it work. Would absolutely stay here again."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"This was our second stay at Jackie's place. We were in town for our son's move-in to Hillsdale College, and this location was very close-by. The two-story apartment is sunny and spacious and has comfy beds. Every bedroom has a closet with a hanging rod and hangers. Two of the bedrooms also have a luggage rack and two even have chests of drawers. And one has a desk and chair, where my husband was able to work remotely. My adult daughter appreciated the secluded nook at the front end of the living room, which she used as a makeshift home-office with a window view. The kitchen also has lots of cupboard space for storing food and cooking equipment. Jackie is very friendly and responsive. We look forward to staying again."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Perfect, quick stay - thanks Jackie!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Jackie was very nice and helpful. Thank you.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place will definitely return!!
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is such a nice apartment - I wish I had known about it when I was in college at Hillsdale! Jackie was super helpful and responsive. The beds are super comfortable and everything was clean!
The stairs are very steep so if you have any accessibility concerns, all bedrooms are on the top floor and you have to climb stairs to get to the apartment. May not be suitable for individuals that cannot handle a lot of stairs.
I loved this place and if I visit hillsdale again I hope to stay here!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Such a great place! Jackie was a wonderful host and the location was perfect!
2023-07-01,5.0,Group trip,"The apartment is huge and spotless. Sweetly decorated but not cluttered…very easy to keep track of what was ours and what was already there. Little extension cords made it so easy to plug things in anywhere. I’m always cold, so all the extra blankets (wonderful, soft and cuddly ones) were perfect. There was no shortage of towels (thank you!!) or toilet paper. We were within walking distance of everything we needed and all the locations for events around our son’s wedding. Jackie quickly responded to all my questions and requests (including sharing the Amazon link for an appliance she loaned me that I loved). The entire process was easy and I felt at home. The three bedrooms are spaced out enough for solid privacy. It was a lovely experience all the way around. I was a little sad leaving the ‘dale this morning. Thank you!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Group trip,"Great location. Most places we wanted to get to were less than a 10 minute drive. We had 6 people and lots of activities to prepare for, so the quiet time nook was a great place to escape to if you needed to be alone to study or contemplate. Plenty of light with high ceilings - takes away the cramped feeling you might have at other places. There are three stories of stairs to contend with, but that was evident from the description. Figured we would get some needed unintentional exercise. Saved money by eating in after shopping at the nearby supermarket, but the are several restaurants available within walking distance if you prefer otherwise. Tastefully decorated."
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Being a parents of a Hillsdale student, this was a great place to stay. It allowed us ready access to the campus, and it was very clean and accessible. It being an older building the stairs heading up to the second floor bedrooms were a little tricky but that’s understandable. Others had written about that and we were prepared and didn’t feel uncomfortable with that at all."
2023-02-01,5.0,Group trip,Lovely location and entry!
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Very clean, convenient location, and amazing host! Will definitely be back."
2023-01-01,5.0,Group trip,Great stay. Close to where we needed
2023-01-01,5.0,Group trip,"The loft is a wonderful place to stay. Full kitchen and amenities. Comfortable and spacious living area on the second floor. The entire third floor dedicated to bedrooms and full bath. This made our trip to Hillsdale so much better that it would have been. Thank you, Jackie!"
2022-11-01,5.0,Group trip,"Excellent location right in town, close to shopping and the college. Extremely clean!
Very spacious for our five travelers."
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Jackie's place is beautiful and so much bigger than we expected! The beds are comfy, and it's so nice to have three separate bedrooms. The back bedroom is separated from the rest and feels especially private. It was also handy to have a powder room (toilet & sink) downstairs in addition to the full bathroom (shower, no tub) upstairs. There are many hooks for hanging things in the bedrooms and bathrooms plus full-rod closets in each bedroom. Towels are also plentiful. Everything was clean. And the apartment was quiet, in spite of being atop a business on a main street in the center of town. It's also just a few minutes' drive from the College and from the local chain grocery store (Kroger).
Some guests might like to know that the street parking, while close and convenient to the door, is all parallel, not angled head-in, but also that on the back (non-entrance) side of the building there is a big, well-lit parking lot with plenty of available spaces and it can be seen from the kitchen and back-bedroom windows. Others may appreciate a heads-up that the stairwell that goes to the third floor, where all of the bedrooms are, can be a little difficult to maneuver since the steps are of uneven depths.

2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Absolutely loved our stay! We loved how welcoming, clean, and overall charming the place was. The decor was adorable and the small chocolates that were left was the first thing our eyes honed onto after a 12 hour drive from Connecticut to Michigan. The informational pamphlet/book about the surrounding local activities and favorite restaurants was a great idea and helped us so we didn’t get lost in the area. Overall, we really enjoyed our stay and will be telling friends as well as coming back when we are back in the area again!"

It is a lakeside property although you cannot view the lake from the apartment, the windows are large & bright with curtains for privacy. The place is tiny with an adorable retro kitchen, private bedroom and well appointed bedding and sitting area. Ronda & Steve were perfect hosts in every way. In the morning, I received a text from Ronda to let me know there were a number of swans on the lake in front of their house and if I wanted to take a look I could. We appreciated the pound of starbucks coffee left by the coffee maker! Would definitely stay here again!"

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was such a nice place. SO well stocked with lots of pots, pans, bowls, plates, glasses, etc also had a nice selection of spices, tea, coffee and creamers. The beds and pillows were so comfortable as was the sectional. Mindi was incredibly easy to work with and left lots of local recommendations and directions on how to use appliances. Very clean and well decorated. The back yard led down to the river and we saw deer in the yard. The weather wasn't great to be outside, but there is outdoor lawn furniture and a grill. One of the nicest Airbnbs that we've stayed in."
2024-04-01,5.0,Group trip,We really enjoyed our stay! The house is very cute and really fit what we needed it for.

2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Love staying at Mindi's because it's very convenient to the college campus! It's also very modern, comfortable, and private. This time (our third) we especially appreciated the several small touches, such as nightstands having post-its and pens as well as lighted digital alarm clocks with dimmable displays, bins and shelves for clothing storage along with many hangers in the closets (including clip hangers for pants & skirts!), lots of towel hooks in both bathrooms plus a hairdryer in each, plastic wrap and aluminum foil provided in the kitchen... On top of that there is an abundance of counter space, dishes & pans, cooking utensils, and paper products (paper towels, napkins, tissues, & toilet paper)! It has also been helpful every time to have the separate/private work space on the weatherized back porch. Great place!"
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Our oldest child is a sophomore at Hillsdale, and because we live in Florida, we hadn't yet visited her - but the choices of where our family could stay was one factor that inhibited our visiting... until now! Discovering Mindi's place was such a gift for our family! The 6 of us were able to stay so comfortably in Mindi's BEAUTIFULLY remodeled home with its gorgeous, well-equipped kitchen, which allowed us to have a great visit with our daughter and even host some of her friends for dinner! what a gift!! Thanks, Mindi!!!"

Only a couple of short blocks from the college, the home offered a very convenient opportunity for us to be close. The home has been beautifully remodeled and offers lots of charm. We're happy to know it's an available option for possible future visits. Mindi was a great host as well. Kind, responsive, clear with instructions, and very helpful!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Group trip,"Mindi's place was even better than described. Very clean, plenty of room, unique house. Would definitely stay again. Super responsive host. No complaints."

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Pictures matched exactly how the house was. Mindi thought of every nice little touch to make you feel at home. Nicely decorated, the fans in the bedroom were great since i like to have some fan noise! The house was super clean. I would for sure stay again!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very well equipped and comfortable. We very much enjoyed our stay.
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Our second great stay at Mindi's! It was already an amazing place when it was relatively new, so we were surprised to see how many improvements she'd found to make in the year or so since then. It's obvious that she is proactive and detail-oriented regarding guests' needs and comfort. She even provides free-and-clear (hypoallergenic) laundry supplies, which is a blessing to folks like us who are sensitive to chemical additives! Mindi was also immediately responsive and dedicated to quickly resolving a problem that came up during our stay. Highly recommend Mindi's place--just please don't beat us to booking it! ;-)"
2023-09-01,5.0,Group trip,"Beautiful newly remodeled house in Hillsdale and the nicest Airbnb I've ever stayed in. Everything is new, modern, and well-designed as the perfect house to host 6 people. This house is also ideally located between downtown and Hillsdale campus where you can easily walk anywhere. Can't wait to stay here again on my next visit!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Mindi’s place was probably one of the best AirBnb’s that I’ve stayed in. It was better than expected. It was the little things that meant a lot. A lot of places I’ve stayed tend to have left over or worn out furniture and furnishings. Not Mindi’s, it was clean and there were lots of extra touches. I’d stay here anytime I’m in town. We didn’t have to contact her bc we didn’t have any problems but she had a friendly welcome and good bye! Great place!!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Mindi was super communicative and her place is a great place to stay in Hillsdale!

2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This was our second time staying in Mindi's home. She again, did not disappoint. Her home is clean and centrally located within Hillsdale. The restaurants and grocery stores are close. Hillsdale College is only a few minutes away, walking or driving. Every time we sent Mindi a message, she responded almost immediately. The cleanliness of Mindi's home as well as the organization in her home, makes you feel welcome, right at home. The wifi and the use of her washer and dryer are very important to our family, we appreciate both of these. Thanks Mindi for another great stay!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Group trip,"It was me, my wife, my bother & sis-in-law, and my 85 year mother, visiting Hillsdale for a family reunion. The pictures were great and all, but this place was even better in person. Whoever did this remodel must’ve been a perfectionist. She also keeps this home well stocked, clean, and accommodating. If we ever find ourselves in Hillsdale again, we will most definitely be reaching out to Mindi."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Good place to stay happy to come back for another week
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Wow! Mindi's home was amazing. You can tell as soon as you walk in the door, that this home has been well loved and cared for. Everything was just as the listing explained. The pictures on the listing actually matched the home. The decor/design of the house is bright and fun with little surprises in every room. Mindi was so easy to communicate with. We already booked another stay with Mindi as the house is perfect for our three teenagers and young daughter. The space is so well laid out that the teens can each have their own space for their video game competitions.
Thank you for a wonderful stay, Mindi, and for sharing your home with us."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great place to stay. Updated and unique. Would be happy to come back.
Next to rail road tracks no trains but could hear some cars riding over tracks at night"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Great home, loved having a pack&play provided!
Very cozy, and roku available in every room if you need to catch up on shows.
Walking distance to all of downtown Hillsdale.
Be sure to check out Hillsdale Brewing Company a block away. They have a HUGE (indoor) beer garden in the back with toys and games for kids.
For breakfast, try Rough Draft, right next to Hillsdale Brewing. They do beautiful drinks, and have a GREAT charcuterie board that's surprisingly cheap.
There's a creek at the end of the yard, which our kids enjoyed putting sticks in, and they even saw their first live crayfish!
Really enjoyed our stay. Provided guidebook made everything clear, and Mindi even sent a YouTube video for starting the dishwasher before we needed to use it. Very proactive!
Thanks for hosting us!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Everything was great
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Mindi was great we look forward to coming back again and again
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Mindi was VERY responsive and helpful throughout our stay. She even bought a high chair and provided a PacknPlay for our grand daughter. Her thoughtful touches make the home super comfortable and easy. Beds are great and everything is VERY clean. The location makes most things walkable - restaurants, Hillsdale College, groceries, coffee shops, downtown shopping, a walking path in the woods. It's lovely! I've stayed once in snowy winter and once in hot summer and both were comfortable. Highly recommend."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was our second stay and Mindi’s gem is our go-to when in Hillsdale. It’s adorable, well appointed, convenient, and charming. What more could anyone ask for! Book it!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,The House was super clean and organized with all the amenities available. Loved every room in this house very well thought out and felt cozy.

2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Awesome home to stay at while you visit your students at Hillsdale college. I would Highly recommend it for “parents weekend” and any other event such as graduation. 10 min walk to the college and one minute drive. Lovely home with comfortable beds.
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Minding has been the best host we have had so far with Airbnb. Her communication is above and beyond as is her rental. We drove all night for a family emergency to find our accommodations elsewhere didn't exist. After being awake 32hrs and needing somewhere to stay Mindi was able to accommodate us with an early check in and was very understanding to our situation. The house was stocked with anything we could have needed if not shopping was close by. Mindi checked in on us when the weather turned bad and the tornado sirens went off in town to make sure we would know where to go. It was comforting that we weren't alone. We will 100% stay here again the next time we are in town. There are train tracks that run next to the house but do not worry about those the trains don't use those that we had seen and from what some locals had told us. Perfect host and house!!!
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"A great place to stay in Hillsdale! Mindi was so helpful: one member of our group accidentally left some clothes behind, and Mindi promptly followed up and mailed them home at no extra cost. A kind and generous host!"

2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Amazing place I would stay at again! It was such a nice and beautiful place. Very organized. She even had suggestions on her book on where to go eat, where to shop, etc. it was so nice to be able to use the washer and dryer. Clean and comfortable place!!!"
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Mindi's place was wonderful. Recently renovated, it was clean, comfortable, and wonderfully furnished. One of our party's guest left an item behind and Mindi contacted us within a very short time of our departure to inform us about the item and asked for an address to ship it to us. We appreciated her kindness and highly recommend her home to anyone visiting Hillsdale."
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Mindi was great. Appreciated her prompt responses and good communication throughout the stay. Will be back!

2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Everything was as advertised and very cozy. The house was full of thoughtful little touches. We look forward to saying again the next time we are in town.
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Very thankful could get the rental the same day as requested as we had a last minute need. The house was very clean and well kept. For our need, the location was great being close to the college. For mid-week rental, the price was very good. Mindi was great in communicating and even let us know when she planned to shovel the snow at the house. Would definitely stay again."
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Absolutely perfect stay. CLEAN and perfectly described. Felt like a home away from home including the little details of extra fancy soaps, lotions and pillows. Newer appliances and squeaky clean everything. Note the house is a few feet away from railroad tracks but no trains came at night and it wasn’t an issue. Will stay again!"
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Mindi’s place is wonderful, perfectly clean, and well-appointed!"

2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This sweet gem is so well done. Tastefully decorated and thoughtfully stocked, Mindi has thought of and supplied every detail and beyond. She’s clearly put her heart and soul into this little cottage and we, traveling as a mother and daughter, were perfectly comfortable and felt safe."
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Wonderful stay! Great Location! Comfortable and welcoming!
2022-07-01,5.0,Group trip,Everything was perfect! Thanks for making our stay special
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"The first thing I noticed upon opening the door to Mindi's place is that it still has that lovely smell of new wood. The house definitely is all new inside, very crisp and clean feeling, very modern. It is obvious that Mindi put much care into the design, layout, and furnishings during the remodel--terrific attention to detail. The mattresses are super comfy, the rooms are abundantly lit, the appliances are top-notch, and the kitchen is well equipped. Mindi's place also offers much privacy with frosted window panes in many key spots, a wooden panel fence on the only side that has a neighbor, and a secluded back yard. We enjoyed eating dinner outside on the patio and even saw deer come up from the creek at the back of the property. Pulling into or out of the driveway can be a little bit tricky, but it's not at all a busy street, and so many things in town (including the college campus) are delightfully walkable from this location anyway. It's situated right along railroad tracks, which we were concerned might pose a safety or noise issue, but by the end, we had to admit we were disappointed that not a single train went by during our 8-day stay. I highly recommend Mindi's place!"
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Everything was great! Thanks!
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This house is newly renovated. It’s so clean and beautiful. Bedrooms are very comfortable and spacious. Kitchen is very fully stacked and spacious. Perfect for a family getaway.

2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,this house is a very beautiful and comfortable place to stay. The location worked very well for us because our grandson was graduating from Hillsdale College. if you are looking for a place in Hillsdale I would highly recommend it.

2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Perfectly sparking clean, newly remodeled and super comfortable home just a 10 minute walk from Hillsdale College. Mindi was an attentive, considerate and discreet host, available as needed (she offered to shovel snow for me, and did so, several times, even brushing off my snowy car) but always checking in first.
We were able to walk easily to everything, including restaurants, grocery, shopping and college seminars. Highly recommend this place!"

The home is within walking distance to Hillsdale College as well as Old Downtown. We would highly recommend it and would definitely stay again!"
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Lovely place, all brand new, super comfortable sleep. Great location to walk to Hillsdale College (10 minutes max) and downtown."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Emilie and the gang greeted us as soon as we pulled in! The animals (gang) were the stars of the stay. The apartment that we stayed in was clean and warming. For us being an hour and some change away from home we felt like we didn’t leave at all! The farmers market was another awesome treat that sweetened the weekend for us on our stay! Emilie and her daughter have a booth there with all kinds of vegetables and different breads and tasty jams to go with. I would recommend this for anyone who wants to unplug from reality and step into the country for a weekend. Being able to see and help with her daily life was a true treat! I would definitely stay again and again.
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We have visited Emilie's place both in Fall and Spring. Each time, it has been a beautiful location and a feast for the senses--the rural woodland sights of trees and wildlife, the sounds of sandhill cranes and Canadian geese honking along a myriad of song birds, the smell of wildflowers and apple mint, the taste of Emilie's sourdough bread and delicious breakfasts! Truly a place of respite (particularly for this desert city dweller!!)"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"As always, staying with Emilie was a delight! Bluebird Trails is a beautiful and peaceful place, and we had a wonderful time seeing the newborn lamb and her friendly dogs and cats! Breakfast was, as always, a treat! We will definitely be staying with her again in the future!"
2024-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was our second stay with Emilie. It was just as wonderful as the first. Great accommodations, breakfast and Emilie could not be more friendly or accommodating. Plus we got to see a baby lamb less than a day old!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We had a quick stay, unfortunately, but we hope to come back again to enjoy Emilie's farm. It is a great place to relax and unwind, take a walk, and pet some kitties, dogs, and sheep.
We ran over our estimated arrival time and Emilie was very understanding. We felt right at home. The beds were very comfortable and it was so peaceful to be able to sleep in listening to the rain and birds outside in the morning."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Amazing apartment. She was very clear with her instructions and everything was clean and ready when we got there.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Every time we have needed to come to Hillsdale over the last 4 years, we always check Emilie's listings first because they are always the best! This time was no different. It's close to the college, but also far enough away that you are in a quiet, serene, peaceful place. She is a phenomenal host with everything you could need, and she makes the BEST breakfast. We loved seeing the sheep and loving on the dogs. If you have the chance to stay here, do it. You will not regret it."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This was by far the best air bnb that I have stayed at. Emilie was a wonderful host!

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We loved staying at Emilie’s bed and breakfast. When we got there, Emilie showed us around the priority and recommended a nice walk through the surrounding forest. Emilie gave us whatever we needed to make sure we enjoyed our stay. Turbo the Cat was a joy to be around as well. Thank you for the amazing omelettes you made us in the morning as well :)"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Emilie’s place was very welcoming and comfortable in a peaceful setting. We had a delicious breakfast!
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We have stayed here numerous times. We love it for our growing little family! Wonderful breakfasts made fresh and delivered each morning, beautiful surroundings, and the kids enjoy the cats and dogs that live on the farm. As always, Emilie is a great host. We will book again when we are in the area to visit family. :)"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Emilie was very kind, very helpful and breakfast was always so good and on time.
Emilie allowed me to move the sheep with her! We got to know each other a bit and it was nice. I know Emilie takes great care over this prooerty.
The property is absolutely beautiful and there's so much peace. The animals were all friendly and greeted us too!
It's the perfect get away, we WILL be back.
Emilie is the hostess with the mostess!
I would gladly pay more to stay bc peace of mind is absolutely priceless.
Thank you Emilie! I've already shared about Bluebird B & B with many friends!!"
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Emilie was a wonderful and accommodating host. The place was ready early & immaculate. Her communication was thoughtful and quick.

We will definitely stay with her again!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Absolutely lovely. Great place to turn off your phone and just decompress. Emilie is a wonderful host. Breakfast was amazing. Love the animals!

2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful farm, very comfortable. Emilie is a friendly and responsive host. Her omelets were great! We’ll definitely be back!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We loved Emilie's Bed and Breakfast. Comfortable and clean inside especially the bed, slept like a log. Out on the deck enjoying coffee in the morning with a diversity of trees watching the birds. Everything from Sandhill Cranes and Turkey Vultures to Gold finches and Bluejays. Even spied the B&Bs namesake Bluebird. Friendly kitties and dogs come to say hello. Gray and white cat hung out with us in the morning snoozing in the chair next to us.
Breakfast brought to us in the morning was absolutely delicious. Really just a perfect way to start our day. We were discussing coming back as we were driving away. A top notch farm stay run by a top notch host."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The apartment was great and well equipped. There was a Keurig with coffee pods, sugar/sweetener, creamer and tea. These items are sometimes missing at other Bed & Breakfasts. We really appreciated not having to go to the store to buy these.
Emilie is a perfect hostess. We enjoyed hearing about the sheep and the farm. Breakfast was always delicious - omelettes, quiche, sourdough bread, blueberry muffins. Everything homemade with fresh ingredients.
Hillsdale is a small college town about 15 minutes away and the farm is quiet, which was perfect. Hillsdale isn't a ""tourist"" area but still had plenty of things to do. We enjoyed walking around the Children's Garden and the Aboretum at Hillsdale College. We also drove down to Baw Beese Lake. There is fishing, boating, swimming, and great views. If you are there on a weekend during the summer, you can check out the Farmer's Market in town.
We highly recommend a stay at Bluebird Trails."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The place is absolutely wonderful!! If you need a peaceful, quiet place to stay, this is it. Emilie was very nice and welcoming. The homemade breakfast, each morning, was delicious! My wife thoroughly enjoyed the opportunities to work with the sheep."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We come to this area to visit family a couple times a year. We have stayed with Emilie the last few times. We will continue to do so. It’s comfortable, the kids love the farm atmosphere, it’s quiet, and the beds are extremely comfortable. Not only that, but she brings the most wonderful breakfast each morning! It’s the perfect home away from home."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Emilie’s place is a favourite. We always feel at home. A perfect stop on the way through Michigan.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,This area is beautiful! We wanted a farm stay and it’s what we got. We rode out with our host to see the goats. The dogs are so friendly. We felt welcome and at home. The place is quiet with a wonderful view of the area out all the windows. We will stay here again. Breakfast is fantastic as well.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Always a pleasure to stay at Emilie’s. Such a peaceful spot. A favourite for our summer vacation trip.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,perfect. I got some fish and free them.
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Emilie responded to our family with sincere respect. We had limited time together and a wedding to enjoy as priorities. She certainly delivered as advertised.
The peaceful setting and comphy beds made for 2 good nights of sleep. We especially enjoyed watching birds from the balcony deck by day, and listening to bullfrogs while watching fireflies late into the evening.
We missed walking with the sheep, but could hear them. Having dogs on the farm made us feel safe from any intruders. Loved the remote setting!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We had a lovely time at Emilie’s place! Our family love the animals, the food and the experience. The pond was peaceful.

Her farm baked goods are amazing too!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This was our third time staying at Emilie’s B&B. When we (family of 3) travel to Michigan to see my grandmother in a nearby town, we plan our visits around availability here; we simply don’t want to stay anywhere else!
The space is comfortable, very clean, and feels like a home to us. Emily is super responsive and kind. She always makes a delicious breakfast for us to start each day, taking care to accommodate our various dietary needs. It is so nice to start each day with a home cooked meal!
Emilie has been a B&B host for many years, and it shows. Highly recommend!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We thought the communication between the owner and us was excellent and check-in was a breeze. Everything was extremely clean and tidy and well stocked with coffee and amenities even in the shower.

2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We enjoyed our stay and it was what we expected. My boys enjoyed the farm and the property. Emilie was happy to show them around to meet the animals. The fresh breakfasts were delish. Thank you Emilie!

We felt like we bonded with the sheep and Emilie. We will miss our new friends and started looking forward to returning again the moment we pulled out of the driveway. My kids didn’t want to leave and I felt the same! Knowing that such a beautiful place and amazing person like Emilie is only 15 minutes away is such a happy thought!"
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Emilie's quiet, clean, and cozy apartment with its view of the rolling countryside was the perfect getaway from our busy life - if only for one night.

We can't wait to visit Emilie again when we come see our daughter at Hillsdale College."
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We stayed with our two young kids. We loved the farm experience. My daughter was enamored with the cats that hung out on our deck begging for snuggles. There were even cute sheep books on the shelf that my kids loved reading. Emilie had a bowl of some farm fresh honeycrisp apples on the table. They were SO GOOD! So many nice, homey touches that made it such a fun night away. Emilie is a great host and it was so interesting to learn about the sheep farm."
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Emilie's farm b&b is beyond words! Emilie herself was kind, attentive, and caring. Her second floor 2-bed, 1-bath was as described, with comfortable and thoughtful finishes. The kitchen in particular is well equipped and spacious. There's a semi-private deck for use by guests as well, which looks over her backyard, gardens, and pond. The breakfast was delicious, and watching Emilie and her dogs shepherd the sheep was amazing! The woods and pasture on her farm are amazing to just walk through and enjoy. Cannot wait to visit again."

2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"An incredible place and host. The apartment was very private, clean, spacious, and relaxing. The farm is stunning. I felt like I could spend forever here. Emilie (the host) is the best host I've had experience with on Airbnb. She brought us breakfast every morning, let us explore her beautiful farm, and let us play with her beautiful animals. And speaking of the animals... Oh. My. God. They are incredibly friendly and beautiful. We would be greeted in the morning by them coming up the porch! If you love animals, you're at the right place!"

If you are looking for a peaceful getaway surrounded by nature, this is the perfect place. The breakfasts were to die for, not to mention the fantastic homemade bread. The Airbnb was clean, cute, and cozy and the photos don’t do it justice. We had fun looking through the collection of DVD’s and kicking back and enjoying some good movies and popcorn in the evening. Emilie is truly the best host, and we would definitely stay here again."
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great stay at this lovely farmhouse with abundant nature on a quiet lane.

She also has a nice selection of movies, games and even a few toys for kids.
The farm is gorgeous, very peaceful, quiet and there's lots of space for walking.
The location was very convenient for going into town for Hillsdale College events (~15 min drive).
Emilie's space provided our family with a lovely retreat while attending college commencement.
I also recommend checking out the fresh farm goods that Emilie sells as well! Delicious raw honey, eggs, bread and other items."

Wake up in the morning sit on the deck and just reset!!"
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Fantastic place and fantastic host.
Easy to find authentic farm atmosphere. Very good breakfast mad with local ingredients as well."
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,This was our second time to visit there. We spent amazing moment with Emilie and her animals. We'll absolutely be back again!!
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"If you're looking for a quite place to relax and love nature, this is the place!"
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"What a lovely find. This B&B is very near a trailhead for the North Country Trail, which is why I chose it. Peaceful and quiet, thoughtfully designed apartment complete with kitchen and rainy-day activities like media and board games, good roads that would be passable by sedan, and delicious cooked breakfasts. I will definitely return if I am coming this way again. Do take Emilie up on the offer to see the farm, it's well worth the time!"
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"It was our second time staying here. We had a great time and got to watch the baby sheep feeding with their mothers :) The weather was freezing cold during the weekend so we couldn’t stay outside much, but we still enjoyed our time watching movies 🍿"
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Delicious breakfast, comfortable beds. Emilie's communication was clear, prompt, and accurate."
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had such a nice, peaceful, relaxing weekend on Emilie’s farm. It felt like we were in our own cozy little treehouse with a view of the snow, icicles, trees, and chickens.
Emilie was the best host we’ve ever had at an Air B&B, and we hope to return in the summer."
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Emilie is so sweet. Also the place is super nice and extremely comforting. She is very kind and welcoming, and you’re sure to have a very relaxing stay :)"
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful spot! The type of place we would have loved to tour in more depth.
Functional and lovely interior space."
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Wonderful little apartment for a quiet getaway. The accommodations are clean and comfy, and the breakfast provided is fresh and delicious. We had everything we needed for a comfortable stay; the few things we needed were supplied right away by the host. She allowed us to come with her as she fed her sheep and it was great fun to watch. It is a working farm and the dogs do ""talk"" to one another quite a bit. It didn't bother us at all but if you're a very light sleeper you might take note of that."
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,We stayed over a week for the birth of our grand baby and really enjoyed our stay. It is cute and very very clean. The wonderful breakfasts were so delicious and we looked forward to them. There was plenty of room for both us and we were able to work at the table as well. Totally recommend it!
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Amazing! One of my favorite places I’ve stayed. So peaceful and relaxing.
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Emilie was very respectful and the BEST HOST we have had on this platform. Her animals were well trained and watching them work was a great experience. You should buy a loaf of bread from her. It was soooo good! We are definitely coming back to this place!
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was my best Air BnB stay to date! These days AirB has turned into such a business in the US that it’s often the same experience as staying in a hotel. Not so with Emilie! This is the way it used to be before we capitulated to the idea that humans are just here to extract money from - kind, generous human interaction and sharing :).
The unit itself is quite nice, large for two people, clean and well organized. The kitchen is large and stocked not just with cooking ware, but with granola, milk, orange juice, spices and other food.
The out doors are lovely and nature. Many deer, beavers, a Bald Eagle, owl, sheep, dogs, squirrels and much more.
But the real peak is Emilie’s generosity. Homecooked full breakfasts every morning! Awesome sourdough bread and muffins. Any other spices or pots we asked for. Flexibility and kindness :).
Thank you very much my friend."
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Accommodations are exactly as described! she had everything we could have wanted, including some snacks and beverages in the fridge. The beds are very comfortable, so you most definitely get a good night's rest! The breakfasts are amazing, and she brings you more then you can even eat (which is great since it's so yummy, you get leftovers!). Sheep herding is a wonderful experience too! We will check if this available again when we come to visit our family in the future!"
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,If you need peace and quiet- this is your place!
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Delightful in every way. Clean, cozy and everything you need, nothing you don’t. Although, the breakfast was FAR above and beyond- homemade gourmet food, hot and delicious. Do be aware of lots of outside animals… dogs and cats and more, which was especially exciting for the kids. Cannot find a kinder or more generous host than Ms. Emilie- we will return!"
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Emilie's room are so comfortable, and the view from the deck is wonderful! The food is delicious and the location is just a short distance from Hillsdale. We will definitely be staying again when we come to visit!"
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This was our second stay with Emilie. This is a beautiful spot to stay while visiting our boys at Hillsdale College. This morning I listened to the wildlife while drinking my coffee on the back deck. The homemade sourdough bread was amazing! Emilie is quick to respond and makes us feel welcomed and cared for every time we visit.
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place! Loved the food/drinks provided! Clean and quiet stay. Definitely recommend.
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I actually was not able to make my stay at
Emilie’s. However, during the booking process Emilie was quick to respond with excellent communication. Maybe it’s not fair I leave a review since I was unable to make my stay, but what interaction I did, I thought was worth noting! xoxo"
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Had a great stay. We appreciate the little extras and all was well.
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Clean, great place to stay!"
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Emilie’s place is the place to soak up serenity and relax. Her place is so welcoming, and the beds were so comfortable! If you forgot any essentials, Emilie has you covered. Loved all the updates to the space. The temperature in the space was perfect (the mini split really cooled things down during the day), and the cooler night temps didn’t require any additional cooling. Emilie’s sourdough bread is amazing, and it was such a treat to have in the morning with eggs, yogurt and oj. Thank you for being such a gracious host!"
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We love Emilie and her dogs, cats, chickens and sheep! Our daughters had amazing experience with Emilie! Thank you so much! We’ll back!"
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"I can’t recommend this place enough- Emilie was available without being intrusive and she was very generous with her time, allowing us to come along to herd the sheep. The house was very clean and well kept and a perfect size for a small family."
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We came to town for a nascar race (MIS about 40min away) and we had such a lovely stay! Extremely clean place. Very thoughtful host! She stocked the fridge with things like farm fresh eggs, butter, and milk for breakfast as well as made us a delicious homemade bread and gave us some blueberries from her trip to the farmers market. Communication was great as well. She messaged us prior to the trip letting us know when she’d be available for a tour of her farm. We got to meet all of her friendly dogs and watch/learn how the dogs herd the sheep. It was a very peaceful and quaint area. We would definitely stay again."
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We had a great return visit to the farm after an earlier spring stay. It was so fun to see how green all the land and garden had gotten and to see the sheep out to pasture. We definitely lucked out to be able to synch up on with a planned move the sheep day (not always a guarantee!) and the kids and I had such fun watching the dogs at work and helping out. Emilie's hospitality is great - super clean, comfortable accommodations and breakfast is always a treat."
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We thoroughly enjoyed our stay on Emilie's farm. The place is clean and well-appointed. Communication was super easy. We recommend without hesitation.
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"WOW! Emilie is an awesome hostess, and fantastic at communicating. We were supplied with delicious Cherry Pecan Sourdough bread, milk, OJ, farm fresh eggs and yummy breakfast bars. Plus she bring you breakfast! The house is really nice, the beds are so darn comfortable that you want to stay there all day. There is a beautiful view from the deck. Emilie made an extra effort to prepare a bottle for the lambs so that our grandsons could have the experience of feeding them. I highly recommend this place."
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Will be back soon for a longer stay!
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Emilie’s place is one of my top 3 Airbnb experiences and I’ve been using Airbnb since 2012 with many stays across the U.S. Beautiful, peaceful, and comfortable space with the unique experience of being on a sheep farm with a beautiful garden. Bonus experience of farm-fresh eggs and Emilie’s amazing baked goods. We would love to come back some day!"
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Emilie has been an amazing host. Her hospitality was amazing. The place was very clean, comfortable, peaceful and quiet . She made sure that we felt like home during our entire stay. The breakfast is amazing, the blueberry muffins are scrumptious. I do recommend to go along with Emilie and the dogs to herd the sheep, it was a great experience. We are looking forward to go back again."
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,She was so thoughtful and considerate! Highly recommend!
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We have stayed with Emilie twice, and both visits were wonderful. Her place is very clean and super comfortable, stocked with everything we needed for our stay each time. Emilie is warm and friendly; it’s clear she’s been doing this for years and is a superb host. We love that she prepares breakfast each day. On this short visit she made us the best homemade blueberry muffins I have ever had, and a veggie quiche (with fresh eggs from her farm!) that was to die for.
Our young daughter loves watching all the animals out the window each day and visiting with them outside. We live in a big city in Texas, so farm life is a special treat for her.
Highly recommend Emilie’s farm. We will be back next time we’re in Michigan visiting family."
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"What an amazing farm stay! Perfect views, idyllic setting, an amazing breakfast, and we had a great time herding the sheep and playing with the dogs. The space was immaculate and well appointed. I’d love Emilee’s quiche recipe, it was that good. We will definitely be back."
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"My family and I had an amazing stay at Emilie's place. The apartment was comfortable, clean and modern, with a nice-sized deck overlooking the grounds. Emilie made us a delicious hot breakfast and took the time to give us a tour of her sheep farm. She was an incredibly helpful and gracious host. My 5yo daughter loved meeting all of the animals and helping feed the lambs. I don't know if we will ever be in Hillsdale again, but if so, we would love to return!"
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Wow!!!!! Great experience with Emilie. Fantastic home, wonder location and delicious muffins. She thought of everything. We will be back. Thank you Emilie!!!"
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,This is such an amazing place to stay. Emilie goes above and beyond to make you feel at home. I would recommend this to anyone seeking some quiet time in a peaceful atmosphere.
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,I loved my stay! Emilie is an excellent hostess and the apartment we stayed in was very nice. I loved the peace and quiet of being out in the country and I thoroughly enjoyed all the animals. I highly recommend Bluebird Trails!
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"voting five stars because we had such a great time here. the rooms were very clean, comfortable, and the farm was a awesome. Went to herd the sheep and that such a unique experience. the homemade breakfast was delicious. perfect stay. the wifi allows for one device at a timeso bring books, a laptop with movies, or something analog to do if you don't plan on being outdoors."
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This trip we got to feed the baby lambs bottles of milk. Really enjoy seeing the changes over the past year. Thank you for all the thoughtful touches!
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Another fabulous stay at Emilie's. We choose to drive the extra distance to be able to enjoy the serene and beautiful location, Emilie's amazing complimentary cooking and baking for her guests (we even bought several sourdough loaves to take home and freeze), the animals (chickens, ducks, dogs, sheep), and the peace of mind that comes with a sparkling clean Airbnb. We enjoyed visiting the Hillsdale County Farmers' Market (where Emilie and her daughter sell vegetables, bread, maple syrup, and jam on Saturdays, May - November) but mostly just relaxed on site. The heating/cooling unit in the living room did a great job of keeping us cool."
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Outstanding experience. We’ll definitely be back!
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Emilie's place was clean and comfortable. The property is beautiful. She provided fresh eggs and fresh-baked bread. We will stay here again.
2021-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This farm was so charming and our favorite part of our trip. Emilie is a kind and excellent host, the breakfast was such a nice touch and the morning walk to feed the goats was so fun! Great for anyone who loves animals!"
2021-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"What a wonderful place! We loved spending time with the sheep and other animals, and the apartment was very clean and cozy. Breakfast each morning was delicious, and we enjoyed walking around the property. Would love to return, and highly recommend!"
2021-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Emilie was a wonderful and accommodating host. Our stay was very relaxing and we enjoyed the peacefulness of the farm.
2021-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We loved our stay at Emilie’s farm! The accommodations were spotless and had everything we needed for a comfortable stay. Emilie graciously answered our young kids’ (and our) many questions about the farm and let us get hands on in helping feed the baby lambs. She went above and beyond by surprising the kids with an Easter egg hunt in the morning, and we all loved the delicious cinnamon rolls. We hope to return soon."
2021-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"My family spent a wonderful and memorable week here. Emilie is a kind and attentive host and made us feel so welcome. Interacting with the animals on the farm was a highlight, especially witnessing the birth of baby lambs. Our toddler was fascinated with the setting and loved roaming about the expansive land. The apartment itself was spotless and cozy. Hot breakfast delivered to our door daily was a real treat. Highly recommended for travellers looking for an authentic and tranquil farm setting. Thank you, Emilie!"

2021-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Just the right place to unwind, relax & be one with the nature.

Thank you Emilie, we already planned to be back in summer again !"
2021-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,What a lovely spot not to far from the college! The apartment was spotless and charming. The kitchen was stocked with everything we needed and more!

2021-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Wonderful stay! Great place, fun farm experience, amazing hostess!"
2021-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"It was such a wonderful experience for us to stay at Emilie’s place and interact with her animals at the farm. The place was super clean, cozy and cute, with a wonderful panoramic view. Emilie was the best host ever and very responsive - we were so lucky to spend valentines weekend here. We cooked dinner in the kitchen and the next morning she made us hot breakfast (so yummy!)"
2021-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This place never disappoints. We had a great time eating crepes and feeding the sheep.
2021-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,I absolutely loved this bnb and look forward to another trip to the farm.

2021-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"My stay at Emilie's was absolutely wonderful! The inside space is clean, cozy, warm, and inviting. The woods, nature, and animals around the house were beautiful. It was wonderful to learn more about Emilie and chat with her about her animals and farm. She was incredibly accommodating with my dietary needs and made an outstanding breakfast for me. I will definitely be coming back again soon. Thanks, Emilie!"
2021-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The Bluebird Trails BnB is a clean, homey getaway tucked in a very interesting natural spot. Emilie provided us with eggs and homemade bread for our breakfast, in addition to coffee, granola, juice, etc. I wish we could have stayed longer."
2021-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,My friend and I had a wonderful stay at Emilies! Very peaceful and delicious breakfasts. Very glad we came out!
2020-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Very nice home. Will definitely stay there again. Hospitality was unmatched.
2020-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We loved our stay at Emilie's bed and breakfast. It is a unique setting that provides a very peaceful and restful retreat. The animals were fun to watch, and we especially enjoyed the cat! The best part though was the breakfast Emilie provided. Just wow-she is an amazing cook. So delicious! We will be back."
2020-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This is becoming my retreat space. Emily and her cozy touches make it quite comfortable.
2020-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The place is just as described. The kids loved all the animals, and being able to heard some sheep with Emilie was so much fun for them! Very gracious host!"
2020-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This is my second time here and I hope to keep popping in. As always, wonderful space and energy."
2020-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Best Airbnb we've ever stayed in and best host we've ever had (Emilie is super friendly and hospitable but gives you your space). Amazing breakfasts, easy to go on short or long walks in the vicinity, and a dog lover's paradise (currently 7 dogs, including a puppy). The space is small and cozy but more than adequate for a couple. Emilie provides yogurt, butter, milk, and orange juice in the fridge, and olive oil and other pantry items are in the cupboard above the stove. Her breakfasts, delivered contactlessly at the time of your choosing to the table on the deck outside the sliding door to the apartment, are so delicious. She uses eggs from the chickens in the yard. The quiche, crepes, and muffins were terrific. Emilie always responds to messages really quickly.
Tip: download or screenshot your navigation directions before you leave Emilie's (or when you are on your way there) because your map app may not work within several miles of the house."
2020-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Excellent value! Clean and comfy! Better than we had hoped for! Thank you Emilie!!
2020-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Staying here was the perfect situation for visiting my daughter at the college. Emilie's place is clean, lovely, and inviting. And the cherry bread she made us was delicious!"
2020-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Absolute quiet with the sounds of leaves chiming in the wind, sheep baa-ing, ducks and chickens chatting and the occasional dog bark and rooster crow"
2020-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"So happy with our stay. The unit was sparkling clean with so many quiet, but important details. Coffee, night lights in all the right places, extra bedding where we needed it. Everything was intuitive and easy. We were there for parent’s weekend at the local college, so we weren’t able to spend much time exploring the property, but it was beautiful. The sheep, cute dogs, chickens, ponds, fall foliage. Just lovely.
Emilie communicated with us on everything. Her quiche on Sunday morning was amazing... so amazing that my college guy kept the leftovers to share with his dorm bros:)
The only thing to be aware of is that the bathroom is very tiny. Clean and new, but tiny. A bit awkward to share if you aren’t staying with people only within your family unit. Not a flaw, just something to keep in mind if, say, two couples were sharing the space.
No hesitation at all in recommending this property. Quiet, easy sleeping, comfortable beds, lovely extras. Thanks so much!"
2020-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We cannot say enough wonderful words to describe this experience. The breakfast was out of this world. The beds are super comfy. It was extremely clean. We enjoyed watching the dogs herd the sheep. We will definitely be back with our granddaughter so she can experience it. Thank you so much!
2020-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Wonderful experience! Emilie was terrific start to finish helping with anything we needed. That said, all amenities seemed to be within arms reach the moment we needed them. Best muffins of our lives! Going to pasture with sheep, meeting the dogs, walking the grounds... we can't say enough good things about our stay."
2020-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Just dreamy! It’s all you think it will be: complete tranquillity.
2020-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Emilie is a hostess like none other! The apartment was exceptionally clean, thoughtfully designed and pleasant. The breakfast was delightful and the farm itself was a wonderful treat. You can't go wrong with Emilie's peaceful retreat and superior hosting."

2020-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place was above my expectations and was exactly what my mind, body and soul needed to have a little holiday among gardens, animals and a fiercely independent and kind host. I hope to continue to visit!"

2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Emilie's place was amazing. So many thoughtful touches to make the stay comfortable. My son and I enjoyed going along in the morning to meet the sheep and chickens and learn a little about raising them. It was so cool watching the dogs work with the sheep, so well trained, happiest dogs we've ever seen! Wonderful experience , especially for children. Note that if you have t mobile phone service you may not get good reception but not a big deal. If you need internet wifi works well. The bed was Soo comfortable! The breakfast Emilie made each day was absolutely delicious. She went above and beyond to make our experience great. If you're looking for a peaceful get away this is the place. Emilie is overall a thoughtful and hard working host!"
2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We stopped over at Emilie's for a night on our way to MN with our 3 year old and wish we could have stayed even longer! Emilie's place was clean, comfortable and relaxing. It was stocked with linens, coffee and tea, milk, yogurt, and granola. Breakfast was delicious. We even got to tag along with her and her 2 dogs to witness for morning routine with her sheep. My daughter absolutley loved it and did not want to come back. Emilie is a fantastic host and we cannot wait to come back again!"
2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"We had a wonderful week at Emilie's. She took us out to see her flock of sheep and we even got to meet a baby lamb! What more can one ask for? Also, her homemade breads are delicious and Emilie went out of her way to accommodate our dietary needs. In all, we had a rejuvenating time away from the city, and we'd recommend her place in a heartbeat."

2020-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is an outstanding Airbnb. We wish we could stay here all the time, but it’s very popular because of its super-high quality. The homemade breakfasts are outstanding, the setting is gorgeous, Emilie is kind and easy-going with requests, and the apartment is very quiet with lovely amenities."
2020-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The highlights of the stay were listening to the frogs, fresh wildflowers on the table, petting one of the sweet pups, watching the chickens running around in the woods, and sesame raisin bread. A much needed exhale, it was an amazing space, thank you."
2020-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Emilie was an ideal host! Generous, kind, and extremely helpful. Her place is perfect and has all you need, and is surrounded by such beautiful nature. The view from the deck is magnificent. Thanks for a wonderful weekend! We would love to come back."
2020-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"A very well thought out apartment with all home amenities at your fingertips. Large amount of land to wander, with the added thrill of herding sheep with border collies in the morning. Wonderful breakfasts cooked and delivered by the host. Bonus: Enjoy the summer evenings watching the firefly displays all around the property and constellations above."
2020-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Wonderful place to stay and relax. As a solo female traveler it felt super safe. Emily was wonderful offering to make crepes and brought me strawberries when she heard I had a special diet. Definitely a place worth staying.
2020-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was our second stay here while attending weddings in Hillsdale, and we found it perfect for our needs once again. Lovely setting, comfortable accommodations, and thoughtful amenities make this an excellent choice when visiting the area. We would definitely recommend it to others!"
2020-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had an amazing time, and Emilie was amazing. We enjoyed talking with her while she herded the sheep, and we learned a lot. She went above and beyond to help us navigate the area, and she was super generous and flexible. Would love to go back soon, since it’s so close to Detroit."
2020-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We loved our 2 nights at Emilie's farmhouse apartment. Both mornings one of us went with one or more of our kids to feed the chickens and walk with the sheep to the pasture, it was so great to see the sheepdogs at work. The apartment itself is clean and inviting with modern, friendly decor. The ample windows are screened to let in the sounds of the bull frogs and views of the treetops. If that is not your cup of tea, then the mitsibushi ac works great! I do advise bringing DVDsas the host suggests. Thank you for a great trip, we will be back!"
2020-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Excellent AirBn B experience! This location is beautiful and serene. Everything exactly as described. A wonderful respite from my life in the big city! Thank you
2020-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great shower. Nice to hear the farm animal sounds in the morning. Very comfortable beds. We all slept well.
2020-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We've been talking about our wonderful stay at Emilie's place the entire drive home - and it's a long one!
We arrived very late but Emilie's directions were perfect and she had the light on for us. The apartment is so charming and she's maximized the space to provide everything you need. Due to the virus outbreak, she currently can't come up and cook breakfast but she left a full range of ingredients in the fridge for us, AND she hand-delivered a delicious breakfast quiche to us two different mornings!
We especially loved taking long walks on the property to see the ponds, observe the sheep and chickens, and just relax and spend time together. My wife had never been on a farm, so it was pretty special to show her a glimpse of how I grew up.
The highlight of the stay was walking out to the field with Emilie one evening to bring the sheep back to the yard. She answered our many questions and we loved playing with the dogs along the way and seeing them work on the return trip. The mornings were quite dewey, so if you'd rather go out with her then I'd recommend some rain boots. We actually bought some and didn't end up needing them so they're in the hall closet if you forget yours!
Emilie's description of the place is very accurate - WiFi is strong inside the apartment for everyday use, but we did have some problems with streaming. Not a problem for us - we opted instead to sit out on the deck and read. I would recommend bringing some bug spray with you though.
Overall this quiet retreat was exactly what we needed in the midst of this new crazy world. We will definitely be back - and will bring our fishing poles along next time! We highly recommend this place!"

Nestled in trees, surrounded by pastures and small lily pad ponds, the sounds of nature are calming. We were welcomed by a couple friendly dogs and a bottle lamb who loves attention! Our upstairs lodging was very clean and efficient. We had everything we needed at hand to make dinner (couldn’t go out to eat during the COVID), and a delightful breakfast spread. We woke up hearing the farm wake up, lambs, birds and roosters. Loved it."

2020-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Absolutely lovely B&B, convenient parking, beautiful farm land and pastures surrounding the property, comforting touches, sweet animals, overall a very comfortable and pleasant stay!"
2020-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"It was a perfect haven to get away from the weekend. Even before entering the upstairs I could hear the birds singing, squirrels chattering and the sheep calling to each other. The view from the upper deck was picturesque. A large pond with pine and birch trees across the bank looked as though it was a living painting.
There were so many vibrant red Cardinals and Bluejays that gathered in the trees near the home.
After walking in the bedrooms looked so warm and cozy. The room I chose had a little wooden grandfather clock that was quietly ticking.
Much to my surprise and delight there was a welcome not and homemade chocolate chip cookies!
Everything was so clean and inviting.
It was the best getaway I have had in years. The perfect retreat to recharge and explore nature. The trails are so serene to walk and the views are stunning.
Emilie was the best hostess, she went above and beyond to ensure my stay was memorable and her blueberry muffins are out of this world!
She happily welcomed me to join her to observe her and her well trained dogs work with the sheep.
She made me feel so at home that I will definitely be back!"

2020-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Remote, yet very pleasant. We stayed during the Winter. I believe it would be beautiful in the Summer or Autumn."
2019-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"It is a clean and very cutely decorated getaway, so peaceful and beautiful too! Emilie is amazing, really enjoyed our chats, the breakfast is delicious! We also loved seeing the border collies herd the sheep, really cool! It was wonderful -hope to go back!! (If you accept breakfast she will come up and cook for you -was a pleasant surprise)"
2019-11-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"Emilie is nice and an amazing cook! She made us pancakes and quiche (the bacon and onion is killer). She is so friendly and we loved meeting her. The apartment is very comfy and the property beautiful. Two things to be aware of: 1. The internet is satellite so can’t handle much beyond email or social media. I did not know this and had some work to do. I’m a designer and work in large files. What would normally take me 2-3 hours took me all day because nothing would load. I eventually had to have someone back home upload the files for me. Great if you wanna escape, REALLY frustrating if you need to work. 2. The bedrooms are not on the same heating source as the living space. With the bedrooms doors closed, the rooms were very cold. My toddler woke up super early due to this. So we kept his door open to warm it up for him while he slept."
2019-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was a truly amazing weekend away! Emilie cooked us a delicious breakfast each morning!
I let her know in advance that I was REALLY looking forward sitting under the stars in the middle of the country & having a bonfire and she made sure the firepit was set up for us with plenty of woods & twigs; she also stocked a box with papers & matches for us to use to start it.
We absolutely LOVED watching the dogs herd the sheep - it was an amazing thing to see for the first time! The dogs were friendly & liked getting lots of pats while they weren't working.
We also enjoyed taking many hikes around her property."
2019-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Our stay was so great! The place was clean & had everything we needed. Enjoyed our morning coffee with a beautiful view of the property. Emilie is very quick to respond and a fantastic host. The only thing we regret is not taking her up on her breakfast offer!
2019-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Emilie's place was an incredible experience! We got to visit with the sheep and dogs in the morning after a delicious homemade breakfast. Very comfortable beds and sparkling clean!

2019-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"You will not be disappointed with Emilie's place. It's a great place to relax and enjoy the country. Emilie offers a breakfast which is very tasty. Take up on her offer to show you the sheep, and see them being herded by the Border Collies. For us city dwellers, it was a highlight of our trip."
2019-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We loved this place on Emilie’s farm. It was the perfect location and size for my husband, daughter, and me. It is unbelievably clean and comfortable, with thoughtful touches and zero clutter. The space is bright and airy with lots of screened windows (which we left open all night to enjoy the sounds of nature and fresh air).
Emilie treated us to a great time with the sheep and dogs. The views of the countryside while out on the land are breathtakingly beautiful.
Emilie is great—warm, responsive, and kind. She obviously loves what she does.
Our only regret is that we weren’t able to stay longer; we will be back as soon as our travels bring us back to Michigan!"

2019-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Emilie's place is the perfect escape to relaxation. Emilie was very hospitable, and even made hot breakfast during our stay in Hillsdale. It is well located, and easy to get to. The space is very clean, private and comfortable. We hope if we are in Hillsdale again, we will be welcomed back!"
2019-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This stay is a gem! We were looking for a quiet retreat for our family and happened upon Emilie's listing. Her space is a private upstairs apartment attached to her home. It was very clean and well stocked with thoughtful touches. She was available via the app for questions offering us local suggestions and instruction as needed. The lamb farm itself is a magical place with a big old climbing tree right outside the window. At night you are greeted by a beautiful lightshow as thousands of lightening bugs sparkle in the trees. In the morning, Emilie brought up fresh baked blueberry muffins and a quiche. After breakfast, we were treated to a wagon ride to her flock of sheep in the pasture. We were able to interact with the animals (including some darling dogs) and feed the lambs. We were even able to purchase some of the lamb meat she sells! All in all, it was a really amazing experience and we were grateful for the opportunity to spend time away from the city."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Absolutely a great host. This is the second time I’ve stayed at one of their houses. I have nothing but good to say about this.
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,What a wonderful and quaint home. There were 5 adults and an infant and there was plenty of space for everyone. All of the amenities you would need and some. We felt right at home.
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Emilie's cottage was vintage and beautiful. She has done a great job making it current and comfortable. Our family of 6 was able to spread out at night, all having our own beds and space. It's quiet, convenient to Jonesville and Hillsdale, and a good deal as well! We would definitely stay here again!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Group trip,"Emilie was very helpful in all she did. The house was clean, comfortable, and a great deal. We thoroughly enjoy our stay."

,,,It’s ALL ABOUT LOCATION! Host and Hostess were not pleasant to us after it being our 4th one month visit since August 2019. I should’ve reported the HOST and his Rudeness in August 2020 after our July 2020 visit. She never witnesses his insults but laughs in our face or immediately takes his side. I’m sure she doesn’t hear what he says to us! Only what he wants to tell her! We’re DONE!
