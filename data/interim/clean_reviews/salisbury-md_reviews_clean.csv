2023-10-01,4,Stayed a few nights,A fine place to stay right above a great spot for food. Pie shop has moved but worth a visit even if it isn’t right downstairs anymore. Quite a bit of road noise and thin walls meant from adjacent units transmitted easily

2023-08-01,4,Stayed with a pet,"We booked this airbnb due to the location of a much anticipated family reunion. Zina was very quick to respond to our inquiries. The loft was equipped with everything I needed to prep foods for the 'big day'. We experienced a few 'hiccups' which were promptly attended to. Bonus was being able to bring our 11 yr old rescue cat. ❤ Unfortunately, because we were constantly coming and going (with family), we didn't actually meet Zina until a few moments prior to our departure. What a kind and lovely soul! Wish we'd had more time to interact as our conversation flowed. Since we brought our F150, close-up parking was a bit of a challenge however, there is another parking space provided, further from the loft's entrance. Location was in a very nice neighborhood, tucked away, with peaceful surroundings. We will forever remember such a wonderful wknd, long after the calendar pages have turned. Much love and choicest blessings to you, Zina. Thanks again for making your lovely getaway available."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Our stay at Zina's was pleasant. We are in the area quite often and hope to stay there again in the future. Zina was very personable and accommodating. The property was as it was presented in the listing.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We had an incredible time staying at Zina’s place, and if anything the pictures don’t do it justice—it’s even lovelier in person. It was so peaceful and relaxing, just the tonic we needed after a crazy day at the local beaches. We loved watching the evening light fade over the farm from the rear window! But the best part of our stay was Zina herself. She was highly responsive to our every need and inquiry and she made our visit so much better with her local recommendations. We would not hesitate to stay here again or tell our friends to stay here. Thanks Zina!"

From the very beginning while booking—I had questions about bringing my furry friends—and she was quick to respond and made it an easy choice to stay at her place. Finding lodging with two doggies is not always easy! Her place was easy to locate and check in, and squeaky clean and homey when we got there. The loft is adorable and was a really neat little place to stay for a few nights for a friend’s wedding. It’s private and has everything you need. She even had some dog treats in the kitchen ☺️ Zina and her family were so kind and welcoming, and we would definitely stay at her place again if we are in the area!"

2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Zina and her space was amazing!
The space was big enough for me, my partner, and our 60lb Staffy to enjoy our anxious puppy’s birthday/thanksgiving away from a huge holiday crowd.
The loft had just about everything we needed to enjoy our intimate stay.
The bed and the shower were EVERYTHING!
The tv was a little tiny (and we forgot our firestick remote) so we used it mainly for background music — again, perfect for our needs.
We brought our dog’s bed and crate but she preferred the dog bed that was provided, haha. She even enjoyed the doggy treats that were provided!
Zina was sweet enough to bring us some homemade pumpkin pie on thanksgiving! 🥧🧡
We were less than 10 minutes from just about everything: groceries, restaurants, pet stores, you name it!
We would definitely stay here again should the opportunity arise!"

2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I don’t even know where to start! This was one of the best places I’ve ever stayed at, the pictures don’t do it justice with showing how spacious the loft apartment is! Zina was an amazing host, she greeted us from a distance (due to covid) when we arrived and gave us a couple restaurants recommendations as well! The water pressure in the shower was amazing too, if you care about something like that like me.

The AirBnB was about a 45 minute drive from both ocean city/Assateague, and about 30 minutes to another beach the opposite way. Also fairly close to several restaurants (check out Mad Hatter cafe!) Zina was very helpful with suggestions on where to go to the beach. The place was clean and stocked with breakfast items (eggs, fruit, etc), extra blankets, and local brochures and coupon books. Overall Zina made everything super easy and convenient for us. We would definitely stay here again."

2021-07-01,5,Stayed over a week,"Zina is one of those Hosts you hope to find: warm, accommodating and will go out of her way to make sure your stayis comfortable.
The photos of the loft apartment are completely accurate. There is plenty of space for two people comfortably, and having thegarden space outside just adds to the accommodations. Her gardens are full of wonderful surprises, including a giant fig tree next to the loft's porch!
We will definitely check with Zina fist when coming to Salisbury again. and hope to enjoy a fruitful friendship with her from now on."
2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,absolutely loved staying at the loft it was so clean and cute and loved her animals!! Her puppers was an absolute delight greeting us and saying hi whenever we pulled into the drive way and Bella was so lovey and cute. definitely a good place to stay! 😊😊
2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My boyfriend, our dog, and I really enjoyed our stay with Zina. The place was perfect for us. Very clean. I would recommend!"
2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Quiet, comfortable loft with everything you may need. So happy I could stay here with my dog (who was the whole reason we were traveling) and she was welcomed so thoughtfully with a doggy bed to lay on during our trip."
2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Zina was an amazing host and the apartment was super cute and comfortable. She gave us amazing ideas on how to enjoy our trip even with the rain.
2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We don’t travel a lot but we don’t need to in order to be confident that Zina’s loft was by far the best Airbnb we ever have and ever will stay at. The loft above her garage is the cutest studio ever that felt perfectly clean, was well ventilated and fresh thanks to some awesome giant-bladed fans and window A/C unit, and featured a full, miniature kitchen. Despite being an objectively small space, there was absolutely plenty of room for two people to stretch out without clutter. We have no complaints whatsoever.
Zina’s backyard is also incredible with several sectioned and specific areas including a fire pit, greenhouse, cottage-shaped shed, and pool. (We didn’t ask if any of these are available for tenant use - I suspect they aren’t - but it still makes for a beautiful environment to wake up and come home to.)
When we arrived, Zina met me (from a distance!) to make sure I got in okay and, inside, the AC was already running and there was even water ready in the kettle for the tea and coffee she provides.
The large bed is probably too big for the space that it’s in meaning you have to almost squeeze past it to get to the bathroom but who can complain about a big bed?
Overall, we almost asked to extend our stay because we simply didn’t want to leave. If you are looking for a place outside Salisbury for one or two people to relax and feel instantly at home in a place you’ve never been, look no further."

2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Zina’s place was a tranquil home base for explorations of the Eastern Shore. We got to see Assateague before most folks mobbed the beaches because of our proximity and there are great coffee shops and breweries just a few minutes’ drive away. The kitchen in the space was just big enough for breakfasts and informal dinners so we didn’t have to eat out if we didn’t want to.

We came to Salisbury with my 87 year old mother to visit family and friends, and she really enjoyed her stay in the house. The townhouse is in a convenient location on the northeast side of town and easy to get to anywhere in Salisbury in about 10 minutes. The house itself is very homey and accommodating. There was a rather steep flight of stairs but my mother was able to get up and down with no problem. And finally there's Kevin... maybe the most amenable, friendly and accommodating Airbnb host I've ever encountered, and that's saying something because my experience with Airbnb hosts has almost always been very good. Kevin is just the best. We had a few special requests for my mother and Kevin went above and beyond to make it all happen. The next time we come to Salisbury we know where we'll be staying...Kevin's is our new Salisbury home!"

It is a studio layout, so the bedroom / living room / dining room / kitchen is all in 1 place, but the high ceilings make it feel larger. We could clearly hear the other people in the house, it made us feel like we needed to speak lowly so our every word wasn't overheard lol but it wasn't too bothersome. Overall a good stay."

The little touches around the space made it even more enjoyable (including the decor, books, charging stations, WiFi, and even the posted ingredients that are included in the shower toiletries.

2023-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"My husband and I had a true 5-star experience at the Red Maple Studio! We raved about every aspect of our stay from the seamless check-in process to the intentionally detailed/clean living space. The studio truly had EVERYTHING we needed to feel right home including a microwave, washer/dryer, and even shampoo/conditioner/body wash in the shower that smelled amazing! We were so comfortable cozying up in the bed and logging into our Netflix account on the smart tv to resume watching our favorite shows. While we only stayed one night, we know exactly where we plan to stay every time we’re in Delmar. Mike and Max Meegan were such wonderful and personable hosts! We will be recommending this place to all of our friends and family when they’re passing through Delmar! My husband and I look forward to our next stay at the Red Maple Studio :)"

The bathroom was spacious and certainly exceeded our expectations, with full sized washer and dryer and luxury thick towels. We loved the attention to details, decorator folded towels , paper towels and even a bow on the tissues. For longer stays I would suggest a few plates, some silverware and a toaster.
We will certainly recommend to family and friends that visit the area."

The bed is superb comfy and credit earned.
All in all, we had a wonderful memory and stay in Michael’s place. The only thing to mention is, Michael never showed up! 😛I am a people person. But we did a couple of talks over the phone! Happy Mew Year! Would recommend it to all!"

Thank you Dawn and Jannia"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed one night,Perfect and clean residence that came with everything you needed and then some. Hosts were very responsive and helpful from check in to check out. Highly recommended
2024-01-01,3,Stayed a few nights,"Fine. The soap is watered down, toilet paper is less ply than a public bathroom. When I came there was no heat on and it was freezing. There are signs all over to keep the lights off to conserve energy. At checkout guests are required to empty fridge, wash dishes, collect linens, and take out trash. The last one really killed me. Through the stay i was writing things off w/ benefit of the doubt but I’ve never stayed at an Airbnb where I had to takeout trash to checkout. If I’m doing all the above, what am I paying a $50 cleaning fee for? For a load of laundry and to sweep the floor? $2 hand soap is available anytime anywhere, at the point one is watering down soap one should stop and reconsider; it’s not saving anything.
I’m frugal, and I recognize when others are trying to shake someone down for their money. This was that which is wild because Airbnb is a hospitality service. It’s in the name!
The unit was safe, as described, and utilities worked."
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Phenomenal Airbnb from the good scents to the accent walls and very inviting space as well as the eye popping art/paintings that compliment the home. Definitely will be booking the home again upon visiting Salisbury, MD"

It was only a 6 minute drive to pick up our SU student - close enough to be super convenient, but far enough to enjoy peace and quiet for two great nights of sleep. This was our first Airbnb experience and the hosts were very helpful and quick to respond. We’ve stayed at a local hotel prior to this, but this was a MUCH more comfortable stay for our whole family and we will definitely look to stay here again when we come to visit SU."

John, always has the Johnna's House spotless, water has always been hot and everything in the kitchen was always work magnificently.

2021-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"The house was beautiful, fresh, clean and had tons of amenities. The beach is a short drive away and most of your shopping needs are within walking distance."
2021-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"We stayed at John's place for an overnight between North Carolina and New York. It was easy to find, right off of 13, and had restaurants nearby.

2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This place was well thought out and is well worth the stay. Definitely a home away from home.
2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Definitely recommend staying here. It was very clean & Mr. John is a great host. You will love the Sun room & watching the bunnies eat grass in the morning.

2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"John’s house, AKA “Johnna’s Place”, is very spacious, comfortable, and thoughtfully laid out.

We really liked the art work in the house as well as the cast iron and stainless steel cookware, which are healthier than Teflon."
2021-06-01,5,Group trip,"Johnna's place is a wonderful home to stay in. It felt like home, and was immaculately clean and very comfortable. The hosts made it super convenient to check in and out. I truly can't think of anything that would have made our visit better! The location was easy to find and convenient to restaurants and grocery shopping. 100% recommend and we would gladly stay again!!"
2021-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,We had a great stay. The house was clean and well maintained with a lot of nice features like the sun room and a large yard. You could tell the host puts a lot of effort into creating a nice experience for guests. It didn’t seem like the greatest neighborhood as the surrounding houses were all in pretty rough shape but we had no issues and would stay there again. It’s on a main road very close to US-13 which was very convenient for getting around town. The price was about the same as what hotel rooms were going for in that area so it’s a solid value.
2021-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"Comfortable, cozy, & very clean home, good central location for enjoying the Delmarva peninsula. Enjoyed the close proximity to quaint downtown Salisbury."
2021-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"The house is conveniently located off the highway. It’s very clean, nicely furnished and comfortable. This was our fourth stay, as a convenient stopover on our travels! The owner is very responsive and attentive. A perfect fit for our needs.!"

Check in was super easy and John was kind enough to give us a walkthrough of the house."
2021-04-01,5,Stayed about a week,Johnna’s home is extremely pleasant and you will not be disappointed! We have stayed here twice within a year and will plan to stay here again in the future. Mr. John and his brother is always available when needed. Everything is always to perfection. Pictures really do no justice to how be this home is in and out! The sunroom is our favorite place in the house especially to see the sun rise and go down!

2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"""Wow! What a host! Sharon is wonderful and this house is incredible with absolutely everything you could possibly need to make your stay perfect. To begin with, the location couldn't be better. It is situated in a lovely, quiet neighborhood, close to restaurants, the charming waterfront, and the best coffee in town! It has been recently remodeled to perfection and we loved how Sharon’s attention to detail was present all throughout the house. From the bedding, to the towels and spotless interiors, we wanted to move in - permanently! Easy access to the entry with no problems at all and immediate response time for any questions. Even delicious local treats and local coffee were there awaiting our arrival along with a lovely note. When we accidentally broke something, Sharon and Matt were there to fix it within 30 minutes, going above and beyond to make our stay perfect. We will definitely be staying here again when we are visiting Salisbury- can’t wait! It’s no wonder Sharon is a su"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Thank you so much for a wonderful stay! The home is beautiful and so clean and organized.
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The home was wonderful! The location and description were just as advertised. Our entire group thought the place was perfect. We definitely will return and stay again if Sharon will have us. Sharon was a great host, she was very responsive and accommodating. She left a little note with information and welcoming us to the house. It was very comfortable for the group and we will definitely recommend Sharon’s property to anyone that needs to stay in the area. Thank you so much!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Amazing place! Looks exactly like the pictures-but better! Extremely clean, organized, and well decorated! Responsive host-we went for our wedding and she even put out roses, champagne, and decorated! We definitely will be back!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We absolutely loved this house for our stay in the Salisbury area for a family member’s wedding! SO much better than staying in a hotel block, we felt right at home and Sharon & Matthew’s space was even more beautiful than pictures could show. The house is extremely spacious, so even with multiple adults, children and a pup we had plenty of room to feel comfy during our stay. This may have been the cleanest Airbnb that we’ve ever stayed in, so if you’re someone who worries about cleanliness when you’re booking a place, look no further.
The neighborhood was gorgeous especially during our fall stay (in October) and we took our dog, Moose, on multiple walks through the neighborhood during our time here and loved all of the foliage and Halloween decor around! Also Sharon & Matthew let us use a dog crate that was the perfect size for our dog during our stay, so it saved up some room in our car.
We will definitely stay here again if given the chance! Would absolutely recommend :)"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with a pet,The house was beautiful!!

2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"It was quite evident that Sharon puts extra effort into making her place exceptionally clean & welcoming to her guests. We were very comfortable staying there. The rooms were spacious, labels on switches & drawers made things easier to find & I wish that I’d had time to cook in her well organized kitchen stocked with quality equipment. The neighborhood is very nice & was quiet & peaceful. The back patio was inviting with a grill, seating, & a gas fire pit. Check in & out was easy. Sharon’s response time was good too. We would be happy to stay there again & wouldn’t hesitate to recommend Sharon’s place.
The only suggestion I’d make is to have night lights in the bathrooms🙂"

2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Wow! Just Wow! Sharon and Matt are amazing people with hearts of gold. So blessed to have rented their home. They put so much thought into what someone needs in a home away from home. Their home is spacious, relaxing and inviting. We cooked every night and they had all we needed to do so, including the bbq grill. Their sweet touches, from the snacks left for their guests to their personalized hand written welcome card made this stay above the rest. Their flexibility with us to make sure our kiddo was settled in for college, was so appreciated. I just hope when we go back their property is available as we will definitely book here again. I could go on and on about how great it was, but I think this review gives you a good idea. Loved our stay!❤️"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great Host, everything was like in the pictures, had snacks, coffee, bathroom amenities, and laundry detergent available for use, would easily stay again"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"I took my family to our reunion this year and convinced my mom to try out an Airbnb for the first time. Firstly, it was less expensive than her usual hotel which was great, but the home we had the opportunity to stay in exceeded our expectations. Each of the rooms were cozy and clean. The kitchen was beautiful. The living room was perfect. We truly felt at home and made use of all the amenities. Sharon was even able to ship something in we left behind. What a terrific host!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"My family and I thoroughly enjoyed our stay at Sharon & Matt’s home. This home is very spacious and is the most well appointed Airbnb I’ve ever stayed in. Everything is labeled so there is no question about where things are (even light switches). I was going to make a store run for paper products and utensils but found a stash in a cabinet. Speaking of the cabinets… the organization of this kitchen is unreal; it definitely gave me inspiration to get mine together at home!
I spoke with Sharon a couple of times and she was SO sweet! This home is approximately 45 minutes from Ocean City, but it is a straight shot and located near lots of restaurants, grocery stores, and other spots.
Lastly, I appreciated the inclusion of the beach umbrella and chairs with the home because it saved us so much money on rental fees at the beach each day! Can’t wait to come back next year - this time we will actually use the grill and fire pit!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We really enjoyed our stay at sharon's place! We arrived to a pristine home in a nice neighborhood that was equipped with all the ammenities that our family could need for a nice getaway. Our children enjoyed the toys and games, and we all loved the relaxing backyard where we had a nice bbq, made smores, and rocked on hammock. The kitchen was also perfect for us which was fully stocked and had some nice welcoming snacks for us. We definitely recommend that you rent this home if you would like to visit the ocean city area with your family!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Sharon’s home was beautifully appointed. She was a great host, leaving a handwritten note and various local treats for my family and me to enjoy. We will definitely be back again when we are in the area!"

Spacious, spotless, thoughtfully decorated, large well equipped kitchen, comfortable bed. Quiet and on a beautiful street and beautiful neighborhood. A relaxing, comfortable place and we will miss it! Sharon (and Matt) most accommodating. Truly thoughtful and kind with various gestures, such as leaving the porch light on since we had a late arrival. Always an immediate response to anything we may need. And Sharon, yes, you spoiled us with various treats (great farmer’s market popcorn), chocolate, local coffee, etc. — Thank you Sharon and Matt for hosting us, a most needed comfortable and lovely stay."

2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This was such a nice place to stay. It was in a peaceful neighborhood and it was quiet. The house was clean and looked exactly like the photos. Rod was a great host. He was friendly and responsive. When the counter top stove didn’t work Rod and his wife went out the way to get a new one and replaced it for us. When we got to the house at first rod was there to greet us and show us around. The place is located close enough to travel to ocean city and Berlin. The town itself and had plenty to do. :))
2023-07-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Rod was an excellent host. Rod and his family were there when I pulled in to greet me and my guest which was a nice surprise. He gave us a tour of the place and was very pleasant. Everything was what I wanted and expected. He gave us suggestions on where to dine and what to do, and we tried them, no complaints.

2023-07-01,4,Stayed one night,"Rod was very responsive. The inside of the suite was nice., but the air inside was too warm. Unfortunately, the homeowner controls the thermostat. While I was told to let them know how the temp was for me, Rod's wife came over, said it felt fine to her, and turned off lights saying they were probably making it hot. I asked for a fan and one was brought to me. Later, I received a message that they hoped I was comfortable and it was ""cold"" in their part of the home with a picture of the thermostat. A 2nd unit would be helpful so that renters can be in charge of their own level of comfort and the owners won't be ""cold"". Also, the water pump that drains the extra AC water is in the unit and very loud. The fan provided was loud enough to drown out the sound as it sometimes drained as frequently as every 15 minutes. Smaller issues -no ice cubes in the tray upon arrival, the surge protectors that power the TVs hadn't been turned on, and there was only one bath towel."

2023-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Fantastic. I come to the area for work with my daughter. Even though it was late that night, they met me to show me around! So kind and attentive. Communicated the entire time."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great place for individual or couple get away. Very quiet, clean. Bed was comfortable and blankets were warm and cozy. Rod and Roda were wonderful hosts, very responsive. Only thing that I did not pay attention to is there is no real stove/oven/range. My fault for overlooking that minor detail. They have a toaster oven and cooktop and microwave. But overall I give it 5 stars and recommend it."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed about a week,Great location. Very responsive and helpful host. Very nice place. Enjoyed visit. Would stay again
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"My kids and I enjoyed our stay immensely. Everybody got a good nights sleep. Quiet, clean, and had all we needed. It was fun to fire up a charcoal grill again. The view of the marsh out the back was unique and interesting."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,A beautiful small space to get away from the bustle! Angela is quick to respond with any questions!
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,Angela’s place suited our needs for a quick overnight trip to attend a family wedding. Bedroom would have been too tight for us if staying any longer as we had to step into bathroom or hallway to get dressed due to how tight the bedroom was…had to step on my tip toes to squeeze between the closet/walls around the bed. Living and kitchen area were more than suitable.
2024-06-01,4,Stayed with a pet,Clean and quiet place to stay while traveling.
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Perfect little place for a short stay. I came by myself for a quick two day trip and it had everything I needed. I utilized the fire pit both nights, it was so relaxing (and a little exciting) sitting by the creek and listening to the wildlife in the evenings. Having coffee on the deck in the mornings was also a treat. Everything was as described, and a scenic 10-15 min drive to downtown and other places. Thank you for having me, I would definitely stay again."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Clean and convenient for an overnight stay while traveling.

2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Highly recommend for a weekend getaway trip. House is clean and well maintained. Will definitely revisit!

2024-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Great comfy place for a great price.
2024-04-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"We used the place as a home base while we visited our daughter camping on Assateague Island.
Loved the amenities... the little extras.... though I loved the tea, a little decaf would be good.
the only issue we had was that there was no frying pan to cook eggs, pancakes or bacon... just sauce pans.
Oh yea... the lock box was a bit tricky...the key kept getting caught in the hinge and was hard to close.
But we really like the place."

2024-02-01,5,Stayed one night,This place felt like home and the scenery was peaceful. It's a good price for the stay. The only thing to keep in mind is that the bed is big so there's not much space. other than that it's a great place! thank you!
2024-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"Clean, responsive, and a great place! Thank you!"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed one night,Angela was a very responsive and flexible host. The cottage was so cute and cozy with a beautiful outdoor area and surroundings. I would love to visit again.
2024-01-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"very secluded, which is what I was looking for.
had a problem with the plumbing, which was no one's fault but kinda put a damper on my trip because I was worried about it during my stay.
TV only has a few channels, and none came in clear.
The bed was very comfortable! I slept really well! I heard a car maybe twice during the night so it was really peaceful."

2023-12-01,4,Stayed with kids,It is a good place to spend with family
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Very private, beautiful creek full of bald cypress trees just feet from the deck. The house was spotless. It was a 15 min drive for restaurants and groceries. We have Mint mobile (same network as T-mobile) and had zero service at the house. I’m not sure how other cell providers perform there."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,very nice quiet place. everything was clean and smelled fresh would definitely stay again
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This place was clean, quiet and cozy :) if you are looking to disconnect and sit by a warm fire, this is the place for you. we thoroughly enjoyed our stay :) only thing to note if you’re bringing pups. the back yard looks completely fenced in but it is not. they did provide a dog bed and dog bowls which was sooo sweet!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"Nice place to stay while visiting Salisbury university with our daughter. It’s about 10 minutes away.
It’s perfect for 3-4 people. The main bed is comfortable. It’s decorated in a very inviting way.
GPS did not take us to the house (said it was the house diagonally across the street) and the service is non existent in that area so be prepared when arriving especially if it’s dark.
Overall a great stay. Host was wonderful and we would consider again when in the area."
2023-11-01,4,Stayed one night,Nice mobile home along the woods. clean and comfortable
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Very nice, quiet, and comfortable place."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This is a wonderful place set along a wooded area. Birds were abundant; heard an owl at night and I am fairly confident I heard a wolf howl three times. It is extremely peaceful and would highly recommend.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,we had a great time. Thank you
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Adorable little place, not far from restaurants and with a beautiful view of the woods!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Quaint little place perfect for our stay.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"I loved staying at Cattail Branch! It was so peaceful and secluded. Felt like we really ""got away from it all"". It was a super cute ""tiny home"" with everything we needed. Perfect for a romantic getaway with my husband, but I could see us also being able to fit our two boys there. The outdoor space was phenomenal- great deck, cozy firepit that I wish we had time to use. Loved the view into the wooded creek area. So many birds! Everything was spotless. Kitchen and bathroom had everything we needed. Wifi was fine for our needs. I would definitely stay again. Thanks Angela!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We loved our time there. Peaceful and quiet.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"A perfect tiny house for our overnight stay. Everything was clean and tidy, and even the pull-out bed was comfy. We did have a little trouble seeing the street address in the dark of night, but that was probably a user error. Wish we could have gotten there a bit earlier to make use of the beautiful fire pit!
Highly recommend."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with a pet,This home was very peaceful and exactly as described. You can tell the owner put a lot of attention into making the home clean and comfortable.
2023-10-01,4,Stayed with a pet,"We were looking for a place to crash after being at the beach for the weekend, where we could get some sleep and complete some work that was due the next day. This place was on the way home, met our needs, and was resonably priced (there was some price gouging going on this weekend). When we arrived the place was as described. Getting in was easy (lock box with code to get the key). The entrance is right into the bedroom which was a bit odd, but nothing to complain about. The rest of the place was comfortable and clean.
Unfortunatley the internet service was out and because we had no cell service, we were not able to contact the host to see if it could be fixed. We had to drive into salisbury proper to get service. By that time, and because I needed to get work that required the internet done, we ended up booking a hotel and stayed there. The host was understanding and refunded what we paid minus ABNB charges, which was very generous. If the internet had worked I'd give five stars."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great place, perfect for a little getaway!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay. Extremely comfortable. Would love to come back!

2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"This cute, tiny house was the perfect place for my brief stay on my way home. Just the right amount of space for me and the location was quiet and peaceful.
I would definitely book again for a longer stay to explore more on the eastern shores of Maryland!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"We had a great stay here! Although we only stayed for one night, we wished we had stayed longer."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My husband and I decided to take a quick weekend trip to Ocean City but didn’t want to pay the outrageous prices in town. Angela’s place was perfect for our getaway. It is clean, in a very quiet area and had everything we needed for our stay. The outdoor area is very pretty. Although we didn’t use the fire pit, I’m sure it would be very nice especially during fall."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very great place cozy I very much enjoy the fire pit and stars .
2023-08-01,4,Stayed one night,Beautifully decorated. With every convenience.

2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"We booked a stay at Angela’s, knowing that we were going to be on the beach all day in Ocean City prior to our check-in. With the extremely high prices for hotels in the Ocean City area, it was completely doable for us to drive the 40 minutes to Angeles location and have a clean, private, restful sleep at her tiny house."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"A beautiful getaway with amazing hospitality. Thanks again, Angela!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This was a very pleasant surprise for us, as we didn't know the area and weren't sure what to expect. The tiny house was very clean and is very quaint and simple in a really great/quiet location. It was the perfect stop on our road trip out east and Angela was very helpful and responsive when we had questions, we would definitely recommend staying here!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,Angela’s tiny home is very welcoming and comfortable. She was very responsive and accommodating. We would definitely stay here again.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Angela was great to work with and very accommodating with the reservations. She was responsive to any questions I had in a timely manner and gave great recommendations for dinner. We were there for a National softball tournament and it was very close to all the fields. My daughters dog went with us and he was allowed to stay by himself in the home due to the heat at the games and that was greatly appreciated. Would definitely recommend.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,Perfect and peaceful place to stay
2023-07-01,4,Stayed with kids,"Nice stay in an area with limited other options. Trailer is private and quiet. Very nice deck and firepit for relaxing when it's not so hot and buggy (we stayed in July). Tight quarters in kitchen and bathroom. One bedroom is private, but pullout couch is not: there's no way to pull the privacy curtain out when the bed is extended. Had an issue with internet bandwidth first night, but it was cleared up promptly. Friendly cats came around a lot to say hi. No bowls in kitchen, but the Keurig machine was a nice surprise. Full-size refrigerator and freezer, but doors do not fully open due to tight space. Ample lighting, A/C was very good, and shower was nice. Had a lot of ants in the bathroom throughout our stay, but that is an easy fix. Overall, we enjoyed our stay in rural Maryland."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Great stay, lovey tiny house would stay again"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"What a wonderful time we had at Angela’s tiny house/cottage. It was a great get away from a urban life to our family of 6! I will have forever memories from my kids playing in the yard, enjoying the 4th of July fireworks, having their first s’mores ever, and watching the fire. The place was very clean and the decoration was so cute. We hope to come back in the near future. Thanks Angela!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place to experience a tiny house. Very peaceful.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Very clean, comfortable and quiet. I would book again."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"A wonderful, peaceful getaway! Close to great restaurants and walking trails, as well as Assateague National Park. A perfect little spot to bring your pups, with more than enough space for them to play. This was our first tiny home stay and it was a great experience! We have 2 large dogs and it was more than enough space for the 4 of us. The beautiful deck provided extra space to hang out and enjoy the surroundings. There are neighbors close by, but you would never know it with the privacy fence. It provides the perfect amount of seclusion and privacy, plus the neighborhood is very quiet! Overall, we enjoyed our stay and would recommend!"
2023-06-01,4,Stayed a few nights,This was a very cute little get away. Very quite and relaxing location. Has everything needed for a great time away. We really enjoyed our visit and would highly recommend.

2023-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We had a great stay in this lovely, well-appointed tiny house in a nice rural setting.

It was especially nice that my dog could be with us! Thank you, Angela!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Nice little cottage, very cozy and comfortable. Great area and very private."
2023-06-01,4,Stayed with a pet,"Cute park model home behind host’s home. Very clean! Rural area, quiet, very dark at night. If you’re bringing a dog, be aware there’s no fenced/secured yard area, but lots of on-leash sniffing and pottying area"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Angela's place is super-cute, cozy and in a quiet peaceful spot. Angela was almost immediately responsive and allowed us to feel welcome, almost like friends or family."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I had a terrific stay at Angela’s. It is clean, comfortable, half hour to the beach, great water pressure, stocked with coffee and tea. The bed was comfortable and it was really nice to have a full kitchen. The outdoor space is adorable. It rained but I will definitely use it next time. A great experience with Angela!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,My husband and I had such a peaceful anniversary trip here! Such a private getaway but still close enough to all the sight seeing spots without seeming like a hassle to get to. The amenities Angela provided went above and beyond anything we could have even thought of!

2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,great place and affordable
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"From the minute we walked in we felt at ""home"". I wish our stay was longer, but we will definitely stay here again. The kitchen was fully stocked and the openness of the living area was really nice.
Ryan was very responsive and helpful before, during, and at check out.
You can tell they really take pride in their home."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,The cottage is lovely and we immediately felt at home. We enjoyed our stay and look forward to staying there again next year.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Ryan's home was as described in the listing. It was clean, comfortable and everything about the stay was easy. I don't have a single negative thing to say about the place. Highly recommend for your trip to Salisbury."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,Ryan’s place was amazing and super convenient. It really is like a cozy cottage just like it reads in the description.

He was very respectful and responsive. Everything was made really easy. Thank you Ryan!

next time we are in town."
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I contacted Ryan as I was boarding my flight. He responded quickly. I mentioned I wouldn’t arrive until 3/4am. He was very flexible. The property had a mobile keypad which made things even better.
The location was just what I needed for the short trip to Salisbury. I was traveling alone so it was a little scary walking into a three bedroom home to stay alone. However once I opened the door the space felt like home. From the plants to the couch with nicely folded blankets in a wicker basket.
The kitchen was huge but I didn’t use it at all. As I walked down the hallway I noticed the first bathroom which was spotless.
The bedrooms were well decorated with nice size closets and drawers for extended stays. I picked the room with the bathroom, which was also clean, even the curtain liner.
I kept looking for a flaw just because it felt to good to be true but there weren’t any.
I ended up checking out a few days early and Ryan gave me a partial refund.

2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Is giving six stars an option? This place is the real deal; it's obvious the hosts thought about folks spending time there and what they might need. Enough extras are tucked away to make your visit functional without it feeling like the place was clogged with stuff -- we were particularly impressed by the pantry having the makings of a quick meal. The coffee maker supports Keurig pods as well as brewed coffee for up to ten cups. Better yet, the manual is present so you can figure out how to work the timer (it's a little unusual).
The place has a farmhouse feel, but there was also a definite emphasis on making it functional. The public areas have a spacious feel that makes it easy to sprawl out -- or work together on making a meal. It's worth pointing out that functional includes comfortable. You might be surprised by just how dark and quiet the place gets, too; with the blinds down it feels very private.
The guest guide provides a lot of useful information, and Ryan was very responsive to all questions we had."
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very clean. One of best AirBnb places I stayed.

We’ll hope to stay here each time we visit this area!!"
2022-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"Ryan's house was perfect for my families trip to Salisbury! The house was just one block from Salisbury University!

I did have some back and forth communication with her as I was arriving a bit late, but she was extremely accommodating and super friendly.
The house is super, super clean and very well organized. There was ample parking upon my arrival. I was only concerned with getting upstairs, taking a shower, and sleeping, so I didn't utilize the living room or kitchen or any of that. Fresh linens, warm shower, comfortable bed and extremely peaceful sleep. Everything was available for a great, comfortable stay, probably more so than most people's houses! I actually slept about 2 or so hours more than I had planned to, it is really just that comfortable. Checking out was super simple, with ample instructions on everything. Overall, the stay was better than expected, and easily a 10/10."

Ann was responsive and allowed us to check in early, which was so appreciated as we were coming from Baltimore with 2 little kids. Just make sure you bring your own bath & body wash and towels as there are none. But that wasn't a big deal, we only stayed one night and if we really needed to, CVS was around the corner. Loved our stay. Price was better and house was way better than the big name hotels nearby."

2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place is EXACTLY what it boast!!!
The place was impeccably clean. Ann has everything you need and a whole lot of little extras just in case you forgot something.
I rented this airbnb because I was hosting a baby shower for a family member. We used the location to prep and sleep and it was EVERYTHING!!!! The location is close to a lot of shopping centers so you will not need to go far for anything. After all the work was done we got to relax in the quietness of this quaint little home and it was just what we needed. The rules are simple to follow and the area is very very quiet for relaxing. I would definitely return here if the need arises."
