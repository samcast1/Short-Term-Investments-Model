2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Lisa & Mike's place was adorable. The home was immaculate. as soon as you drive up, they have a well manicured lawn. entry into the house is coded. You walk into a clean, beautifully decorated, uncluttered
home with any amenity you can think of. you are greeted with a snack basket and booklet of rules and suggested things to do. they provided some bottled waters and a few other luxuries in the kitchen to include a coffee maker and pods. Let's talk about those beds and sheets. we all woke the next morning boasting about our restful sleep. The kids enjoyed the pool and all the floats she already had. Added plus is the washer & dryer, if needed. Other than the house; Lisa is super sweet, accommodating, and fast with responding to my many questions. My family and I would love to stay there again. Thank you, Lisa & Mike. It was a
pleasure."

2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Truly a beautiful and relaxing and happy home! Although we went out and explored every day. Our best time was looking forward to coming back after a day at the beach or hike and enjoying playing cards by the pool in the warmth of the sun! Even on evenings when it was a little chilly to sit out we loved the amazing windows around the dining table. Felt like you were outside. Vera’s place is so comfortable and great location to great parks. Myakka River park is our fave and it was a quick thirty minute drive to our favorite beach stump pass! We really didn’t have the desire to eat out too much because we enjoyed so much preparing our meals in the great kitchen. Although we did once to a great spot called Snook haven. Fun place!
Definitely 5 ⭐️ and definitely recommend Vera’s place! She’s a fantastic host!"

2023-12-01,5.0,Group trip,"Great home to stay at. Mainly there to sleep. The beds were comfortable. We cooked some meals here, and supplies for all meals were very helpful. The washer and dryer definitely needed, so we didn't have to pack soo much. Pool was cooler then we had hoped for, but our family members still got in for a quick dip. (Kinda figured it would be, since the weather was in the 60's and 70's not a big deal though.) Two bathrooms always a plus since there were 5 of us. I loved the soaking tub too. Overall, it's just the best home we have been in yet for an air b&b. I definitely recommend this beautiful, stocked up, clean, and very comfortable home for the price. Our host was great too, responded to my questions in a timely manner."

Very CLEAN, exactly AS PICTURED on photos, COMFORTABLE, FULLY EQUIPPED with all you might need on a great holiday! THE POOL was such a lovely thing to have, especially with kids, very well maintained and clean. We were able to grab stuff in a cooler provided in home, along with beach towels, chairs and umbrella, and in 25-30 min drive wind up on the most beautiful beach. Actually, so many of the best Florida beaches are within comfortable quick drive that you will have a hard time picking where to go next! House is close to restaurants, 2 mins from Walmart, and a short drive to the best Ukrainian and other Eastern European delis and restaurants :) Warm Mineral Springs was 10 mins away and such a cool place to visit as well!

2024-04-01,2.0,Stayed with a pet,"The beds were very hard and uncomfortable, the sofas both sunk in the middle and very uncomfortable, most utensils did not work like the can opener or peeler, cheap utensils, no screens in any of the doors so many flies got in the house, poor water pressure in the showers, found 6 roaches during a 9 day stay, live hornet nest outside and very poor landscaping outside."

Communication was great since she always responded right away, 10/10 recommend this home. I would definitely book with her again."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Valentinas place was exactly as described. Communication was excellent and the check in and checkout process was very easy.
Thank you Valentina!!!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Group trip,"Great place and great host. Only thing I'd mention is the water is pretty mineral rich or harder than normal so it makes washing soap off a bit harder from dishes and when showering, but this is fairly normal across FL with well water. Otherwise a really pleasant place to stay, Venice Beach is about 30m away, and feels like at home. If you're cooking bring your own knives or sharpener, I wish there was a sharpener there on site."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"My family and I stayed here and it was absolutely beautiful 😊 I have a two year old son and they provided a pack a play, baby monitor, high chair and children bowls plates and silverware. They also provided a beach wagon 3 beach chairs two beach blankets and beach toys for my son. I saved so much room in my suv with all the stuff the provide for your convenience. The master bathroom is absolutely amazing my son had more fun in the shower with his bath toys than he did at the beach lol. All in all it was amazing felt right at home will definitely be coming back in the future 😊"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"We were very pleased with Valentina's house. The house is new and the interior is accordingly in good condition. Valentina is very helpful and responds very quickly.
After our stay, there are now 2 umbrellas, 4 camping chairs, 3 beach chairs, 2 buggy boards, 2 swimming noodles and a wagon for the beach to take your equipment with you.
Thank you Valentina"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"The place was clean, beautiful, the host worked with us to get us in as soon as possible. Valentina Communicated well with us to make sure the stay was going well, the home was well stocked on anything you could need! extra bedding, toiletries was in abundance! The mattress and blankets were amazing, very comfortable! It's near everything, stores, restaurants, the streets are walkable even with kids, parks nearby. We felt right at home and relaxed as ever, on vacation!"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Valentina was so easy and responsive to communicate with. We came down for Braves Spring training, and this location was great - about 20 minutes to the park. Good selection of grocery stores and restaurants close by (we love Blue Tequila). Pleasantly surprised when we decided to take a quick trip over to Venice Beach that she had plenty of chairs and an umbrella to take with us. The fenced in back yard and screened in back porch was also a nice surprise. Definitely hope to stay here again next year!"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"My family and I had a great time staying at this location. The home is absolutely beautiful and extremely clean - way better than we expected. I wish we had spent more time there.
Valentina clearly cares about her guests and she was quick to respond to all of my questions. She's easy to talk to and an excellent host.
I will be marking this as a favorite of mine because I know I'll be coming here again."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Our stay in North Port was wonderful. The house was beautiful and spacious. The beach accessories were very appreciated. We enjoyed our stay immensely. The only thing that I will not miss is the Nest thermostat. It is finicky:) All in all I would highly recommend!!
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Valentina was an above average host - very responsive and helpful. The home is peaceful, pristine and tastefully decorated. Complete with all amenities but extremely clutter-free. The neighborhood was quite and easy to access. It felt like home from beginning to end of our stay. We found several beaches within an easy drive and access to quick and easy shopping of all kinds. If you are considering, it’s a great choice!"
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,I can’t say enough great things about this house! Super well equipped house in a lovely neighborhood and the most comfortable beds! Highly recommended! We can’t wait to stay here again the next time we are in the area!

2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Valentina was excellent and very responsive to a minor issue/question I had. The home is quite beautiful and I slept so well in a very comfortable king-sized bed. There was a high-speed blender which I really enjoyed having to make smoothies. There were plenty of coffee pods and detergent pods for the clothes washer. The location was quite convenient for me. A neighborhood Walmart is right down the street, in addition to a super center, just a little further. There are restaurants conveniently located. The Warm Mineral Springs is close by. There were float noodles in the garage, but no beach towels, so make sure you bring a towel if you plan to go. The neighborhood is interesting with quite a few chain link fences around. There are many beautiful, newly constructed homes with many older ones mixed in (I’m guessing a result of past storms). It’s not a well-lit neighborhood, but I did feel safe & it was very quiet during my stay. I would recommend staying here."

Our girls were delighted to play with the games available in the bedroom.
In short, this stay at Valentina's was just perfect. She was very responsive and friendly. Our girls were sick and Valentina immediately gave us a list of doctors and emergency. Thank you!!
Really thank you Valentina for everything.

The home is as descriibed, spacious, clean, comfortable. We had a 3 year old who greatly appreciated the toys available to distract her. Family was visiting from the Caribbean during a cold spell.

The house had all the amenities we needed and the host was quick to respond when I had to ask her questions. There is lots to do in and around North Port. Publix and Walmart is within 10 minutes, which was very convenient considering my family and I arrived late the first day and had to find something to cook at the house. We went to Siesta Key Beach in Sarasota since red tide was low, which was approx. 45 min commute without traffic. Highly recommend staying at this house! We loved it so much we want to come back soon."

Thank you, Olga!"
2024-06-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"House was private and quiet. It looked just as pictured. Rooms were all clean, kitchen had all of the basics, and the AC was cold, even in triple digit FL heat. The bonus room bed was a little iffy with two of us on it, the bonus room shower is small, and the hot water was slow to warm up. But those were minor complaints from our weekend. The host was very responsive and SUPER easy on their expectations for check-out. Worth the price, and an easy drive to anything in North Port or Port Charlotte."

2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This place was ideal for our two family stay in Northport. The house was very clean and extremely well stocked (spices, kitchen/ cooking tools, extras like coffee and tea were greatly appreciated, shampoo, etc). There were plenty of towels and beach supplies (chairs, kids toys, towels, etc) The pool had so many extras like goggles and waterwings for the kids. Pool is also very visible through the windows to be able to safely supervise any outdoor activities at all times. Every item in the house was accessible and well orgnaized, easy to find and know where to return, etc.
Our only hang up was the house is listed as 4 bedrooms, the 4th bedroom is actually a room off the front entrance with curtains in the door way, not a sound proof closing door. This worked out in the end for us, as we have some kids that are heavy sleepers, but could be an issue for others.
We are counting down the months to be able to enjoy this house and space again!"

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"The house was very open and roomy! We were extremely comfortable with 3 adults and two toddlers. We easily could have had more people stay with us in the house and still would have had room. The pool was beautiful. The house was not cluttered at all.
The listing did say it came with kids toys, which was 2 toy cars and a small dinosaur. We did however pack our own just incase! There was laundry detergent at the house, toilet paper and kitchen utensils/pots and pans. There was dirty towels in the hamper in the laundry room and a comforter in the dryer when we came in - I had no problem putting the comforter away in one of the spare linen closets. The patio is screened in, the outside door to the patio and the door to the pool both have the handles raised up higher than your average door handle - which is VERY nice with having two toddlers! We loved that.
The host was very responsive the very few times I messaged her. It was a pleasant experience! We would surely stay here again!"

2024-01-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"Elena’s home was exactly as pictured. Clean, beautiful decor, huge kitchen. Our only real issue was that the washing machine smelled moldy and one of our people in our group was reactive to mold, so we were unable to wash laundry while at the home. We did not reach out to Elena to remedy the issue, since we were only staying 2 nights. Overall a great experience! Thanks!"

2023-09-01,5.0,Group trip,"This home beautifully designed is immaculate. The home is not as close to stores as I would have liked and the area roads were dark with woods in the front and back. If you want privacy, this is definitely the place for you.
Pros: Beautiful home inside and out… located on a large lot, and is not too close to neighbors for privacy, looks like a recent renovation… The kitchen with updated appliances, oversized island separates the kitchen and living room, master suite, bathroom with large modern tub, large 6-jet shower (3 front/3 rear jets) and water closet, three additional bedrooms on the other side were decent sizes.
Cons: We ran out of toilet paper in one of the bathrooms, and one roll in the other bathroom… for seven ladies, so we had to purchase a pack. Also the grass was a little overgrown.
I give this home 5 stars because I received a response from Elena when I sent her a message."
2023-09-01,5.0,Group trip,Great place to stay! Would definitely recommend!
2023-09-01,5.0,Group trip,"Great host! Had a little trouble getting in at first but I think it was for the best because it will improve future stays! Elena was helpful and responsive, and the home matched my needs and was very comfortable! Definitely would recommend!"

2023-07-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,Place was very clean and nice.
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The home was pristine and plenty of space for our family. The pool was just as amazing. Great property...A 5 star for sure.
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"A great host with a beautiful home in a very quiet and private area. The house is great, very spacious, and with the spaces perfectly distributed. The house is exactly as shown in the pictures, so no surprises after checking in.
The pool is great, especially if you have kids because the shallow end is built as one long step about 4 feet, comprising the entire width of the pool. It is almost like a kiddie pool inside the regular pool. Two more steps going down are perfect for 3 to 4-year-old kids to be able to stand inside the pool while keeping their heads out.
The beds are comfortable, the bathroom is a spa-level experience, and there is plenty of room in the living room to share with a decent size group. The back patio is great, and the pool has plenty of space.
Elena is very responsive and accommodating. She was ok with me adjusting the temperature of the pool, and she was very receptive to any feedback I had to offer. I would definitely come back to this property."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Had an amazing stay for memorial weekend
2023-04-01,5.0,Group trip,"Our stay last weekend at this rental was wonderful! This home is truly beautiful, clean and comfortable to stay in. Elena was a wonderful host when it came to attending any questions &/or requests. The only suggestions we would make to fully enjoy the pool & bbq would be not to have the pool so hot and to clean the bbq grill to avoid possible grease fires. Overall I will definitely consider renting this home again when visiting the nearby beaches."

2023-03-01,4.0,Stayed about a week,"Beautifully appointed home. Even better than the photos. Large bedrooms and living area. Very timely to respond to communications. Great location and very quiet neighborhood. Disappointed work was being done on the pool cage and we were not notified in advance so could not use the pool for several days. While the host provided a partial refund, the loss of pool time and having workers on the property did diminish our full enjoyment of our stay."
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Thank you Elena. The house made my wedding weekend perfect. We will definitely be looking for availability every time we come to visit family. It's the perfect size, setup and location if you're looking for a quiet place to spend time. Elena is an amazing host and was very responsive. Don't hesitate to book this home, as it is immaculate and has great amenities."

2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Beautiful place
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Beautiful home! Perfect for our family vacation with 6 adults and 3 kids. Elena communicates very efficiently answering any questions we had. Only 30 minutes from shark tooth beach area which was a blast and close to stores and restaurants. House had plenty of towels and beach equipment we could use too. Plan to come back next summer.
2022-06-01,5.0,Group trip,We were in town for a long wedding weekend and it was great to find a house close by for the 5 of us - way better than separate hotel rooms. The house was perfect for our stay. It was very comfortable and I loved that it was clean and so thoughtfully and well stocked. We cooked breakfast every morning and enjoyed our coffee in the lanai. Elena was quick to respond to any questions I had and check in was a breeze. A great stay overall! We even had a some wildlife sighting behind the house - very cool!
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I would definitely recommend Elena’s house for vacation rental. Great location, quite neighborhood, clean and stylish house, with all essentials, even more. Pool area is amazing, brand new heated pool. Elena is amazing host, communication rates as 100 of 100."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Always a pleasure staying here when we visit family. It is our third stay.
2024-06-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Well worth the price. Quiet location, private entrance. Single occupant felt extremely safe. Best convenient location for the reason for my trip, visiting family. Host was extremely accommodating. Lost my phone contacted host to use phone to contact family, extremely nice and understanding. Kitchenette made location extremely budget friendly. Two TVs that are well suited for location. Wi-fi access (never used). Many utensils, toiletries, dishes, seasonings, disposable plates, silverware, Extremely clean and comfortable pillows. If you like the look of throw pillows you are gonna be in heaven. Little touches like luggage rack, steamer, iron, clean towels, washcloths, extra linen pillows that you are not afraid to utilize. Go check it out."
2024-06-01,2.0,Stayed a few nights,"Decent setup if all you’re doing is sleeping and showering there. Living and kitchen area are not setup well for using. Appeared clean, on the surface. Pay close attention to the host’s disclaimer. Among other things, they say you may see the “occasional palmetto bug.” Two nights in a row, there were roaches crawling on the kitchen counter and on the refrigerator. If you search for Australian Roach, you’ll see exactly what we encountered in the kitchen. The host insisted that they were not roaches and simply referred us to their disclaimer. Additionally, because the unit is attached to their house, we could hear the host’s TV, dogs and voices. Paid for 3 nights, but only stayed 2. We thought maybe seeing a roach the first time was just a fluke, but after the second, we had enough. Didn’t want to risk them getting into our bags and bringing them home with us. The host refused to refund the night we didn’t stay and only referred us to the disclaimer."
2024-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"such an amazing time for me and my daughter, place is super clean and hostess very responsive, 100% will recommend . :)"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Place was wonderful! Would definitely stay there again. Nice quiet out-of-the-way place.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Just what I needed for a short stay
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Wonderful to be in Florida for a break from WI winter!
2024-03-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Convenient and nice for a short stay!
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We had a great stay at Sherry’s in North Port! We were able to borrow beach chairs and a mini cooler for our beach day that was very convenient!
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We came down for spring training games, great central location for us."
2024-03-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,We stayed for two nights at Sherry's place to visit a nephew in the area. She provided the necessities for a comfortable stay and making simple meals. There were fun accents to the house inside and out-- and they made the most of the compact space. We thought the rental was very reasonable and well-located for our purposes. The pink eared poodle is very sweet-- make sure you meet her.
2024-03-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,"Overall the stay was pleasant. She was late in emailing me the code to the door but it worked out. It suited us fine as we were just in town to look for property to purchase. We were gone most of the time. There is not a couch for relaxing if you’re looking for that. Two people can’t sit comfortably to watch tv in the entrance/sitting room/kitchenette area. Very awkward. Bathroom was fine for our short stay. Linens were provided. Bedroom was clean, bed was ok, again, for a short stay. TV in the bedroom is small and was malfunctioning. We couldn’t watch tv the first time we tried as it was purple/pink and picture was fading. She had her husband come fix it and then screen worked on and off after that. We didn’t complain much about it because we weren’t there a lot just at night to sleep. The TV is probably 30 years old. I would recommend upgrading to a new version. Since the room is located in the house, we could hear the owners and the dogs while we were there but it wasn’t bothersome."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Although, it was a short stay. My husband and I enjoyed every minute of it. The house is exactly as described and Sherri and her family are very welcoming. The bed is very comfortable. And atmosphere is very relaxing. We would definitely stay again and recommend to our friends and family."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"A wonderful place to stay. Close to Braves spring training, lots of restaurants, shopping, and places to visit. The beach was only 25-30 minutes away as well! Shery was quick to respond to any questions. I would recommend staying here if you want to have close access to everything!"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Great stay! Mike and Sherry were always available, helpful, and really friendly. We will stay again on our next visit."
2024-02-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Ok place. Comfortable bed and pillows. Ok location. A slightly musty smell in the kitchen and bathroom. View from the entrance door is of an excavated lot with dirt piles. It was nice to have a bedroom separate from the living/kitchen area. Also, it was nice to have a TV in both the living room and bedroom. Basic coffee supplies we’re already in the unit, as well as extra pillows, towels and a ukulele. 😀"

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Where can I begin about this place?! Not only was it in a great location with great hosts, but it was an amazing price! Sherry and her husband couldn’t have been nicer or more accommodating. They left us recommendations for local restaurants and coffee spots( all fantastic) and made sure my wife, my pups, and I were taken care of every step of the way! Great for a quick weekend get away or an extended stay if necessary! Couldn’t have been more pleased with this trip and it was all thanks to a great place to stay! I hope they have an opening the next time I’m in town, because I will be disappointed if I have to stay anywhere else. Thanks y’all!"

Note: The fold-down sofabed is best for shorter people (5'9"" or less?). That said, my recovering back quite liked the firm support so I just slept diagonally."

Other than that we had all of our needs satisfactorily met.
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We are very happy that we picked Sherry’s place

The kitchen set up worked well too - I especially appreciated the coffee and fixings!"
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful, clean space with a gorgeous garden. Sherry was very welcoming and was available for any questions we had. Heads up, this location has a private entrance but shares a wall with the homeowner so TV sounds, conversations, and dog barks go both ways through the wall. This wasn’t really a problem because we turned on the bathroom fan for white noise and all was quiet during sleeping hours. Great place to stay!"
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Nice place
2022-01-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Sherry and Mike are great hosts who are quick to respond to any questions raised. The space was clean and co.fortable for our short visit
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,This place is great! The apartment has a great layout which is ideal for both short and long stays (we were here for 2 weeks). The kitchen worked well for cooking simple meals either with the hot plate or microwave which also doubles as a toaster oven. The yard was also perfect for us and our dog to relax in. The hosts were very friendly and helped us whenever we needed anything. Highly recommended!
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Quaint tropical abode tucked away in the safe, suburban-felt city of North Port. The perfect place for myself, my husband and our two dogs. 25 minutes to beautiful white sand beaches, where my husband and I went shelling and found shark teeth. Sherry and Mike were gracious hosts, and went above and beyond to assure we were content with our stay. Their attention to detail made our stay extra special. The kitchenette had beautiful plants and beach decor, which added to the Florida feel. The entrance is private and surrounded by beautiful vegetation. They got treats for our pups, recommended nearby parks, restaurants and beaches, and even gave us papaya from their papaya tree! We returned to the Airbnb on Christmas Eve to a bottle of wine at our step from Sherry and Mike. It made our holiday extra special. The hospitality of our hosts made the Airbnb more than just a place to sleep, but a cherished part of our Florida experience. We hope you have as much fun as we did!"
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"Anyone would enjoy a stay at Sherry’s place ! From the safe, quiet neighborhood setting to the tropical garden attributes, your stay here will make you feel “at-home”. Sherry is prompt to answer any needs and extends great courtesy. From her fresh-baked cookies to the green tea and coffee set-up, this is a lovely place to be. The Nautical decor and artwork are a reflection of her good taste, and sets the stage for a quality Airbnb experience. Sherry is sure to be a Superhost !!"

2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"We really enjoyed our 2 week stay! The duplex apartment was very clean and had a modern feel. Very comfy beds and couch. Nice 2-3 car parking. It was listed as a 2 bathroom, but there is actually only 1 bathroom.
The house comes with some beach chairs and umbrellas & and a kureig machine, but it had limited trash bags, toilet paper, etc. But that was fine we just bought our own since it was a longer stay.
Overall we would definitely recommend it for a quick or longer stay!"

2023-01-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,"The place was surface clean and centralized to a lot of restaurants and shopping. Quite cozy in a good way, and the beds were extremely comfortable! Needs to have a good, deep cleaning however, and some of the dishes in the cabinets were not clean when we arrived. Needed to be cleaned between fridge and stove. Could be better stocked in regards to paper towels, TP, etc. Not even basic things like salt and pepper, no ice trays or ice maker. Cleaning person showed up 30 minutes ahead of checkout, making us feel rushed to get out. That definitely should not happen! Overall nice place, and we would definitely stay here again... just want to provide suggestions for improvement! Thank you!"

2022-11-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"I highly recommend it.

2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,This family was a blessing before and after the hurricane I highly recommend this Location I pray for a speedy recovery for this whole town devastated by hurricane Ian
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Nice location, quite neighborhood, and place looks like pictures."
2022-08-01,3.0,Stayed with kids,"Our check-in was not the best experience. There was a lot of people working on the unit as we were pulling up and trying to unload. Had to ask if they needed us to come back, as they looked busy.
As for our stay, the house was lacking in essentials. There were no cleaning supplies, we did our best to clean up but didn't have a broom to clean with, or cleaning supplies. There was no oven mitts so we have to improvise getting something out of the oven. There were no measuring cups so it was hard to make/follow recipes.
The water had a yellow color, I was told its because its well water and there are a lot of minerals, but having some form of filtered water would have been a plus.
The neighbors that were next to us at the time were so loud, they woke our whole family up in the middle of night. They were smoking in the front section which made it very useless for us to sit out front. The listing says no smoking, so we were pretty disappointed.
Washing/drying machine didn't work for our side, listing said that we had our own, was told that they were working on a panel upgrade, but we found out a day after our stay that it was non-operational.
The bed and pillows were about as hard as a rock, was not very comfortable.
I felt like there was a little invasion of privacy as there were people right outside our door painting a couple of the days, and working on the unit still.
It does look nice, but I feel like it just quite wasn't ready for us to stay there."
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"My family and I were visiting family and friends from out of town and very much enjoyed our stay at Lisa’s home. Everyone loved the house, along with the pool. Will DEFINITELY book in the future! Thanks again Lisa!"

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Felt right at home.
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Vera's place had all the space we needed. I personally appreciated the office space, where I was able to get up early in the mornings to get some work done. As an interior designer, I thought the furniture in the rooms were arranged well, and there wasn't too little or too much furniture. My daughter's loved the room with the two beds. It probably ly reminded them of home.
Vera was very responsive and was ready to provide solutions for the few minor issues that came up.
The neighborhood is very quite and private. Restaurants and shops are about 15 minutes away.
This is a great plane to stay for a family."

Vera, was a great host."
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Home was spacious, clean and well appointed! Had everything we needed for a wonderful stay! Would stay again!"
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Very quiet nighborhood, off the beaten path, but close eough to restaurants and grocery stores. Outstanding kiitchen area with adjourning TV room......very roomy. We actually stayed here here twice ; 3 days here,left for 4 days, then returned for 3 more days. We had a minor issue during 1st stay and Vera had it resolved by the time we returned. Would highly recommend this place to others and we will book again if in the area."
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Wonderful stay! The home is beautiful. Very clean and spacious. Felt private, cozy and right at home. The owner, Vera, was extremely communicative and took care of a slight issue within hours. Would highly recommend this stay.
Suggestions for future tenants:
The home is very well stocked overall, (kitchen, bedding, trash bags, coffee etc), but be sure to pack any bathroom/shower toiletries as nothing is provided in this regard. Bring pens/paper/office supplies if you plan to use the office.
Also, the mattresses are sadly, not great. Completely understandable for a rental, and manageable for a night or two. But if you plan on staying much longer than this, I’d suggest packing a mattress topper. We stayed 5 nights and this was the only part of our stay that was uncomfortable. Not a complaint, just an FYI for the next family :)
Overall our stay was wonderful. Four minutes to freeway, 10 minutes to stores/shops. This is a legitimate review and we would highly recommend this home :)"
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We really enjoyed the stay, we went to the beach and enjoyed a nice day , the house has everything included for that, thank you very much"
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Second time in Vera's house. Perfect as the last time. Highly recommended place to stay. We'll be back for sure.
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"We (3 adults) had been travelling with 2 kids (3,5 and almost 2), and choosing property to stay was a challenge for us. We were really lucky to find Vera and her property. As a host, she is very welcoming and responsive. We really enjoyed our stay at her house for 13 days. House is new, specious and has everything you need and even more (fyi - including detergent, toilet paper, paper towels, garbage bags, barbecue with a full gas tank, Samsung TV Plus, Internet connection, washing and drying machines, beach staff like umbrella, towels, toys for kids, also a lot of additional bedding was also provided) for really good price. We felt ourselves at home. I will definitely recommend staying at her property to anyone. And we plan our stay there in the near future again."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Great place, just as described, we really enjoyed our stay. House is very clean and well maintained with lots of space and modern amenities. The biggest thing to be aware of is that the house is on well water which was a little harsher than we expected, not an issue at all, just took some getting used to."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Vera was very easy to work with and communicate with. The home itself is very nice and fit our needs. I will say the internet is very spotty and was not reliable at all. So working on the road from this location could be frustrating and the tv was often in and out. Additionally, the bed in the master is extremely uncomfortable. I unfortunately didn’t sleep well during our trip. The home is very clean on the inside and was stocked well with most things you would need during a stay. A couple simple fixes and this house is perfect."
2023-10-01,4.0,Stayed over a week,"The hose was very pleasant. We did have issues with the lock and the cable. My mother in law is 90 and all she does is watch tv, so that was a bummer for a couple of days . The landscape was all full of weeds to the extent I had to hold them back so she could get by with her walker. Overall the home was beautiful. I don’t think the owner goes there very often to check things out."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The house was very spacious and clean, we really enjoyed our stay!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"House was lovely and clean. The only problem for me, which might not be a problem for some, is the master bedroom bed was not comfortable. Extremely too firm.

The neighborhood was very private and secluded and a very nice area to walk, yet just a short drive to stores and restaurants. Vera was an outstanding host, very proactive and responsive. Her number one priority was making sure our visit was enjoyable. We would definitely stay here again!"
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,Many stores and restaurants within 10-15 minutes. Nice walking neighborhood. Trees surrounded sides and back of property so there was privacy. Vera was friendly and responded quickly to questions. Home was spacious and clean. Loved the huge shower in the master suite. Enjoyed our stay!
2023-01-01,5.0,Group trip,"Very clean, new house with well equipped kitchen, nice towels, good water pressure, laundry was great. We didn’t see a single human during our stay, which was just fine with us! Close easy access to I75, Publix and other basics a quick 5 minutes away. Great to be away from the crazy crush areas. Would recommend for a family or couples. We shared the house with two of our daughters and their husbands and everyone had enough space and privacy. We even had our third daughter and her fiancé spend one night before we went to Universal, they used the air mattress in the “office” and were comfortable as well."

,,,"If I could give zero and tell every person to run from this place asap I would, I left the home after about 5 hours, within 5 hours the owner was in the back yard of the home multiple times absolutely no privacy, next the home has no way to secure your belongings when not at the home, owner has complete access at any time, and I’ll tell you why. We left the home around 8pm to bring my mom home, the owner was in the back yard giving us zero privacy, we felt uneasy leaving the home so I made sure to take all my belongings with me I made sure to put a slip of paper on the tops of the doors locked and checked to make sure all doors where locked, I took video proof of this, we came back to the home around 2 hours later to find the back door was open and the slips of papers on the floor, my only assumption is the home owner went into the house as she was the last one seen directly behind the home. We packed and left immediately. Thank goodness for airbnb getting us set up into a new home RUN"
,,,"In addition to the horrible smell that hits you when you walk in and less than clean kitchen area...it was not a private suite. Its more like a room in a house and they put a door in the hall. You can hear conversations and their TV. Word for word. If you can hear them they can hear you. Pics are out of date. No seating for eating in kitchenette and no desk - its being used as tv stand.
I spoke to host about my concerns. She offered no solutions. She agreed to process refund but never did. Despite several calls and emails from airbnb and me she did not reply.
Airbnb processed a refund for my stay minus fees on my behalf due to the proof i sent (pics of dirty kitchenette)."
