2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Home in Jackson, by Lauren, was the perfect accommodation for our short family visit to Jackson. Everything in town and the surrounding area were easily accessible. The unit was perfectly outfitted with everything we needed. Lauren was very responsive and an excellent host. We felt right at home and will definitely stay at this unit again next time we visit."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Perfect location and excellent value for the area
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"What can I say?? This place was fantastic! I was a little concerned because there were no reviews, but everything was even better than I had hoped. The place was immaculate, beautifully decorated, and in a perfect location to walk to all the restaurants and shops. We loved the gorgeous views of the mountain from the wrap around porch. Lauren was incredibly helpful and responsive. 10/10 recommend."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great stay! We loved how close we were to the coffee shop and the views were great.
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I absolutely loved my time here. I felt very peaceful. The night sky was the most beautiful I’ve ever seen. The dry cabin was cozy but nice. I didn’t notice when I booked that the bathroom was not attached to the room so make sure to consider that when booking dry cabin. Bathroom and showers were very clean. They have a pool/hot tub, and restaurant/bar on premises"
2024-06-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"I rented a dry cabin for the first time and it was not as scarry as I imagined. Bathroom and showers were 15ft away. However, the lock on female bathroom would periodically not work during early morning hours. Also, the cabin could get pretty warm during the day even with fan on. It was just as described and 0.7mile away to downtown area with restaurants and a market. Cabin was private and I could not hear my neighbors. Pool was clean and there were always chair available. 2hrs from Yellowstone and 1hr from Teton hike-able tracks. Also 40min away from Jackson hole!"

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We had to pivot our plans to car camp in Grand Teton due to the cold, and this was a godsend to find. The dry cabins are cozy, with a great space heater that actually had us sweating in the night! The only issue we had was some cabins being the same number, but the service line got that sorted out immediately for us!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a great time, and were able to visit Lepark du Grand Teton."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Had the best stay here. Was a little hesitant at first to book the dry cabin however restrooms were a short walk away and extremely clean!

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I was so impressed with this place that I almost don’t want to tell anyone about it! Such an incredible hidden gem, Teton Valley Resort was beautiful, comfortable, and the staff was so friendly and helpful. The on-site restaurant was something I over looked in the description originally, and let me tell you it was a WONDERFUL surprise! The food was absolutely delicious, made to order, and surprisingly affordable. The restaurant staff were personable and attentive, and I truly can’t commend the food enough. I’m already looking planning my next stay!!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great little spot- The hot tub in the middle of a snow storm was MAGICAL.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is the perfect place for a comfy, relaxing getaway. We stayed in the dry studio cabin, yet the restrooms were conveniently located close to our cabin. The staff was very friendly and the food/coffee in the Mess Hall was exceptional. We definitely plan on coming back soon!"

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,This is a well maintained resort with comfy cabins and RV stay options. Their dry cabins are cozy and dog friendly! My pup and I enjoyed our stay.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"great place, really clean and next to Gran Teton national park"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great deal and value. If you are ok with dry cabin, this makes an excellent midway place to stay for both jackson hole and grand targhee skiing."
2024-04-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"It’s definitely impractical to not have any kind of bathrooms in the Dry cabins- I would not opt for one of those again. Other than the freezing cold walks to the bathroom, the place was adorable and cozy and comfortable. It was nice that they provided waters and coffee pods, and there was a lovely little essential oil mister running when I got there. I kept plenty warm with the heat fan, and I appreciated the size of the refrigerator (full size freezer and fridge). It was disappointing that they had Christmas lights in March on throughout the night, because it made it more difficult to stargaze. Perhaps they’d consider turning those down at night for this reason, and adding potties or outhouses to the dry cabins- these improvements would have made the entire stay perfect.
There were some great restaurants in Driggs and Victor, and the front desk was empathetic and helpful by providing pain relief when I got altitude headaches. It was a pleasant place for sure!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Clean and staff was helpful.
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Really great place to hit the Targee from. very comfortable and plenty of amenities.
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We had a great stay at Teton Valley resort. The cabin was perfect for two and the restrooms were very close to the cabin.
2024-03-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Nice place to stay when passing through Victor, ID. I probably would upgrade next to not have a dry cabin. Overall, would recommend."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Really nice
2024-03-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,I stayed in the dry cabin. It was as described and comfortable for a couple nights. The shared bathhouse was clean and just a few feet away from the cabin. There was also a hot tub and surprisingly cheap beer at the restaurant.
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Excellent value and wonderful staff. Highly recommended.
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Fantastic stay! Was exactly as pictured and advertised. The cafe had delicious breakfast as well. For the area, was the best priced and super cute. The shared bathrooms and individual bathrooms were surprisingly VERY clean! Quiet area and easy drive to Grande Targhee Resort. Would definitely recommend and will probably go back!"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We stayed in the dry cabin because we brought our dog. The “community bathrooms” were cleaner and nicer than most hotels I have stayed in. They are also individual private bathrooms with shower/toilet/sink, not one giant shared setting like a state park. Very short distance from the cabin. The cabin was perfectly comfortable, clean and quiet. Would 100% stay again ."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Very easy drive to Grand Teton. Perfectly designed small cabin! The showers were extremely clean, accessible, and well stocked. The resort even provided coffee! Would highly recommend for Teton National Park and surrounding ski areas."

2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great time. Would stay again
2024-03-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,Loved staying here while skiing at Targhee. The dry cabin is wonderful and close to the bathrooms/shower. Just wish the hottub had later hours - it was very busy and closed early so we didn’t get the chance!
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Cute place! Wish there was more to do in Victor so we didn’t have to drive to Jackson so much, but still a great place to stay."
2024-03-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Only complaint was in the tiny homes, there was a picture of a bathroom in house but there was no bathroom attached, clean public bathrooms were available but slightly dishonest picturing a private bathroom without one actually being there"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Very sweet place to stay. Cabins are very cute and clean, not to mention that amazing hot tub. Will definitely stay again!"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Clean, easy access, quiet, had alll the amenities needed, easy and quick communication."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,All good
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Great place and location for skiing at Jackson or Targhee.
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"So, should have looked further into what a ""dry"" cabin was! I merely went by the high average reviews when booking...and it is worthy of the high reviews. The place was great, but a dry cabin has no toilet, sink or shower...those are kept in a separate building a 30 second walk away. This wouldn't have worked for a 56 year old man during sleeping hours, especially in the middle of winter, without purchasing a tiny 32 ounce ""urinal"" that could emptied and rinsed out each morning!
Seriously...I think these are great for careful men with a large water bottle...or women able to ""hold it"" and sleep well while holding it...or don't mind one or 3 walks to the bathroom in single digits in the middle of the night!
Otherwise fantastic, clean, cute, comfortable."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Staying here was a blast! Victor is a sweet town that I can't wait to come back to. The online check-in process was wonderful and convenient as we arrived late. The cabins are the perfect size and the communal bathrooms are quite accessible and clean. I would 100% stay here again, especially for the price!"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Amazing stay. So cute and cozy. Would definitely stay here again. Awesome price!!
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Our stay was perfect in our little dry cabin. The shared bathrooms were super clean and close by!

2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Have stayed there before but not in a dry cabin! They’re amazing. Super cool little cabin with everything needed and bathroom/showers are super clean, nicer than the cabins!!"

2024-02-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"The place was small, but generally clean and as described. Odd layout and weirdly large fridge. Bathrooms are a short walk from the unit. All things considered, a decent value for the price"

2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Place was awesome!

2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very affordable nice place to stay at for skiing or hiking the Tetons. Cabin was cozy and comfortable and the bathrooms and showers were easily accessible clean and private.
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The dry cabin room was very clean. The shared bathrooms were fairly clean. There is a shuttle stop right in the resort which is very convenient. The housekeepers are hardworking and the front desk was very nice.
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Awesome place to stay! Everything we needed and no hassle on check in or check out.
2024-02-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Great spot to stay during a ski trip!
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Pros:
The dry cabin was very comfortable for the price. Having a shared bathroom is never ideal, but the bathrooms are spotless and much nicer than many similar set ups. The cabin itself is tidy and has some thoughtful touches. The hot tub was a nice addition at the end of a day of skiing.
Cons:
For a place situated so near multiple ski resorts, it would be nice if there were more hooks, places to hang wet gear to dry out. I was one person, and there wasn’t quite enough places for even my clothes, much less that of a second.
I would steer away from the food in the clubhouse. A little disappointing for the price."
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great location
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Our second stay here and we always love it!

2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The interior of the dry cabin very much surpassed my expectations. Also the bathhouses were very clean and readily available, easy check in/out. Would definitely stay here again if my route happens to cross Victor."
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We stayed at Teton Valley Resort for a ski trip and it was everything we needed. The cabin was comfortable, quiet, and clean. Even though the cabin we stayed in was a dry cabin, the restrooms and showers were a very short walk away from our cabin and they were always clean and stocked with everything like shampoo, soap, etc. We grabbed a breakfast burrito from the Mess Hall and hopped on the shuttle to Targhee to ski for the day then relaxed in the hot tub afterwards and it was a perfect weekend! I will definitely stay again!"

2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Loved staying here for a quick weekend getaway!
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The day of our check in we decided to call and see if we could upgrade to a not-dry cabin with a bathroom and they were super kind in changing our cabin last minute and providing check-in details immediately! While we didn’t stay in the dry cabin, our cabin was pristine and the resort itself was peaceful and a quick drive to Jackson and Grand Teton park. Laundry facilities and hot tub were also a huge plus and very clean! Would 100% recommend"

2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Teton Valley was a wonderful host from the start. They were communicative and proactive in giving instructions. We appreciated the option to check in via your phone before arrival. Additionally, the cabin was exactly what we were needing. It was spacious, cute, and we appreciated the heat options within the cabin. And it would be remiss to not mention the hot tub, arguably my husband's and I's favorite part. When the hot tubs jets stopped working the first night we were there, the lovely maintenance man was quick into fixing the issue. We will definitely be back!"

They even had a nice touch of diffusing lemongrass and rosemary oil in the cabin upon my arrival."

2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful quaint area. Cabins are provided with a small tv, dinning table, fridge, microwave, fan and heaters. At each bed side there are multiple outlets to charge your things. The bed was SO comfy.
You have the options of public or private showers as well as a small store and pool/hot tub at a walkable distance. Very much enjoyed my stay. I will come back again."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We absolutely loved our little cabin! The facilities were great, clean shared bathrooms. I would recommend this over and over, if we ever come back we’d stay here again! Possibly upgrade to the cabin with a bathroom! The food in the restaurant was also really reasonable and delicious! Thanks guys!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We booked this for our trip to the Tetons and Yellowstone because of the great price and location. I was a little hesitant about the dry aspect and having to walk to the bathrooms, since typically campsite bathrooms are not the nicest. I was also concerned that maybe it would not be the cleanest since it is pet friendly. However, this place was much nicer than I expected. The cabin was adorable on the outside, and modern and clean on the inside. The bathrooms were a very short walk and were the cleanest I have ever used in similar settings. Staying outside of Jackson Hole in the small town of Victor with a view of the mountains in the distance made it feel like you really got the whole experience. Communication was excellent and the staff at the main office were friendly and helpful. Last but not least, there is a little cafe by the pool and hot tub that serves coffee and a few breakfast foods. If you are looking for a quick and hearty breakfast, the breakfast burrito is amazing!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,loved staying here while visiting the Tetons. Hot tub was phenomenal after hiking.
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,My favorite place to stay when in the Grand Teton area. Hosts are responsive and the cabins are so cozy! Super close to Victor.
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Loved the stay! The cleanest, public bathrooms ever!! Great location from all of the dry cabins and never felt scared to go by ourselves. Amazing front desk staff, kind, and always helpful! Restaurant options in town that are great and 45 min drive to Jackson! Would definitely stay again!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Clean room and bathrooms, provided soaps in shower, nice location. Hot tub closed early the night that we got there and were excited to get in, but it was really nice to enjoy after enjoying a sunset and looking up at the stars the next night!
Microwave and fridge was clean, no paper products in the rooms, but the front desk did provide us with some when we went to ask. They were also very kind. We would definitely stay here again in the future!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great location, great price! Loved it!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Great location, especially if you have pups! Close enough from Tetons (45 - 1hr) and Jackson Hole (30 min) and not terribly far from Yellowstone (2.5 h). Will definitely stay here again next time!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Our stay here was amazing! Such a cute and cozy place to stay, exactly as pictured! And extremely clean, not only the cabin itself but the shared bathrooms/showers. I would stay here again."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Overall the space was great. Simple, cozy cabin. Walking outside to the community bathrooms was a bit cold in the mornings, but not too bad. We used the pool and hot tub at night which was great. The location is close enough to Jackson and the Tetons that it made for a great place to stay. Thank you!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,pattie was so helpful & communicated amazingly!! worth every penny & more to stay here!
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Amazing location! Very peaceful! The resort was clean and close to Tetons and Yellowstone. Great deal to be close to both parks. The drive to both was beautiful. The resort has so much on hand for guests. Very nice and helpful. The dry cabins are great and all located close to bathrooms and showers.
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"So beautiful, we were nervous to see before we arrived but we were turkey shocked once we saw the resort. absolutely beautiful and the cabins are spotless! Beautiful location and not far drive to the Tetons over the mountain pass!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Would definitely stay here agan. We used it as a home base for day hikes in Grand Tetons and was only approx 45 minutes to the park entrance. The cabins were cute and clean, and all the amenities were great, especially the hot tub!"
2023-09-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Good place to just chill. Takes about 1 hr and 30 mins to Jackson hole due to construction
2023-09-01,3.0,Stayed with a pet,Place was excellent except the two things found between the sheets.
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,We stayed in a dry cabin and we loved it! It had everything that we needed and the shared bathrooms/showers were very well kept. We took advantage of the pool and hot tub and met some friendly travelers. Highly recommend!
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Easy to find and check in process was a breeze. Nice clean facilities. Only about 1 hour from Grand Teton and 2 hours from West Yellowstone. Would stay again!
2023-09-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Pretty nice place. Quiet and relaxing. We stayed in the Tiny Dry Cabin which was expensive for not having a bathroom.
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,great place to stay near gtnt. Lots of food options nearby.
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Cute little cabin! Very clean and had everything we needed. No bathroom in unit per the dry cabin but bathrooms were only a short walk away. Would stay again !
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was a real adventure for me. I was traveling alone and realized I booked the dry cabin for three nights. I didn’t think I could go without a private bathroom! The woman at the front desk was SO helpful. She ended up putting me in three different rooms, over the course of my stay to try and get me a bathroom at least two of nights.
So I stayed in cabin 45, 11 and 71! Cabin 45 was a queen cabin. What a gem! The best of the rooms. Loved it! Then 11 was two queens, this room lacked the charm of 45 and had a couple minor issues.
The dry cabin was just as advertised. It’s actually adorable inside! So fun. And I did ok using the shared bathrooms. For me I just always went to the bathrooms closest to the RV park. They are private and lock. That’s really helpful if your showering etc.
If you’re adventurous I’d say give the Tiny Cabin a try.
All three rooms had some things like the inside door locks not working or other little things. But all in all a fun stay."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay for Tetons. More rural than Jackson. Hotub/Pool were great after a hike.

2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Teton Valley Resort is the perfect place for a relaxing, secluded getaway, and a great base for exploring Grand Teton and Yellowstone.

2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Very easy check in, beautiful scenery, and very friendly."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We used one of the dry cabins as our ‘home base’ while exploring Grand Tetons and Yellowstone. Very nice and quaint but enough people to be sociable. It was like a small village rather than a big grand resort. We loved it and would definitely recommend it as place to stay of you’re in the area.
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This place was amazing! I can’t say enough good things about it. From the cozy little cabins to the hot tub and cafe! Will def be back!!
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Absolutely loved our stay. Great location to relax after adventuring in the mountains.
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Cabins are very cute and set up really well! the price is a little high in our opinion for a dry cabin but we didn't have a choice since our other reservation cancelled on us. Overall it was a good stay and the receptionists were very nice.
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful place with awesome amenities! Staff was super friendly, cabin was cozy, and the hot tub was amazing after some long days of hiking. Short drive into Jackson and delicious restaurants in Victor. Would definitely recommend staying!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Loved staying here, super quaint and sweet. The surroundings are amazing and the bathrooms were close to our cabin. Will stay again."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,This place was a great deal! It’s about an hour to most of the hikes in the national park - but I preferred the little town of Victor to Jackson. Lots of pretty hikes closer by too. Facilities were all clean and well maintained. There are private bathroom/shower rooms available so I really didn’t miss the running water in the dry cabin. The little bistro in the lodge is super convenient.
2023-08-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"the facilities were great, everything was very clean and tidy. would definitely recommend!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Overall, I really loved the Dry Cabin at Teton Valley Resort. It was perfect for my husband and I and a few nights to be close to Jackson and the Tetons. The cabin was very clean, the bed was super comfortable, access was incredibly easy, and the amenities were great--the hot tub and pool even with people had space for us, and even stayed open a little late one night when the hot tub was full, and the pickleball courts were nice and always available for us. The only thing we were disappointed with was that the bathrooms didn't match the photos (there were individual toilet and shower stalls in a classic campsite style bathroom), but they were very clean and always available. Thought it was awesome overall and would definitely stay again!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,I will certainly stay here again!
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We loved our stay and enjoyed visiting the Tetons!

2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great space with everything you need. The main office was helpful with our questions.
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"An absolute gem! Stayed here while traveling cross country/ exploring Yellowstone and the Grand Tetons. The space was very comfortable, clean, and the staff were all so kind bf very responsive. The bathrooms were attached with showers and were kept clean. We appreciated that they even had a laundry room. Didn’t utilize the pool or hot tub, but it was definitely popular when we were there. The little cafe/ store was awesome and the food was delicious! Space was also very dog friendly with lots of space for a little walk. It’s located near a little town with plenty of restaurants and food options (although places closed between 8-9pm and coming from a city, certainly not used to earlier closing hours). Would recommend 11/10 if I could!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We loved our stay!! It was perfect for a few days to explore the Jackson Hole area!! Everything was super clean! Would love to stay again in the future
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This stay was absolutely perfect for my partner and I. It’s fairly close to the Grand Tetons National Park (40min) and Jackson (20-30min) where we spent most of our time. This place also had great places to eat right in the town. It was a lovely was to wind down in a comfortable and private area with a pool and hot tub.
2023-08-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"My 14y old son and me travelling in August across the United States. We stayed 2 nights in Teton Valley. In the 1st night we arrived very late and the access to our tiny house was very well prepared, the envelope with the access information for the house were pinned outside at the pinboard next to the desk. The room itself we received clean and well prepared. The room was a bit hot due to summer peak season, so after open all doors and windows for 30min after sunset it getting comfortable to sleep.
The entire area is well maintained, the pickle ball was great, pool was open, but we did not used. The common shared wash house was clean and appropriate for 2 nights stay. We used the laundry (wash maschine and dryer) for a small fee 2$/each - worked perfect. The staff all the time really friendly and helped finding solution (my credit card issues). So for a stay longer than 2 nights I do recommend the tiny houses w/ own bathroom and be better equipped.
We can recommend the location :-)"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Absolutely loved our stay at this adorable resort. We had everything we needed! The pool and the hot tub are great additions. We will definitely be staying here again!

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Daniel’s place was wonderful. Superb location, beautiful condo, comfortable furniture and bed. Kitchen, balcony, and dining table were all excellent. Daniel’s photography was a nice touch – he’s very talented."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Words alone cannot praise Daniel’s place enough. The photos listed show you what to expect, but upon entering, the spotless rooms, the view, the perks (fireplace, soaking tub, double head shower, high-end bedding, abundant kitchen appliances, washer/dryer, etc) far exceeded expectations. Perhaps the biggest luxury was Daniel’s beautiful photography displayed in the apartment, and even throughout the building hallways! If you have any appreciation for art, nature and color, you will enjoy his talent. The location and ease of using the parking garage also elevate the experience. There’s so much to do in the walkable town, restaurants and shopping, all friendlier than the next, and Daniel provides a thorough list of recommendations. This spacious, beautifully furnished, clean, comfortable home is topped off with the balcony and fabulous view of the mountains. Book it now, it’s worth it. Thankful we did, and 100% plan to return."

2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Within the bustling heart of Jackson town, we found ourselves a sumptuous haven, perched aloft, a jewel in the crown. This condo, luxurious and fine, with fireplace warm and inviting, became our retreat, oh so divine, its comforts endlessly delighting.
The deck, private and covered, did offer views most splendid, where morning brews and evening wines were enjoyed, our spirits mended. The town's square, but a stroll away, did beckon with its charm, where shops and feasts lay in array, and streets did bear no harm.
The chamber and the living space, with art and comfort blend, did host us with unmatched grace, our weary souls to mend. And though the nights were cold and long, the fireplace's gentle glow, did fill our hearts with mirthful song, against the frosty snow.
In this condo, high above the town's lively face, we found not just a place to rest, but a luxurious embrace. A haven where every detail, with thoughtful care, was wrought, in Jackson's heart."
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Daniel’s condo is perfection! Beautiful, modern, comfortable, functional, incredible view, walking distance to everything. We didn’t even need to rent a car- you are steps away from all of the bars and restaurants and the START bus to Jackson Hole ski resort. Daniel was responsive and easy to communicate with.The bed was like sleeping on a cloud, and the soaking tub and fireplace were perfect after a long day skiing. His photography is stunning! We hope to stay here every time we come to Jackson. Book this place, you won’t regret it!"

It’s walkable to everything in Jackson with great views of Snow King. The place is modern, yet comfortable. Extremely clean with great amenities. Bed was comfortable, appliances worked well (although we ate out a lot more than we cooked), and parking was covered and easy. No complaints, no suggestions."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We were originally scheduled to stay at the fanciest hotel in Jackson for almost triple the price, and then we found Daniel’s place. It was way more spacious than a hotel room and the location is amazing. The balcony is huge and has incredible views of snow king mountain and a bbq.
It also seems Daniel is a world class photographer and he has incredible images of wildlife and the Tetons around the unit and in the hallway, an added bonus."

2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Awesome location! The condo was very clean and everything we expected!
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This condo is in a great location, an easy walk from the central area but enough blocks away to be quiet at night. It is well-furnished, comfortable and spotlessly clean. And it has a reserved garage parking space, too. We went for a week of hiking and thought it was perfect!"
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This place is amazing! The condo is immaculate and has everything you will need. Daniel is great and will answer questions you have for the town! We hope we can come back and stay in the near future!!
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Daniel’s condo is located downtown Jackson, the perfect walking distance to shops and restaurants. His condo feels quaint and luxurious. All the details from the pillows to the kitchen equipment/supplies are all top notch. You could tell a lot of thought was put into making his guests feel at home. The oven even has a sabbath mode! The balcony has a beautiful view and catches the afternoon sun perfectly for enjoying the warm rays. Daniel was quick to reply to any questions we had. If I get back to Jackson I would definitely stay here again."
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Perfectly situated on the edge of the “downtown” core so everything is walkable, with lots of options nearby to get to the ski resort (tip: talk to front desk at the hotel to see if they have space on the direct one!). Beautifully appointed kitchen, dining, and living rooms with everything you’ll need to be comfortable and enjoy meals made at home or picked up. Bed and bathroom were also very comfortable; two shower heads are awesome! Would definitely stay here again if we come back to Jackson."
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Beautiful condo! Sunny and bright! Beautiful views great location! Very quiet as well!! Daniels personal touches and attention to hospitality made a lovely stay!
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,Awesome place in town. You can walk everywhere and yet still be in a quiet environment. The indoor parking is a real plus in the winter. Apartment was clean and had everything we needed. It was perfect for us and we would come again in a heartbeat. Daniel was a fantastic communicator as well...and his photos are awesome!
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Had an absolutely amazing stay, condo was beautiful, view was beautiful. Was the perfect place for our honeymoon. Thank you!"
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Daniel was a great host. His condo and photography is beautiful. We really appreciated the guide he left (we checked out the sunrise/sunset spots). Everything was really thoughtfully done. We’d 1000% stay here again.
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This place is perfection! If you’re on the fence about whether or not to book, just do it! You won’t regret it. We felt so comfortable. Great view, amazing location walking distance to town square and next door to a brewery. The heated parking during all this snow was a game changer! And we were lucky enough to catch the NYE ski torch run and fireworks out our windows. Thanks for everything."
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We were thrilled with the close proximity to town! Just a quick walk to the town square and restaurants. The fully stocked kitchen was great for a dinner in. The views were fantastic!
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Wonderful condo with all modern conveniences and the host was very responsive, nice and attentive."
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great host and Stay
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"When my family and I travel, we almost exclusively stay in Airbnbs and Daniel's home was one of the nicest we've ever seen. INCREDIBLY clean, spacious, well-designed, fantastic location, great amenities, safe & convenient parking, and an unbeatable view. Daniel was super responsive to all my messages and even gave tips on where to go and what to see in Jackson. Super close to Grand Teton National Park (20 mins) and Yellowstone (1 hr). Absolute gem and would not hesitate to stay here again!"
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Wonderful, clean, great location. Space to spread out. Perfect for a Jackson getaway, we couldn’t recommend this place more!"
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Wonderful property! Spotlessly Clean, spacious, high end appliances. Great soaking tub, large walk-in shower. Balconey was perfect for end of day relaxing. Good value."
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Daniels’s place is perfect for a trip to Jackson. A great location, close to everything, but far enough away to be a great retreat. He’s an incredible host and this is one of the best properties in Jackson!"
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Wonderful stay! Conveniently located to everything, but just far enough away from the crowds in the square to be a nice escape. Highly, highly recommend! Will definitely be staying here when we return to Jackson."
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Amazing stay!
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Excellent location two blocks to the main street but quiet with a great patio and view. Very good and clear communication and checkin. Highly recommend!
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Nice, clean condo with great amenities, cool photographs throughout, and a good view from its outside porch. My only complaint is the amount of noise that comes from the outdoor hotel pool that's located directly below the unit on the bottom floor of the hotel. We were there in the middle of July, so the pool was being utilized, mostly by kids, essentially from sun up to sun down. The noise echoes off the hotel and water and is quite loud. If you're looking for peace and quiet while sitting outside on the deck, you likely will not find it on a sunny, warm summer day. Other than that, I enjoyed everything else about this place, and Daniel was an excellent host and communicator."
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We booked Daniels condo for the weekend during our wedding festivities and it was wonderful! Daniel was very accommodating to our request for a early check-in. The place was clean, great views of snow king, and easy access to town."
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Daniel's apartment is exactly how it looks in the pictures and how it is described. The location is perfect for walking to everything in Jackson, and the reserved parking spot is ideal since Jackson is somewhat crowded and would likely be difficult to find parking. The apartment is super clean and beautifully decorated! We found everything we needed in the kitchen. And, we enjoyed the comfortable outside patio. No hesitation--this place is amazing!"
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful condo in a great location. Super clean and Daniel is a perfect host!

Daniels place is clean, cozy, stocked with everything you need and walkable to all of town. We loved this place and will definitely book it for our next trip out."
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"What a beautiful unit. Located in a central area to everything in town, anywhere you’d want to go is a 5-10 min walk away. And the inside, breathtaking. Modern appliances and design, with a balcony I almost (and should have) taken a nap on. Would recommend to anyone!"
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My husband and I had a fabulous 5 nights celebrating our 40th anniversary in Daniel’s beautiful condo. The condo was even better than it looks in the pictures.

We will definitely be back for another stay in this gorgeous property!"
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,would absolutely stay here again!
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Daniel was an amazing host. He was very responsive and communicated with us from reservation to check out.
Daniel’s apartment is even better in person than it appears in the pictures. The balcony is a great place for a morning coffee or late night drinks. The apartment is very well located with a short one to two block walk to all the great restaurants and shopping. We walked to some amazing restaurants for breakfast and dinner. Parking access and building access was easy and secure.
If you stay at Daniel’s we recommend eating at Gather, Trio or Local and make reservations in advance.
We can’t wait to come back and visit again. Thanks Daniel."
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We stayed here for three nights after visiting Yellowstone. What a treat! Location is perfect, easy walking to town but away from crowds.

The condo was very clean, spacious, and well-stocked. We could not have asked for a better location. After our days of hiking it was really nice to be able to walk everywhere we needed.
We’d recommend this stay to anyone and can’t wait to make it back."
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Pictures are exactly what you get. Awesome place all around. Comfortable condo and the best part was walkabilty to the town square where all the restaurants were. Building was quiet and easy to find and Daniel did a great job with communicating all the details.
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Daniel's place is beautiful, clean and super comfortable. The location is right in the heart of downtown so you can walk everywhere.

This is a perfect spot for enjoying Jackson Hole and adventuring into the Grand Tetons. We hope to come back again soon!"

Daniel’s condo is a great location within easy walking distance of the town of Jackson. The condo was like new and had all the amenities you would require for any stay. Daniel was easy and prompt with all communications. We had a great stay and would recommend this Airbnb without hesitation. We will be back.
2021-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I literally have zero complaints! If you want a great location and a space that is amazing and perfect then this is the condo for you. The condo itself is stunning with a great deck that gets a lot of sun in the afternoon.
We had a great time being able to walk everywhere in town for meals, drinks, and shopping. Also a nice and easy drive to Teton National Park.
I would 100% stay here again and recommend this property. Thank you Daniel!!!"

2021-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Our stay was truly perfect! We loved sitting on the private patio enjoying cocktails after a day of exploring. The king bed and sofa were very comfortable. The fireplace was cozy. The location is perfect. Quiet and less than 5 minute walk to the square... amazing restaurants, bars, breweries, markets, shops galore. The heated assigned parking space was a wonderful amenity. Daniel’s welcome packet was very informative and helpful with local tips. It answered all of our questions. Therefore we didn’t have to contact him during our stay which is obviously wonderful for all involved :) I can’t recommend his place enough!"

2021-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My husband and I had a small elopement at Grand Teton NP and had the most special time here. We loved drinking champagne on the patio, warming up by the fire, the amazing photography displayed on the wall, and all the local Jackson Hole touches such as cute mugs to drink out of! The host even left us a special bottle in the fridge to celebrate the special occasion. I couldn’t have asked for a better experience because it was perfect! The condo was walking distance to everything in town and had endless choices for dining options! I would recommend Hand Fire Pizza and strolling around the town square park for an evening! We did that after our ceremony. We will definitely be back again in the future for anniversaries and summer road trips! Jackson will always hold a special place in our hearts. Thank you again to the host!"
2021-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"OUTSTANDING !!
The best Airbnb that I’ve ever stayed at so far."
2021-01-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Daniels place is great! Perfect for a couple (plus 1 since there is a sofa bed). The apt is very stylish and has everything you need (especially kitchen wise). There is a balcony with amazing view of the mountains. I would definitely recommend Daniels place! Looking forward to coming again.
2021-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Daniels place exceeded our expectations. It was immaculate and modern but still had the comfort and touches of Jackson Hole throughout. Everything was accessible from the distance into town to the kitchen and other home amenities. We truly loved our stay here and can’t wait to come back.

2020-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"What an amazing location, space and host. This home hits all the marks! Daniel truly cares and makes sure that all your needs are met. It seems so much more spacious than its one bedroom lets on. Easily walk to town or enjoy staying in looking at your gorgeous view. Underground garage parking is the icing on the cake."
2020-12-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Daniel’s place is a lovely place to stay in Jackson, with everything you could need in a home. Plenty roomy with a great kitchen, our week long stay was easy and comfy. Having 2 bathrooms and a washer / dryer was also a big plus."

2020-11-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"My husband and I stayed here while visiting our son who is living in Jackson during his senior year of online college. We were happy with the location nestled between town and the local mountains. The kitchen came in handy since we are practicing safe social distancing during Covid19. I enjoyed the coffee that our host Daniel provided. The balcony is a sunny spot to relax, read a book and take in the gorgeous view."
2020-10-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Beautiful location and great experience! We ran into a few minor issues during our stay, and Daniel was readily available, so responsive and so accommodating.

The gas fireplace was perfect for chilly fall days. We didn't end up grilling but there is a nice grill on the patio, as well as a big comfy outdoor couch. Jackson town square/shops and restaurants are all a short walking distance. I would recommend staying here for any occasion!"
2020-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Daniel’s place was amazing! Great location and SO dang clean which was a top priority of mine during these times! The place was beautifully decorated and had an amazing kitchen that we made use of! He also left us a few treats in the fridge since it was our honeymoon! The fireplace was awesome for the chilling Jackson nights and we loved drinking tea out on the balcony facing the mountains in the mornings. Would definitely stay here again!
2020-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This was our second visit to Daniel's place. After we had a change in plans, Daniel was able to accommodate a last minute reservation for the night. He was incredibly communicative and quick to respond. His place was just as we remembered - clean, stylish, and comfortable. It is definitely our go-to when we're in the Jackson area! We cannot wait to return again one day soon."

2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Daniel’s condo is exactly as pictured - beautifully decorated, immaculately clean, and stunning location and view.
Having booked during COVID we didn’t want the enter and exit through the hotel lobby below (the condo is on the top floor above a hotel) but Daniel told us about a side entrance that worked perfectly. The condo itself had everything we needed and the balcony was the perfect spot for a morning coffee or evening glass of wine, snuggled under those delicious Pendleton blankets.
Book. You will not be disappointed."

2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Great place,very clean and modern. Great location. Host is very responsive"
2020-07-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Enthusiastic 5 stars for Daniel's condo and his hosting skills! I booked this wonderful condo on March 3rd, just before COVID hit, so I was worried we'd be unable to visit Jackson in July as planned. Every time I reached out to Daniel with a question or concern, he replied immediately and was always reassuring. Given the global situation, I didn't really believe we'd be able to go until we were on the plane. But we had the most wonderful time! The condo was perfect for our family of three. Our teenage son slept very comfortably on the pull-out sofa, which was actually inflatable (which I'd never seen before) so it was much more comfortable than a regular pull-out sofabed. The kitchen was fabulous with everything we needed. When we arrived, we hit two grocery stores (suggested by Daniel) and stocked up on necessities for the week. Given COVID, we ate at home more than on most vacations, and it was perfect. Each night we ordered takeout from one of the fabulous local restaurants and would walk five - ten minutes to pick it up. We'd sit outside on the lovely deck and dine al fresco! The 1 1/2 bathrooms were good-sized, and we used the washer and dryer after many dusty hikes. The master bedroom and walk-in closet were great! The bedding for both with master King and the sofabed were super soft and luxurious. We also appreciated the ROKU enabled TVs so we could sign into Netflix or Amazon and watch movies at night. Before our visit, Daniel sent me a list of suggested companies for whitewater rafting, nature hikes, etc., and many restaurants. We love YELP, but were also thrilled to have recommendations from a local. Daniel also left us nice touches: coffee, a bottle of wine, and a big container of Lysol Disinfecting Wipes! The location was perfect....just a few blocks from downtown, but in a relatively quiet area. From previous trips to Jackson, we knew we wanted to be walking distance to town and we were 100% thrilled with this condo. His gorgeous nature photos on the walls and tasteful decor were a bonus. We will absolutely book this unit again when/if we come back to Jackson. Thank you, Daniel!!"
2020-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is the perfect place to stay in Jackson Hole. It is beautifully decorated, everything is top of the line. Daniel’s beautiful artwork adds to the enjoyment We totally enjoyed cooking out on the grill and sitting on the balcony. The location is perfect for walking to town and all of the great restaurants. We will definitely stay here again."
2020-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Daniels place has all that you want! Unbelievable location, perfect styling, comfort, and amenities! We enjoyed walking to downtown restaurants and coming back to sit outside and enjoy the patio. The soaking tub and shower are top notch! The kitchen is thoughtfully stocked. Washer and dryer were beyond useful. The photography though out is stunning.
I can’t say enough, stop looking and book this place if available"
2020-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Daniel's place is wonderful! Very clean, lots of stylish touches, and close to everything great that Jackson has to offer!"
2020-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This condo is superb. It's location is great, near to Town Square in Jackson. Daniel was super responsive and his condo is very nicely decorated. The kitchen is well equipped which is great since we tend to cook more than go out to restaurants. We also really enjoyed that spacious balcony in the evenings after a long day out hiking. Thanks Daniel!"
2020-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Look no further. The minute we walked in the door, we knew we made the right choice. This modern condo is the perfect blend of style and comfort. It has everything you need to explore Jackson and the surrounding areas. We loved the patio facing Snow King and spent every afternoon taking in the view. Daniel thought of everything. The kitchen is well stocked. The bed is comfortable. The building is in a great location. We enjoyed the beautiful photography and book collection. We hope to visit again soon."
2020-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Amazing photography, decorating and location in town"
2020-05-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"Daniel's place in Jackson really exceeded my expectations -- the condo is in immaculate shape, has top appliances and is very clean. The unit is tastefully furnished, much more so than the pro forma furnishings you might expect in a typical Airbnb. Someone has clearly spent real time and money outfitting this unit. Would definitely stay again in Jackson and recommend staying here without qualification."
2020-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"What a fabulous condo! The location was perfect for exploring the town and all the great restaurants were walking distance. The view was stunning and the interior of the condo was very comfortable and beautifully appointed. It was perfect for 2 people, however it would be more than comfortable for a party of 4 because of the second bathroom. We will be back!"
2020-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Let me be the first to thank Daniel for providing such an amazing condo in the middle of a very interesting town! Everything was as advertised and more- the place is extremely roomy, the pullout bed easily fits 2, the kitchen is fully stocked, and the overall ambiance is very relaxing- from the Teton artwork to the coffee table book. I would say my favorite part was the location- w/in walking distance to anything you want to do in Jackson. We were only there for a weekend but it was the perfect spot for a little boys trip. Would recommend to anyone!"
2020-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We loved our stay at Daniel's place! The apartment was stylish, comfortable, and so convenient to downtown Jackson. Daniel went above and beyond to ensure our stay was perfect - even purchasing a humidifier when I was having difficulty adjusting to the dry air. We wouldn't hesitate to stay here again in the future!"
2020-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Daniel's place is delightful - perfect location, clean and well decorated. It truly exceeded all of our expectations and then some. I highly recommend."
2020-02-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Where to start ...
You can't go wrong with this condo. It is perfectly located within easy walking distance to Jackson and all the shops, galleries and restaurants it has to offer. In this cozy oasis that is spacious, comfortable, well-appointed, inviting and interesting, we felt completley at home.
Daniel, our host, thought of everything. By that I mean you don't need to bring anything - sundries, paper products, cleaning supplies, basic toiletries, and laundry detergent were all provided. Every appliance is professional grade and easy to use.
The bed was uber comfortable and one amenity that delighted us because it's not in the pictures was the walk in closet.
Views to the Snow King Mountain were welcome windows to local activities and reminders to GO OUTSIDE.
A highlight of this space are Daniel's photographs. He's brilliantly created a neutral canvas where his art is the star of the show. He even has photos in the outside hall so you can't miss your home away from home. They are all beautiful reminders of where you are and what's around you.
Daniel responded quickly to every question and provided clear directions making checkin and checkout effortless.
The most easily overlooked amenity ... that parking space in a covered, heated garage! That's worth gold on a freezing winter morning!
If there was a flaw in this setup, we couldn't find it. We wouldnt hesitate to rent here again.
Thanks, Daniel, for sharing your amazing space."
2020-02-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,What a great location and condo!! Highly recommended and I will be back thanks dan
2020-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had just spent the weekend staying at a suite at the Four Seasons in MD for our wedding and this was the perfect segway to a private vacation rental. Daniel and his condo are Four Seasons quality.
The condo is beautiful and has literally anything you would need!! The kitchen was fully stocked to make breakfast in the morning before skiing and a nice steak dinner one night. There wasn’t a single thing we wished we’d had.
The bed was amazing as were the bathrooms! The overall living space was exactly what you would want with a spacious couch, big tv and our personal favorite - gas fire place ❣️
The location is beyond perfect - anything you could want is within a couple blocks and a 15 minute drive to the resort to ski.
But aside from the actual condo Daniel went above and beyond to make our stay perfect. He was always so kind and responsive! I never felt like I was bothering him and felt as though he made an effort to see us as more than just guests. Hopefully we will have another vacation out to Jackson and we will surely be coming back here!!!"
2019-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"A 5 minute walk from the famous Jackson Hole Town Square (Antler capital of the World) ) lies a private, spacious Condo refuge- Daniel, the Condo’s owner, made our self checkin easy with his detailed directions & prompt response to any & all of our questions.
Convenience, Comfort & Cleanliness sum up our delightful stay at Daniel’s 4th floor condo. The Condo is professionally & tastefully decorated & accented by Danial’s own nature/Teton themed photography. Little extras like A package containing locally supplied Mursells Candy & a generous portion of freshly ground Snake River Coffee set the tone for a truly satisfying experience.
From the comfort of the 4th floor balcony you can soak up Gorgeous views overlooking the nearby Snow King Ski Resort.
The strategy that worked well for us was to savor the views, relax a bit by the fireplace in the Condo, or, chill out on the balcony, then, stroll downtown.
To access street level simply take the private elevator or stairs. It’s a quick 5 minutes to stroll into town. If you have a vehicle, it’s kept warm and cozy in the secure, heated garage with keypad entry, also accessed from the elevator or stairway. But numerous restaurants, boutiques, art galleries, pubs, coffee shops and shopping opportunities await just minutes by foot, so why bother with the hassle of parking? We enjoyed meals at: Bin22, Snake River Brewing, Local Restaurant & Bar, Persephone Bakery, Pearl Street Bagels, Starbucks, & Cowboy Coffee. All within walking distance of the Condo. But these are just a sampling of the many dining options available close by. (When you elect to explore by driving, be sure to visit The Virginian, The Bird, Calico & The Mangy Moose).
Back at the condo, Convenience abounds with pristine JennAir appliances to handle all of your provisions. Full size fridge, gas stove, sink & dishwasher (and all utensils) in the pristine, spacious kitchen make food prep/cooking a breeze. You can have a quick snack at the kitchen island, or, something more formal in the dining area.
After dinner, relax on the outside balcony or inside on the spacious couch facing the gas fireplace and TV.
At bedtime, the dual shower provided a relaxing finish to our days. You can also choose to relax in the full size bath tub. The incredibly comfy king size bed quickly persuaded a deep and relaxing sleep.
To anyone seeking a spacious solution with privacy & convenience in Jackson Hole, we highly recommend staying at Daniel’s Condo!
We anxiously look forward to our next visit!!"
2019-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This was by far one of the best and easiest Airbnb experiences! An amazing location, in walking distance to Town Square, skiing, and amazing restaurants. Daniel's place was new and pristine with everything we needed, and more. The views were an added bonus! Highly recommend staying at this fabulous spot in Jackson Hole!!! Daniel is a rockstar of a host."
2024-06-01,5.0,Group trip,"What a beautiful home! Plenty of space for the whole family. Kitchen had everything you need. We especially enjoyed the outdoor seating, grill and hot tub. Will definitely look to book in the future."
2024-03-01,5.0,Group trip,Great stay.
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Wonderful place to stay in Jackson. Snake River Sporting Club is a beautiful community and very well kept we would love to come back and see it in the summer. The house was just as described. We stayed as a family of 4 with 2 kids and there was more than plenty of room to spread out. This place would be perfect for 4 couples since all the rooms are en suite. It was a quick and scenic drive into Jackson. Small market and gas station 2 miles away. Only one thing to keep in mind. If you are traveling in the winter and with kids you may want to choose to put them in the back bedrooms. Maintenance shovels snow on the front porch before 6am and it’s loud. Didn’t bother me but wanted to note that for families with littles that need to sleep in. Great place overall and we would book again!
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Stayed for 3 nights in February and the place was gorgeous. Couldn't have asked for a better spot to gather in.
2024-01-01,5.0,Group trip,Loved the home and location. Anka was very responsive and helpful. Will stay again.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Our family of 5 thoroughly enjoyed our stay. The home is beautifully decorated and had all the amenities we could ask for. The home was very clean & comfortable. The location is approx 30 minutes from downtown Jackson which suited our needs.
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"When we were looking for a place to stay near the Grand Tetons, the idea of staying at a busy hotel or lodge was not at all appealing, given the purpose of our trip, to visit the parks and take in the beautiful vistas. This was the perfect rental! Worth the drive. Market/gas station w/in a few minutes, Jackson easily accessible for morning coffees, and The Bird - a great restaurant nearby, filled with locals instead of tourists and an amazing view.
While it is a community still being developed (as shared in description), the house is situated overlooking a golf course so we definitely had a feeling of privacy and solitude. Stunning home. Plenty of space and bathrooms/showers galore. We can’t wait to return!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We had a lovely week long stay at this beautiful property. It is about 25 min from downtown Jackson and there is a small fully stocked store about ten min away (no restaurants right by the home). We hope to come back!
2023-06-01,5.0,Group trip,This house in Jackson is beautiful! The view is incredible and it’s close enough to town. Would recommend!
2023-05-01,5.0,Group trip,"Great, serene location with 5 star finishes and surroundings. Check out meals at the club."
2023-05-01,5.0,Group trip,Great place to stay and relax with family.
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Our stay here was wonderful! The property is in a more remote location in a gated community, about a 30 min easy and scenic drive from downtown Jackson. We loved that each of the 4 rooms and bathrooms were all equal in size and décor! Sitting in the hot tub with the beautiful snowy trees and mountains all around us is something I'll truly never forget! The place was spacious, extremely clean, and comfortable. It had everything and anything we needed. We also got to enjoy many family movie nights after long days of skiing around the cozy fireplace. The hosts were also responsive and friendly!"
2023-03-01,5.0,Group trip,This home is beautiful as well as the location. Anka was very responsive and accommodating. We hope to visit again soon!
2023-03-01,5.0,Group trip,Thanks for the wonderful stay in your beautiful home!
2023-02-01,5.0,Group trip,"This place is amazing: very clean, lovely decor, very spacious, and has a great hot tub! One thing to note is it is located in Hoback, which is approximately 20 min drive to downtown Jackson and 45 min drive to skiing. I highly recommend a rental car with four wheel drive or am wheel drive in winter, as getting to the house can be tricky and expensive for ride shares. The property was beautiful - the views from the bedrooms were absolutely stunning. Anka was very responsive and friendly."
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great host, absolutely would stay again!"
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We had a great stay. The Airbnb was exactly as promised in the listing and truly felt like staying in someone’s carefully cared-for home.
2023-01-01,5.0,Group trip,The perfect location for going skiing or to town. The house was gorgeous and very well set up. The hot was well needed after skiing. Anna answered all of my questions within minutes. We will be back for sure!
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Our family absolutely loved staying at this Airbnb. Beautiful home in a beautiful location. Nothing better than skiing all day and then going back to cook a meal, hot tub with the family, and watch a movie. The host was very responsive and helped accommodate our big family. Thank you for hosting us!"
2022-12-01,5.0,Group trip,"Loved our stay at Snake River Sporting Club! Anka was an excellent host who gave great recs & was very accommodating all around. The home was located in a private, peaceful area just outside of town. We will definitely be back! Thanks again, Anka!"
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This place was phenomenal. My family could not stop talking about how nice this place was. We definitely want to return and would like to try to stay here during the summer too.
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Amazing place!! The photos do not do it justice. It is like a postcard.
2022-07-01,5.0,Group trip,Great location and home! Very spacious and perfect for families and up to 4 couples. All the amenities (including the grill) were great! Would love to come back and stay again!
2022-07-01,5.0,Group trip,A lovely stay - we can’t wait to come back. Anka was very responsive and accommodating.
2022-06-01,5.0,Group trip,Our family trip from Park City to this beautiful home in Jackson Hole was a real success. We truly enjoyed the setting and the well designed floor plan and will be back again!
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Just the most incredible stay at Anna’s place - stunning location and home. I thought the price was a steal for the area and the luxury of the house. I would LOVE to come back
2022-03-01,5.0,Group trip,This home is perfect! The house is EXACTLY as described and even better. The owner is so quick to respond. Will definitely be back.
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Beautiful property with everything you need. The rooms, beds, and baths were all so comfortable. A little far from skiing and town, but peaceful and quiet. We had a great stay!"
2022-02-01,5.0,Group trip,"Beautiful place that really checked all of boxes. 4 king beds with their own en suite, big open layout, amazing views, and owner Anna is great with communicating. We look forward to coming back during the summer. Thanks again for a great stay!"
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"SO MAGICAL! We own many businesses in Wyoming and come down to Jackson and stay at Peter and Annas lovely homes in Jackson/ Teton Village. This one was amazing. Always so clean, neat, organized, private and wonderfully designed! Coming to stay again next week!"
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Beautiful, modern home about 20+ minutes outside of Jackson and right next to a lovely hot springs. We saw elk every day and the scenery was gorgeous. 4 master suites and a large open living/dining and kitchen made this a luxurious stay for our family. Be advised there was no cell service in this area but we were able to make calls using WiFi (strong signal). The kids appreciated the generous movie channel subscriptions and soaked in the hot tub every night. The beds were comfortable and we were all relaxed and rejuvenated by the time our vacation ended. The owner offers the most convenient check out experience ever -not asking any chores of guests at all. We recommend this home without reservation and would stay again."
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was the most perfect house! Location, scenery, accommodations.. the list goes on!! Everything you could possibly need to feel as if you are in your own was there. All four bedrooms were equally sized and had a double vanity in each bathroom. Anna was also quick to respond leading up to my booking. Once I arrived everything was so easy we didn’t even need to connect once when I was there. I will 100% be visiting Fariway 18 again in the future!"
2024-06-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,"In a great location in Jackson. Sheets were a little odd (nothing over comforter). Otherwise we had a great stay with easy parking, close to town, amenities and cleanliness"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Great place to stay right in downtown Jackson!
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Really enjoyed our stay here- team was very helpful and the rooms were clean and quiet. Location was easy to walk to everywhere once we arrived. Would recommend and will stay here again if possible.
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I recently stayed at the Mountain Modern Motel in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, and it was an exceptional experience! Five out of five stars. The place was spotless and well-maintained, which made for a very comfortable stay. Its proximity to the city center was incredibly convenient, allowing easy access to many great activities and attractions. The host was extremely responsive and helpful throughout my stay. I would definitely rebook again. Highly recommend!"
2024-06-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,"Enjoyed proximity to Jackson square. Exactly like pictures and staff was very friendly. Only issue is the amount of noise from staff and other guests. We were woken at 6am from upstairs guests and 9 am from multiple knocks for housing when check out wasn’t until another 2 hours. Also, random strangers were standing outside our door being extremely loud. When I opened door they picked their backpacks and walked down the street."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay in an unbeatable location!
2024-06-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"Very cool rooms on a relatively big hotel lot. Cafe was great, just a little loud. It’s a busy hotel but walls are thin. They provide ear plugs!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This was the most beautiful, convenient, downtown location. Loved the setup of the room and functionality of the space. So pristine clean! We also thoroughly enjoyed the pool and hot tub with our toddler!"

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This house is very new and owner is very nice. We will accommodate the house to our friends definitely next time.
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great location!
2024-06-01,2.0,Stayed a few nights,"We were very upset upon arrival, to be informed that we had to walk a flight of stairs with our luggage to get to our room. We are elderly and my husband has a heart condition. We were told that all the 1st level rooms were taken, this was at 5:50 pm. Some guest must have been informed to make a selection for a 1st floor room. I do not recall any information when engaging the room that offered a choice of room levels. The front desk was no help, they said there was no one who could help us with our luggage. They frankly did not care. I called the the manager at the time but received no response. I am sick of companies that just suck up the money but offer no customer service. Eventually this will come back to bit such companies."
2024-06-01,4.0,Stayed one night,Right in the center of Jackson Hole... Commutable to food & dessert. Amenities were good.
2024-06-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Very good location and clean. Would stay here again.

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,It was amazing!!!!
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Such a cute place to stay! It’s the perfect location for things at the square in Jackson and close and convenient for Grand Teton National Park! We loved being able to come back from the park and relax and recoup in the pool and hot tub. We had a great stay and would totally stay here again in the future.
2024-06-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place and recently updated!
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Check in was great
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very luxuriously equipped motel!
2024-06-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,Nice stay! Lack of captioning on tv. Fee for service or hearing assistance dog.
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Not far from the Teton park so it's useful but it can be a bit noisy with the road next to the rooms. Sadly, the swimming pool was closed"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great place!
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Great place close, very clean, close to downtown."
2024-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay with a lot of walkable restaurants and shops. Only downsides are the mattresses (at least in our room) sink down so much that it can get uncomfortable and you can hear everything outside as if you windows are open. They do provide ear plugs and for the price it’s still great if you don’t mind those two things.
2024-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great place to stay close to the square & Grand Teton NP! Easy, short walk to the square. Would definitely stay here again!"
2024-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,GREAT location and very friendly
2024-05-01,3.0,Stayed with a pet,"Parking is tight and limited in parking lot, and the floor is thin, being on the bottom floor I could hear every foot step in the room above me, our bathroom did not have any, hand towels or washcloths"

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Thank you
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Nice and clean. Great location.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Great place to stay.
2024-04-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"This hotel has modern accommodations with a good location. It appears they recently renovated and painted up everything. The room had a couple of quirks: some lights didn’t work, the air conditioning was non functional, and the bathroom door handle latch was loose in a way that would lock you in if you were inside of it and all the way closed. These are easily fixable maintenance items. The restaurant/cafe was very good!"
2024-04-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,It was centrally located in Jackson and a short walk to the town square!
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,It was a nice clean place to stay. I was expecting it to be two blocks from the square and it was about 5 or 6 but still close.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,the stay was great! the place had everything we need. Would stay here again!

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Thank you
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Great Value, loved the vibe!"
2024-04-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is a hotel that is listed on AirBnb. We knew this, but I could see how some people might not realize this! So this made it somewhat weird checking in because it’s a hotel, but they can’t adjust or do anything if the reservation is made on AirBnb.
Walkable to the square in Jackson Hole and one of the closest places to the square to stay.
Mattress was super soft and uncomfortable, bathroom towels had stains on them, bathroom was super crammed and just outdated / not the cleanest. Actual room was more rundown and dingy than the photos on Airbnb showed! So I wish we could have paid less bc of this. Noise was pretty bad too, you could hear everything!
Very good housekeeping service! Wish we had time to use hot tub and fire pits outside. Lobby was nice and welcoming, lots of resources and maps for the area. Parking was easy and convenient.
Overall, place did the job, wish we paid a little less for what we got, and we’ll probably stay somewhere else in the area next time."

2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great hotel, right on the center of Jackson. Loved that we would walk to restaurants and shops. The only downside was the beds, very springy and uncomfortable. Everything else was great! The outside jacuzzi was just perfect!"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Second time staying there and it was excellent once again. This time I was in a lower level room and the guests above me were incredibly rowdy, I chose not to say anything and it is to be expected during ski season. Maybe ask for second level room if you would like it to be quieter!"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Fabulous location!
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,As advertised and very convenient!
2024-02-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Overall a good stay. Good value, amenities and clean. We liked the cafe, happy hour, and hot tub. Only real complaint was the noise from the idling school bus out in front (in the parking lot) early in the morning of the motel. Our neighbors weren't considerate, but not the properties fault."
2024-02-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Excellent location for skiing Jackson Hole and the bus service was very convenient.

2024-02-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Definitely worth the money, property staff was pleasant and helpful. Great location."
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,great location
2024-01-01,4.0,Stayed about a week,"Motel room/ Airbnb was clean and neat. Lots of hot water and heat. Room was cleaned by housekeeping every day and fresh towels were added. Great location: walking distance or short drive to restaurants,shops and large grocery store. Tours picked us up in the hotel lobby.
Accounting methods were questionable! I paid for my room , in full, 6 months in advance but Airbnb as a rule do not pay the motel until 2-3 days after check in. My credit card was charged daily, the room rate for 7 nights as a pending charge on my credit card. Makes you wonder what Airbnb did with my $1300 for 6 months.
Lots of phone calls and text messages but nothing changed. This practice caused me undue stress my entire vacation.
This practice seems very unnecessary!"
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Motel matched description. Affordable cheap stay in Jackson that is walking distance to downtown. Would recommend.
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Mountain Modern is a great place to stay. Lots of young people, very clean, great location. Quick walk to the town center. Highly recommend!"

2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Loved it!
2024-01-01,3.0,Stayed with a pet,This is a great location to the town square. Parking is difficult as you may not be able to part in front of your room door.
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Great place, near everything!"
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Lovely hotel in a great location walkable to town- pool areas are amazing and we had a wonderful stay!
2023-12-01,3.0,Stayed with kids,"Well I paid for the room in full online. Then upon check in was asked for my card for incidentals which is normal and not a problem. Saw that my card was getting holds put on each night that we were there despite me paying jn full. The rooms are lacking in major sound proofing. You can hear everyone around you. The hotel provides you with ear plugs but you can still hear everything. We had quite inconsiderate neighbors. Not to mention when I brought up the issue of the holds on my card, the woman at front desk wouldn’t let me get in a word in and had to speak over me basically justifying why they were charging my card. Our bathroom fan was also extra noisy.
Rooms were pretty clean but for the money I’d go elsewhere next time.
I also wanted to upgrade my room prior to arrival my messages went unanswered the whole time."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We had a great stay and enjoyed the hotel pool and hot tubs. Fire pits added a nice touch
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great stay! Very close to downtown Jackson. Staff was very friendly. It was nice to learn that there is no early check in fee, if your room is ready whenever you arrive they give you the keys!"

2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Clean, convenient and comfortable. Nothing more you could ask for - especially for the price. Would happily stay again."

2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,everything was almost excellent just that they didn't offer breakfast from there in general everything was very good great location in Jackson Wyoming..
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great, cute place right in the heart of town. Perfect."
2023-12-01,3.0,Stayed one night,"Great location. Bit noisy next to road and could hear neighbors through the walls but comfortable beds. Great outdoor hot tub and pool..
When checking in, they asked for a credit card to place a $10, TEN DOLLAR, hold for incidentals. Check my card afterwards and they tried charging my $125 and some change. My credit card blocked it thankful but very misleading and I read other reviews saying the same thing, I was hoping it was a fluke but clearly not.. Not very cool, to say one thing then do another.."
2023-12-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"For someone wanting to be in the town of Jackson, it would be great."
2023-12-01,3.0,Stayed with a pet,"We stayed in room 413 (first floor) which was right by the lobby. The room was great other than how loud all of your neighbors are. The floors and walls are paper thin. You hear everything. They even had ear plugs on the bedside table. It’s non stop. Every door that closes, every person who walks by your door…..you hear it all night. Other than that, the room was clean and the location was conveniently located. If you don’t have a lot of stuff to lug up the stairs you might want to consider staying on the 2nd floor."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,MMM was amazing! We loved the location in town and how easy it was to walk everywhere. The rooms were spacious with plenty of storage. Our favorite part was the outdoor hot tub with the awesome view of the mountain side and the aesthetic of the hot tub itself. 10/10 recommend!
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Such a cute and comfy place, worth the money 100 times over, we will definitely be returning"
2023-12-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place to crash for the night. Floors are noisy so take the top floor if that’s something that bothers you.
2023-12-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Very close to all the great spots in Jackson!
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,A nice clean hotel room with plenty or gear storage. Great pool and hot tub too.

2023-12-01,4.0,Stayed one night,.
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,The hotel is amazing and very well served. Unfortunately I was charged twice for different payment methods and the second payment that was supposed to be voided in the following days was finally charged to my credit card. Neither the hotel nor Airbnb has taken responsibility and are only pointed out to each other so as not to take responsibility. It's a shame to end up paying twice as much for bad management and that no one intends to help solve the problem
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Nice spot to stay in town, close to everything. Triple M, the café affiliated with the motel, is also very good. The only issue is that the place is a bit noisy, and rooms are not well insulated."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Great location, super clean"
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great location
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great little place next to the town square the national parks!
2023-11-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"This hotel is a great location and a great price, very loud (next to the road, you absolutely need ear plugs). There were construction worker guests up all hours of the night by the fire pits, which made it hard to sleep. I messaged this hotel with some questions and never received a response prior to checkin. When I checked in, they were the disappointed that I booked on Airbnb and weren’t very helpful when I asked if I could upgrade my room. They checked me into a room that smelled like cigarette smoke and I had to go get another room. The faucet in my room dripped all day and night. Overall a good location, not sure I’d return."
2023-11-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Loved a stay in the heart of Jackson, WY! Helpful staff and a perfect location were highlights."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Right in the heart of town. Everything was walking distance.

2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Couldn’t ask for a better location. Everything was walking distance in town with the pool and cafe as a bonus with the accommodation.

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great location for a good price!
2023-10-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,Comfortable stay and walking distance to restaurants and shopping
2023-10-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Our stay at Mountain Modern was nice. The room was cozy and clean, and the hotel is centrally located. They had lots of amenities and the photos in the listing matched what we actually saw. The wool throw blankets were a dream with the surprise storm that came in.
While the staff was very friendly, they were not upfront about charges. I was told there would be a preauthorization charge of $10 for incidentals. However, the following morning I tried to go to Urgent Care for Altitude Sickness and my card was declined. When I logged into my banking app, the hotel had charged an undisclosed hold of $106.47, which ate up my anticipated funds on that card. This violates Airbnb’s security deposit policy, but I was so sick I didn’t go into the lobby to argue about it."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great hotel. I would stay here again on a ski trip because they had a designated place for ski gear.
Only complaint is the walls are thin."
2023-10-01,3.0,Stayed with kids,"Great location. Everything in Jackson is an easy walk. Nice staff. On the other hand, it's clearly an group of older motels that were spruced up to look modern. It still has a lower end motel feel and smell to it. It's a decent spot and can be a good value, but set your expectations accordingly."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Perfect accommodations and location. Clean and nicely decorated. Did miss the coffee maker.
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Mountain Modern Motel was very clean and had everything we needed. The pool and hot tub were very nice as well. We loved our stay!

2023-10-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Our stay was exactly as described by others and the listing. Nicely updated motel! There was mold in the bathroom which was disappointing to see. The beds are also REALLY soft, my fiancé ended up sleeping on the floor due to discomfort from the bed. Overall, our stay was okay! Amenities were nice and location was perfect."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Was an awesome place to stay walkable to everything in Jackson Hole!

2023-10-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"Excellent location, clean rooms. Price felt pretty reasonable. We enjoyed being able to walk into town from our hotel. Had some interactions with grumpy staff members that put a damper on things, as well as almost being hit by a heavy sack of dirty laundry that staff dropped from the second floor."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Great hotel, friendly staff."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Very great spot! This is the second time we stayed.

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great stay at Mountain Modern! Very helpful with late dinner recommendations (loved Annie’s) and within walking distance to everything downtown!
2023-10-01,4.0,Stayed one night,This park-at-the-door motel was in a great location. The parking lots for the motel were full since we arrived later in the evening. There was on-street parking nearby though. We had everything we needed for a pleasant one night stop to the Tetons!

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Great spot conveniently located within a couple blocks of downtown! Room was clean and cozy and the bed was comfy! They have complimentary coffee in the morning, which was a nice plus! It was the perfect spot for us to stop with our pup to check out Jackson on our way back across country! Super close proximity to Teton and Yellowstone too, which were wonderful!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great place. Clean, cool, and comfortable. Excellent location in downtown Jackson. Would definitely stay again."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Good location, comfortable room. A little pricey for a motel."

2023-09-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Very convenient to everything in Jackson Hole. Cute decor and very clean.
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Mountain Modern had a friendly staff and was in a great location. Easy to walk to most places in Jackson. The room was clean and modern. It had thoughtful amenities - a large kitchen sink, mini-fridge, microwave, plenty of shelves, and an area for winter gear. Only two con's from my POV- the room did not have a coffee maker and if you are on the bottom floor and guests are above you the sound does travel between floors. However, because everything else stated, plus the amazing indoor/outdoor pool & hot tub made up for it! Definitely a place I would stay if ever in Jackson."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great place to base out of
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Would highly recommend for a cute, walkable place to stay in Jackson. Price was just right. A lot of cute details in the room. The main hub for the hotel is very well done and enjoyable to spend time in."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Wonderful service, and I really loved the room decor. The bathrooms could use some updating."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We had a great stay. Easy to check in and out. Clean and comfortable.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great place to land. Comfy and perfectly located
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"This spot is a great location in Jackson. Easy to walk to a number of great restaurants and Grand Teton National Park is just minutes away by car. My kids loved the pool and we spent lots of time there when not out exploring.
One thing to note is that when you book through here and your room is pre-paid their billing system will put pending nightly charges (for the entire room) against whatever card you present at check in. Apparently this happens with all pre-paid bookings. Just something to be aware of as it was something that came up and was confusing during our stay.
Good place and a great jumping off point to Jackson."
2023-07-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"Nice, clean, great location, walk to sites and restaurants, easy drive to both Tetons and Yellowstone. Upon arrival you get charged for the room when you have already paid through AirBnb. Not a positive"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Updated motel with super comfortable beds and spacious rooms. Right on the edge of downtown so everything was very convenient. Outdoor pool was nice and warm, fire pit was a great place to finish the day. No negatives about this property."
2023-07-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"Nice place, great accommodations. Has everything you need while on the road. Cafe, nice working area, laundry, nearby restaurants, pool, hot tub, filtered water, atm, etc. Staff were friendly and very helpful. Only reason I didn’t leave 5 stars was there is a $350 holding fee after paying for hotel that I was not told about and am still waiting to show back up in my account."
2023-07-01,3.0,Stayed one night,"It is through a motel company, I wouldn’t have heard of it had I not found it on Airbnb. It’s pretty pricey but then I guess so is the rest of Jackson. It was walkable to shops/dining/downtown area, which is what I enjoyed most about the stay."
2023-07-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"the room was fine and all, but it was nothing outstanding for almost 500 a night"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"The Mountain Modern was SO cute. We’ve paid less for a boutique hotel in the heart of Manhattan, so the price was a little more than what we find reasonable, but it is apparently reasonable for the area and what we could book on short notice. The beds were comfortable and the extraness of the decor and amenities felt boutique-y. We loved being able to use their sister property’s outdoor infinity pool and hot tub. We were really pleased with our stay and regret we couldn’t stay longer than one night."
2023-06-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,"We rolled into town around midnight and the GPS took us the wrong way at first. We found the hotel and lobby, and luckily someone was at the front desk for us to check in. We got a map and verbal directions to our room, which in the dark was a challenge to find because of the multiple buildings on the property.
Once we did find it, the room was spacious and clean. We had asked for two queen beds, but wound up with a king bed in one room, and a fold out couch in the living room, which worked out fine.
The bathrooms were well equipped with plenty of towels, soaps, etc., but the kitchen was strangely sparce, with just one dish towel and two dishwasher pods for our 3 night stay.
The outdoor pool was closed due to weather, but the indoor pool and hot tub were fantastic.
Overall, a place we would stay again."
2023-06-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,"Location was great. Didn’t think the price we paid was worth it for the hotel itself, but it was convenient to walk everywhere downtown."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Great stay with our 2 dogs. Plenty of space & easy access to food & shopping.
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Great place, clean, friendly staff, and very good location to be able to walk to restaurants"

2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Very clean, nicely decorated and reasonably priced motel in a great location in Jackson Hole."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great stay!
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This place was wonderful- newly remodeled, very stylish and clean. The only downside is that no check in instructions were given and we arrived late. The office was closed and we panicked because we didn’t know what to do. However, a few phone calls later, it was worked out."
2023-04-01,3.0,Stayed one night,"It was a clean nice place close to the main part of town! The only complaint I have is we were on a downstairs unit and the guests above us and then housekeeping when they left were extremely loud and woke us up very early! I understand this happens from time to time in hotels but housekeeping could have at least tried to be considerate considering it was early. Also my key card didn’t work when we got in late, and no one was around in the office so the security guy had to let us in!"
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"First time in Jackson Hole (and in Wyoming) - I fell in love! Will definitely travel back. Easy check-in, central / walkable, clean place to stay, etc etc. Wish I could move here. Always important to experience new places. (Environment changes helps promote neuroplasticity!) I had to leave Wyoming back to Valhalla+Smart Light Cell Therapy in Heber City, UT…. But, again, I’ll be back!"
2023-04-01,2.0,Stayed one night,So noisy we got no sleep. Will not stay there again.

2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"fantastic condo. well located and a short work into town and also close to the bus stop to access jackson hole etc. lots of really nice homly touches in the condo, it was warm. cosy and comfortable. awesome communication from Teresa and she was very helpful, made our stay that much more enjoyable. thanks so much !"
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Comfortable 1 bedroom 1 bath condo on lower level overlooking a creek. Very clean and comfortable with Wi-fi, big screen TV, dishwasher and washer and dryer.
A little cold in the winter, however walking to downtown Jackson is only a quick half mile. Skied Jackson Hole Resort which was only 20 minutes drive and the local Snow King Mountain would be even closer. Grand Teton National park is close and condo could be used as a base for that.
Teresa was very helpful on how to get to the unit what rules were, etc. We alternate ski resorts and when we return to Jackson Hole a few years from now I have retained info on this condo in my file for a future visit."
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"A cozy little gem tucked away just a few walkable blocks from the famous square in Jackson, WY. Outside, the apartment faces a quiet river with a beautiful tree and firepit. Inside, the owner has supplied every thoughtful amenity. It's easy to tell she cares deeply about the space and the experience it offers its guests. Highly recommend."

2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We would highly recommend Teresa's cozy and immaculate condo. It felt like walking into someone's home, put together with obvious care and lots of attention to detail. There's always that moment when you first open the door to an Airbnb, hoping for the best, and this one delighted!
A functional, well-equipped kitchen is important to us since we cook lots of our meals when we travel. Teresa's kitchen was thoughtfully put together with everything we needed, and more. Bed was very comfy. Washer/dryer was great, especially after a week on the road with lots of hiking.
Teresa was exceptionally good at communication - very responsive, welcoming, and thorough.
This is Airbnb at its best, when you stay in a place where you feel like the host has taken joy in making you feel welcomed."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Teresa's place was the perfect spot for us! So close to everything downtown that we walked most of the time. Very quiet, clean and comfortable. She had great recommendations for food and things to do. We will definitely stay here again the next time we visit!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Highly recommend this hidden gem!Teresa’s space is very comfortable and the location is perfect. But the best part is the shared yard right on the river - it was so peaceful and relaxing. I’ll be back!
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Perfect place for our visit to Jackson Hole and Grand Teton National Park. Very relaxing and private condo. Within walking distance to the downtown area. Had everything you need, including a full kitchen and washer/dryer. Bed was comfortable. Very nice and accommodating host. We give 5 stars!!!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Teresa’s place is wonderful for Jackson getaway! It’s only a 10 minute walk to downtown and 30-35 minutes to several beautiful spots in Grand Teton National Park. We loved how clean and comfortable the apartment was and you simply can’t beat the location! Definitely recommend to couples looking to explore Jackson!
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Teresa's place was perfect for our 4 night stay in Jackson Hole.
First off, the location was incredible. We were within minutes walking to the best restaurants in town! And to top it off, right outside our front door was the most peaceful, beautiful stream with grassy area, Adirondack chairs, a picnic table, a fire pit, and a barbeque, and it was STUNNING.
The accommodations themselves were exactly what we needed. Full kitchen, ceiling fan in the bedroom, and a very comfortable bed.
Would definitely stay again! Thank you Teresa!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The condo was as described - clean, very convenient walk to downtown Jackson, and great surroundings. I was most pleasantly surprised by how nice the grassy area was along the creek - great place to sit out in the late afternoons / early evenings. Teresa was very responsive and helpful. I’d stay there again."

Would highly recommend!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This is our second year coming to Jackson, and our second year staying here! The location can’t be beaten, and the surroundings, despite being super close to the center of town are quiet, peaceful and naturally beautiful. We will definitely be back!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I highly recommend staying at Teresa’s place on the creek - 10/10. Out of all the places in Jackson, so so happy we chose this one. It’s quiet and private, the creek is beautiful & peaceful. It’s away from the hustle and bustle of the tourism in the town, but centrally located to walk (5-10min) to all the places downtown or an easy drive to the Tetons were we spent most of our time. If i’m ever in the area, definitely staying here again.
Teresa was so responsive, communication was above and beyond. The place was immaculate when it came to cleanliness and very cozy for two. It did get hot some nights without A/C so the extra fan was really useful.
We got engaged during our stay and I loved this location, a really special experience. Thank you so much!"
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Great location tucked away in Jackson with a scenic grassy area and creek right outside the front door. Walking distance to everything downtown Jackson has to offer, but away from any main roads."
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful spot with Flat Creek right out the front door. Plus, just a couple blocks walk from the main downtown strip. I would definitely stay here again."

2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This apartment is absolutely a perfect place for 2. It is close to downtown but far enough from the action of downtown so it’s quiet for sleeping.

2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great area & quiet location!
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This condo on Flat Creek is a gem. The setting is quiet but within walking distance of Jackson Square. It is one of the cleanest Airbnbs we have stayed in, with a nicely equipped kitchen. You can tell that much love has gone into this beautiful condo."

2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Great location close to everything and lovely setting next to a brook. Thoroughly enjoyed our stay at Teresa’s place.
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Teresa’s condo is in a PERFECT location. Close enough to walk to all downtown Jackson has to offer but enough outside of town to get some peace & relaxation. We will be back for sure!!
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Location, location, location ... walkable to historic Jackson and an easy drive to the Grand Tetons. The condo itself is very comfortable and well-stocked. And we loved spending time out back in the Adirondack chairs, watching Flat Creek and the resident beaver(s)."
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Teresa’s place is exactly as listed. It’s a quaint and quiet place close enough to everything without carrying much of the noise of the town. The water nearby is very calming and we had a beaver buddy stop by on the opposite side every morning and evening! We will definitely try to stay here again if we come back to visit the Grand Tetons!
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Excellent stay,
very well-equipped apartment.
Very friendly host and always reachable.
Riverside residence setting perfect for relaxing in the evenings.
I recommend this impersonal month address as well as hotels in the city."

2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Walking/biking distance to Jackson Square, while you're able to get away to a quiet, peaceful area when you get home right near Flat Creek. We have already booked again for next year! Thanks Teresa!"
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Location, location, location!! You can’t beat this little home away from home that is walking distance from everything in Jackson. We had a wonderful stay and can’t wait to come back!"
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We enjoyed this place a lot. Very convenient to downtown Jackson and the parks. Quiet location and right on a little creek with easy parking and simple access. Had occasionally drop-out with the Wi-Fi but the host was very responsive with communication and their willingness to help get it fixed. It had very little effect on our trip. Overall we had a great time!
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Great place to stay! Super nice with location, and the yard is great for hanging out outside"
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Teresa was a fantastic host. Her communication was excellent and she accommodated our request to stay a day longer because of the unfortunate closure of Yellowstone National park due to flooding. The condo is at an excellent location and convenient to bypass the traffic on either side of town. We highly recommend Teresa as a host and would stay there again if we ever return to Jackson.
2022-06-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"This condo is situated in a perfect spot! It’s clean and well furnished. But, be ready to open windows for comfort because there’s no air conditioning. It was hot in June when we stayed and made it difficult to sleep comfortably. The host is very accommodating and will communicate with you often during your stay."
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I don’t think you can find a better place to stay in Jackson . It was quite, clean and within walking distance to the town square . And it was so relaxing after a day in the park to come back, sit out by the creek and watch the geese. And Teresa was a great host! Don’t hesitate to stay here!"
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Exactly as advertised. Location is great and walked downtown every night. Area is quiet, we did not hear another soul. Equipped with everything you need. Wi-Fi was great. Owner is a great communicator and very responsive. Will definitely stay next time we are visiting."
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Comfortable stay in a walkable location. Teresa was very communicative and helpful.
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"First time in Jackson Hole, and the location was perfect! And the river right outside was pure bliss! Wonderful host and spot!"
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Teresa was very accommodating. We needed to check in a day early due to weather issues & we were able to go straight to the condo with no issues. Conveniently located to the shops & restaurants in town.
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Perfect location next to creek and just blocks from the town square where everything happens! Teresa makes sure you don’t need for anything, very well stocked and absolutely loved our cozy home away from home!"
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,This condo is great and we are looking forward to coming back already. Fantastic location right in town and close to the bus to the mountain.
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Wonderful place to stay for a couple. Perfect location to walk into town with a beautiful view. Would love to stay again!
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Teresa is a great host and goes out of her way to make sure your stay is a pleasure. Great communication. The condo was very convenient, very clean and in a pretty little setting on the creek. A couple of deer greeted me in the front yard shortly after arrival. The condo is well stocked and the development seems pretty quiet. It’s just a 3 or 4 block walk to the shuttle stop that takes you to Teton Village (20 minute ride if you take the express shuttle) or on a loop around town that includes Snow King if you’re headed there. Pearl St. Market is a couple of blocks further but has a good selection if you’re not wanting to ride out to Albertson’s or Whole Foods to stock up and don’t have a car. I stayed 3 days without a car and had no issues getting around. Lots of good restaurants/shopping within easy walking distance. Good value!"
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Teresa's condo is a perfect getaway for skiing Jackson Hole and also enjoying the town of Jackson. My wife and I stayed a week and thoroughly enjoyed our stay. The bed was very comfortable and we slept very well. We made many meals in the ample kitchen. We used the couch to watch TV but did not use the roll-away bed which could be handy if you have children (ours are grown). The condo size was great for us. However, having multiple couples might be challenging, depending on the length of your stay. The assigned parking spot was a convenient distance. For food, we recommend the Virginian restaurant (we had breakfast), the Fiesta Mexican restaurant, and Hand Fire Pizza. For non-ski activities, we recommend the National Elk Refuge Sleigh Ride, the National Museum of Wildlife Art, and driving to the Grand Tetons. Each of these activities are within 2-10 miles from Teresa's condo. Jackson and Jackson Hole are special and staying in Teresa's condo was perfect for our trip."
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"The condo is clean, we'll equipped, and in a good location. The unit is on small side but comfortable for two. It took some time to figure out how to use the television. This was my first encounter with Apple TV and I have to say that I was not impressed."
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Teresa was very accommodating and helpful with everything we asked, the place is tucked away in a nice quiet location right on the creek just outside of town. Perfect location for venturing out and exploring the town."
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The condo was exactly as described. The photos don’t do it enough justice. The condo was better then expected. The hosts were helpful and responsive. The location is fantastic and so close to everything downtown. Will definitely stay here again and would highly recommend anyone visiting Jackson stay here.
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Our experience with Teresa at her Airbnb in Jackson hole was wonderful. The Airbnb was well-stocked, TERESA was responsive and attentive. We were able to watch wildlife out of our living room window.The bed was fabulous and everything was clean and taken care of. Thank you Teresa for a memorable experience"
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,Teresa was a great host. She was attentive and gracious. The place has a lovely view of a stream and the condo itself was quite clean. The free coffee was a nice touch as well as the washer/dryer. Would definitely come back again!

2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"A very quiet and cosy location along Flat Creek with a well-equipped kitchen to serve as a base for your time in Jackson Hole. Being able to easily walk to downtown is a real plus. We found this place to be very clean, and the bed especially comfortable. We also appreciated the ease of use and quiet of the washer & drier . The owner was very easy to communicate with and really focused on ensuring you enjoy your stay!"
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This condo is the perfect home base for visiting and experiencing the many great activities and sights to see in Jackson Hole, Grand Teton, and Yellowstone Park. We loved the location, and the private and quiet feel it has being next to the creek. Not too mention the beautiful willow tree and wildlife that are right outside the door. Also once inside you will find everything is as advertised and more from the Owner! They do a great job fulfilling your every need. Highly recommend this place and will be back here again as soon as we can!"
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Small but perfect condo for a couple. Supplied with everything you need. Exceptionally clean. Beautiful grounds…park like setting right on Flat Creek. Great communication with Teresa! Thank you!
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great location with all the needed amenities. Everything was cleaned and ready early for us with our stay.

Awesome to be on the creek!"

2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We really enjoyed our stay on Flat Creek! Teresa was responsive and accommodating throughout our time there. It was an added plus to be able to wash and dry our clothes before we left town! Would definitely return for ski season!
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This condo was perfect for our 5-day stay in Jackson! It is located on the outskirts of town and is only a few blocks from downtown. It was quiet and the location on the river was beautiful. The condo had everything we needed and Teresa was extremely helpful and thoughtful in her details. We will absolutely check out her condo for any future visits. Thank you, Teresa!"
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great little condo for two just a few blocks from downtown Jackson. Quiet and very clean. Was perfect for our stay at Grand Teton.

2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,PERFECT location! We were able to walk downtown every day and the park was a quick 10 minute drive. The condo has everything you need AND beautiful views right outside the front door.
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We were looking for a place that would allow us to walk throughout Jackson Hole and easily access the Grand Teton Park. This was great. And the flowing stream outside the door was a nice bonus.
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"-The location is perfect for traveling in and out of the national parks.
-The location is short walk to shopping and dining.
-The space is arranged perfectly to maximize room.
-Clean!
-Teresa is great to work with!"
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Teresa’s condo was immaculate. The location could not have been better. It was the perfect home away from home. We will be back!
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"This is as advertised. Just right for two, especially older folks, as it’s on the ground floor. Great location: quiet, but convenient to everything. And, the creek provides a lovely setting."
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Couldn’t ask for more with this AirBnB, it had everything. Recommendations, close proximity to the parks, walking distance to town square, things to take with you on your hike, just a really comfortable place to make your temporary home. Can’t thank you enough for allowing a to stay here, we’d definitely book with you again."
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This condo was the absolute perfect place to stay during our time in Jackson, and Teresa was so kind and accommodating!

2021-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Awesome location to town. Very clean. Easy to communicate and ask questions if needed.
2021-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Our stay at Teresa’s place exceeded expectations. Check in was easy, the apartment was clean and fully stocked with a variety of coffees. We were within walking distance to downtown which made shopping and going out to eat extra fun. We were also pleasantly surprised to find geese and ducks on the creek outside the apartment!"
2021-04-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"Great cozy 1 bedroom condo very conveniently located, just a couple minute walk from the town square in Jackson. Nice touches with everything we needed for our stay!"
2021-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"LOVE this place! It is a wonderful location, just a 5 minute walk from the main area with all the restaurants and bars and only about 20 minutes to Jackson Hole Ski Area. We stayed here for a ski weekend at Jackson Hole and it is the perfect home base. Communicating with Teresa was super easy and the space was perfect. Looking forward to staying here for future trips back to Jackson!"
2021-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Awesome
2021-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Lovely location by the creek, clean, comfortable and had everything we needed. Highly recommend!"
2021-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We originally had plans to stay at a hotel but we were so much happier to find this place given its great location, well stocked kitchen, washer/dryer and comfortable bedroom. It was great for 2 people but perhaps a little tight for more if hanging out (the pull out couch would make it fine for the sleeping setup though). Teresa and Ryan were excellent and communicative throughout."
2021-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We loved staying here and would absolutely stay again if we make it back to Jackson. Teresa was great - I appreciated her proactive communication. We had a few minor questions throughout the week and she responded quickly each time. Check in / check out directions were very clear and easy.
The apartment itself is great. The location is ideal - close enough to walk to everything in Jackson within a few minutes, but set back against a creek in a peaceful little condo community. Everything in the apartment is very comfortable and felt like home right away. It was great to have a full kitchen (especially in COVID times), washer dryer, etc. It was also very clean and it's clear that Teresa takes good care of the unit. The pictures are accurate as well. Highly recommend staying here!"
2021-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"For a little space, it’s very thoughtfully laid out. Well-stocked kitchen. Super comfortable bed. Amazingly helpful house guide with area-specific recommendations. 10/10 would stay again!"
2021-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Very cozy, clean condo in a great location!"
2020-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great stay by the creek. Good value for a modest 1br with everything you need, including laundry. Host was polite and responsive, but they stay was still private feeling. Overall great rental."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"It is a beautiful place! Wonderful location as well, we enjoyed our stay and would definitely stay there again."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great location. Very clear instructions from host...made the stay easy. Would stay again.
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great location, walkable to town. Looks like photos, easy instructions. Host communicated clearly and was flexible with check in allowing us to check in earlier! Would come back and stay here again!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Wonderful stay - great location, great service."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The location and the home itself are perfect for downtown Jackson. The space is super large. Great for couples. Patio in the summer would be amazing to use. We still went out even in the cold weather but could see it being a great asset in the summer! Beautiful place. Would love to come back.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great stay! The location was perfect and an easy walk to town. Additionally, you are within easy driving distance to Teton National Park and Snow King slopes. The space itself is extremely clean, and the hosts are very helpful/responsive!"
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Really enjoyed our stay. The location is fantastic; very walkable to downtown Jackson and just a short drive to ski slopes or hiking trails. The condo is well appointed and had everything we needed during our stay, plus a beautiful view. The only things missing are a hot tub and grill, but we knew going in they are not available at this location. The Outpost staff was terrific, very responsive to questions, helpful with local information and pleasant to deal with. Definitely would stay here or at another Outpost location during our next trip to the area."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Absolutely amazing location. The kitchen was incredibly well-equipped with an impressive array of cookware. The place is big enough for two couples to be comfortable. We really, really, really loved the location and loved how easy it was to communicate with the hosts. Super responsive and helpful. We will definitely stay here again."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Super easy check-in and check-out, and so convenient to downtown Jackson! Would definitely stay again"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We loved staying here! It was the perfect location being able to walk to everything downtown and having a private parking garage and not having to worry about finding parking was wonderful. The bed was very comfortable and everything was as described. The blinds downstairs were broken before our stay so we were unable to close them but it didn’t affect the quality of our stay. The bath towels were really small.
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This location is fantastic. It is in the center of town and close to everything. It is a beautiful space and has very communicative management. We really enjoyed our stay there. The only challenge we faced was navigating the entry at night when we first arrived. We couldn't tell if we were in the right space as the garage was a bit dark and it looked like a service entrance of some kind. Other than that, it was great!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Perfect location for access to downtown Jackson
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful and well-located apartment in the heart of Jackson. Easy walk to all that Jackson has to offer, particularly the Persephone Bakery, which was just a block away. Highly recommended!"
2023-07-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Nice place to stay. Location is prime and parking was nice. No major problems. Exactly as shown in the pictures. Great communication from hosts. Downsides are that AC struggles to cool below 73 during hot days, linens and pillows are 3 star, and generally the place feels like it’s managed by a corporation (which it is), and you should not expect the usual personal touches of a place someone lives in. It’s very clear when you stay that no one has ever lived here. This is a nice corporate apartment. Solid 4 stars."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great place!… location, garage, layout, amenities, and everything else. Very walkable if wanted to go about town. We enjoyed the fireplace, as well as the gated entry. Would book with Outpost again!"
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Amazing place to stay! We loved this place and would definitely look to book here again. Outpost sets up each space so it’s a home away from home, has everything you need. This spot was awesome for walking downtown. Highly recommend!!"
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Wouldn’t have issue recommending this home to family or friends! Great location, great service and exactly what was pictured."
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This place was perfect! Huge, clean, modern, great kitchen and comfortable beds. Walking distance to everything and covered parking. Will definitely come back!"
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Outpost is a very friendly and professional property management company. They were able to accommodate our needy crew and were incredibly responsive. For example, a strong snow storm knocked out the internet in the building. They took care of all correspondence with a notoriously difficult internet provider and had the problem resolved as promptly as humanly possible. We also had weather-related travel issues and they worked with us to make sure we were accommodated for the few days we were stranded. In our frequent foreseeable travel to Jackson, we will be booking with Outpost and recommend that anyone else do the same."
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Great location. Place was exactly as described. Very well maintained property.
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Our stay was fantastic! The place was clean and had plenty of room for us! Owner was quick to respond and was very accommodating! Wonderful stay!
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Amazing!
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Stunning space, and location! The staff were easy to contact, and quick to response. The kitchen was absolutely perfect for cooking in."
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Place was great and well located.
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great stay in Jackson. This is a perfect little unit with almost all the amenities you could ever want. We really wanted to grill, but that's evidently not allowed by the HOA that this unit belongs to. Nothing anyone could do about it and nothing a cast iron skillet couldn't fix. Outpost did great for us."
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Wonderful stay.
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great place. Lovely decorated and location is awesome. Very well stocked, comfortable place to hang out in after a long day. Would stay there again"
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"WOW, what a beautiful stay! We enjoyed absolutely every minute of our six-day stay here.
The unit was so clean, cozy yet modern, and fully true to the listing. We were particularly impressed with the available kitchen tools! We are both chefs and were able to cook up a storm with the variety of pans, tools, and the incredible Italian oven.
We reached out to the Outpost crew for a few things during our stay and communication was so prompt and efficient, they were a great resource!
We are already planning our next trip to beautiful Jackson and will be sure to stay here again!"
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Beautiful, comfortable and great location! Well appointed kitchen to cook at home but also in good proximity to downtown Jackson to enjoy the wonderful restaurants. We will definitely stay here again. Highly recommend!!"
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Terrific place, great location and management did a great job!"
2021-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Everything you need is here for a great stay. The location is great for a quick walk to shops and restaurants.
2021-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great spot!
2021-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Everything you need for a trip with your friends or loved one. Location is literally PERFECT. Walkable to everything in the town, even during the winter. Very quiet, private, stocked with everything you need. It felt like a home away from home and the communication was fantastic."
2021-01-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Fantastic place and location. One block from town square.
2024-06-01,5.0,Group trip,Had a great time staying in this cute airbnb! Loved that they provided plenty of fun board games and coffee. Thanks for hosting us!
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Enjoyed our stay. Loved the coffee and chocolate he provided. Nice extra!!!
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The place was as described and an easy drive to the park as well as Jackson Hole Resort. I would definitely consider staying here for ski season. Kitchen was well stocked and we appreciated Kristopher’s recommendations.
2024-06-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Kristopher is a very good host. His place was clean and very quiet, however the bathroom upstairs is extremely small. I didn't like the fact that to get to it I had to go through a parking lot and past the dumpsters. I wouldn't have felt safe if my husband hadn't been with me. I am older so maybe this place is more for younger people."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great stay! The host was very responsive and helpful.
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Kristopher's AirBnB is top compared to others: the furnishings, kitchen supplies, bathroom supplies, etc. are all top quality products and so much is provided! He provides a nice thought out binder to provide everything needed along with maps & brochures of nearby activities (Jackson Hole, Grand Tetons & Yellowstone). He even has a welcome table for sign in (fun to see where people's home state is) and a basket of goodies (such a kind gesture). The location is outside Jackson Hole in a quiet & peaceful area but a very quick drive to visit Jackson.
I stay in ~3-4 AirBnBs per year for years and this is top on my list."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Loved staying here! Great location and lots of space.
2024-03-01,5.0,Group trip,"Kristopher’s condo was a perfect fit for our group. The upstairs loft was a great size while the main floor queen bedroom was very comfortable. Perfect distance to JH and close to Jackson with easy access to the Start bus. Kristopher was very helpful, friendly and responsive to our questions and instructions were clear. I would be happy to rent from Kristopher again!"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We loved Kristopher’s place and can’t wait to visit again. The Aspens are a great location — market nearby, on the bus line, and close to Teton Village. The condo itself was cozy and well equipped."
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I’ve stayed at the aspens many times and this is by far one the best located unit. The unit also has a great sleeping situation with a king bed upstairs in the loft. Given Kristopher’s willingness to help at a moments notice, you won’t regret booking this!"
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Kristopher’s place was exceptional. The location was very convenient for skiing JHMR with the START bus stop right next door. The accommodations were as described and Kristopher went above and beyond with extra amenities such as a booklet full of recommendations, extra toothpaste and lotion, and a cute little welcome basket! We had such a wonderful time, can’t wait to come back!"
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Stress free and simple lodging. Traveling can get hectic at times- so work with Kris and mitigate the stress as much as possible lol. But in all seriousness, I have no complaints. Will book through Kris again when I come back through."
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Well furnished and supplied. The condo is a 2-3min walk from the shuttle pickup spot so it’s super easy to movr around, especially if you’re skiing Jackson Hole. The market is also a 2-3min walk so it’s very convenient for groceries and even a quick breakfast.
Everything in the condo works and in good condition. Definitely an easy and comfortable stay."
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Super Great location! Very close to the skiing resort (Jackson Hole). Very thankful for the memories here.
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I would give this place 6 out of 5 stars. The place was fantastic. Every little thing you could think of was there. We had coffee, tea, chocolate waiting for us as we entered. The bathroom was stocked with extra toothbrushes and toothpaste in case you forgot, and extra tissues, tp, and laundry supplies. Kitchen had cooking necessities like salt, pepper, and oil spray. Location was very convenient, right next to the market and bus stop, only 8 mins from Teton village. Kristofer was a very helpful and communicative host. I would definitely stay there again."
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place is the best. Convenience is the key at this stay and it’s clear as soon as you arrive. Having the market and liquor store next door for last minute groceries is fantastic. The bus stop right outside really makes it feel like you’re staying in the center of Jackson or the base of the Teton Village after a short ride. Plenty of room for a group of friends or family to cook, eat, and hangout. This Airbnb was also extremely well equipped and Kristopher was great staying available at all times to answer all questions. I’m already looking forward to booking again. Thanks Kristopher!"
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Kristopher was very helpful during our stay! He messaged us the week leading up to our stay, giving instructions and letting us know he was there for any questions or concerns! When I needed to message him during our stay for questions he replied very fast which was super helpful! The place was very clean and felt like home! Definitely would stay here again!"
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"6 out of 5 stars if that was possible. The condo is a great place to stay. Clean and located in an extremely quiet neighborhood. It is clean and has everything needed for your stay from extra extension cords to a full kitchen. Location is great, 5 minute drive to Teton Village and a scenic 10 minute drive to Jackson Hole. There is a market and bakery within walking distance of the condo. The market has everything needed from a toothbrush to a butcher shop and everything in between.
Kristopher is an amazing host. From the moment we booked, he was on top of everything. He is very knowledgeable of the area providing suggestions that made our trip that much better. Upon arrival we were greeted with a little gift basket, showing his dedication to guest satisfaction. His response time is immediate. Kristopher goes above and beyond what is expected of a host. If visiting the Jackson Hole area, Kristopher and his condo come with the highest recommendation."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My party and I were so impressed with the Virginian Lodge. The front desk was so nice and helpful, we loved the beverage station and probably visited it 3x a day, the smores kits were such a lovely surprise for the weekend, and the outdoor fire pits, pool and hot tubs were great. There’s also convenient on site restaurants and amenities. It was so close to Jackson downtown and close to Grand Teton and Yellowstone. We loved our stay!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We had the best experience at Virginian Lodge. The rooms were clean and stylish. There was thoughtful details throughout. We will definitely be back!
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Excellent stay. Great room and courtyard space. Nice to have the saloon and dining options right there!

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This is such an amazing option in the cool city of Jackson. About 10 mins from downtown, walking distance from several eating options and about 20-30 mins drive from Jenny Lake / Grand Teton. The tie-up with AirBnB while operating as a lodge with check-in, a courtyard, an awesome breakfast place next door & the burger joint on the other side, makes it a very convenient stay. 5 stars"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,You can tell they put a lot of work into taking care of their guests. Great amenities and lots to do within walking distance. The cheerful staff here made our stay especially enjoyable.

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was a great place to stay in Jackson. The room was perfectly clean when we arrived. I also loved the style of decoration of the room. The hotel grounds are lovely, especially the inner courtyard. The fire pits were really nice, and the views were beautiful. My only critique would be the shower; there’s no shower door so it didn’t stay too warm in the shower but this wasn’t the end of the world by any means. Overall, a really great stay and I would recommend staying here. Would definitely come back!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Really enjoyed our stay. The location is great, the rooms are clean, but the best part is the outdoor area. Multiplied fire pits, heated pool, and s’more packets and skewers after 7pm. It was a very enjoyable, relaxing, and peaceful stay and we would definitely come back next time!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The lodge was the perfect place to stay if you’re visiting the Tetons! Great location, very comfortable bed and linens, and very peaceful at night. I’d definitely stay here again whenever returning to the area!"

2024-04-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful place with restaurants and a bar on site which was really nice. Plus great food and staff at both places. We loved everything about our stay besides the surprise resort fee. We were charged an extra $83 for three nights (not each night in total) which I had no idea we would be charged. For an extra hundred dollars I felt like we could have gotten a place closer to the heart of Jackson, but unsure if the amenities would have been as nice. Even with the surprise fee we enjoyed our stay and I would stay here again!"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Everything was excellent! The saloon and Billy’s Burger on site were a great addition.

The host was wonderful and very quick to respond with any questions we had. The Virginian Lodge was so cute!

2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The Virginian was a great airport hotel. The room was clean and comfortable and the shower was amazing. All included toiletries smelled fantastic. The staff was incredibly friendly at check in and gave great recommendations.
The only downsides were that there was only one washcloth for two guests and that it was a little noisy due to the outdoor rooms, but those were minor in the grand scheme of things. We truly enjoyed our stay and would stay here again."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We visited the Virginian Lodge in Jackson during the offseason and had a lot of fun. The Tetons were a convenient 20-minute drive away, and the location was fantastic, with plenty of restaurants and bars within a 5-minute drive. The hot tubs and fire pits were great for relaxation, and the rooms were good and spacious. We appreciated the fridge, although an oven would have been a nice addition. Nonetheless, we had a fantastic stay. Just be aware that there is an extra $25 charge per night on top of what you pay on Airbnb."
2023-11-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great location, well renovated in a vintage-lodge style, friendly staff."

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Outstanding service from the front desk, housekeeping and maintenance team made our stay quite enjoyable. The room was clean, bed was comfortable and the grounds were very well maintained. It's an older motel, yet it has been updated quite well. Location is within a walkable mile from the Jackson town square and along the way there are restaraunts, bike rentals and shopping that made the location quite ideal for us. Rate was much better than other hotels, so it was a great value."

2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a great stay at The Virginian. The mid-century Western kitch vibe is so fun – much better than ""generic upscale hotel"" vibes. Pool and hottub were a lifesaver after full days of hiking in the Tetons."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Was in town for a wedding and this was an ideal location! It’s a little outside of town but easy enough to get to/from. Love the proximity to Albertsons and lots of great parking! Staff were super friendly on check in!! Was NOT aware that a resort fee was required over and beyond the Airbnb charges… but that is more Airbnbs fault. Aside from a constantly running toilet, I had no issues with the room. It was lovely and just as pictured. The pool was nice (though I didn’t go in) and I particularly enjoyed the fire pit with the s’mores!! Thank you for a great stay!!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Can’t say enough good things about the Virginian. We checked in with Walt who was as kind and cool a guy as you can find. This place has or is close to everything you might need or want plus a few extras like a great saloon with karaoke, and fire pits by an outdoor pool and hot tubs. We stayed 3 nights during our time in Jackson and definitely would recommend this place."

2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The courtyard area with the fire pits and pool/hot tubs was great! It was a great place to chill and unwind from your day.
The late night receptionist was AMAZING. Even at 11PM he was more than happy to give us the lay of the land not just for the motel but all of the town of Jackson with recommendations.
The room was homey and exactly what was advertised with a nice rack to dry off cloths.
Lastly the restaurant was amazing for a nice breakfast. Though the lunch orders coming out of the kitchen also looked spectacular."

2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Such an awesome experience. They hand out s'mores so we can enjoy a little time in the yard. Swimming pool area surrounded by mountains. The Lodge is near restaurants and near the downtown area. Would love to visit again!

There was also a drive through liquor store on the property, and a restaurant as well. Situated close to everything."

2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Great location! We were able to walk to dinner and lunch whenever we liked. About half a mile away is a Target and there is also an Albertson's nearby. Nice big pool and two large hot tubs. Very relaxed environment and everyone seemed to be enjoying themselves. The Virginian restaurant on the property is great. The owners work the front and were extremely helpful. Food prices there not as insane as the other places we went to eat. The room was great, nothing unexpected, but we spent most of our time in Grand Teton."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Centrally located and we loved the inner courtyard. The look and feel of the whole place is pleasent. It is a refurbished motel and it does not dissapoint!
2023-08-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,Great spot to stay in Jackson Hole area. Prices were a little high but likely just keeping up with the market demands. Billy’s burgers was great.

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"The Virginian is the model for what all motels could be with a few thoughtful touches. The recently renovated property is clean and well-designed throughout with an amazing pool, cozy fire pits for nightly s’mores, yard games and on-site restaurants. It’s also conveniently located at the beginning of town and close to Snow King Ave, which is helpful to navigating traffic and heading the mile into town. We loved riding our bikes everywhere once we arrived.
The Virginian is relatively new to AirBNB and we had some challenges at check-in reconciling AirBNB details with their systems. The front desk management jumped in to address the issues and was very accommodating for the delays.
We will absolutely return to The Virginian and will just book a slightly larger room for our family of four next time."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Good spot
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We were passing through and found this place last minute and it turned out to be a wonderful oasis nestled in the middle of the mountains. It had a community area in the middle of the rooms that was a pleasant surprise and felt like a mini resort style getaway with hot tubs, a pool, cabanas, fire pits everywhere, corn hole boards, lots of spaces to eat, and s’mores!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The staff at the Virginian Lodge are some of the most gracious and hospitable you’ll come across.

Gets noisy early morning as people come in to the restaurant next door."

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Place was exactly as decribed. Wonderful stay!
2023-10-01,4.0,Group trip,"Overall, good place to stay! The layout of the condo works good for 3-4 people comfortably. We had 5 and there wasn’t enough comfortable furniture or space in the living area to really hang out together. It was well stocked except for toilet paper. It was an easy walk to Snow King Hotel where there’s a shuttle that takes you into town and back via an app."
2023-10-01,5.0,Group trip,"Thank you, Anna, for letting us stay in your beautiful home. Everything was as described, very clean, and comfortable. The location is great, too. It is only a few minutes' drive to downtown Jackson. Thank you again for everything!!"

2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We had a very nice stay at Anna’s place! Highly recommend as it is in the perfect location and is very spacious. One thing to note - the main living area and kitchen are located upstairs, so something to consider if you have people in your party who aren’t as mobile. Would definitely stay here again! :)"
2023-09-01,5.0,Group trip,"It was a great and convenient location in Jackson, closer to Teton"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,It was clean and fantastic!

2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,beautifulplace
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Walking distance to downtown and beautiful ski resort right across the street. Friendly host!
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We had such a great stay here! Our time was completely focused on Grand Teton, so we didn't spend much time in Jackson, but the proximity to downtown is great! It is also a quick and easy drive to the park entrance, which was our priority. It was plenty of space for our family of 6 and gave us a great base during this leg of our road trip!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Group trip,nice place
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We loved the easy location of this condo in Jackson. A perfect home-base for visiting the Tetons. The size was perfect for our group of five. The kitchen was well stocked with equipment to allow us to cook meals as needed. Everything was clean and comfortable.
2023-06-01,5.0,Group trip,Excellent place! Loved the two levels.
2023-06-01,5.0,Group trip,"Stayed one night. Very convenient in relation to Grand Teton National Park. Gave us the space we needed vs a hotel, which is exactly what we needed. Thank you!!!!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Group trip,"We booked Anna’s place just a few days before our stay because our previous Airbnb didn’t work out. I think her place was the first listing I saw and it was just perfect - location is great, price is decent (for the area), and the amenities are great (washer/dryer was a plus). She even has a designated garage to park your car, which came in handy when we were there.
The place was a little confusing to find, but Anna had provided extremely detailed instructions beforehand. The condo was very clean, organized, and roomy. We had 5 people there with all of our luggage and still had more than enough space to move around.
Overall, great place to stay with a group of people when in Jackson. We were on the outskirts of the town, which was nice cause it was quieter, but still close enough to all the restaurants and stores for everything we needed. Check out was one of the easiest I’ve ever had to do at all the Airbnbs I stayed at."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Anna’s place was great! A perfect size for my group and a lot of great amenities. We made great use of the kitchen and loved how walkable it was to downtown Jackson! Would definitely recommend and would stay here again in a heartbeat! Thanks, Anna!"

2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was the perfect spot for a winter getaway. Like other reviews mentioned, the location is ideal for anyone looking to be close to skiing and shopping options. Located close to downtown Jackson and walking distance from Snow King. We were in town for a wedding at the Amangani and this Airbnb was halfway between the airport and the resort. The condo was probably one of the cleanest places I've rented and it had all the basics you would need to be comfortable. The condo was easy to find, comfortable and exactly what was listed. My favorite detail was the heated pads featured on the steps right outside the condo. They helped keep extra snow off our boots before walking into the condo and made it easier for us to keep the condo clean (we don't wear shoes indoors).

Anna was quick to respond the two times I reached out -- no complaints here!"
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place! Exactly as described and fit what we needed. I’d happily stay here again.

2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Anna is the perfect host! After booking a condo in the same complex that was less than ideal, we were a bit worried about booking in the area again. However, Anna's condo is fabulous and from the minute you walk in, everything is set up to make your stay effortless and comfortable. Additionally, the condo is in a wonderful location, it's a short walk to downtown...and more importantly, Persephone Bakery! The condo is also very well laid out for multiple people/couples - plenty of private space/bathrooms. Finally, the sheets were so wonderfully soft, it was an unexpected treat after a long day full of outdoor adventures. Thanks Anna, we'll definitely be back when we visit Jackson again!"
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This place was really lovely, including a terrific location! We would definitely stay here over and over if it was available."

2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Anna’s listing is exactly as described on Airbnb the place is clean and walking distance to the Snow King resort and town. We highly recommend renting her place if you get a chance to visit Jackson Wyoming.

2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We greatly enjoyed our overnight stay at Anna’s AirBNB, which is a luxury townhome with all the comforts from home."
2022-09-01,4.0,Group trip,"The location is quiet residential neighborhood, and well located to Snow King. Downtown Jackson is a short drive away. This could be a great spot depending on your needs, but keep your expectations managed if you're looking for comfort.
The property is a bit smaller than I expected, so although there's 3 bedrooms it was definitely cramped for 6 adults. This would be a good spot if your family includes children, but I wouldn't recommend it for any more than 4 adults. Additionally, the layout is a little odd and might pose problems for people with mobility issues. The entrance and two bedrooms are located downstairs, but the kitchen, living room, and another bedroom are upstairs. You WILL have to walk up/down stairs multiple times a day.
There is also no AC or even ceiling fans in the bedrooms. While it was cool at night by late August, there's also a lot of mosquitos so keeping the windows open wasn't a great option. The rooms have fans which helped a little, but ultimately it was a bit uncomfortable for the group. The living room has a portable AC which was very helpful. But the living room isn't really big enough for 6 adults to hang out.
Additionally, the check-in and check-out times are more inconvenient than any Airbnb I've ever stayed in, ever. If you can control when you arrive, then a 10am checkout and 4pm check-in probably won't be an issue. But we were flying in/out with limited flight arrivals and departures. But Anna was helpful and tried to accommodate us by letting us keep our luggage in their garage, which we appreciated."

We ate breakfast at the Virginian almost every day. They make wonderful homemade food and they do so quickly. We also ate at Bubba's Bar B Q (casual), Pinky G's Pizza (very good), Silver Dollar Grill (Wort Hotel), and The Restaurant at White Buffalo Club (A little pricey, but worth it).

Perfect location to town and all that Jackson has to offer. We have many friends in Jackson and this place was a perfect home base for the many activities in the area. If you plan to have drinks, you may want to pick up a bag of ice. There is no ice maker. (ice trays are available) This is such a minute detail, barely worth mentioning. However, temps were in high 80's and cold beverages were a priority to us during our stay. Anna was quick to respond to our questions and very helpful. What a treasure this place is."

2020-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My family and I stayed at the condo on our way back from Yellowstone. It was the perfect location.
What you should know about this Airbnb is: check in is very easy.
Our host answered me back within 5 minutes of texting her.
The place was spotless, it had everything we needed and more. I was very happy that there was a washer/dryer as I hadn’t done laundry in days.
Beds were comfy.
I have no negative things to say. It was our second time doing an Airbnb and I couldn’t have been happier."

2020-07-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"Everything checked out clean and hospitality wise. Very quick response when you need her. Fees (cleaning, booking etc) are to high in my opinion. No AC to make it comfortable. But overall we loved the place!!!!"

2020-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We found the place to be ideal for the 6 of us (one family, 3 generations). The 3-bedroom condo was all set up, easy to move into, as described, and provided a great place to sleep, wake up and get going. Had we not been as busy traveling to nearby locations, we would have enjoyed spending more time in the condo, as it was very comfortable."

2020-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Great space, clean and all the amenities needed as listed. Easy walk to town. Plenty of parking which was a nice bonus."
,,,"This was my first poor experience with a host. This is a motel but the front desk phone number is not listed as a host. The host that airbnb communicates with is someone else and the person was not reachable so I was not able to get checked in when there was a problem with the reservation. I got to the hotel at 4:45 pm and was unable to get into the room until 9pm. When it got close to 7:30pm and I was unable to get checked in, I was worried I would have no place to stay. I asked the reservation to be cancelled so I can book another hotel since it’s getting dark outside. I was told that they are not able to offer a refund because there was no manager to authorize the cancellation at the time.
There is not enough parking available. We had to street park along with many other guests.
Overall, it was a stressful experience and the staff was not helpful."
,,,The hotel staff was very rude! The walls in this place are so thin you can'teven have a conversation. It's also more like a motel than a hotel.
,,,"I booked a night at The Virginian Lodge for my family (with three little kids) and me, but right after booking realized I messed up the dates by one day. I reached out immediately to ask if I could move the reservation and the only response I got was “this will not be possible.” No mercy, no understanding, no compassion or humanity even if their policy wouldn’t allow a change. I did not feel like I was communicating with another human being, and felt mistreated by a harsh establishment, which goes against what AirBnB was founded upon."
,,,"I cannot express my disappointment enough with this lodging. The description and photos are utterly misleading - there is no wilderness in sight, just an old, run-down building straight out of the 1970s. Upon arrival, it was clear that nothing had been updated or maintained. The sheets were ripped, pillows had holes with cotton falling out, and the floors were a mess of buckled wood and water damage. This place is a far cry from the peaceful and serene surroundings depicted in the pictures - it's more like a nightmare. Parking was a nightmare too. The host was unhelpful and refused any refund, even when confronted with the unacceptable conditions. We were forced to abandon our stay and seek refuge in a hotel. Save yourself the trouble and steer clear of this place. It's a disgrace. If I wanted something this crappy, I could have rented a rundown hotel in town for way cheaper."
