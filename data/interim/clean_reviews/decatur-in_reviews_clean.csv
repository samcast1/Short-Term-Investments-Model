2024-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"From the second we got there our group just kept discussing how much we loved this place! It is perfect, especially if you have a large family with kids! They have everything you need to bring little ones with you!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Green Gables was amazing! Tastefully decorated yet homey and Ann provided anything you might need and extras. She provides all nice high-end appliances (including washer, dryer and detergent), comfy beds, bedding, games to play and even some nice snacks, coffee and water. There was plenty of storage area for our unpacked items and luggage. The kitchen is beautiful! It's nicely and clearly marked with what is in each drawer and cabinet which made finding what we needed easily. My grandkids loved sleeping in the attic bedroom that has two twin beds. All bathrooms had an abundance of nice fluffy towels and bath products. Ann made herself available should we need anything. Although all my family did not make it to Indiana, this AIRBNB is so roomy it can hold 10 people easily. We enjoyed sitting and rocking in the chairs on the front porch. This home is beautiful inside and out. We will certainly return to Green Gables when we have the opportunity to return to the Bluffton area."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Ann was very responsive and friendly. The house is beautiful inside and out. Will definitely be returning if I’m in the area again.
2024-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Absolutely amazing house. We are frequent BNB’ers and this one was impressive.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Ann was easy to communicate with, and her place has everything you could need to be comfortable.
We had 3 generations staying in the space, and it was perfect. Nana and Papa had their own room with access to the walk in shower. The “kids” each had their own comfortable rooms, and the “grands” had choices for sleeping accommodations on the same level or up on the next level. The play space in the basement was perfect for the grands to get into safe mischief.
The kitchen is amazing - Nana was cooking at the stove as I was loading dishwasher and 2 grands chased each other on their way to the fridge - all without bumping into each other!
Everything was labeled and easy to find, and we couldn’t think of anything to suggest to add for future guests.
We are already talking about planning our next getaway at Green Gables next year!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We stayed at Ann’s home to watch the eclipse. The home was spotless! I can’t begin to talk about how clean the home was. The furnishings were beautiful. The appliances were top of the line. The beds were very comfortable. The patio was a wonderful space to relax and enjoy the eclipse. Everything you could think of was provided, bathroom supplies, kitchen supplies, and many different snacks and coffee options. We were there the weekend of the NCAA Final Four and Championship tournaments and the streaming capabilities of the internet and TVs was wonderful. Ann was very responsive and helpful. The home is in a cute neighborhood and the neighbors are very friendly. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay and if we are in the area again, we would definitely stay at Ann’s home again. If I could give this home double the 5 star rating, I would!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"oh my goodness this house was amazing we own airbnbs we were very impressive of how clean this place is, I love the little toys in the basement for people that have kids that will distract them and keep them busy for a little bit.
you have everything you need in the kitchen and bathroom.
I don't even know what else to say
one of my friends made a comment saying that the house look like it was made yesterday super nice house and Ann was very friendly."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I’ve stayed in many airbnbs and this has to be one of, if not THE best airbnbs I’ve stayed. Completely unexpected gem when traveling to Bluffton, Indiana. Spacious. Clean. Immaculate amenities. All the cabinets and drawers being labeled was also a touch that I didn’t think would be important but it feels needed at every airbnb now. Our host even called to help when she noticed our truck broken down. Great spot. Great host. Would stay again!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Amazing home!! One of the best and cleanest homes I have come across!! We will be returning!!!
2024-03-01,5,Group trip,Ann’s place was great! Zero complaints
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Recently update, perfectly clean, great spaces, and a gracious host. We loved out stay, and would recommend it without reservation."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I’ve stayed in several Airbnbs and this home has been the best one I’ve stayed in yet!
The attention to detail and welcoming atmosphere Ann has created is like none other"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,What a place. It is common for Airbnbs to not be as nice as they appear on pictures. This one is the other way around. It would be hard to say enough good. Very well supplied. Very communicative host. Just a good clean Airbnb. It is close to the crossroads - which can make a little noise - if that happens to bother you. Just typical small town feel...
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This house is absolutely gorgeous! Immaculate! Ann was very responsive and answers all the questions we had! Lots and lots of extras!
2024-02-01,5,Stayed about a week,"The house was everything we thought it would be, it was super clean and organized. Also has all kinds of toys and games for the kids to play with. We will definitely being coming back to stay."
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The house was perfect, it was very clean, spacious, made you feel right at home. Would recommend this home to anyone."
2024-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This is an absolutely superior home. Ann has curated a beautiful, comfortable, and well-stocked home that will make you feel welcome the moment you enter. I have been an Airbnb host for about 7 years now, and I have four properties. Green Gables is one of the best homes I’ve ever seen. You won’t be left wanting if you choose this home. Simply excellent."
2023-12-01,5,Group trip,"My family loved Green Gables & Ann’s a fantastic host. She thought of everything to ensure a comfortable stay for all, including the kids. Everything was squeaky clean and the beds were very comfortable. We enjoyed walking downtown to visit all the local shops and restaurants too. I highly recommend, and our family plans to return again next year."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,Ann was a great host and the home was fantastic! It was perfect for our large family to celebrate the Holidays together! Immaculate inside!
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I stay in at least a dozen Air bnbs a year while working out of town. I think Air is too loose with their “superhost” labeling as few ever meet the “super” moniker.
This one of Ann’s truly is super. She has thought of everything in a freshly remodeled and up to date property.
I would absolutely stay at Ann’s place again in the future and you should too.
I’d like to nominate Ann as the inaugural “ultra host” when Air gets around to making it."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Anne's place is a beautiful home with plenty of space for us all. Plenty of play area and toys for the kids. Anne was always prompt to answer any questions we had. It was close and convenient to my family, restaurants, and grocery store. Has definitely become our go-to place to stay when we visit family."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Wonderful place to stay and very comfortable! 😃
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,This house was what we were looking for!!!! Clean & comfortable. Needed somewhere that 8 of us could come n go as we needed for the weekend.
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,"I highly recommend this house if you are visiting Bluffton! It had a modern and spacious interior with plenty of room for our family of 5 (we didn't even need all the rooms!). Ann went above and beyond to make the house feel like home with snacks and a coffee bar, perfect for us after a long drive. This was the best rental we have stayed in and I cannot recommend it enough to others."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Ann was a fantastic hosts. All of us that stayed in the home said it was the best AirBnB we've stayed at. Very clean, clear instructions for checkout... not to mention a welcome basket with snacks & labeled cabinets! Finding the things we needed in the kitchen was a breeze with all of the labels. SO appreciated.
The home was absolutely gorgeous and had enough separated space to accommodate our friends and their families. We look forward to renting the space in the future!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This Airbnb is fantastic! Extremely comfortable. The details are by far the best I’ve seen! We loved our stay and would love to come.
2023-10-01,5,Group trip,"Ann was an amazing host! Her home was absolutely everything we needed and more! Probably one of the best homes we have stayed in, especially with her many extra thoughtful touches."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We (myself, hubby, daughter, son-in-law, and 3 kids aged 1-5) stayed in Ann’s house while in Bluffton for a family event. Ann’s house was spacious and beautifully decorated, with comfortable furnishings. Ann has thought of everything to make visitors’ stays enjoyable. My grandsons were thrilled with the playroom in the basement, as well as the finished attic space to explore. Lots of room for the family to spread out and for the kids to play. Beds were comfortable for sleeping, and there are room-darkening shades on the bedroom windows which we all appreciated! The kitchen was fully stocked with all items needed to cook a meal - can’t think of anything that we needed that wasn’t supplied! We all hope that when we come back for future family events, that Ann’s house will be available!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"very clean, spacious, nice snacks, friendly host. very accommodating.comfy bed."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Appreciated the stay greatly. Gave us a great place to hang out after work.
2023-09-01,5,Group trip,"We loved this house and wished we had a couple of more days to stay. It is really clean and beautifully equipped. We had seven adults in our group and spent most of our time at the house around the kitchen table laughing and talking. I made a mistake on our reservation and Ann went out of her way to help us get settled. If you are going to stay in Bluffton, I highly recommend this property. You will love it."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,appreciated letting us use the house. Would definitely stay again.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Our stay at Green Gables was perfect! Ann provides so many little touches to make you feel right at home. Beds comfy, overall very clean, crisp, homey feel with perfect gathering areas throughout. Kitchen has everything you need to whip up a meal and just stay in for dinner. This stay exceeded our expectations and with family close by we will be back!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay…
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Ann’s place was far beyond any Air B&B I have ever stayed in. The home is gorgeous. The beds were more comfortable than our beds at home. Ann has thought of everything; soft throw blankets all over the house, spare toiletries, first aid kits, a wonderfully stocked kitchen, games and toys for the kids, the list goes on and on.
Ann was very responsive and gave us great recommendations for local restaurants. We were staying at Ann’s place as part of my daughter’s 12th birthday celebration, and Ann had a birthday card waiting for her on the counter when we arrived. It was a lovely weekend with great memories made at Ann’s beautiful home. Thank you so much, Ann!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed about a week,"As a travel nurse, this is the best air bnb we’ve stayed in. Clean, spacious, comfy, and quiet considering the down town area. Will absolutely repeat this stay"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Green Gables was a gem. Beautifully remodeled home right on Main Street. Sound was not a problem and privacy glass on the doors and the blackout window shades in the bedrooms made it feel very private. Attached garage was convenient and two parking spots outside as well. Ann really thought of every amenity you could need. Plenty of towels, clean linens, bathroom necessities if you forgot anything, fully supplied kitchen, coffee bar, even folding luggage racks in the closets. Everthing was also extremely clean. My kids really enjoyed the games and toys she had available. Ann was extremely responsive and offered several times to help us with anything we needed. If you are visiting the parks and attractions nearby, stay here! And if you get a chance, read Ann's story in her house info binder, very inspiring."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful Spaceous Home! Very comfortable and homely. I will definitely be back to stay again!
2024-06-01,5,Group trip,"This was the second time we stayed at this location in Decatur while visiting family. The three full bedrooms, two full baths and well-equipped kitchen all made for a comfy stay. The variety of children's toys in the front bedroom were also helpful with our little visitors. Thank you, Jessica, for another great stay!"
2024-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Jussica's property is beautiful and comfortable. It looks just like the pictures, and it was very clean. We will definitely stay there again!"

2024-04-01,5,Group trip,Took my family to see the Eclipse. This place was fantastic. The house met our needs and was exceptionally comfortable. The location was perfect with a nice yard with patio. The location was close enough to the stores and facilities that we needed. We enjoyed the little decorations and knickknacks.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Used to live in the area and this was a great place to stay for a visit. Would book it again.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Our second time staying at one of Jessica’s properties. Would recommend.

2023-12-01,5,Group trip,This space worked out great for our family. We usually stay at a Decatur hotel when visiting family but they are not good options anymore so we appreciated having this option! The apartment was clean and homey. Jessica thought of every little detail to really make it a pleasant stay. Thank you for a pleasant stay!

There were 4 of us and the 3 bedrooms were great so we could spread out if needed. The size was perfect. We appreciated the ice maker and open kitchen. Thanks for allowing us to use this great place. We will book again in the future if it is available.

2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,We rented out 3 of Jessica AirBNB locations for our son's wedding to save us an hour drive for our family. We had 2 locations the Piqua Rd and Arcadia Place and we were easily located between the church and the Mirage. Wonderful time in Decatur.

2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is the second time we have stayed at this Airbnb, and it was just as great this time as last. It is very clean, and exactly like the pictures.

2023-07-01,5,Group trip,"The home had exactly what we needed in it, was clean and comfortable, and in the location we needed as well. We used the kitchen, which is well stocked, had a fire in the firepit outdoors, used the fenced in outdoor area which gave us sun and privacy, we slept well in comfy beds, and had some great gathering spaces.

2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Just on word perfect!
2023-04-01,5,Group trip,"I rented this lovely little apartment for the weekend of my son’s wedding. It was perfect for me and other guests traveling from my hometown for the event. Everything was comfy, room for 7 of us and an ideal location for every place we needed to be that day. It was a much better deal that could have been provided by a local hotel, especially for the number of people who came with us for the celebration.
I will definitely book again for my next visit to Decatur. Thank you for a lovely visit."
2023-04-01,5,Group trip,Super great home! Fit everyone perfectly and super clean. Def recommending to friends and family!
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,Great place to stay. We did a lot of cooking in the well-stocked kitchen. I believe Jessica keeps usable items that guests leave so the next guest can use them. This is especially helpful when stores are closed and you need a cup of tea or a quick meal. There are toys for the children and games for the family to play. Too bad we didn’t get a chance to use the firepit - maybe on our next visit to Decatur.
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very nice place simple instructions and I like the fact that nobody bothered me during my stay

2022-09-01,5,Group trip,"We all had a wonderful time staying at Arcadia Place! The location was super easy to find and only minutes from town! The duplex was beautiful and spacious. There was enough room for the seven of us to comfortably hang out together whether it be in the kitchen, living room, or outside and still be able to retreat to our own spaces at the end of the night. The only thing I wish we had known ahead of time was how sensitive the fire alarm was. Otherwise we had a wonderful stay, and were so grateful to find a place that resembles home while we were away from home 🙂"
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Peaceful
2022-08-01,5,Group trip,Great place to stay and kid friendly! Super clean!

2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,amazing home!
2022-08-01,5,Stayed one night,What a great place. An oasis in an area with very few good hotels. This was probably the cleanest Airbnb I’ve ever been in. Outstanding.
2022-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This was a perfect place to stay while in Decatur. We typically stay in Fort Wayne and drive to Decatur. This home was in a very quiet and safe area. The home was super clean and had so many thoughtful things available. The kids room had bunk beds, toys, baby gate, and sound machine. Lots of space for everyone! We will definitely stay here again!"

2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Jessica's place is fantastic! We had a comfortable home to come back to between visits with family. She had everything we needed, and more. A lot of thought and love went into decorating her home, and it is beautiful. I would highly recommend staying at Jessica's home."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,Accommodations were pleasant and commodious. We would choose this host again if the need arises.
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This was our second stay in this very warm and welcoming home. Clean and very thoughtful furnished. We love the convenience to downtown Decatur and yet a quiet place to rest at the end of the day! Highly recommend this home and Jessica’s hospitality!!
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I can not say enough wonderful about the Arcadia location!! Beautifully decorated! Feels like home! Our relatives stayed here from Georgia when they came up for a family wedding. This will be their new home away from home when they visit Indiana. Host is very responsive and very helpful!!Check in could not have been easier. Would highly recommend!!
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great place to stay. Clean, roomy, just as described. We have stayed at Jessica’s places a number of times, and it’s always great."
2022-06-01,5,Group trip,"We travel full time, coast to coast, as touring musicians. Jessica's home in Decatur was one of our top stays. Jessica has created a wonderful respite that was much appreciated by our family (5 adults) while on-the-road between performances. Our time was necessarily brief but this would be a lovely location by those seeking accommodations for longer periods of time. We were able to cook our supper and although the dining area was beautiful and spacious we took our meal outside to the picnic table to enjoy the fresh air and song birds. We took a walk down the country road just as it was getting dark and recharged our spirits with the fireflies twinkling over the prairie grasses. A big storm blew through but we felt safe and comfortable inside and Jessica even messaged us to make sure we were ok and had power - we were!"
2022-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Arcadia Place was exactly what we needed for an overnight stopover on our road trip. The unit is in a quiet area apart from downtown Decatur, but it's just a short drive to restaurants, a grocery store, and a delightful coffee shop. The space itself was very clean, comfortable, and spacious enough for three adults and two children. We really appreciated the kids toys, extra bedding, and private outdoor sitting area. We would stay here again."

I traveled with my elderly parents, my brother and my daughter and it was comfortable for us all. After coming from a funeral it was comfortable for us to relax and enjoy ourselves. It was so peaceful and warm during these cold days. There are plenty of blankets to feel nice and cozy and watch the big TV on the couch. I cooked full meals in the well equipped kitchen. My favorite part was the Sega Genesis game console, i felt like a kid again. Me and my 7 year old had some good times playing it our first night. There is literally nothing this home lacked. There were snacks waiting for us when we arrived. Jessica was great with communicating and prompt. This was my parents first experience at an air bnb and they were impressed. I've stayed at several in many different states and i would have to say this is my favorite. Thank you so much Jessica!"

2023-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Lana's property was a sweet 'home away from home' while visiting family nearby. It had all that we needed: washer and dryer, well-stocked kitchen for cooking family meals, and plenty of beds upstairs (can sleep 6 upstairs with trundles - all very thoughtfully designed). The bath was spotless and came with quality linens and plentiful bath products. Great AC. The property is located across the street from the Berne clocktower with splashpad and glockenspiel; farmer's market also across the street on Saturdays. Woke up to the gentle sound of a passing horse and buggy - very charming stay. Thank you, Lana, for your warm welcome to Berne!"

2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What a lovely place to stay! Quiet street and neighborhood. Just a short walk to downtown. Well equipped, cozy and comfortable! My only disappointment was no internet. The category ""Internet and Office"" in the listing threw me. It did say no WiFi so I thought the internet was through an ethernet cable. Since this was a working vacation, I needed to work elsewhere. That really altered my plans since I was dependent on relatives and friends for transportation. The hosts Amber and Megan are quick to respond to questions. I throughly enjoyed my stay!"

2024-04-01,5,Group trip,"Pros: Beautiful house inside and out. Clean and nice updates throughout. Didn’t hear any complaints about the beds. Host is very responsive and has put a lot of thought into the place. Overall, my group had a lot of good things to say about the place itself
Things to ponder: There are trains nearby that you can hear pretty well in the house. Could have been worse but I feel like it’s worth mentioning since I didn’t notice any noise alerts on the posting. And lastly, there’s a list of check out instructions (towels started, trash collected/taken out, dishwasher, etc.) also not mentioned in the listing until after booking. Again, not really a big deal but it’s nice to know ahead of time."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed over a week,"Michelle's place was just as described and matched the pictures exactly! It was clean, spacious and very comfortable. The kitchen had everything I needed for a long stay. She was super responsive and helpful throughout. I would definitely recommend!"

The hosts were great. They were very communicative and available, both leading up to our stay and during it. They were accommodating and helpful. We appreciated that they came promptly after a snow and cleared the driveway, sidewalks, etc.
Just a note that there is just one full bathroom on the main level and it is not connected to the main bedroom (though it is right next to it). This was not at all an issue for our family but I could see how someone might mistake that based on the listing."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Love the location of this home. It’s walkable to downtown and a short drive to anything you need. The home itself is very nice, well appointed and Michelle had a basket with coffee, sugar, cream and snacks which was a nice added touch.

We had 8 family members and had plenty of room. EVERYONE is still talking about how spectacular the house was! Thank you Michelle and Gary!"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This place was worth every single penny. Michelle was so accommodating- she gave us awesome recommendations for places to take our kids and to meet up with family, the house was equipped with absolutely everything we could’ve needed, it was SPOTLESS, so comfortable and absolutely gorgeous inside and out. We loved sitting out on the front porch, playing the board games provided, eating outside in the patio, cooking in the very well stocked kitchen, and walking to and from all the cafes and breweries and splash lads nearby! The house has plenty of space and storage for everyone and we all enjoyed every part of our stay immensely. Michelle really cared about our stay and you can tell this house is a very loved home. We are already planning trips back. Thank you for everything, Michelle!"
2022-06-01,5,Stayed about a week,This place was AMAZING and beautiful!! The location was excellent and safe. The host was very gracious and we were able to stay one more night as unexpected issues happened — it was just perfect. So so so much better than a hotel in Bluffton which was almost the same cost!! Highly recommend it!!
2022-06-01,5,Group trip,Great place to stay and lots of room! Host had free snack and very clear instructions. Will definitely be going back in the future if we’re in the area.

The space was extremely clean and comfortable, with plenty of room for gathering together while providing private space for sleeping.

2024-06-01,5,Group trip,Last minute decision to stay in an air b n b and what an Awesome place! Had EVERYTHING we needed! From laundry detergent to dishwashing supplies. Entire house was clean and felt very comfortable. The beds are super comfy so be prepared to hit snooze. They even had board games and cards for the kids. Very private location and more spacious than the picture allude to. Nice layout with en suite bathroom in master bedroom LOVED!
2024-06-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Nice, private stay!"
2024-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Our stay was great! Easy to find location. The house was clean, and plenty of housewares for our stay. We definitely stay there again when we come back to visit family!"

2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,nice cozy place
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The home was so much better than the hotels around. We loved the quiet neighborhood cute small town feeling.
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Nice place
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We had stayed here before and felt “at home”. She even let us stay when we didn’t give her much advance notice. Thanks.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"we had a great time staying here, best lodging in Decatur :)"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,She put a personal touch to the decor by pictures showing what she is involved in.
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,Amber Rose was great to work with and the house was lovely and comfortable. The queen size bed was perfect for us - firm but in a good way. The other bedroom had a futon which worked for the kids but some adults may not like that. Kitchen was well-stocked! Easy to walk downtown to Java Bean.
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Gracious host and comfortable house. Overall we enjoyed our stay.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Very friendly and informative, described area very well. House was clean and felt right at home."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a great stay! The weather was beautiful so we were able to enjoy the back deck. Nice large kitchen, comfortable living room and spacious dining room table. The location was very convenient for what all we needed to do while in Decatur. I liked the eco-friendly approach to running her AirB&B. Amber’s mission for helping people in Haiti was nicely displayed throughout the home. She has written a touching and informative story that is in a binder on the dining room desk…a must read. 🥰"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Awsome peaceful time will for sure be getting this place when coming around the area again. Love the small town vibe, reminds me a lot like my home town."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The house is a short walk from downtown and the main throughway in town. The little library out front was a nice touch and is a statement of the owner’s commitment to community. We were in Decatur when it was unusually warm and the house did not have AC. The ceiling fans helped and the floor fan Amber provided was helpful.
I am a tea drinker and the tea kettle was right on the counter making it easy for me to start my day. Everything worked out well for us. Thank you for allowing us to use your home."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Very nice place, comfy beds and layout was nice. The wifi screwed up a couple of times, just unplugged the router and let it restet, had no issues after that. Other than that, everything was good. Would stay again if in the area working."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed about a week,"The PeaceCYCLE home felt like you were staying with friends. Great location to downtown Decatur. Quiet, peaceful neighborhood. Comfortable furniture and beds."
2022-03-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Awesome, peaceful place!"
2022-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"For my stay in Decatur, I had a good time in PeaceCycle. I was not really uccustomed to the towette napkins and no TV, but I mananged to entertain myself while I stayed there. I hope to visit again and book when it's available. Thank you so much."
2022-01-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Nice clean place. Good location.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,Everything was exactly as listed. Lexy was very flexible with us and quickly responded to any questions we had. We loved our stay. Everything was clean. We loved the full kitchen. Very quiet and peaceful. Thanks again!
2024-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,Lexy was a great host. They were friendly and welcoming. Her family made us feel at home and were very easy to work with. Our trip had to be cut short but we would definitely stay there again when in the area
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great stay. Host was amazing. Would stay again.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Quiet and tranquil location. Just what I needed 😌
Wonderful hosts ❤️
Beautiful apartment style accommodations very clean and well equipped.
I didn't use the pool but the setting would be perfect for friends and family entertaining.
A nice family-run business that I'm happy to recommend.
It will be my go-to place when visiting the area.
Thanks, Lexi ❤️"
2022-09-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Lexy's Airbnb is wonderful. Peaceful, roomy and close to my work. Awesome host. Thanks!"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,My wife parents and I loved our week at Lexy’s! They are extremely accommodating and willing to do what they can to help with what you need and their family is incredibly sweet! The pool is a perfect place to relax! We look forward to coming back for future trips!
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,A great place to stay. Would come back again.
2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Lexy's space was so much fun!! It was so clean and we had everything we needed! The ping pong table and toys in the basement kept us busy when we weren't enjoying the great outdoors! Outside, the pool was beautiful and the kids loved the water slide and water toys! There was also a big playground set and trampoline that the kids loved!! We would love to come back in the near future!! Lexy and her family were very kind and welcoming. (Also, the pool has an automatic cover which gave us peace of mind when the pool was closed when we weren't swimming!)"
2021-04-01,5,Stayed about a week,"If you are looking for a well kept place and country living. You will be right at home. And if you don’t see it, just ask. Everything was very clean."
2020-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Had a fun time here. Very nice home with great hospitality!
2020-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This was by far one of the nicer houses I’ve ever stayed in. Even though it’s in someone’s basement don’t let that steer you away they are very nice friendly people. They were very accommodating to anything I had a question to.
2020-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"If you want a nice trip away, with a pool, Lexy’s place in the country fits the bill. The guest space is spacious and very clean. The pool was amazing and my son loved going down the slide, and because of its depth, was able to use the whole pool. There is a grill, fire ring, and plenty of yard that can be used. We loved the ping pong table, and my son liked being able to play with toys that are available in the family room. Overall a great stay."
2020-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"A great break from the city, a little less than 4 hour drive from Chicago and a weekend in the country was just what we needed. The pool is brand new and so nice, plenty of outdoor seating and space for kids to run around. The basement looked newly renovated and the kitchen had everything we needed to cook all meals for three days. The bedroom was big enough for our queen air mattress to fit with room to spare. Would definitely recommend to our friends for a quiet weekend away."
2020-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Lexi has a wonderful family and a wonderful home. The swimming pool was absolutely perfect. She was very quick to respond to all of our questions. I would definitely stay here again
2020-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This property is gorgeous inside and out. We were free to use the pool and play in the yard whenever we wanted. The basement apartment and being outside felt private despite the owners being there. There weren’t any other people in sight! My phone had no reception in the apartment and the WiFi didn’t work well. It was surprising because I never go anywhere with spotty internet connection, but ended up being ok because it forced me off my phone, left me without Netflix, and untemped to throw the kids in front of the tv instead of playing and dancing with them. I would def stay again! If there were a hot tub outdoors, I’d book a few nights this winter to take in the gorgeous sunsets to the west which will be even more delightful once the trees are bare. Thanks for being great hosts!"
2020-08-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Lexy and Roger were very gracious and accommodating hosts. Their property is absolutely gorgeous! The pool is very nice and well maintained and the house itself is spotless and homey. The internet and cell phone coverage is spotty but I was still able to work with a few internet service interruptions while I was there.
I will say that if you're looking for quiet solitude, this isn't the place for you as there are small children on the premises that do what small children do. Otherwise if that doesn't bother you, I would highly recommend staying here."
2020-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Lexi and her family were a pleasure! Very responsive and helpful. The space was large, clean and equipped with everything we needed, with a full kitchen, grill and more. We had our one year old with us, and they had everything for her as well - pack n play, high chair, toys - we didn't have to bring a thing. The pool was gorgeous and well maintained, it was so nice to lounge in the pool all day. The wifi/cell service can be spotty, so it may be hard if you need to do something with internet service. However, it was nice to be a bit more disconnected. Would definitely recommend a stay!"
2020-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We booked last minute and it didn’t seem to be a problem. The host was friendly and got back with me soon after I booked the house. The place was spotless! The pool was very well taken care of and looked new. The kitchen had everything we needed to make some of our own meals. This place is awesome, go check it out if you’re in the area!"
2020-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is a truly amazing property. The pictures do not do it justice at all. The pool and slide are wonderful, and the entire place is gorgeous. Lexy and Roger were both very accommodating. The downstairs apartment was spacious, and beyond our expectations. I would highly recommed this ABnB."
2020-06-01,5,Stayed over a week,Very clean and comfortable space to stay in. I work long hours and it was no problem to come and go as I pleased. Roger and Lexy are both very friendly welcoming hosts.
2020-01-01,5,Stayed about a week,Awesome host. They had everything in the kitchen I needed to cook. The pics you see on the site are actually what you get. It was super clean to the point it looked like it just got renovated. They make you feel right at home.That was my first time staying at an Airbnb. It was an Awesome experience with it being my first time doing Airbnb.
2024-06-01,4,Group trip,Very clean and well kept. Couch was comfortable but a bit small for two to sleep on. Other than that the place was very nice.
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This trip was a Mother's Day Sabbatical for me. I did not want to leave!
10 minutes away, and en route to Jessica's place, I picked up a few simple groceries from Walmart. Once I arrived, I wanted for nothing. I only left when I had to.
I loved the layout of the apartment. Everything was just a few steps away. A fun activity - Jessica has placed eye candy throughout the rooms. Finding different pieces was an adventure.
The bed was comfortable and the blankets available to add were soft and cozy. The shower was relaxing and the water pressure was perfect.
For me, the location couldn't have been better. Even though I only live 35 minutes away, since I don't get to Decatur often, it felt like a real getaway. However, it was only a 25-minute drive to church on Sunday and work on Monday. Checkout was simple and quick. I cannot wait to come back! I truly would love to live there!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Cozy, clean, and comfortable. Had everything we needed."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,everything was great. clean place! would rent again.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"Staying at Jessica's place was a great experience. We enjoyed it from the moment we walked in. My daughter immediately said, ""Oh, this place is cute."" I appreciated the attention to detail that was displayed throughout. There were snacks in the kitchen, games in the living room, and cozy throws in a basket. Our visit was brief, but Jessica's place gave us everything we wanted--a clean and comfortable place for a meal, with well-cared for green space outside where we could sit and watch the sky (we were there to experience totality during the eclipse).
Jessica was friendly and informative throughout the reservation process. She always responded very quickly to my questions and accommodated our timing needs. The apartment is attractively decorated and updated for comfort (new windows, nice cupboards, and such). I don't think you could go wrong here. I recommend Jessica's place highly."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Great place! Cute, clean, and well-stocked; it had everything we needed for our brief eclipse stay. Jessica was responsive and helpful and coordinated easy pickup when I accidentally left a bag there after checkout. The only thing to note is that the washer and dryer are very loud, so be sure not to run it at night if you have small children with you. But that's on us!"
2024-03-01,5,Group trip,this was our first time booking an airbnb and we had a wonderful experience. Jessica's place was small quiet and cozy and we loved it.
2024-01-01,5,Stayed one night,.

2023-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,Jessica’s places are always just as expected and clean. She is a responsive host and always there if you need anything.
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,This place is the only place to stay in Decatur. 100 percent better than a hotel. Love the added amenities that are included. Close to everything. The individual temperature controls for each room is a added bonus. Will be back soon.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Always outstanding. We have been lucky enough to stay at one of jessicas homes several times now. She has set a very high standard for all of the other airbnbs out there. Perfect!
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,It was a perfect play to stay for my friends wedding. Close to a cute little town and the drive to Fort Wayne was super simple too! Definitely worth another fun weekend getaway next year!
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Jessica helped us at a time when our family gathered as our mother passed. She was very sensitive to our needs and very helpful to us.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I will definitely stay the next time I’m visiting my home town!
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great location and many thanks to Jessica for being a wonderful host!
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We rented a few of her AirBNB's for the weekend for a family wedding, and it was great we would have booked them all if we would have jumped on them sooner."
2023-08-01,5,Group trip,"This was the second night/leg of our journey. We arrived at about 12:30 am and were gone by approximately 7:30 am, but it was a perfect location and exactly as listed."

2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great value! Thanks!
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Visiting Berne from WV for grandsons birthday. The apartment was very comfortable, clean and in a nice area. We will definitely stay here again. Jessica was very helpful."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Jessica was Awesome! This was my first AirBnB rental and Jessica made it GREAT!!!!
2023-07-01,4,Group trip,"Jessica's place has to be the cleanest in the area. I'd definitely choose her place over any hotels in the area. Be aware that the A/C is not central, and there is one unit for the place. As long as you keep the bedroom doors open, it's not bad... and you may not need the A/C when it's cold. That being said, I'll be making reservations the next time I'm in the area... so clean!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,This was my first time renting an Airbnb and it was great. The only thing I would of liked was to know the size of the beds bc it was pretty small for 5 adults and one teenager. But great place and will definitely rent again w a smaller group
2023-06-01,5,Group trip,Great place!
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,Very cute little place. Will stay here again if in the area.
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"There are very few options for hotels in Decatur. I think that's the reason Jessica renovated this former motel. It was clean, comfy, quiet and a great place to relax after work. Much better than a hotel!"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Very safe.
LOTS of cooking utensils and appliances.
Super clean with LOTS of towels and blankets.
Beds were comfortable.
Washer, dryer, refrigerator, dishwasher, and stove were all new and in good working order.
Near a neighborhood with nice walking paths around ponds."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,I don’t think I could ask for anymore better service! Great service and place to stay in this small town.
2023-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,This is my 3rd time staying here for Jessica great service!
2023-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Jessica's place was welcoming, cozy, and an affordable alternative to local hotels.

Thank you!"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Super cozy! I loved how it just felt like home! She had so much extra stuff, if you forget to pack something, no sweat! She already had it ready for you! Absolutely fantastic experience! Will definitely stay again and recommend to all my friends and family!"

2023-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We have family in Decatur and since having kids it’s hard to all fit at their house. This Airbnb was a great solution! Jessica was very responsive, had snacks available upon arrival, even had a pack n play and toys available for the kids. We will definitely be using this again in the future!"
2023-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"Second time I’ve stayed. Everything I needed it to be and more. Comfortable, clean and Jessica responds quickly.

2022-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"Jessica’s place is beautifully decorated and had everything you could need- and more. We were just stopping by on travels but wish we had stayed longer as the amenities were great, dishwasher and washing machine in easy reach and Disney+ for the kids was awesome. Will stay again for a stay in Indiana."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed one night,Wonderful place! Great value!
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Cute apartment in a four-plex building. The air conditioning is provided by one new window type air conditioner in the living room with ceiling fans in the bedrooms. Stacked washer dryer laundry center in the hall. Fully supplied kitchen. Very responsive and helpful owner.
2022-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"This was a very clean, well thought out place to stay, with just the amenities that you would want, including a few extras you might not expect. I would think it would be perfect for a small family, couple or bunch of friends. If I was a woman traveling alone, I wouldn’t feel safe."
2022-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Absolutely perfect stay! Communication was great, the place was quiet, very clean and comfortable. There was everything in the kitchen we could want although we did not cook. Cute little coffee bar set up with just about anything you’d want. She had both a drip coffee maker and a Keurig which was nice. The sofa and the chairs were comfortable, and I think it was the best night sleep I’ve had in months. When we first approached I thought that it might be a little noisy because it’s close to a four-way stop. But honestly once I was inside I never heard a thing and there’s very little traffic in the area. It was a pleasant evening and we wanted to go for a walk. Just across the street was a really nice trail that wound through a neighborhood around a lake. It was really beautiful and so I did it again in the morning before we left. I would highly recommend this place."
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very clean. Great location

2022-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This airbnb is a nice, peaceful place to stay. Clean and comfortable. It was very nice to have some breakfast and snack options sitting out for us as well. It's back on a quiet street, but very close to everything you should need. Jessica is very helpful and quick to respond to any question as well. We definitely recommend this place!"
2022-05-01,4,Stayed with kids,"This is a super cute little place that’s really great for families. My daughters loved discovering the toys in one of the bedroom closets. There’s also a TON of streaming options on the TV, including kid-friendly options.
Jessica was extremely responsive, both through Airbnb messages and through text, and was very gracious about a small issue we caused. I would stay in one of her properties again in a heartbeat."
2022-05-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Lovely little apartment in a great location with a well stocked kitchen. Thank you, Jessica!"

2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This Airbnb is the perfect place to stay at if you were at or around Decatur Indiana. It feels like the tardis, where it’s much bigger on the inside. The space, new kitchen it seems, and everything else just had an updated field to it. I will always look for this place if I’m in the area needing a place to stay from this point forward!"
2022-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"The stay was nice and relaxing. We made dinner and forgot a few items. Fortunately, the place was well stocked with cookware and was able to finish cooking. The place felt comfortable and put together well. The host was very professional and non intrusive. Very pleased with our stay."
2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very clean and acceptional place. Quiet and perfect for a short or long stay. Will keep this place in mind if I’m ever back in this area!!!

2021-09-01,5,Stayed one night,Jessica was very accommodating and very responsive. The place is decorated nicely and was very clean . I would recommend this place to anyone staying in this area !
2021-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,Definitely worth the stay.
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Best Airbnb around town
2021-08-01,5,Stayed one night,We couldn't recommend Jessica more. She is fantastic and was super helpful.
2021-08-01,5,Stayed one night,Nice place clean and very nice and homey
2021-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"Jessica's place is loaded with amenities - everything a kitchen needs to cook, lots of throws and pillows in the living room, a shelf full of bathroom extras, and super comfy beds. There are toys for the kiddos, snacks and easy breakfast items, games and a roku for the adults. It was super clean and easy to find and in a quiet neighborhood. We love Piqua Place!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"10 out of 10 this place was more than what I was expecting great location most everything was with in walking distance. recommend it to anyone staying in the area, thank Chris"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We fell in love with The Vintage House upon entry! It is so homey and adorable. plenty of room, with a fully equipped kitchen! We loved the front porch where we enjoyed a glass of wine several times! It is within walking distance of almost everything in town, and the neighborhood is safe and quiet. A washer/dryer is available and the basement room would be perfect for kids!
As a constant traveler, I thought It was a great experience and I highly recommend The Vintage House!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Nice place would stay again.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,My siblings and I were so fortunate to find Chris’s place available for our trip to watch the eclipse. It was such a great location and we enjoyed being able to join others at the Clock Tower park to witness the full eclipse. The house being in such great location and so homey and welcoming was just icing on the cake. The house is very well appointed with everything we needed. As children of a collector we appreciated the eclectic decor. We felt right at home. The house has a nice layout for multiple guests. We wish we could have stayed longer to check out the town more but now that we’ve had our first experience there we hope to return and stay at Chris’s house again.
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The house was extremely adorable, and decorated with thought. Everything we needed was there, and it was perfect for our stay. Basement was clean and felt like a separate space for privacy, if desired. I would definitely visit again!"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,very nice little home. met all our needs ans we enjoyed our stay.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Lovely and quiet place to experience the eclipse! The RV was comfortable and clean. We enjoyed visits from the friendly dogs. Very responsive- when we needed help with the wifi, they came right over to get it working."
2023-10-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Great place, fairly peaceful. Except for dogs barking sometimes but for most part they let us alone. Would definatly recomend. If your doing any fire cooking bring supplies for that, also can opener, griddle if you want it. Otherwise kitchen had nice basic set of utensils/ dishs. Enjoyed kerig and owner supplied coffee/ hot chocolate. Bed very comfortable, nice place."
2023-10-01,4,Stayed a few nights,It was a very comfortable spot comfy inside a little smaller than I thought. I think there should have been a couple of easy chairs rather than an uncomfortable couch. Other than that we really enjoyed it. The bed was comfortable. The kitchen was fully equipped.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very clean and organized. Clear instructions/ house rules. Would absolutely stay again.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"great visit, peaceful, beautiful night sky. caught meteor shower which was my son's first time, so good memory. plenty of coffee:) there's an outside compartment on left side with led lights, sink, refrigerator, and a stove if desired, atleast good ambient lighting. there's also a switch inside the main front door, light switch #2, that operates main outside lighting... #1 operates inside lighting..."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Absolutely loved our stay, felt so at home, will be staying again and will definitely recommend!!!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Clean, quiet, comfortable.
I slept very well to the sound of the frogs in the pond!
Perfect space for a getaway.
Air conditioning and heat both worked well, everything simple to figure out.
Will stay again!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,Amazing hosts!! Wonderful place to stay.
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Joann & Mark are always great hosts!
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,Wonderful place to stay!
2024-06-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Nice option in Decatur. I do wish they had central air. The only room that really stayed cool is the one with the unit in it that’s connected to the window. It’s also loud and bright at night. Blackout shades would be helpful and we had air plugs to help with the street noise. Very cute place and we love the space. The location is great with many walkable eating options nearby. Be prepared for the stairs- they are mentioned in the listing and definitely not for anyone who might have mobility issues. Thanks for a great alternative to a hotel!
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,Beautiful place in a great location!
2024-03-01,4,Stayed a few nights,The instructions given were spot on and they also sent many entertainment and food recommendations. It was a super cute “nest”. I was glad that someone previously recommended an eye mask and earplugs.
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Our second stay at The Nest and once again we were very happy with the accommodations. Clean, close to coffee shop, restaurants, bars and near walking path."
2023-11-01,4,Stayed a few nights,The place was exactly as described. Mark and Joann kept in contact and were available if needed.
2023-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"This airbnb was so cute! Very clean, super soft towels, and tons of space! We were given very clear instructions on how to find the location and get in, as well as what to do before heading out! They even had some beer and water in the fridge that was super helpful to get our night out for our friends wedding started, and to hydrate when we got back. It was perfectly located right downtown and close to all of our plans we had with our friends!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"Pros:
Hosts very responsive and give local recommendations.
The space is as described and very clean.
Nice bathroom and shower
Temperature control is consistent.
Nice decor
Cons:
Sits on Main Street so there is a lot of street noise.
Small island area to eat if several occupants
Small college type refrigerator with very little room and no ice maker.
Overpriced: I don’t stay at a lot if air Bnb and this is nice space but compared to others of similar quality I feel it to be overpriced secondary to reasons listed above."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,I've stayed here several times in relation to races at Eldora. Can't beat it
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,Joann and Marks place was so cute and fun! We stayed there the night before my wedding so I could relax! I love downtown Decatur and so many options in walking distance!
2023-10-01,4,Stayed one night,"It was nice and clean, as described. Liked it but feel the cost exceeded location and accommodation."
2023-10-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Nice place for a quick wedding trip. Just don't forget earplugs and a mask if you're a light sleeper since the road is just outside the window.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"Very nice apartment, comfortable. Mark was very responsive when we had a minor issue, and extremely helpful. Shopping and food on a cute street, ample street parking for our two vehicles."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"wonderful place, clean, comfortable"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We truly enjoyed our stay! The Nest exceeded our expectations and we are excited to visit again in a few months!
2023-08-01,4,Stayed a few nights,This place exceeded my expectations... will stay again.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Space was designed for 3 -6 adults with ample room for gathering for board games or watching TV. The bath was generous in size and the little kitchenette had everything we needed. Lighting was amazing and gave the space great character! The steps to get up to the loft are steep and a bit uneven so this location is best for those with no physical limitations...and those with light luggage!
2023-08-01,4,Stayed one night,"Stay was good, location and town are awesome. It wasn’t clear where to park and took a couple hours to hear back on that. The curtains in the bedroom need to be blackout, it’s very bright at night because you are downtown. I also didn’t realize the bedrooms are separated by a roller barn door so there was not full privacy. Paper plates, bowls and plastic silverware are what you’ll get. They did a great job with renovations and the place was very clean."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"We really enjoyed The Nest! Mark and Joann truly take pride in their property. I appreciated their flexibility for check-in! Everything was very clean, comfortable (like home) and a safe location. The stairs to the apartment on the 2nd floor were well lit, the wood treads were clean and free of carpet.
The purpose of our visit was to attend a family wedding. Although the visit was brief, we will be back!!! Thank you Mark and Joann!!!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Another great stay at The Nest July 2023. An impeccably maintained property with great hosts. We return to the Decatur area every summer and won't stay anywhere else. Located downtown with parking directly in front of your door, the Java Bean next door, in an utterly safe and small-town perfect location."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,Beautiful place and a great location right near some excellent restaurants.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,Joann & Mark were very flexible and responsive!
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What a great apartment in the heart of downtown! We had a fantastic week. Practically everything was in walking distance. Joann and Mark have created a welcoming, cozy space. They are very responsive and gracious hosts. We would recommend their space to anyone who wants a charming Airbnb in a quaint town."
2023-06-01,5,Group trip,"Another great stay! Great location. Clean space. Joann & Mark are very responsive, too."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,This location was perfect for exploring Decatur during the Sculpture Trail launch. My daughter loved people watching from the bedroom window. Everything matched the description given in the listing. I was very pleased.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The apartment was perfect for our stay in Decatur. Downtown location made everything convenient. Joann & Mark are great hosts. Their place will be our go-to spot for future visits!
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,Our stay was quick but worth it. We were in town for a wedding. We enjoyed our stay and appreciated the local recommendations from the host. I would stay again if we were in town!
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,Very nice place. Will stay again
2023-05-01,5,Stayed about a week,"I enjoy my stay ,it was a visit to my home town ,just 3 blocks From where I was raised ! All my favorite restaurants, where still they ! Loved Monster pizza, congratulations Max ,wonderful place ,pizza the best ! My friend enjoyed the Antique Mall ,could get her out of there !

Linda Bienz"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"Whenever we have family or visitors come to town, this is our recommendation on where to stay. Great hosts and property is in good condition and location."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This Airbnb is very clean and I loved their style of decor so I felt good in the space. Parking on the weekends is right in from which is super convenient. Hosts are responsive. We had some internet issues and needed to tether to our phones for tv 2 evenings. There is some traffic noise with it being above a Main Street storefront so keep that in mind if you are sensitive to noise at night. And if you grab some food to go, request your utensils and plates from the restaurant as they are not provided. There are coffee mugs and water glasses however. Highly recommend!"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great space and place to stay
Plenty of room to relax in living room, large walk in shower, plenty of counter space in kitchen, comfortable bed
Only a couple of small draw backs i forgot about from the last time i stayed here
1 needs blackout curtain's in the bedrooms
2 needs anti slip strips on shower floor
3 climbing all those steep stairs to climb to get into the apartment could have used a landing about half way up
But other than these small things feels like home"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great hosts and location!
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Amazing spot! Perfect price! I would recommend it to everyone!
2023-01-01,5,Group trip,Great place to stay!
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The Nest was very comfortable and clean. Located close to several good places for food, drinks or coffee. Great place to stay while in Decatur."
2022-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"Our four adult children stayed and enjoyed the space!
Mark and Joann were very accommodating!"
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This location is very nice. Lots to do within walking distance. We spent an entire day at the huge antique mall right down the street and a great bookstore. Lots of shops and restaurants and all the big chain stores are very close also. There is night life across the street if you are interested in that but it wasn't overly noisy and definitely not an intimidating situation. The people in this area are amazingly friendly and we felt very safe. Decatur is a very nice town. The lodging was very warm, spacious and pretty."
2022-12-01,5,Group trip,Great place to stay!
2022-12-01,5,Stayed one night,It was a perfect place!
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Love the location

2022-09-01,5,Group trip,"Loved this place, great host!"
2022-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"Very clean, great instructions to get to and enter. Super cute also!"
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The apartment was very clean and nice and had great ammenities. It was close to a lot of restaurants and bars and had plenty of parking right outside. It's a great place to stay!
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Wonderful place! Very clean & communication was great.
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,What a beautiful place to stay with all the necessities and charm. Enjoyed my time and had many options for food and drinks within walking distance. They were very responsive when booking the property. Thank you so much.
2022-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,We had a great stay at the Nest and appreciate all the little touches that make the place quaint. We also loved the walkability of the town for good food and entertainment.
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Easy to check in and communication was very good.
2022-08-01,5,Group trip,"If you are staying in Decatur, stay here! Mark and Joann did an amazing job renovating this lovely downtown space, and it has an amazing, relaxed vibe. Everything feels bright, new, and very clean. Super easy check-in process, beds are very comfortable, and there were some nice treats for us upon arrival. Communication was excellent prior to check-in and during our stay. We can highly recommend this place!
Thanks, Mark and Joann!"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This is a great apartment. Very nice and clean. Great location where you are within walking distance to several restaurants and shops. We will definitely stay here again.
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Book it now. We have family in Decatur and visit every summer. This Downtown location is perfect, and is right next door to the Java Bean. A fairly large upstairs space that's been nicely updated, with two very clean street-side bedrooms, good wireless and tv service, and an excellent shower. The entry doors are solid, with a solid keypad entry that worked flawlessly. I was able to park overnight directly in front of the door on the street.
Decatur is a very, very safe town, and the surrounding towns (I'm a Berne fan) and Adams county itself are very fun to explore.
As other reviews point out, expect steep entry steps and a freestanding room A/C unit for summer months.
Joann and Mark are excellent hosts with prompt communication and obvious pride in this home. Highly Recommended!"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed one night,The perfect place to stay in Decatur. I met my parents in Decatur to see the Ultimate Doors Tribute band at their Thursday downtown concert series. The apartment was very comfortable and the listing perfectly shows the accommodations. The hosts were very helpful with places to eat and things to do. Highly recommend this spot.
2022-07-01,5,Group trip,Great place cute set up and town as well! Hope to be back
2022-07-01,4,Stayed one night,"This listing has a lot of potential and a couple of drawbacks
If the owners keep adding little touches and upgrades this will be a premier spot to stay in downtown Decatur Indiana and we would stay here again and again
Drawback number one
Climbing a lot of stairs is not for people with heart troubles or elderly ( stairs seem to be 8"" between stair treads)
Drawback number two
No Black out curtains in the bedrooms street lights keep room to bright for light sleepers
Drawback three no central air or heating but i will assume that is something they are working on
Overall its a very good stay and will most likely stay there again in the future"
2022-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The owners were extremely accommodating, I changed the arrival time 3-4 times and felt terrible. They made it all ready for early checkin and were very responsive the whole time. Beautiful place!"
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"such a lovely place to stay, everything went smoothly so glad I chose this airbnb"
2022-06-01,5,Stayed one night,Nicely done upstairs apartment in downtown Decatur.
2022-05-01,5,Stayed one night,Mark was very helpful throughout our stay and made sure everything was perfect.
2022-04-01,5,Stayed one night,Everything was as stated and in a great location. Excellent communication. Thank you!
2022-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"Beautiful and open living room. Very clean. If you stay on the weekend you'll be able to hear the music from the bar across the street, but it's muffled and not very loud. My husband easily slept through it. Owners give you their cell phone number and return texts quickly. Access is easy, and plenty of parking. We very much enjoyed our stay. We'll definitely stay again."
2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Wonderful location, extremely comfortable and Joann and Mark are fantastic hosts. I would stay here again."
2022-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"I had a great stay. The description is very accurate. Joann and Mark responded quickly and provided helpful information. The location is great and was very clean. Since the apartment is located downtown, I would suggest bringing ear plugs if you are a light sleeper and an eye mask, if street lights will bother you while you sleep. Overall, great experience. I will return."
2022-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Love this place!
2022-02-01,4,Stayed one night,"Great location, within walking distance to many local restaurants and shops. Hosts were very helpful, they gave many recommendations for places to eat and things to do. The place was very spacious and welcoming."
2022-01-01,4,Stayed one night,"Very nice downtown location. Perfect walking distance to everything Decatur has to offer.
Very spacious updated loft with plenty of room."
2022-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Very clean, cute and cozy 💐"
2022-01-01,5,Stayed one night,This place is truly a gem from the decor to the amenities. The owners are kind and responsive should you need anything.
2022-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Nice, clean, downtown location. Hosts were great, left drinks/snacks. There were games, books, multiple TVs with lots of options. The only odd part was the open doorway between the bedrooms. There's no privacy between the two rooms. Other than that, it's a really nice space to stay and we'd do it again."
2021-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Thank you so much and we enjoyed our stay.
2021-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place is awesome, very clean, great amenities and great location."
2021-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"The Nest at Oak Room was a fabulous space. Wish we would have had more time to spend in this quaint town. Industrial meets modern with a few antique touches that compliment the age of the building...decor and furnishings that should please anyone's taste. The space was clean, welcoming, and comfortable. Thank you for hosting us!"
2021-11-01,4,Stayed with kids,"Joann and Mark's place was very nice. Clean, spacious, and everything we needed. They even provided complimentary drinks and snacks. The location is great. It's downtown and close to tons of restaurants and bars. But, the bar traffic late at night can get kind of loud. Also, as far as I know, you don't have a specific parking spot. There is parking behind the building and in front on the side of the road. There are two doors to the room. One is at ground level and the other is up the flight of stairs. Getting luggage up the stairs is a bit of a chore, but not bad. Also, the hosts didn't send me the code to get in the doors. I had to call to get it. I think they thought they had already sent it but they must have forgotten. Another strange thing, you don't have control over the A/C or heat. I'm not sure where the controls are, but I read a review that the salon downstairs controls it. There is a personal unit in the living room for A/C and heat but it doesn't affect the temperature much. It was 30 degrees out during out stay and we slept without the covers on. It was pretty warm in the room. I wish we could've change the temp. Overall good stay with some quirks!"
2021-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"Joann & Mark’s place was the perfect space for me and my friends to return to after attending a wedding. They gave us great suggestions of where to eat and things to do. It was the most amazing air bnb that I’ve stayed at. Cute, clean and cozy."
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Location, location, location. Great place to stay if you are visiting Decatur. Close to everything downtown and directly next to the Java Bean Cafe which is a bonus."
2021-10-01,5,Stayed one night,Very nice rental. Clean and perfect for our overnight stay.
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This is a very modern apt and we were not disappointed. Parking right in front of the entrance. Beds were very comfortable. Furniture comfortable as well. Very clean. Coffee shop next door a major plus !! Highly recommend this property.
2021-10-01,5,Stayed one night,Lovely location in downtown…especially with all the improvements taking place. Clean and roomy. Perfect for our needs. The coffee shop next door was a bonus as well. Highly recommend your loft!
2021-09-01,3,Stayed one night,The apartment is newly remodeled and very nicely done. Everything was clean and bed was comfy. There really is no kitchen so you better plan to eat out every meal. There is a dorm fridge and small microwave only. Located on the main drag in Decatur on the same street as several bars. Be prepared to be awake until 3 am. Too noisy to sleep on a Friday night. And you can’t control the heat or AC. Both are tied into the salon downstairs which only the owner can control. A space heater and portable ac unit are provided. And no door or divider between the 2 bedrooms. All of these items should have been divulged in the listing but were not.
2021-09-01,5,Group trip,"Awesome spot! Would definitely stay again, loved it."
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Cute and comfortable little spot. Right next door to a coffee shop. Lots of public parking in the back. Would recommend if you’re in the area and looking for a place to stay.
2021-08-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Had a wonderful stay! Only slight issue was that it was pretty warm in the living space and bathroom since there isn’t central air just a small unit in the bedroom, but it was very hot weather outside so I’m sure once it cools down outside it’d be perfect! We enjoyed our girls week!"
2021-08-01,5,Stayed one night,We really like this place. very clean quiet. small town. walking distance to alot!!
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Very clean, modern apartment - everything we needed for a short stay. Coffee shop next door. Host was very informative and responsive."

2021-07-01,5,Stayed one night,Everything was clean and nice! Mark was a great host. There are a lot of nice restaurants within walking distance.
2021-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"My wife and I had a great time staying here. The apartment was very clean and exactly like the listing. The apartment is located right downtown which makes it easy to walk to some of the restaurants, ice cream, a bookstore, or a coffee shop. Fort Wayne is also a short drive away and offers a lot to do. Mark was very kind in his communication and made sure we had all that we needed. We would definitely stay here again!"
2021-07-01,5,Group trip,A clean homey place. Very communicative host. Lived up to the description and a perfect place for a little getaway.
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This little loft is great!!! So private and peaceful. Very clean and comfortable. There are plenty of local restaurants to choose from, including 2 pizza places right across the street. Mark (host) is very attentive and quick to respond. Highly recommend!!"
2021-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"This place looks just like the pictures. The bed was very comfortable - I think it is sone kind of foam mattress. Modern bathroom and even the living room furniture was comfortable for my husband - that is a rarity!!
Just know the a/c for the apartment is a portable unit that vents out the window in the biggest bedroom . It is loud, keeps the bedroom very cool but the bathroom at the opposite end of the place gets a little warm.
I did not make the reservation until about 11:30 am and he had us in the unit by 3:30. We really appreciated that. Also there were some snack items and also beverages in the refrigerator. Nice Coffee Shop downstairs too!"
2021-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,There are a few stairs to walk up to get to the door but well worth it.
2021-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Very nice place, great location, parking spot ten feet from the door, clean, great host - what more could you want?"

Furthermore, they were very considerate of my needs (e.g. turning on the porch light for me when I was traveling at night). The place appeared clean and tidy and was a pleasant experience overall."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This is not the first time that someone in our family has stayed at Cindy’s place. She comes highly recommended. It’s accessible to several eating establishments; all of which are very reasonably priced and very tasty. Our main reason for using Cindy’s home is so that we can visit our parents at the retirement center in Berne. It is a wonderful place for a stop by or for an extended stay.
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Cindy had a very nice victorian home. Loved all the wood work. She was very nice and helpful and kind. She went out of her way for me. She lives in a very nice neighborhood. Reminded me of when I was a child. You could ride bikes and not worry. Traffic went slow. We really enjoyed our stay there and would definitely go back some day.

2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Kristina was super! I had been leery of the second floor location due to knee & balance issues and of being in someone’s home but needed to be close to friends I was visiting for a graduation weekend. I was prepared to make multiple trips up the staircase to get all my belongings up there but Kristina carried my suitcase up which made it so much easier for me. I also needed to iron a blouse and she set up an ironing board & steam iron for me. The whole upstairs has 3 BR, 1 bath, and a sitting room. If only one person, as I was, is staying, none of the other rooms are rented out. You have complete privacy. The bed is quite comfortable and the room was charming. The bathroom has been updated and everything was clean. This was a lovely, clean, quiet, and convenient stay. Thank you!"

Caring and attentive hosts that made me feel at home for a (4) week stay!
I highly recommend this setting!"
2022-02-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Our three nights' stay - under extreme winter conditions - was providential. We were attending a funeral in Bluffton and needed the isolation of an old, two-story farmhouse on a wind-swept, frozen, fallow corn field to complement our grief. We were very grateful for the huge, attached garage: protection for our SUVs. The propane gas furnace did all it could to keep the open spaces in the house habitable, while making the bed- and- bathrooms toasty-warm behind closed doors ...
We very much look forward to returning some happier day."
2022-02-01,5,Group trip,"The farmhouse was extraordinarily clean, and everything was just as described. The hosts checked on us to see if we needed anything on the day we arrived, and they answered questions very quickly. The farmhouse and area in general were very quiet and peaceful; it was great for relaxing and recharging! We could not have asked for a better experience!"
2021-11-01,4,Stayed with kids,Well stocked kitchen. Not the most comfortable furniture but adequate and a great space for our large family to crash. The outdoor space for kids to play was also a perk. The hosts were also super helpful and responsive and kind!
2021-11-01,5,Group trip,"Stephanie and Ryan had a great place! Needed a place to stay with some friends to go to a wedding nearby. Overall, space was clean and what we expected. We didn't spend very much time at the house but it was better than having to drive all the way back into Fort Wayne."
2021-11-01,5,Group trip,We had a wonderful time. Great Hosts
2021-08-01,5,Group trip,Very rural but close to Fort Wayne. We used it for a place to stay while at a wedding in hoagland. Perfect location for that.
2021-07-01,5,Group trip,"We really enjoyed our stay at this quiet farmhouse. We had a family group stay here as we were in town for a family wedding. The house is exactly as described. In addition, it is very clean and well stocked with basic amenities. Our only regret is that we did not have the time to stay longer. The property is beautiful and we would’ve loved to have had an outdoor fire and done some stargazing. We did enjoy sitting on the front porch and just enjoying our space. It fit our needs perfectly. The large table in the kitchen was perfect for our meals as well as some evening card playing. The house has one TV, which is small, but that is not why we were there so not an issue for us. If you want the house to watch some big game, maybe this isn’t the house for you but if you want some quiet and serenity and comfort, it is the place for you."
2021-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This farmhouse was just what we needed for a quick stay on our way from NC to WI. Beautiful, historic, large, comfortable, plenty of room to park and a huge garage, nice basketball court, nice firm beds, close to Fort Wayne but a world away. All that plus gracious hosts."
2021-07-01,5,Group trip,Such a great find! My fiancé and I rented this house with two other couples since we had a wedding to go to in Decatur. We really wanted a house to ourselves so we could catch up with friends we had not seen in such a long time! Stephanie made sure that we had everything we needed and was so sweet! Highly recommend this place to anyone who is visiting the Decatur/Fort Wayne area!

2021-06-01,5,Stayed one night,Wonderful place right outside of Fort Wayne!! I met a mama friend in the middle and it was the PERFECT place to let our kids run wild and free… stay up late drinking tea downstairs while kids slept upstairs… early morning swing set playtime… just PERFECT! So kid friendly!
2021-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Lots of room to roam outdoors and indoors in this peaceful home! We stayed with our two little boys, and there were plenty of beds for all. They loved the swingset and the basketball hoop too. The beds were really comfortable in this house too."
2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Quiet place, clean & very well kept. We will definitely choose this location & host again!"
2021-05-01,5,Stayed about a week,"We spent a week in Stephanie and Ryan's Airbnb and were very happy with the arrangement. There was plenty of room to spread out and relax and this was the best option for us in the New Haven/Southeast Fort Wayne area. It was so much better than a hotel room, and we were able to have relatives over to visit us. We're looking forward to coming back. I had to stay connected to work pretty much the whole time we were there. A wifi network would have been appreciated, but I was able to get by with a mobile hotspot."

2019-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Ryan and Stephanie were the nicest people and treated us like family. The house was clean and it truly gave us the country like feeling, but with all the amenities. We also loved the fact that is was silent all night long. We will be staying here every time we go to Fort Wayne. This is a great place to get away with the family or a great place to stay when you are in town for work."

2019-07-01,5,Group trip,"I absolutely recommend this home. It’s quite, you are able to converse in different areas. My cousin loved the hammock! The owners of this home are quick to respond and make the best accommodations. We are very thankful!"
2019-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"What’s to say but wow! Loved this place, the hosts, the location... everything! It’s a perfect spot for one night or several. Even though it’s not located in downtown Fort Wayne it’s not far from anywhere. We will be back!"
2019-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,The house was amazing! We had a temporary problem with the air conditioning (user error) and Stephanie & Ryan were at the house to fix it within 20 minutes. The house really felt like we were staying at one of our own homes. I highly recommend this place!

2019-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The “Quiet Farm House” was the perfect stay. It is an easy drive to Van Wert, Fort Wayne, and Decatur. The Farm House is well stocked and supplied. “Quiet” is an exact description. Early morning was cool and breezy, the doves were calling, and a train whistle blew in the distance. It totally reminded me of where I grew up. My son and I sat on the front porch one evening and watched a thunderstorm roll by and a rainbow form over the fields. It is a true retreat!"
2019-06-01,5,Group trip,"The house is very comfortable for large groups or families. Very, very clean. We only stayed one night at the house and, unfortunately, didn't have a lot of time to enjoy the surroundings. But we did get a good night's rest before going back on the road and enjoyed a wonderful cup of coffee on the front porch the morning we left."
2019-05-01,5,Group trip,Stephanie and Ryan are wonderful hosts. We were in New Haven for a family wedding and 8 of us stayed at the house. Weather we were all sitting around the kitchen table talking or relaxing on the front porch it felt like we were in a friends home. I’d recommend Stephanie and Ryan’s place to anyone considering staying in the Ft Wayne area and if I’m ever in the area again I will definitely stay again. Thank you guys!
2019-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The place was as described and accurately reviewed by many others. Quiet farmhouse, which was nice to escape the city noise. Communication was fast"

2019-05-01,4,Stayed one night,Good House to stay .
2019-05-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Very nice place. I will say the two twin beds are not that comfortable. If you are traveling with big individuals it might be tight and not the best sleep experience for those. There is no wifi and couldn't figure out the TV. The basketball hoop is tons of fun! The shower has some of a sulfur smell, but it's clean and works with hot water."
2019-05-01,5,Group trip,Great place for a get away! Stephanie was very easy to work with and responded very quickly! The whole entire house is very spacious with two full bathrooms. The house was very clean and can hold a good amount of people. We wished the weather was better to do more things outside but it was still a fun weekend that we used this house! It's in a very private location in the countryside and going into town wasn't a long drive as you would think. We would definitely use this place again if we are in the area.
2019-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,Ryan and Stephanie are awesome hosts and their farm house is just perfect for a quite get away with your family! Thanks guys!! Ken

The house and property is beautiful and offered so much peace and quiet, and truly a place of rest! Stephanie and Ryan were great to work with, as well!!"

The home is well taken care of, clean, and has special touches when you visit. My wife and I highly recommend this as your next stop. The scenery and amenities is hands down some of the best NE Indiana has to offer! Stephanie and Ryan are super friendly and welcoming. Here, you will find not only the rest you want, but the rest you deserve. It was an A+ to us. :)"

2018-08-01,4,Stayed with kids,"Quiet Country Farmhouse is a great name for this Airbnb. The house and yard are large enough to allow everyone to have their own space. Being surrounded by farm fields, you are in the country but still close enough to town to not be an inconvenience. Stephanie, Ryan and family were very friendly and accommodating to our needs."
2018-08-01,5,Group trip,Awesome awesome awesome! If you’re ever in Indiana and you need a little privacy this would be the homes for you. Me and my family had a awesome time at this home and it is quite beautiful it is really something to see. You will enjoy your stay!

2018-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,Great place to bring small kids. Great yard and driveway to play in and quiet atmosphere with plenty of space inside to hang out.
2018-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The house and yard are very spacious and this was a great location for traveling with our 3-year-old. We were just in the area to visit with family, so this was definitely better than staying in a hotel. Oh, and the bed I slept in (upstairs room with bathroom) was super soft and I slept like a baby (until the toddler woke me up at 6 am). No cable but there’s 16 channels pulled in from the antenna, and no Wifi, but it was easily fixable with a hotspot from your cell phone. Love the kitchen table, and my son loved the little tractors and slide. Perfect yard for soccer too."
2018-06-01,5,Stayed one night,thanks for everything
2018-05-01,5,Group trip,"The Quiet Country Farmhouse is correctly named. Very quiet, peaceful and comfortable. In the country, but still close enough to shopping and restaurants.

2018-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Had a wonderful time at Stephanie and Ryan's house. The house is immaculate and in a great spot it's nice and quiet. Only complaint would be the house has no WiFi which was very minor. Overall I would absolutely stay there again.
2018-05-01,5,Group trip,"This was my second time staying at this peaceful house. One of the two bathrooms had an issue, but the host had a repair man fix it in a timely manner. Overall, things went smoothly! I invited Ryan and Stephanie to visit the building I was working on, and they came with their kids. It was great to meet all of them!"
2018-04-01,4,Stayed with kids,Great space for a family to spend the weekend. Our host was helpful and great with communication.
2018-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We really enjoyed our stay this past weekend at Ryan and Stephanie's place. We arrived late evening, but didn't have any trouble finding the home since all the lights had been turned on. It was raining when we arrived, so we were very grateful when we found that the garage door had been left open for us to pull our vehicle into. We very much appreciated their hospitality!"
2018-04-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Country house about 15min from town. No rush-hour traffic. No traffic at all... Very responsive hosts - I needed to change my reservation mid-stay and they accommodated within hours! Read the description; it’s accurate.
I will be returning here."
2018-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Stephanie and Ryan were amazing host. They went above and beyond to accommodate my family on such short notice without hesitation. Stephanie literally responded immediately after I pressed send message : )) . This was my first time using Airbnb, therefore, I didn't know what to expect, but staying at Stephanie and Ryans' home relieved my fears and I will most definitely return on my next trip to Ft Wayne. The home was immaculate with a nice country feel. There is a Dollar General, gas station and very inexpensive restaurant (Richard's) only about 4 minutes away. I highly recommend staying at Stephanie and Ryans'."
2018-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The whole family found this an absolutely delightful place to stay, very repeatable and recommendable! A lovely, homey country setting, a little farther from stores than what we’re used to, but not too far. The kitchen is well-equipped and the kitchen/dining area very spacious for a family or group. The cleanliness and special touches were appreciated, like the candle burning when we arrived. The hosts are gracious and hospitable, quick to respond to our questions. There is a great porch and yard that we hope to enjoy, as well, in the future when it’s warmer."
2018-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,Stephanie and Ryan were great hosts! We met them briefly when we arrived. Everything was as advertised.

I would definitely recommend this place to anyone traveling in the area, who wants some peace and quiet."

2017-10-01,5,Group trip,"The home was better than expected - very clean, updated nice kitchen/dining room and cozy living room. Bedrooms were perfect for families, queen downstairs and 3 bedrooms upstairs for kids with a bathroom. Communication with Stephanie and Ryan was super easy, even on a day they were busy with a family celebration. Very peaceful location, even had a swingset for kids. If we are anywhere near Ft. Wayne in need of an overnight, this is 1st on my list of places to book."

I would gladly stay there again and would recommend this place to any family visiting the Fort Wayne area. We were able to get from the Coliseum to the house in 15 minutes with no traffic.
