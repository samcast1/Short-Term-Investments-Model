2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This is my second time staying at one of Live’s places. I really liked this apartment. It was very clean, free parking, gorgeous living space, and the host was very accommodating. If you’re in the Harrisburg area, definitely consider staying here. He takes a lot of pride in his rentals and it definitely shows."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Would stay again with this host!
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Live's place is great, the location was easily walkable to downtown meetings. Everything was comfortable and well organized. There is quite a bit of traffic noise and walking around from the upstairs apartment, but I would definitely stay again."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,My mother and me stayed in This Airbnb for one night. it was so nice and clean and the shower was really cool. I also loved that there was a parking spot that I could park my car in the back. Overall me my mother and me are very happy with our stay!
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The stay was excellent! This was a work trip. Easy to get around and a super safe and clean area and close to everything. The space was very comfortable and everything you could need was already there. The host was super responsive to any questions. I’d definitely stay here again for work or leisure.
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Live’s home was BEAUTIFUL. The pictures did not do it justice. I will say parking was a hassle being in a larger vehicle than what the parking lot could accommodate, but friendly neighbors came out of their way to assist. I think this home would benefit from added security on the front door I.e, a camera or inside deadbolt since it is right on a busy street. Waterfall shower was a huge plus after a long day of travel! We enjoyed our stay in Harrisburg!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Really enjoyed my short stay here! Everything was incredibly clean and the space felt new. I would stay here again!
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Really comfortable! Felt so luxurious for the price. We had a lovely stay. :)
2024-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The apartment is very clean and tidy, everything from the decoration and arrangement has been done professionally, the view in front of the apartment is very beautiful. Convenient location for tourists because it is close to downtown . I really like this place and will definitely come back in the future 🫶🏼."
2024-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great location for the greenway and bike riding. Very convenient parking and access. Perfect setup.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,this place was beautiful and made it hard to leave
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Pros: The apartment was extremely clean and neat. The bed was comfortable. The shower was excellent. It has a very nice heating and cooling system that works great. The tvs are very nice. Cons: The first one: we got woke up about 2:30am as someone was opening a door and walking on the floor above us. It sounded like they were walking on popcorn as the floors up there must be very old. The second one is small, but there is only a old style electric percolator type coffee maker there. It’d be much easier and convenient to have a Keurig style coffee maker there. We did take advantage of the tea there till we got got coffee later. All in all a very nice place to stay !!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Sweet spot in Harrisburg. Hosts have clearly invested in the space and everything appears pristine. Quick walk downtown for a memorable dinner, wish we had more time to explore!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"It was by far one of the best places I’ve stayed at. Super clean, comfortable and perfect view of riverfront and can walk right up and down it as you please and not have to move your car at all to go to near by restaurants either.
If you are bothered by the homeless population in the area, it may not be the place for you though it’s not heavily populated but you will see it. An outreach program was out serving the population across the street by providing meals and it was lovely to see it be done in the city.
The apartment had everything needed minus oven cookware. That’s something that can be gotten and needed for others to enjoy while they stay for an easy meal. However, no biggie.
It was really a pleasant stay and bed was very comfortable as well as living rm area. It really catered to my needs during my stay for a conference."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Very nice place to stay. Well worth the rate. Comfortable with a great view of the park and lake.
2024-04-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"The location of this Airbnb was incredibly walkable, which I really enjoyed! Furthermore, the interior was beautiful and well-designed. It is, however, beside quite a busy road meaning that you can hear cars at all hours and that it may be troublesome for light sleepers. Overall great place!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Stay was great and was very nice inside.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We loved staying at this location in Harrisburg! The front door lead right out to a beautiful view of the river, which was a great spot to watch the sunset. We really loved the shower and the setup of the bedroom! This was such a cool place to stay for the night and we’d love to stay again next time we visit the area"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great place to stay!
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Live’s place was so clean,!spacious and new. We walked to dinner along Second Street, one block from Front Street. Parking and access to the home were easy. The photos helped with check in instructions. It was our first stay in Harrisburg. The locals were friendly and welcoming. We will stay again when we travel. It was a perfect half way to home for a night’s stay. Thank you!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"One of the best Airbnb's that my boyfriend and I have stayed in. Clean and spacious. We loved the shower and the king sized bed. We had a concert in town and to come home from a long night at the concert and just lay in the comfy bed was amazing. There is a lot of traffic on the road in front of the house but that didn't bother us at all. Just an overall amazing experience, we will definitely be back."
2024-04-01,4.0,Stayed one night,Alright place but a bit noisy upstairs and outside
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Live’s place was extremely clean and the bed super comfy. It was easy to walk along the river and get to several restaurants. The downside was the loud traffic in the morning right out front of the apartment. Also the kitchen is minimally stocked. Even so I would recommend his place to others.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Loved staying here! The place has all the goodies you need, super clean and super cozy. Plus, the host is awesome – so kind and understanding!"

2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Perfect stay. Clean and neat. Very well maintained property.
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Even better than the photos! I enjoyed every moment, from walking up the stone front steps and laying on the king bed, to grinding my own coffee and checking out the view of the river from the front windows on a sunny morning. My stay truly went too fast and I wish I could have stayed longer to enjoy those cozy little getaway! And it felt safe going for a late night walk into downtown, the perfect location if you’re visiting Harrisburg! Thank you for such lovely accommodations!"

2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Wonderful place.
2024-03-01,2.0,Stayed a few nights,"The apt was just like the pictures! So much attention to detail went into the decor. It was clean, comfortable and lacked nothing! HOWEVER, I ended up in that beautiful shower with the rain showerhead, all lathered up in fine body wash and the water turned cold with no way to rinse off the soap! I was Mortified! I contacted the Host, Live via text to let him know about my experience. He read my text and never responded! Can you say ""INSULT TO INJURY!"" This was a Horrible ending to such a wonderful short stay! He showed me No empathy or concern. He did not acknowledge how awful that was for me. No apology, NOTHING!! The footsteps of the people that were in the apt above me, not a problem. They even had a party for St. Patty's Day with music, loud conversation and walking back and forth till 2am, I didn't even mention it. But the cold shower took my experience from a 5 star rating to a 2! I was so disappointed! So if you Love COLD showers and Cold hosts, this is the place for you!"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Every stay with Live is a great stay! This place is amazing, great view off of front st, quiet minus the city noise of course, and extremely clean. Loved my stay! Thank you for being flexible with the late checkout!"

2024-03-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"The place is very clean and has everything you need! Make sure you park in the exact parking spot that is pictured in the listing. Also, since it's downtown and on a busy street, pack ear plugs and a noise machine just in case the neighbors or street traffic is an issue for you. Bed is very comfortable. It's a great price for the location and brand new everything!"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Spent a weekend here and could not ask for a better place. It is walkable to restaurants and bars, and it is right next to the river.

2024-05-01,4.0,Stayed one night,This place is really big. It is located in a very nice neighborhood in the heart of the mountains. It is located very close to Interstate 81 which allowed us to sleep there one night on our way from South Carolina to home in Canada.

2024-02-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Very comfortable stay in a great neighborhood. Close to anything in Hershey or Harrisburg and 81.
Bedroom was great for sleeping as there are no windows. Bed was comfy.
No tv (as mentioned in the listing).
Great Wifi.
You are in the basement so you do hear people above, but not loud.
Walkway to entry would be tricky to anyone with a disability as it downhill and paving stones.
Shower was delightful!
Kitchen also has a furnace, water heater and sump pump in it. Very clean, just wanted to mention it.
Thanks for a relaxing stay!"
2024-02-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"The few things that can be improved.
1. please let people now that it is one level in the house you live in. Not a complete house.
2. The heater every time it turned on, it would make a loud noise.
3. The path going to the back of the house was very slippery in the winter.
4. Since it is the lower floor, you can hear every step they take upstairs."

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Neil and Tone were great hosts and we slept SO well at their place! They greeted us when we got there and informed us that there were kids there with them, but what time they’d be leaving. We go to bed early, and we were able to get settled in the dark, quiet room very easily. The shower was fantastic (very spacious!). They had more than we needed in the kitchen, which was a nice option to have. The goat was sweet and was actually the reason we chose to stay! I would definitely stay there again."

2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,nice place
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Everything was much more then We expected. There was breakfast food, coffee you really couldn't ask for anything nicer. I do wish there was a TV But I did bring my lap top and the internet was great. Getting to the house the GPS took us the long way around and through a neighborhood that wasn't the best. When we did get to the area where the house was it was great."

2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"The best stay we’ve had on Airbnb. The place was spotlessly clean, no dust or any feeling of it. The neighborhood was very lovely, very safe. You can walk around on the sidewalk and there’s a big (soccer/ baseball) field not too far away. Nice to see people playing sport there. Neil and Tone were super helpful and friendly. My little four-year-old loves their goat, Billy. With a goat, some bushes of home-grown vegetable here and there, and a far sight looking down the hill behind the house, the view from the apartment was very relaxing."

The hosts left us things for a morning guest that was very handy and nice. There was even gluten-free coralplex! The bed was very comfy, and the air conditioning was nice. Parking was also not a problem at all, and the neighborhood was very pleasant and welcoming. The real attraction of the place was the little goat they grow- Billy. You don't hear it too much but he greeted us every morning with licks and kisses. It was really cute!
We would definitely love to stay again! Amazing house owners Charming apartment and of course Billy (:"

2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,I loved 🥰
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Great and safe location.
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Conveniently located just off the highway. Neighborhood felt extremely safe. Neil and Tone live upstairs and so are right there if there are any problems (which there wasn’t). Everything was clean and set up for us. They had even set up a small bed for our daughter. And some breakfast stuff for the morning. There is an inside door to their house that you aren’t able to lock from your side and a set of double doors that goes into a large dark garage or something that you can’t lock. It would feel a bit more secure if you had the ability to lock those doors. I wasn’t worried because of all the positive reviews and them being super hosts, but thought any single women might want to know about it beforehand, I wouldn’t have wanted that surprise. All in all we had a great stay."
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Stayed at Neil and Tone's Air bnb. It was a very nice place. I would stay there again.
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,The apartment was perfect for our one night stay!
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Neil and Tone’s place was good for a quick overnight on our drive through Pennsylvania. It is not far from the I-81 and easy to find in a quiet, safe neighborhood. We received really clear check in instructions and also quick answers to our questions. There is a full size kitchen as well as laundry facilities - both are always appreciated by us when we’re on the road. The bed was comfortable and there were extra blankets and pillows handy. As mentioned by others (and in the ad), there is no TV but good Wi-Fi allowed us to easily stream on our computer, and there is no window in the bedroom. The place is no frills, and I probably wouldn’t choose it if I were going to be spending several days, but it was what we needed for the night, and it was definitely a good value."
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Stayed for a night. Just right for what we needed to get a shut eye. Would recommend if you are in the area.
2022-11-01,4.0,Stayed one night,Tone and Neil's apt is conveniently located a few miles off the highway and in a beautiful safe area. Their apt is in the lower basement level with patio double doors that lead out to the patio. The bed is super comfy and we slept great! Breakfast foods and snacks were a bonus! Beautiful extra large shower with good pressure and hot water too! A perfect place to stay on your trip through or for your vacation.
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This facility is a home and the hosts are genuinely interested in making your stay memorable. This is a suburban setting; quiet, super safe and conducive to joggers and walkers. Parking is available in their driveway.
Located between Hershey and Amish country in Lancaster; an easy 30-45 minute drive to either site.
Fully applianced kitchen, washer and dryer, and spacious walk-in shower.
The hosts are genuinely interested in making your stay memorable; their personal pursuits in giving back and reaching out to those in need are reflected in the manner they operate the private lodging for their guests."

2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Good stay.

2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This was a terrific option for my event at Hershey without being in the chaos of the area. Very clean apartment with a great shower and many little touches makes this a great choice!

The unit is very large and nicely furnished with a comfortable bed. The shower is huge and very nice, much nicer than my shower at home. The kitchen is nicely stocked with breakfast food and the essentials if you want to cook. There is no TV, but didn't matter to us.

2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We went to Hershey and didn't want to drive home the same day. The place is exactly what we needed. It is clean and located in a nice, quiet neighborhood."
2022-08-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"Neil and Tone were so kind to let us check in a little past their check in time. The bed was very comfortable. The unit was clean, but needs a good deep clean. The bathroom exhaust fan was caked with dust and in the bedroom there was dust and maybe bug carcasses along the baseboard between the bed and night stand. My allergies were really bad there and I had trouble sleeping. We appreciated the bananas and coffee in the morning. Some of the other food items were past their expiration date."

They also provided some yummy food items like eggs, bagels, cereal etc., which was a very nice gesture. The apartment was comfortable and we slept well! Also has a very nice shower, super fast wi-fi and plenty of room for two people."
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"It was great! The place was big enough to accomodate an air mattress and host our family of 5. The breakfast food was a nice touch. In my opinion, it was much better than staying at a hotel, and it was no more than 30 minutes away from the different activities we chose to do in Hershey."
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The hosts were real nice and even gave us a tour of the accommodations. Unfortunately I wasn’t able to spend the night because the masquerade party I went to lasted longer than expected, but I would gladly stay here again knowing the respect and privacy any guests can receive while staying here."

Owner was quick to respond and offered to have cleaner return but we declined as we had a very busy schedule and felt more comfortable doing a surface cleaning ourselves at that point. Very noisy area, window and doors not well insulated so heard all of the city noises. Overall stay was good although price was high for what our experience was in the end."
2023-07-01,5.0,Group trip,He was amazing and made hosting my first event so smooth and easy. Thank you and I will plan to keep using him to help with accommodations in the future.

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,As stated.
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"It was my second time staying here and it was just as good as the first. It’s convenient as far as traveling about is concerned, being close to downtown and highways. But it’s also in a really nice and quiet residential area. The room is light and airy, with a comfortable bed; the kitchen area is small, but has a fridge, microwave and toaster - all that I needed. I’m looking forward to staying here next time I’m in central Pennsylvania."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Lamont was quick to respond and rectified a problem that we had with internet and Wifi. King bed was comfortable and the room was very clean. Nice big closet, large clean bathroom and a little area with a fridge and small appliances to make our stay even more comfortable. We would definitely stay with Lamont again!!"

2024-01-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"The place looked better than the pictures. Spacious rooms and easy checkin. Well stocked with toiltries and coffee.
The negative is that the temperature appears to be controlled by the main house. The thermostat in the room doesn't do anything. I woke up in the middle of the night and it was 75 in the room. I had to open the windows wide open to cool the room down so I could sleep. It was in the low 20s outside. They do provide a fan which also helped. I probably would not choose this place if you like to sleep on the cool side."
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"A great deal, private, nice."

2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Lamont's private room was an ideal place for me when I needed to rest from a long day of traveling. It was clean, cozy, and felt like staying at a friend's house. I'll definitely keep this place in mind for the future! Thanks!!"
2023-12-01,4.0,Stayed one night,The room was nice although you can’t lock the door when you get inside the room the lock part was on the outside of the door if you lock it your stuck in the room I’m pretty sure there are hidden cameras in the room maybe the clock that doesn’t work but face the bed the bed was comfy nice house just them few things

2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"My son and I stayed at Lamont’s place for a soccer tournament. It was easy to find, and he provided clear instructions for entry. He does mention in his listing to leverage your expectations thats it’s not a 5 star rating, but I was thoroughly impressed. It worked for us as we were only staying one night. Lamont was also very responsive. If you need anything just reach out to him. If I’m up that way for a tournament again I’ll definitely lodge there again."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"It was peaceful and quiet there and I liked the private entrance, the large bathroom and the setup to have coffee and some meals with the microwave and fridge."

2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Lamont has not had to be ""responsive"" since everything has been setup so well. This last visit I had question and Lamont responded within minutes.

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"No information was provided beforehand on the access code for entry and it took a long time to find someone, who lived in the main house, to help.
No information inside the apartment on the local WiFi code and password"

2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This was my second time staying here and it was great. Very clean and spacious. Friendly and responsive host. Great deal for the cost.
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Very large & comfortable space - surprisingly bigger than on the photos !

2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Clean and easy to find! Friendly and informative host. The mattress/pillows/bedding were a little uncomfortable but it was worth the price!
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This was my first stay at an Airbnb. Lamont was a great host providing easy directions on how to access the room, where to park, and how to reach him if I needed to. The room was private, clean, and secure. It was a lovely stay while traveling across Pennsylvania."

2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Lamont was very helpful and accommodating. The area was comfortable and homey. Enjoyed my stay and use again if available. Would recommend.
Charlie"
2023-08-01,3.0,Stayed one night,"Clean and comfortable.
Glad to see a bathtub, but alas no stopper.
Bed sheets are polyester. Yuck, but whatever. But shocked to find no mattress pad,just bare mattress under a very thin bottom sheet. I was creeped out contemplating the various peoples' sweat and other.......and having no washable barrier between the mattress and the sheet.
Clock on the wall: no battery.
Coffee area: 1 keurig-type coffee and lots of Splenda, no sugar.
Odd that the dorm sized refrigerator opens to the wall. Hinge can easily be switched to make it more convenient.
I just didn't feel the love.
It was a place to crash.
I wouldn't go back."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Quite and clean
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,A fantastic place for me to stay the night to break up my drive from Charlotte to Albany. Lamont was responsive and the place was clean! Would stay again if I am ever in Harrisburg again :)
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This was a great place to stay! My spouse definitely enjoyed herself, and we felt right at home. We will definitely be returning when we visit Pennsylvania!"
2023-08-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Nice, quiet place to stay"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Lamont’s place was clean and comfortable for a one night stay. Bed was comfortable and bathroom was large with good lighting. Small fridge and microwave along with keurig were a huge perk.
Only thing that was odd was the parking arrangement. You have to park on the street even though there is a large driveway, although i was able to pull car up to unload and unload, I felt a bit uncomfortable parking on the street.
Overall a nice place and quiet neighborhood close to where I was working."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"A great place to stop for a night or two. Easy check-in process, and quite spacious. Great value for the price!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"I really loved staying here. The bed is extremely comfortable and the simple kitchen was more than adequate for my needs. The place is in a quiet neighborhood, but close to places I needed to go (downtown Harrisburg, restaurants, major roads, etc.) What's more, there are quiet, peaceful places to go walking close by (the Greenbelt, a lovely pathway around the city that makes you feel you are in the countryside). Lamont was great at responding to any questions I had. I'd certainly stay here again next time I'm in the area."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Great overall experience, at a great price, with a couple of things worth noting.
If you are staying in the room at the side of the house, you have to park on the side of the road. I can't understand why, when there is room for plenty of vehicles. I don't like parking on the side of the road.
The cleaning fee was sufficient for the cleaning to be a bit more thorough. The ceiling fan had quite a build up of dust, which should have been easily seen by the cleaning person."
2023-07-01,3.0,Stayed one night,"It's true that this is not a five-star hotel as very well specified in the listing. The accommodation is clean, spacious and old-fashioned.
The neighborhoods crossed to get there are underprivileged but once you arrive, it's correct and calm.
The feedback with Lamont is not very optimal.
I would not receive a friend like this but for 1 night, at this price, once a few small work is done, the accommodation is good"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This was the perfect and most affordable place to stop after a long day of traveling. Lamont has a beautiful room with everything you can ask for.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Perfect for an overnight stay! Safe and quiet location! Pleasure staying with Lamont once again!
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,pretty good
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,I was in town for work and Lamont’s place was close. It was in a quiet neighborhood near some local walking trails. Really great place to stay if you need something quiet and convenient!
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"exactly as described! Great place to stop over while travelling. place was clean, including bathroom and towels, which was great! we only stayed from 1030pm to 11am. private, quiet, easy to find, minimal things to do before check out! Host was very responsive even though we checked in super late at night. thank you, we would love to come back when we are in the area!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great quiet place to stay with private entrance and private bath!
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Everything is beautiful and comfortable thanks a lot

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"2nd time here, always will be a repeat customer"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We were looking for an affordable place for one night in Harrisburg, and Lamont’s room with a King-sized bed and private bath fit the bill. Lamont’s check in process was smooth and instructions were clear and complete. When next I’m in Harrisburg, Lamont’s properties will be my first choice!"
2023-06-01,4.0,Stayed one night,Lamont is a very good host!

2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Perfect place to crash for a quick weekend trip to Hersheypark. ~20 mins from the park in a safe, quiet neighborhood. Can't beat it for the price, especially as a solo traveler. Exactly what I needed, nothing more and nothing less. Would stay here again in the future!"
2023-06-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,"Inexpensive place to rest up, needs some TLC.
Really wish the AC could have kept up with the high temps."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Great place, cozy. Even had a microwave, which was a pleasant surprise!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Recent trips to low end motel chains, like Days Inn, have been bad (as in filthy), making AIRbnb so important as an alternative. The individual hosts have a vested interest in keeping their properties pristine and I have never been disappointed. For this stay, everything was thought out, clear instructions, no problems. I'll be back next year."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,A great place at a great price.

2023-05-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"I was at a conference in Hershey and this was the perfect spot to land! Great little kitchenette setup with a mini fridge, toaster, and coffee additions!"
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Pleasant room, nice neighborhood, and close to Harrisburg center (by car). Suited my needs and at a fair price. Ah, and good communication with Lamont. Thank you!"
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"A quiet, restful stay. It was just what a weary traveler needed. Great location near the highway."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"So incredibly worth it. A real hidden gem. Way better than what we expected for the price. Like a hotel but half the price!! super clean, spacious bed, all the tv entertainment access you could ask for. Bathroom amenities. All great!"
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Just exactly what I needed to attend a two day seminar on the east side of Harrisburg. Easy in and out. Was able to travel local roads and avoid the interstates.
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I am very satisfied with my stay,the completely independent private room is very comfortable and reserved if I had to go back to Harrisburg I would definitely go back"
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Great stay, clean and beautiful, will b back"
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We just needed a quiet place to relax and sleep before continuing on our road trip and we found it here! Very clear instructions and directions. Ive always disliked paying tons of money at hotels just to have a bed to sleep in so yet another air bnb making lodging affordable so we can spend on money on fun things to do!
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We had a short stay at Lamont's place on our way home from Myrtle Beach. The location close to the highway was perfect for us.
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Comfortable and perfect for an over night stay when you’re traveling on the road!
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We made reservations for our trip to New England on the way there and another one for the way back. For a quick stop just to sleep and get back on the road was our reason for staying. you can not beat the price for a stay. Huge TV to unwind. small kitchenette area with coffee and microwave and mini fridge. I would stay again if needed but not for long term as the bed tends to slope to the right and I roll to the middle. Its a king size bed I believe so that helped with room. Overall best bang for your buck!!
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,It was an amazing stay! I’ll definitely stay again in the future.
2023-03-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Very nice and well maintained. Would recommend and will stay again if I'm back that way

2023-03-01,2.0,Stayed one night,"I have stayed here one other time and it was a perfect stay. This time I communicated with the host to tell them about my arrival and departure, as well as a message telling them I had no towels in the room I never heard from them until 24 hours after I left stating they were busy at work very unfortunate situation since the listing is a beautiful place to stay. Maybe this is unusual, but still not acceptable."

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Really great neighborhood. Clear instructions for parking. We arrived super late due to travel difficulties but Adam was still responsive when we didn't read his directions well enough and missed that the door was on the 3rd floor and not the 2nd!
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"The stay was perfect - our little one slept will in the crib provided, the space was clean and the balcony was an added perk for the adults!

2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Very spacious and clean. In a great location to explore Harrisburg and surrounding areas. The unit is located in a very historic part of town, close to the core. Communication with host was excellent. The unit had every amenity you might need, plus nice extra touches such as chocolate, wine, and flowers! Located on the top floor of a heritage building, so two narrow steep staircases to climb. Not an issue for us, but might need to consider this for others with mobility issues or with small children."

2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The apartment met our needs perfectly. It has the feeling of spaciousness in the kitchen and living room area because of the high ceiling. It was very clean and thoughtfully decorated, no clutter. While we didn’t use the balcony area because it was Dec, I could tell it would be fun to hangout there.
An additional nice touch was providing locally sourced product like coffee from Lil Amps and wine from SpringGate winery. And of course Hershey candies!
Adam was very responsive to any questions we had along the way. A prospective renter should be comfortable with stairs. Once you are in the apartment you are well rewarded."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This is the second time we’ve stayed at Adams place. It’s just perfect. Clean, comfortable, cozy. He’s one of the best Airbnb hosts we’ve ever stayed with.

Adam seems to have a talent for anticipating every need a guest may have and I can honestly say there was not a single oversight. This is an exceptional spot and we were so sad to leave.
If you are lucky enough to stay here, don’t miss happy hour and/or dinner at Note across the street! Delicious.
Thank you Adam for a wonderful and memorable stay."

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a great stay at Adam's rental. He gave us all the information we needed, especially about the parking. We didn't have time to check out the nearby restaurants, but he gives a lot of detailed recommendations."

It was beautiful with great natural lighting and an incredible balcony. Adam was very gracious to allow us to film there not having done it before. He was responsive and gave very clear instructions.

2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The place was so clean! One of the best airbnb stays I’ve had so far. Great price as well. They’re was candy and bottle of wine for us when arrived, so sweet! The location was overall very nice however, not too much to do in Harrisburg itself, its a slower city. However, we were able to walk to the downtown capital area and explore, it was all 20-30 minutes away. It is very close to the water so we were able to do a sunset walk which was great. The apartment is a great size and the balcony is a plus. Off street Parking was also a benefit. Would recommend others to stay here, and we would stay here again if visiting for Hershey. Adam was very responsive and sent detailed instructions."
2023-09-01,5.0,Group trip,Exactly as advertised! Very clean and the beds were very comfortable. The location is great and the balcony at sunset is a must.
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Adam went above and beyond to help me with parking when he found out the parking lot would be closed for paving.

The home was beautiful and the riverfront walk gorgeous. I will definitely stay again.

2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We had a wonderful stay! We enjoyed visiting downtown Harrisburg. The capital building and museum are within walking distance. Our main trip was to Hershey Park, which takes about a 25-30 minute drive, not bad at all.
We were worried about finding parking on the street, but luckily, Adam had a parking permit we could use to park in the parking lot across the building. That was very helpful!
We loved the fully-equipped kitchen and coffee bar. The apartment was clean and lovely! The host, Adam, was very attentive and would respond promptly if we ever needed anything. We definitely will come back again! Thank you so much Adam for your hospitality!"

The porch is adorable and provided us with fantastic sunset views. The space has everything you need to cook, relax, etc. The beds are super comfy and the linens are luxurious. The bathroom has shampoo, conditioner, and body wash in installed dispensers, which is very convenient. We went to The Millworks for dinner and it was delicious! Highly recommended.
Adam was a wonderful communicator and answered all questions immediately and politely.
In our opinion, your search is over for a place in Harrisburg. It’s simply Adam’s place!"

2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Cute, clean and spacious. Everything
You need is there!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Family of four, including a pre-teen and teen, loved this place! Absolutely everything we could possibly need was included at this adorable apartment right down to creamer for my coffee. This completely furnished gem made our travels so much easier! Full kitchen, towels and linens, in-unit laundry, games, toiletries - the list goes on.
We chose Harrisburg for its central location to places we were visiting in PA - Gettysburg, Hershey, and Philadelphia. The apartment was in a convenient location for getting in and out to highways, yet set in a quiet, safe neighborhood with great food and walkable to downtown Harrisburg.
Host Adam was so great from the beginning, even before we arrived. I asked for advice on our travel plans and his guidance was useful and right on. His communication and instructions for arrival were thorough and continuous during our entire stay.
We loved everything about our stay and I’m confident anyone would love staying here."

2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was our first time renting and we were beyond pleased with our experience. Adam was very accommodating. Everything was clean, comfortable, and exactly as described. Adam was responsive and sensitive to our needs and offered his assistance as we looked for short term monthly rentals in the area. We would definitely stay there again and was disappointed to hear that he was booked for most of the summer."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Wow! What a lovely little apartment! Adam's home was exactly as described and then some. The perk of the stay was the balcony - watching the sun set over the skyline was fantastic. And the entire place was so clean and nicely furnished. The location was central to all of our planned activities and the notes from Adam on 'things to do' led us to the greatest little restaurants in the area. I highly recommend checking Adam's place out for any stays you may plan in the area of Harrisburg, PA."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"It was basically perfect. I wish I could stay here no matter where we go--in some sort of magical, Howl's Moving Castle sort of way. Loved sitting on the balcony for morning coffee. Bunk beds were perfect for the kids. The bed was super comfortable! It had literally every amenity I could possibly want. Plenty of everything! Close to all the things!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"A first class apartment with a first class host.

2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This stay was great! Adam is very responsive and so you won’t have any trouble checking in, parking or checking out. Cute little extras!

2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Very clean and well located home. Parking right across the street was super convenient but most of the time we were able to find parking right in front of the house. Kids were able to have fun playing games and watching TV while we worked. I will for sure book again!
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Great care and attention to detail was made for our stay. Water in the fridge, a selection of coffee and snacks, even an aperitif if we were so inclined. We arrived at the beautiful private apartment with sun streaming in, a gorgeous view, and everything clearly labeled and laid out. We only stayed one night, but could easily have stayed several weeks very comfortably."
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Adam was a great host- checked in with us to make sure we arrived and were able to access everything. Location is excellent and apartment was so clean.

2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"First off Adam is a great guy who communicates well. His instructions are easy to follow and accurate.
The apartment was perfect! Clean, neat, and comfortble. The kitchen is well equipped, the main bedroom has a new comfortable mattress, and the balcony is an ideal spot to enjoy a morning cup of coffee. The apartment is located in an active yet quiet neighborhood, convenient to restaurants, shopping, highways, and just a block from the riverwalk.
This was perfect place to stay during my visit to Harrisburg."

The apartment is spacious and quiet. All appliances are new and work great.
Adam was a wonderful host—responsive and friendly and helpful, with a dash of good humor! I highly recommend this place—and if you do stay here, do not miss The Midtown Scholar bookstore on N. 3rd Street. A true gem!"
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was the perfect place for a girls' weekend trip. It was clean, cozy, and the perfect size.

2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great space and Great view! Will be booking again!
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I must say that, I enjoyed my stay so much I can't wait to stay there again. Adam was very friendly and polite. I also liked that there was parking available. The house was very clean and he had many amenities, a nice bottle of wine, some snacks, board games, and a coffee station. As a woman, I did appreciate that he had a black “makeup” wash clothes so when I took my make-up off I wasn't messing up any other towel. The view from the balcony was amazing and so relaxing. I would definitely recommend this home."

2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Adam's apartment was perfect for our short stay in Harrisburg. We appreciated the little touches, like Hershey Kisses and wine waiting for us upon arrival. The place was spotless and well appointed with the necessities. The beds were firm, but we thought they were very comfortable. We liked having two different televisions and access to the washer/dryer. Adam gave us some great local food recommendations. We enjoyed walking through the city and along the waterfront trail, and visiting Hershey Park. Parking was never a problem, and we felt very safe in our surroundings. The three flights of stairs may be an issue for some, bur was not an issue for us. We loved the cute little deck overlooking the street as well. We would definitely stay in this location again!"
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Adam was a great host and our stay was flawless. The apartment was spotless, well-stocked, and comfortable.

2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My two teenage sons, husband and I thoroughly enjoyed our stay at Adam’s apartment. The place was exactly as pictured and fantastically clean (very important to me). 30-minute drive to Hershey, which is where we needed to be. The bedrooms are as described and someone could also sleep on the sofa outside, if they wanted. Linens were great; my husband LOVED the foam memory mattress on our bed. We didn’t cook — it was a short stay — but from what I saw, there were enough cooking supplies and equipment to handle that if needed. Great internet.
Our stay was in December, but we would have loved sitting out on the balcony if the weather had been warmer (we did step out and explore it).
Adam is the best part of this rental. He’s super responsive and extremely helpful. He answered all of my questions almost immediately over chat. He had great recommendations for food and checked in that we were doing ok. My sons want me to figure out another reason for us to visit again
Stay here!"
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Adam is a great host. He was very responsive and gave great recommendations for places to visit. He was very responsive and his apartment was everything we could ask for and more! Couldn’t ask for a better AirBnb! Would highly recommend!
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"I was immediately pleased by how spotless and clean it was! We had come after a long day at Hershey Park and we were ready for a good nights sleep.

2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Adam’s place is just as it looks in pictures! Very clean and everything looks like new! We had a nice stay here. The place was stocked with towels, extra blankets, a blow dryer, and even toothpaste and toothbrushes if you happen to forget your own. TV had Netflix, YouTube, Disney+, and other apps. The location was perfect for all the places we visited on our trip (Lancaster less than an hour away, Echo Dell Caverns 20 min away, Hershey less than 30 min away). We had breakfast at Tomato Pie Cafe two times (less than 15 min away). Adam communicated with us before and throughout our visit. I would definitely recommend staying at Adam’s place."

2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We had a great stay! Adam had excellent communication and we found the apartment to be exactly as advertised. It was very pleasant and clean. One thing that I especially liked was the cooking equipment was good quality and not just the cheapest available - which made cooking more enjoyable. We had a beautiful view of the sunset from the balcony. There were many restaurants near by - we especially enojyed Burger Yum. It was an easy drive to the Lake Tobias Wildlife Zoo, Hershey World, and the Turkey Hill Experience - all of which my kids loved."

2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Adam’s place was immaculate. Because the airBNB is a dedicated space for such purposes, it really has the feel of being all yours. In the shower, for example, there are pumps for body wash, shampoo, and conditioner. The apartment is amazingly soundproof for its size. The kitchen is equipped and alcoholic beverages were gifted. There are some cool restaurants and cafes in the area and the walk along the sesquehanna river is lovely. I will be back!"
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Great apartment in a beautiful old part of Harrisburg, five minutes' walk from the superb 1836 cafe.

2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great place!
2022-09-01,5.0,Group trip,"This was one of the nicest AIRBNBs we’ve ever stayed in. It was roomy, comfortable, had every amenity you could think of, and the host was so responsive and nice.

2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Hi Adam,
Jon said the you two texted and he let you know about a couple of minor tweaks that he thought you should make (shampoo dispenser, etc). We just talked, he thought you place was wonderful. I think that once you get a few more reviews you might either raise the rate slightly or at least do a 2-night minimum.
Maybe I will come by one of these days; good luck Adam — sounds like you will be a Super Host soon!"
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We had a wonderful stay at Adam's place! Everything was as described and in fact exceeded our expectations. Adam was was very responsive to any questions we had and went out of his way to make us feel welcome. We would definitely recommend staying here!

My friends and I were trying to find a place to stay at since we were visiting the area and this one clearly stuck out to us. Communication with the owner was easy and friendly, the process of getting in was simple, the condo was extremely clean, and the look/style of the condo was magnificent!
This condo is definitely a great choice and I thought it was worth every penny spent."

You wont find a better value for your buck in Harrisburg specially when the hotel prices can soar due to being the capital and lots of gatherings, events and such.

Besides that it’s super super clean and nice !"
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Ben’s place was fabulous! Perfect little spot to explore Harrisburg for my sisters wedding weekend. The place is spotless and the bed and linens were very comfortable. My only small complaint is the curtains do not block out much light from street lamps for the morning sun. Blackout curtains would make the place absolutely perfect.
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great and spotless efficiency apartment perfect for a couple or single traveler. It’s right across the street and has gorgeous views of the capital! Walking distance to restaurants and bars. It was a quick and cheap Uber to our concert at XL Live.
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Spent 2 nights in Ben's place on a business trip to Harrisburg. The description matched my experience, which meant it was perfect for the occasion.
Enjoyed the downtown location across from the capitol. Walkable to good restaurants and pubs. Just a few blocks to the river and the island and a great river walking/biking trail where I went running.
I was a little nervous ahead of time about the street parking but it was not a problem at all. If I'm back in Harrisburg again anytime soon, I'd happily stay at Ben's place."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,I had originally scheduled a different date. Ben accommodated when plans changed and helped me move my dates quite easily. Not only did he adjust my dates but also adjusted the cost based on the dates available. Highly recommend!
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Loved this place! View is great, the entire downtown is walkable, and the bed is comfy. 10/10 would stay again!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Everything was as described. The free parking is on Commonwealth Way, the employee parking signs where we parked were free and we did not get towed.
The only troublesome thing was the two eye burners that would overheat if using both eyes, so used only one. There were instructions on how to use the burners. It seems to constantly need to be unlocked. There wasn't a broom and dustpan so you may want to bring a little hand one in case you spill something and the knob in the cabinet kept coming off.
None of the issues above warranted a drop in rating. Overall this place was perfect in location, size, and amenities. Everything was perfect, thus, five stars.
My sister and I enjoyed our stay and would certainly visit again if the need arose. Thanks, Ben."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place is great! Super clean, very cute/well designed, and Ben was a great host. I will definitely book here again for future stays in Harrisburg. The location of the apartment is central to the Capitol and lots of restaurants, food, shopping, etc. I felt comfortable and safe during my stay and will definitely return! Thank you, Ben!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Amazing place amazing owner. Would rent again 10/10
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Perfect sport for travelers visiting the town or staying overnight. Easy to find and feels like home. Very comofortable set up. I would come back again
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This place was amazing and an awesome location if you are coming to visit the Capital or are her for business. I arrived slightly earlier than my check-in time and was able to meet the hosts. They were both so lovely and kind to me. The place is great to relax in, but also perfect if you need to get some work done. 10/10 recommend!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"What a great location. We had dinner and a concert, each a five minute walk. McGrath's Pub and a Steve Hackett concert at Whitaker center made a dynamic combo. The place itself was terrific with a very comfortable bed and everything we might need for an overnight. The unit is very clean and modern with a view of the capital outside the front window. We would come back in a heartbeat."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great place! I’ve been here twice already and will come again!

2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great location across from the beautiful state capitol and capitol complex. Walkable to local restaurants. Nice natural lighting through windows that face the street. There is traffic noise but the fan helps keep the level down. Monday - Friday you will get louder early morning traffic noise. Needs an extra blanket for the comfy bed. The kitchen is small with only few pots and pans if you plan to cook. Would definitely stay there again for a few days.
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Exactly as advertised-
I was there during the week and able to park right in front of the building.
Apartment was quiet and clean.

2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This Air BNB was a wonderful delight. Any questions or comments I had were answered immediately. The apartment was spotless and looked the same as the photos (house keeping team deserves to be paid well for the great work they do). The other guest there were respectful for the most part and followed house rules as requested. The shower and bathroom was wonderful and spacious. I would recommended to anyone to come to this location if visiting Harrisburg, PA is something they wish to do."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We booked super late in the evening, but Ben responded super quick and place was ready for our arrival an hour later.

I was able to get up in the morning and take a run down the street to the island. I felt safe and comfortable. Additionally, the coffee shop around the corner was a bonus. Highly recommend Ben’s airbnb."

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Everything was great, thanks!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great place. The only recommendation we have would be a few more pillows on the bed. Only one per person was kind of spartan.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Ben's place was a much better value than the local hotels and was an easy walk to the Capitol. The apartment is spacious and uncluttered. Climate control was excellent, even on the hot day. Easy walk to ZeroDay and Cork & Fork. I recommend Ben's place for central downtown Harrisburg!"
2023-07-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"Great little apartment to stay in for a night or two! Very central location and Ben is very responsive through the booking process. Only reason I gave 4 stars instead of 5 is because I was told via message there would be an iron there and there was not, and the bed could use a couple more pillows (we just brought our own!)"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We've stayed at Ben's places a few times now and they never disappoint. This was our first time in this unit and it was perfect. Clean and convenient. Cool vibe with exposed original bricks and beams. Nice layout and the steam shower was awesome. Not to forget the outside rear courtyard, so peaceful and quiet to chill at the end of the day. Ben was very hospitable and gave us good recommendations on places to eat/visit."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Comfortable, clean, cozy place. Great A/C fir this hot summer. Parking is an issue in this area, but free spaces available at night and within a quick walk during the day. Felt safe and homey. We’ve booked here twice."

2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Be. was incredibly thorough about checking in. The location was great, only a 4-minute walk from the train station. Very close (5 min walk) to downtown restaurants. Only stayed one night, was just in town for business, but would definitely stay again on a future visit."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great place! Great location with easy street parking right outside. I enjoyed reading in the bay window at night. It is a bit small, I don’t think I would want to be there with someone but as a solo traveler it was a lovely stay."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,The apartment was perfect for our one night stay. Its a small studio. It was clean and cozy.

2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Wonderful and cozy place to stay for a night in Harrisburg. We loved the simple open design and comfortable mess that was achieved with simple and clean furnishings. The view was great. The location was perfect for walking around the capitol for business, entertainment or exploring the many restaurants. Thank you!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I can not recommend this place anymore!!! It is absolutely beautiful, walking distance from some great restaurants and across the street from the capital. The hosts are kind, communicative, and very highly accommodating! I say 6 our 5 stars. Absolutely stay here if you can!"

2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I stayed at Ben's place for only one night on my way through. However it was so nice, beautifully decorated, clean, and located perfectly it certainly made me want to stay longer! Only thing I will note, (and this is my fault) I had a much too large suitcase and if you lack arm strength and good balance, it can be quite a challenge to lug it up those stairs in particular ."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Everything was great. Ben sent really helpful instructions for us to check in. Everything was as described.
We liked how the apartment is decorated, also the room is very spacious."

2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Great location to explore the capitol area and the beautiful park-like setting surrounding the state buildings. Short walk to the river for fun, scenic strolls. Nice restaurants and pubs close by. The studio apartment is very clean and comfortable....a bit of street noise, but not a show stopper. Excellent communication from the hosts and highly recommended for a stay!"

2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I really like this listing. Right downtown in Harrisburg. Parking could be tricky/paid during the day, but I was just there at night and had no problem parking right out front. The place is super cute with exposed brick and updated kitchen. Loved the shower. Plenty of space to feel comfortable and at home. Thanks so much!"
2023-04-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"The place is very cute and the location is good for walking. We had street parking right out front which was great. Street traffic was pretty loud as were other inhabitants of the building, so I'd bring ear plugs. The bed was fine, but I'd bring additional pillows if there are more than one of you staying - both pillows were very flat and floppy, not great for two sleepers. No hair dryer."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Easy to find, clean, and right across the street from the capitol."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I stayed in Harrisburg to break up a long drive and this was the perfect stop, although I regret not staying a bit longer!

2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,I stayed for 1 night for a work trip. It was exactly what I needed! Small desk to work at with excellent WiFi. Location is perfect if you are headed to the capitol. Hosts were very communicative. Would recommend.

2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Stayed here 1 night passing through Harrisburg. Was here on a Sunday to Monday so parking on Walnut was free all of Sunday and easy. Used the parking app after 8 am Monday. This bnb is perfection for 1 or 2 people. Loved it. Outstanding host communication. Comfortable bed. If you are interested in history/architecture, I recommend booking a free statehouse tour right across the street."

The location is very convenient and within walking distance of many restaurants, bars, the capitol park, etc. It was surprisingly not too loud for being downtown. Everything from check-in to parking information was detailed and simple to follow.

Would definitely stay here again!"

2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"11/10 you should stay here. If not for the steam shower, stay for the patio area, if not for the patio area, stay for the amazing coffee shop down stairs. I stumbled upon this amazing place just looking for a place to stay while I had a state meeting/weekend trip with my boyfriend. We were so close (walking) distance to “restaurant row” or second street.
If you are punk rock/metal/emo fans please do yourself a favor and find your way to JB Lovedrafts and order the chili with grilled cheese. Every place we ate at was amazing, we took an eating break and walked around the water. I never thought I’d go back to Harrisburg for just a fun weekend trip, but we are definitely planning that and it’s because of this location! Ben was great, very responsive and the apartment is so cute. I love it. Book here"

But this has something else that makes it stand out - a fabulous host that really stocks the place like no other! Nice selection in the bar area.. Additionally, LIndsay went out of her way to provide us vegan food especially for us - tons of items! I've never had a hostess go to such efforts. Both beds are super soft and comfy, and she also paid attention to our chemical sensitivities with the linens, which was much appreciated. It was the kind of home that truly felt like home, right from the moment we arrived. Easy walk to the water and its nice walking path, with Little Amps coffee on the way (yummy butterfly pea coffee) and do not miss Millworks! Best brewery/art gallery I've seen. We would love to return."

We loved the two queen size beds and large closets with lots of hangers! The large bathroom was easy to share with my sister.

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Such a cool spot. It was perfect for our family. The house was super clean and so comfortable. We enjoyed all the extra things like the snacks and drinks. Bike ride down by the river was great. The host was so nice and quick to respond. We would love staying here again.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This was our second time staying here for good reason. Lindsay's place is fabulous and perfect for our needs. Spotlessly clean and Lindsay is always an excellent host and communicator. We will definitely stay here again when we return to Harrisburg. A++
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We had a great stay! Lindsay was very flexible and ensured we had everything we could have needed to make our stay a great one. Next time we’re in town we will definitely stay here again. Thank you!!
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Staying at Lenda's Airbnb was a pleasant experience. The place was clean and tidy, and the host was friendly and accommodating. They were quick to respond to any questions or concerns we had and made sure we had everything we needed for a comfortable stay. Overall, we had a great stay and would recommend [host's name]'s Airbnb to others."""
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We really enjoyed our stay and felt welcome and comfortable. The website with instructions is awesome! As for the place itself, it’s one of the best stays we’ve had. Lindsay went above and behind with amenities, beverages, snacks, and even breakfast items. The items for our fur babies were an added plus! As someone else stated, we were skeptical of the neighborhood upon arrival, but felt safer as the night went on when we walked our dogs. Thank you again!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We had a great stay at Lindsay's place in Harrisburg. We were visiting for a trip to Hershey Park, and the house was far enough away to have a good break in our day. The check-in was easy, and the place was clean and comfortable. The kitchen was stocked with everything that may be needed for our short trip from almond milk, Nutella, and breakfast basics. The coffee was past the best before date, but that gave us a chance to explore the area. The Broad Street Market is very nice walk from the house and has everything!
The living room had a variety of alcohol stocked and mixers in the fridge. The bed was very comfortable and we slept peacefully. The back patio was a nice place to sit and have tea. It was surprisingly quiet.
We wanted to take the 🚲s out, but one had a flat. Lindsay did her best to remedy this by guiding us to other bikes available. Because of this, Lindsay made the other bikes available to us for later. We will definitely again. Thank you!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Lindsay’s place was so inviting and immaculate. Should you need to stay in Harrisburg for longer than a day or two this is the place to stay. Unfortunately, my daughter and I were only at her place for a lacrosse tournament and it was a bit too far for us. However, it seemed easily accessible to all the great places in Harrisburg and is only a couple of blocks away from the water."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The hosts were responsive and very friendly. The place looked just like the pictures and was very clean. They even had snacks and drinks on hand, which was great. My only complaint was about the neighborhood, it looked really run down and we didn’t feel very safe at night walking in from our cars. I wished there was at least out door cameras by both doors just for added security."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Upon arrival, we were a little skeptical with the area (we’re not used to city living), but we once we settled in and explored we felt very safe and at home.
The area was very quiet during the day and especially at night. It was also very close to everywhere we wanted to go/see.
The house was so clean and accommodating to all our needs.
Lindsay communicated very well with us during check in and was very kind and helpful! I would recommend this place to anyone looking to travel to Harrisburg!"

Highly recommend for anyone needing a stay in the Harrisburg area."

2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We had a great stay at Lindsay’s AirBnB nestled in the heart of Old Town Harrisburg. It was super convenient to have off street parking nearby, and we loved being within walking distance of two of our Harrisburg favorites (Alvaro’s and Little Amps Coffee). The home was well appointed and extremely comfortable with lots of personal touches throughout (bonus points for several coffee creamer choices in the fridge and a selection of snacks and breakfast items). We would definitely stay again when we are in town!"
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This is how an Airbnb should be! Everything was perfect start to finish, and it would be a pleasure to stay at this property again!"

Lindsay goes above and beyond with the little extra touches like treats and coffee! Easy parking and entry! Well worth it!
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We were so sad to have only 1 night at this wonderful spot. We immediately felt at home with the cozy decor. The touches like comfy throw blankets and snacks and drinks made us feel like invited guests.
We enjoy walking to find new sights to explore and we were able to find a great coffee shop, the big market, and a brewery within a 15 minute walk.
If this listing is available, do not pass on it. You won't be disappointed."
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This was the nicest Airbnb stay I've ever had, and I've had several 5-star stays.

Property is decorated so comfortably, cozy and classy.
I'm from Houston but would look for reasons to come back to Harrisburg just to stay at this place again. Thank you so much for a great stay!"

Hershey is just 25 minutes away as well. Everything was clean and very neat including the washer and dryer so we felt comfortable using them. Having an assigned parking space was really nice and a relief since you don’t have to spend time looking for a spot or worrying about street cleaning schedules and where you can/can’t park. Lastly, there were some nice touches like providing a bed and bowls for pets, everything you need for a continental breakfast and some drinks both of the alcoholic and non-alcoholic kind."

The inside is tastefully decorated, and there are thoughtful little touches everywhere that we really appreciated. The kitchen is fully stocked - we really appreciated the kcups and creamer and the snacks available to us after a 2 hour drive! We used the master bedroom - the bed was comfortable and the bedding dream-like.
We would absolutely stay here again if in the area. Thanks for hosting us!"
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We LOVED this apartment. It was probably the nicest Airbnb we’ve ever stayed in!

2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Lindsay's place was immaculate, we only stayed for one night as we were passing through Harrisburg but we felt more than welcome. The place was spotless, check in was easy, and having designated parking spots was perfect. We really enjoyed having personal A/C units in the bedrooms as A/C isn't always a guarantee in PA."
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Lindsay's place is absolutely beautiful, and she stocks literally every amenity that visitors might want. The beds and bedding are great, and the location is near the terrific Capitol Greenway along the river, a great coffee shop, a pastry place and a market.

2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Lindsay's place is so lovely! There are so many amenities, it's truly worth the price. Even down to the sheets, towels, cookware etc. it's clear Lindsay has put in a lot of time keeping this place cozy and up to date. Plus, there's 2 porches and an outside area in the back. Definitely worth staying!"
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Fantastic stay! Wonderful place with thoughtful touches. Highly reco.
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Lindsay's house was beautifully decorated, well stocked with all the essentials, and very clean, comfy, and homey. This is a great place to stay if you're traveling to Harrisburg. We stayed here for a concert in Hershey, and the commute to Giant Center was quick and easy. Check in/out was a breeze, as was communication with Lindsay. We wouldn't hesitate to stay here again if we're in the area."
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Clean, comfortable, and creatively styled!
I would stay here again if we travel to PA again. I’m a bit skeptical about Airbnb places because I’ve had a bad experience however, this place is the complete opposite. Clean throughout the entire house, comfortable beds and sofa, and the home design is well thought out. Also to add the snacks, drinks, and extra items like a makeup cloth are very thoughtful."
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Highly recommend staying here! One of the best Airbnbs I've stayed at. Lindsay was very accommodating with our last minute booking request, quick and easy to communicate with. Check-in was a breeze and the house was spotless. Both beds are extremely comfortable, like sleeping on a cloud. We only stayed one night and didn't get to cook a full meal in the kitchen, but it appears well stocked with all basics needed to make a meal. Walking distance to a nice path along the river, the neighbors was quiet and cute with a great coffee shop just around the corner. If you're on the fence about booking here, just do it, you won't regret it."
2022-07-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,There is not much to do locally. The neighborhood seems to be in a renovation stage.
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"If you’re looking for a perfect place to stay, this is it! Lindsay was very responsive. Very clean and homey feeling. Would stay here again!"

2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Amazing location, house and host!!"
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great home ! Would definitely recommend. We will definitely be making another stay here.
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Wonderful place in Harrisburg! True city living in walking distance to many things. But with a reserved parking place, you can come and go and never have to worry about parking! The home is wonderfully decorated and the beds are soooo comfortable. The air conditioning and white noise machine made for a great nights sleep. The complementary snacks, beverages and stuff for breakfast were greatly appreciated. If we had known how wonderful this place was, we honestly would have changed our plans to stay a second night! ❤️
Details you may want to know- the steps are steep, so not ideal for mobility challenged (both bedrooms and bathroom are upstairs). Also, since they ask you take off your shoes upon entering, don’t run down the steps in your socks! (Trust me it doesn’t end well!) The parking lot is diagonally across from the house, on a different street. Most of the streets are one way and narrow, so if you miss it you’ll have to go several blocks around to take another stab at finding it. The steps and parking aren’t problems at all for most folks, but had I been traveling with elderly folks or tiny kids it might have been.
Truly a gem of a place near great food and about 20 minutes from the airport."
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Amazing stay for our family of 4! Very cozy place with great amenities! Stocked drinks, snacks, and breakfast items were a bonus and appreciated! Parking spot is close and convenient! Communication with owner was fast!
Location in walking distance to the river and food options. We went to Hershey Park which was about 25 min! It was a perfect stay and we would definitely stay here again!"
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Great place , everything you need."

2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Very beautiful home decorated very nice, with everything needed to make a stay away from home perfect. I however never lived in the city and it was a little overwhelming to see its location it is in the city and is densely populated area of the city."
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We loved Lindsay's home. A quaint row house in the Olde Uptown section of Harrisburg, the home is spotless and incredibly well cared for. Lindsay is truly a ""SuperHost"", stocking the fridge with everything from drinks to snacks. She checked in, made us feel welcomed, and help us enjoy our first trip to this fun part of Harrisburg. You will love this home."

2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We were impressed with Lindsay's airbnb from the moment we entered. It's clean, cozy, stocked with the essentials and then some. The decor is lovely and inviting. Lindsay was a great communicator though, frankly, there wasn't much need because instructions were detailed. Clearly, Lindsay has put a lot of thought and effort into how to make an airbnb visit welcoming. Also, the location is only two blocks from a beautiful river walk. We will definitely be back!"
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,One of the best places and would highly recommend if you are looking for a place to stay while in Harrisburg!
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Such a comfortable home!! We stayed here one night passing through to western PA. The couch was perfect for watching a movie with our kiddo. We ordered take out from a soul spot nearby. The king size bed was soft and so comfortable. We really appreciated the stocked fridge with breakfast items before heading out the next day. There are blinds and curtains in the bedrooms but if you need extreme black out, bring an eye mask. We put up travel black out liners for our kid and it really helped them sleep in a little."

It was decorated beautifully and we loved how she had many snacks & various beverages in the fridge & cabinets, including tons of breakfast items! Comfy beds & very clean place. Parking (for 2 cars in one space) was right around the corner, just steps away from the home. Excellent communication and easy check-in. Would highly recommend this home! (Just a note… The bathroom is up a narrow flight of stairs by the bedrooms, which wasn’t a problem for us, but is something to be aware of if you aren’t comfortable with steps.)"
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Wonderful, beautiful and incredibly clean space. Above and beyond with thoughtfulness and accommodating. The parking is basically across the street and it’s in walking distance to so much! Definitely will stay here again if my travels lead me to this city."

Kitchen and fridge are always stocked which I love!
Lindsay was quick to respond to all my questions and check-in/check-out was a breeze! Would definitely recommend!!"

2024-06-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"this place was absolutely clean! Great stay. however, do not stay here if you are a single women! I got heckled quiet a bit by homeless men. I actually had one random guy approach me as I was putting my luggage in my car asking if this was a pawn shop. I got heckled three separate times by homeless men if I had anything to give them. Make sure you have a buddy with you at this place."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The place was clean, clear instructions."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Erica’s place was exactly what I needed for the week! I was starting a new job at the capitol and didn’t have an apartment yet, so this place was perfect. It was a 10-ish minute walk to the capitol and the off street parking was so nice. The kitchen had everything I needed and the bed was comfy. Due to the location, you can hear noises from the street, so be mindful of that if noise bothers you!"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Erica is a very responsive and helpful host.
The space was just as described and had everything listed.
the surrounding area was fun and walkable and most importantly I felt safe at night.

2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"it was absolutely perfect for our stay!!! high-end comfort and amenities!!! really cool historic neighborhood in the city and walkable restaurants, bars and a great river walking running trail. highly recommended!!!"
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Went to PA for the weekend and we found the right place to stay. Cozzy and well equipped studio.
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,￼ we had such a beautiful stay in the studio! The place was nice and clean and the bed was super comfortable.
2023-12-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,The studio was very clean and the bed was so comfy. The location was great! Close to our family. Parking was convenient. However an issue with the heater was never resolved. Even after a space heater was provided which was also broken. Luckily we weren't there during the day much and the heavy blankets helped at night.
2023-11-01,4.0,Stayed over a week,"Nice spot to stay in Harrisburg! No real complaints; Wi-fi was on/off for a few days but Erica got back to me and had the issue fixed. Great location, walking distance to restaurants."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"I stayed here for a week and enjoyed it very much. On-site laundry was useful and the unit was well-furnished and clean. Close to 3rd street attractions and restaurants, and not too far from downtown and the capitol. Off-street parking is wonderful to have in this town and hard to come by. Only minor complaints are the noise from the busy intersection nearby and sometimes hearing the upstairs tenant walking around, but things are usually quiet past 10pm. Wish the front door window had some kind of covering at night since anyone walking by could see right in and the street lights shine in and make it harder to sleep. I stuffed a couple hand towels along the top of the door as a remedy."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Wonderful space. Loved our stay here and will certainly be back.
2023-10-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place for a weekend getaway. It's about 2 blocks away from the capital and the river and the parking was pretty convenient. The apartment was very clean and modern and was a comfortable place to stay. Highly recommend.

2023-08-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"1.) The apartment was in incredible condition, there was not a hint of dust anywhere. It was extremely clean.
2.) Our car got sprayed with something sticky on our 2nd day there, I’m unsure if it was the city’s doing or the upstairs neighbor since they departed that night.
3.) There is a spider problem, Multiple spiders were found outside and they were HUGE. They made a web in-front of the door which we walked face first into.
Overall I would stay here again."

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Host communicated instructions on how to access the apartment and throughout our stay. The apartment was easy to find and we were happy to see the capital building lite up when we arrived. Ample parking out front even during the day (meter parking from 8am to 5pm at $4 an hour). The apartment is in a beautiful old building but newly remodeled inside with all you need for a great stay. The living area is comfort with a tv, little fire place on the wall, and dining nook table. A long galley kitchen connects the living area to the bedroom. The bedroom and bathroom are both very large and modern. We really enjoyed our stay and will stay again!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great location-walkable to good restaurants and sites. The capital tour is free and the building is a treasure. Communication with hosts is fast and very responsive.

2024-04-01,4.0,Stayed one night,comfortable
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We really enjoyed our stay in this Historic building at the foot of Capital steps. It’s a short walk to area restaurants and cultural sites, including the Pennsylvania State Museum, the Central market, and the Mid- Town Scholar bookstore which should be in your list to visit.
George is an amazing host and the apartment exceeded our expectations, with new renovations throughout, including a lovely kitchen and bathroom.
George was very responsive and every question we asked was answered promptly. He has also prepared an extensive welcome in orientation packet and clear instructions for every detail.
You can’t go wrong staying here and we hope you have as much fun in Harrisburg as we did."

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We loved staying at Erica’s place. The home was very clean and comfortable. You are very close to lots of restaurants and coffee shops. The neighbors upstairs were a little noisy one night, but quiet the rest. We would definitely come back."

2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was a perfect location! Even in the cold month of February many things were walkable, in a warmer month we would’ve walked to so much more! And the location was perfect to drive into Hershey for the day also. The apartment was furnished nicely and the bed was super comfortable. One thing to note if you are a light sleeper this is a bottom rental and you can hear people moving around upstairs, for the most part it didn’t bother us but some people it might. We would definitely come back again!"
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Attractive, convenient little suite close to plenty of local attractions. The bed was super comfortable and I loved the decor.

2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,I had am amazing stay.. she was very helpful and the home looked just like the pictures
2023-11-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Photos and description are accurate, check in instructions were clear. Erica was able to accept a change to my reservation at the last minute when I noticed I entered it incorrectly.
There was a binder of information in the unit with slightly different instructions for check out than the Airbnb instructions so that was a little confusing.
There were no spare pillows or blankets so I had to use a throw pillow to support my neck.
Not in Erica’s control: the driveway had a large truck next to it which was hard to see around when pulling out of the driveway so be ready for that if you stay here."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"We have stayed in two of Erica's rentals, and they were both 5-star units. Immaculately clean, crisp updated decor, comfortable beds, and walking distance to restaurants, coffee shops, etc. Erica is super responsive and helpful. In fact, whenever we are visiting Harrisburg to see family, we always look for Erica's rentals first."

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This place is beautiful! There is a lot to do in walking distance and everything inside was extremely clean! The only thing is there were so many spiders around the place outside that would often get into the front door.

Bed was super comfortable, towels were nice, shower had great pressure and was spacious, everything was updated, and really enjoyed the ice cube trays in the freezer for refilling my water bottle! We visit PA a few times a year to see family and will be repeat visitors for sure!!"
2023-06-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Just small recommendations. There needs to be a larger trash can in the kitchen. There were many bugs out back. Maybe invest in pest control. The gate out back was hard to lock. It looks like it was drilled incorrectly. Overall good for the price. Modern, clean, and plenty of space for a couple."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Erica's place was a wonderful place it had everything we needed. My wife and I had an event in Harrisburg so it was more business than a getaway. But we plan on taking a long weekend in the very near future and this be the first place we check for availability.
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"A homey little place in a neighborhood with lots of character. Safe, super clean and well kept …found fun little eateries within walking distance. Would highly recommend and will stay when we are back in the area."

2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Erica's apartment was comfortable, pristinely clean, and supplied with enough paper goods (TP, paper towels, kleenex) to last our stay. The bed was very comfortable, and the combined living / kitchen space was perfect for our needs. This apartment is centrally located - walking distance to restaurants, Little Amps (great coffee shop), and the river walking trail. And the off-street parking is a bonus in this area. Erica was super responsive and very friendly when we ran into her one day outside the apartment. Big thumbs up for Erica and her rental - we will be back!"
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is a fantastic new Airbnb in the heart of Harrisburg. The location is fantastic, and the apartment is absolutely pristine. Upon check-in, I had difficulty connecting to the Wi-Fi. I don’t mention this is a negative, but instead a positive, because I contacted the host and she had it resolved almost instantaneously. This was a wonderful apartment and I can’t wait to book this location again! Thank you, Erica! This was a great stay!"

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Danielle was a very responsive host! Several times I sent her messages and she answered me right away! There was a wine bar and brewery within walking distance. We felt very comfortable at Danielle's place and will stay again when in the area.
2024-06-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"The stay was wonderful for a few nights. You can hear the neighbors which is typical in this type of living situation. The parking was a bit difficult to find at first. If you have a larger vehicle, street parking is your best bet. Overall the stay was great."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"great little spot, cozy and comfortable. nice location too, walkable to several bars & restaurants, and the river just a block away. danielle was an excellent host who provided local recommendations, clear instructions, was friendly and responded quickly. would definitely stay again."

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,I had a wonderful stay here very comfortable!
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We spent two nights in early May 2024 at Danielle's apartment. Very nice overall! Danielle communicated via email in a prompt and timely way. The listing and photographs accurately matched the property. The unit was very clean. Self check-in was fast and easy. The internet wifi was strong and reliable. We parked on the street about a block away. We walked about 15 minutes to reach the capitol and center city, and the nearby river walk was a pleasant stroll.
Just a few small things to keep in mind: the neighborhood seemed plenty safe, but groceries (aside from a gas station convenience store) aren't nearby -- so bring along with you whatever sustenance you plan to consume. Also (and as the listing accurately depicts), there are a couple of dinette chairs but no sofa in the living space. Finally, the bed lacked a box spring and therefore felt a little squishy."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The house is in a beautiful location, next to the river. There are lots of walkable food/drink options. The room is a great size for what you’re paying. Perfect for a weekend trip. It all felt very safe and secure. Danielle was also great at responding."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The building has a wonderful historic charm. We enjoyed visiting and learning about Harrisburg. Thanks for hosting us Danielle!

2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This was my 1st time using airbnb and i was very happy with the apartment. It was clean and very easy to get into.

Danielle was a great host and very responsive when i asked her anything. If i know anyone coming to Harrisburg i will recommend reaching out to Danielle.
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very lovely location! Gorgeous sunset view of the river! Very clean and quiet and a nice walk to many things! Good food across the street too!

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"What can’t I say about this stay?! We traveled for a much needed girls trip away with our daughters for 21st birthday celebrations. We felt like we were somewhere we could enjoy staying forever. Brian & Karen thought of absolutely everything we could possibly need and then some! There were games in the apartment which ended up being a plus when we had an unexpected rainy evening. The communication was top notch too! Everything from making us feel welcome to letting us in on little “need to knows”, were included. The property was absolutely gorgeous and a beautiful place to stay!

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Everything about the villa was amazing. The kitchen has everything you needed and everything just felt super comfortable. The views are beautiful and we even got to see deers and bunnies! There was so much space outside where my daughter got to play the whole day and the place is also well lit at night if you're coming back late. The pool was also huge and we really enjoyed the hot tub. I will for sure come back :)
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Our son and his family were visiting from out of the country for a family wedding. The house and pool worked perfectly for them. They were thrilled with the house and the pool. Thank you for sharing your beautiful home!
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"What can I say about this place but it delivered! Perfect little villa for a mother/daughters weekend where we were not only able to reach inside the villa but also spent a good bit of time in the hot tub and pool. Karen was a fantastic host, responded to our messages promptly and even gave a breakfast suggestion the morning we were headed out. We would definitely recommend and go back :)"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Property was very clean and as described. The pool was the highlight of the trip!
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Where do I begin? This villa was a cozy, heavenly nook in the middle of a warm blue sky. The pictures on the listing don’t do this place any justice. Specially when it comes to the pool and hot tub. The pool and hot tub are in a huge paradise like area surrounded by gorgeous plants, palm trees and a spectacular glass wall with an amazing view. It’s equipped with all your entertainment needs and accessories. Loaded with floaties for the kids, blue tooth for mom and tables/chairs for everyone. The villa itself is very intimate and welcoming. I am a single mom of 13 yr old twins and we all truly enjoyed our stay. Brian and Karen made sure to furnish this place with lots of love and when you first step in your definitely greeted by peace and harmony. I would recommend this place to everyone. They are amazing host! They were very present and anytime we had a question or concern they responded immediately. We will definitely be coming back!"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"A comfortable villa that proved a great getaway for us! The beautifully-appointed apartment with private entrance and modern amenities (love the heated bidet!) made us feel like we were on a Mediterranean vacation, only minutes from Harrisburg. As described, Karen & Brian live upstairs, so they were quick to respond to our requests. We chose The Villa because it offered the indoor pool and hot tub, which was exactly what we needed! We can’t wait to come back, perhaps in late spring or summer when we can take advantage of the fire pit and private patio or the outdoor pool deck. Over all, it was a fantastic retreat!
Thank you so much Karen & Brian."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place! We really enjoyed the pool and hot tub!
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"location is in a quiet upscale residential neighborhood with easy access to much of Central PA, including grocery stores, fitness centers, airport, interstate, etc. Home is clean, spacious, looks just like the pictures, and has all the amenities you'll need for a home away from home."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was a beautiful home, the pool and hot tub were fantastic. Brought my daughter here for her birthday to have access to a private pool in the winter.

2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This was the perfect place for us to stay. It was close to where we needed to go and the hot tub was an awesome bonus!
2024-02-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,"Honest reviews are crucial for enhancing future guests' experiences. Karen proved to be a great host, but challenges with the pool and hot tub impacted our stay. Despite requesting prior to our stay a safe temperature of 100 for my pregnancy, the hot tub consistently exceeded limits at 102-104. Making it hard to put more than my legs in. The pool, advertised at 83-85, measured 73-75, affecting our plans. Despite shivering I was able to swim for a short period of time. When brought to the host's attention, the advice was to swim when the sun was out. The long icy path to the pool room and the requirement to remove shoes in the cold were inconvenient.
Cleaning standards were lacking, with dead bugs in the bathroom, hair in sinks and bed, and potential dirt/debris in one bed. We made the best of it, enjoying game nights with provided board games, but suggest improvements for future guests.
Also keep in mind the guests are beneath the hosts and can hear each other when walking and talking"
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We stayed here for a quick getaway, and it was a wonderful experience. The space is immaculately clean and bright, exactly as pictured and described.

2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Karen and Brian were both very responsive and helpful! Love having access to the hot tub and pool, and their binder in the AirBnB with local information and recommendations was super helpful! Checked out the caverns nearby in Hummelstown, Hersheys chocolate world and downtown Harrisburg, and it was such a great time, with great hosts!"
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Karen and Brian were very accommodating, especially in regards to the pool and hot tub. They’re both very responsive, polite and considerate. I can’t always say the same about myself or my own children, but they definitely were excellent in every domain:)"
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We needed a quiet getaway for the weekend and this truly did fit the bill. The space is just what you’d need to relax, eat and have some fun in the pool and hot tub. My kids absolutely loved the pool! I was craving some hot chocolate and asked if they had any and I kid you not, within 2 minutes we had a few packets! Definitely recommend checking this out."
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,What an incredible experience. The property is awesome. The pool was perfect. What a find!
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"House was great. Kitchen had everything you would need to cook. Laundry closet included, clean bathroom.

2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We had such an excellent stay. The indoor pool and the hot tub were perfect. Only suggestion is to bring flip flops for the walk around the house to the pool. The kitchen had everything we needed. The rooms were toasty warm. The beds were soft and comfortable. Everything was clean. The heated bidet was a neat surprise. Plenty of towels and toiletries in the bathroom. Karen was super friendly and helpful when needed. We have absolutely no complaints. It was a perfect stay for a getaway weekend!! Thank you so much!

2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,great responsive host the place was amazing and they provided everything you needed and more to make you feel right at home.
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"What a great time we had. Karen & Brian have a wonderful place; beautifully landscaped, a gorgeous indoor pool oasis (you don’t feel like you’re indoors) and a comfortable, quiet and clean living space.
They gave clear instructions for check-in, for leaving and all the fun in between. There were plenty of magazines and brochures available to us to figure out what we wanted to do, and we took advantage of some of the dining recommendations provided.
The bedrooms were comfortable, well suited for myself and two kids. The bathroom was dreamy with a double vanity so teeth brushing wasn’t a chore. And there were plenty of towels and things available to use should we have needed.
The kitchen was stocked with spices which I enjoyed and plenty of room in the fridge for all the food we didn’t cook 😂.
I don’t think they missed a beat when constructing their vision for their guests. I’d recommend this place to anyone. We are already talking about going back soon! Thank you Karen and Brian!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Karen’s place was quiet, clean and peaceful. The photos don’t do the property justice, it’s very evident how well maintained this space is & cozy the unit is. We were very impressed at the little touches that made it feel like home. Karen was even thoughtful enough to bring our pizza delivery down to us as the driver delivered to the wrong door. Definitely will stay again! Thank you!"

2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Karen was easy to communication with and provided me answers to all my questions. It was an amazing stay.
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This accommodation was very nice and Brian and Karen are great hosts; very friendly and responsive! We loved the patio outside and the deer that visited. The private entrance and parking were wonderful. This villa is located in an upscale, safe neighborhood, which is very important to us. Personally, I found the temperature in the unit very cold, but my sister loved it. The host provides space heaters so I was able to sleep well. We used the pool twice, and the hot tub was broken so we couldn't use that. The hosts were at the mercy of servicemen and it was out of their control.
We enjoyed the kitchen and the host even let us borrow their hand mixer and a pie plate. Oh, and the microwave also doubles as a convection oven so we were able to cook!
There is little room for the fold-out bed (we set it up in the living room), but it's a nice option if you need it (we did.)
Overall we had an excellent stay and I would definitely recommend it!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great location in a quiet neighborhood. Enjoyed seeing deer and rabbits roaming the neighborhood. Very relaxing place to stay.

The pool and hot tub were amazing!
Karen was so wonderful and helpful. We met her when we arrived and she was very quick to respond if we had any questions.
The beds were very comfortable and the apartment is perfect. It has everything you need to be comfortable.

We loved staying here!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"They have thought of everything -things you may need that you didn't pack, brochures for things to do in the area, coffee and so clean. Wonderful experience and I hope to come back to the area again."

2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Georgia and I have been traveling and just got home. We stayed with Karen from June9th to the 16th, 2023. The place was awesome!! Karen is a legit Super host. The place was spotless and offered every amenity just like your own home. The pool was fantastic. The location is in a really nice neighborhood and your drive into Hersey is a fast 16 min drive. Practically a straight shot from their door to the park. It was nice to have the privacy of the little apartment yet be so close to everything. It was really really enjoyable. We can’t say enough good things. You will not be disappointed if you decide to stay here."

2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The place was very nice, wasn't to happy about not being able to hear the tv due to not being able to adjust the volume past 13, felt like I had to speak in a whisper. Made us feel like we were at grand moms house not wanting to disturb her sleep."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We enjoyed our stay so much! The instructions on how to get there and about the home were crystal clear. Anytime we reached out to Karen/Brian they were always responsive. This airbnb is located in the perfect spot. Just a short drive from the city which has so much to do! Anytime we are in this area in the future we would love to stay here again! Thanks Karen and Brian for such a wonderful space!!
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a great stay and hope to return! It was quiet and peaceful. I loved the back patio and the swing…listening to the birds in the early morning was excellent! My kids loved the basketball net! But, of course, the pool was their favorite. The hot tub was my favorite! We would have loved more time in the pool but understand the generous opportunity the owners offer to others to rent/use. We stayed for two nights and our pool time was 6-10pm and 8-10pm. I loved the complimentary coffee and tea. The whole apartment is updated and cozy. We loved the bathroom, too. Especially the toilet seat. There’s a warmer on it! And more! And- thank you for the games- we played Monopoly for hours. Overall, it was a wonderful stay and my kids have requested/insisted on returning. The whole property is beautiful."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,we have had a great stay at Karen's place! The appartment was very cozy and well appointed.

Thanks again!
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Karen’s Villa was exactly as described. It was the perfect size for 3 adults and 1 toddler. The indoor pool and hot tub was amazing!

They responded to any questions we had very quickly, and were very helpful in getting the information we needed of they didn't have it right on hand! The home itself was great! Perfect for our family of 4, and all of the amenities were exactly as stated! We hit Hershey Park, and Palmyra for the days we were there and the location was very accessible to everywhere we needed to go. 10/10 would recommend this place for a great family getaway!

2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"You'll Thank Karen and Brian a million times over! They provided us with such an amazing stay!
Both the apartment and pool/hottub area were up to date well organized and clean.
All of our questions were answered via message in a timely fashion, making us feel extremely comfortable and important. It was easy to plan pool time and they even built us a fire in the pit one night so we could roast hot dogs and smores. The neighborhood beautiful and quiet. Tucked away from the city, but not even a mile from the local grocery store and banks. We look forward to staying again ! Such an amazing experience!"

2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Brian and Karen’s place was perfect! It has all the comforts of home. They communicated with me before my arrival so I felt prepared when checking in. They made it feel like staying at a friends place. Unfortunately, I was too busy to try out the pool but if I had the time, I would have used it!"
2023-01-01,4.0,Stayed about a week,"Great stay overall…loved the kitchen as it had everything I needed plus some (I mean storage containers, seasonings, coffee, and etc.)! Additionally, the bathroom had all the toiletries you would need if you left something at home. I was sad that I forgot my swimsuit so I did not get a chance to utilize the hot tub. One minor setback “for me” is that it just didn’t feel very private. I could hear people above me so I felt as if I could hear them, they could hear me…so I was mindful to be very quiet (that’s just me and definitely was not a dealbreaker). Great host and very attentive to their guest. My husband loved the apartment."

2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I truly enjoyed my stay. It was nice, it was relaxing, it was cozy. Brian was awesome for me as well as Karen. But I like the fact that Brian was there because whenever there was an issue (hardly any!), he was the one I spoke with. Because I'm a man speaking to a man it was easier for me to ask for things that I would feel less comfortable asking a woman about. So, it was cool that we had Brian and Karen. They both were fully attentive to all of my needs so they made it great! Just remember that the villa that you're in is underneath their house with all the pros and cons thereof. But, it was comfortable and a very nice stay."

2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I cannot praise this host enough for all the special touches, the classy and comfortable accommodations, the POOL!!! They thought of everything from a fully outfitted kitchen to a bathroom full of helpful toiletries “just in case” but wow - how beautiful and clean and organized! It truly felt like home away from home. The TV, fireplace, comfy linens and plentiful towels, hangers, blankets/throws, kitchen cookware and even spices, food prep items, gorgeous dishes and cutlery, just above and beyond. Dedicated parking spaces, our own private entrance, access to pool and hot tub (who has THAT in the winter, huh??) large Fire TV, gas fireplace, TWO bedrooms, gorgeous dining area, washer dryer… and any time I had a question they were quick to respond and very patient with me as I figured things out. We WILL be back. THANK YOU, Karen and Brian, for everything you have done to make your AirBnb the best in the area!"
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My friends and I had an absolutely lovely stay at this location. The hosts were very friendly and they had great communication which was incredibly helpful to us. The apartment was perfect for our weekend away, and the pool was beautiful and refreshing. I would definitely recommend this location if you are looking for somewhere to stay in Harrisburg!"
,,,"We showed up to what was a very bad part of town, there were empty alcohol bottles and trash all over ground at entry way. The inside had doors falling off hinges, dirt and trash all over the floors and furniture. The bedding was not changed, there’s was dirt and hairs under the comforters on the sheets. No toilet paper, paper towels, trash bags, towels, or ANYTHING. When I complained the host told me he was not going to believe the filth in the photos I sent, to leave the premises and take the refund but not to “lie” about the cleanliness. Horrible experience. We were eight hours from home without a place to stay for a week. The host said he was going to “believe the cleaners over the photos”. Terrible. The doors did not seal, it was just dirty and scary atmosphere. Air bnb was wonderful about getting us our money back and into a new space. Thank goodness!"
