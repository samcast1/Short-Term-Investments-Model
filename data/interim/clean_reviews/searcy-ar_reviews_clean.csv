2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Kari's place was great! Cute, clean, and close to anything you'd need! Would absolutely recommend!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,My wife and I love to travel and have a hard time with ANYTHING that is scented. This home was our safe haven! We even thought to ourselves that we could one day live in a little home like this. Kari’s communication and care for our family was felt by all of us.
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Such a lovely little airbandb! Clean and neat, super easy check in, and they even provided a list of fun things to do in Searcy. Would return!"

2024-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The Cottage on Cross Street was welcoming and cozy. I hope to stay there again next time I'm in the area!
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Kari’s place was perfect for me and my partner’s parents! Everything we needed was provided, and in great condition. The bed’s were comfortable and we all slept like babies. The area was calm, and we loved hearing the birds in the back yard. Kari was extremely accommodating and responsive. I would definitely recommend this place if you’re passing through or even just need a quick getaway!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We had a great stay at Kari’s home in Searcy. The house was SO cute, clean, and had everything we needed. My children especially loved the large, private backyard. We would definitely love to stay again if we come back to Searcy."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Had a wonderful stay at Kari’s little cottage! Felt right at home the minute I walked through the door! Super cute, love the style of decor in the house, very clean, comfy bed, lovely backyard, convenient location, easy check-in/check-out, friendly host - I can’t say enough great things about the home! Would definitely recommend it - and would stay there again if I find myself back in the area!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We were in town for the April 8, 204 solar eclipse, and Searcy was in the path of totality. Kari did some extra research for us in advance. She also provided the door code early enough that we could share it with members of our group who arrived separately. The shady back yard was comfortable for socializing. The front yard was sunnier and great for watching the moon cover up the sun for a few minutes. We were surprised that not many neighbors were out watching the eclipse. Maybe they were at one of the public parks or stadiums that had special events."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The house was quiet and clean. Kari gave friendly, clear instructions and was a great communicator. The house was clean and so cute. We already scheduled our next visit."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,We highly recommend this cute cottage for your stay if you are traveling through or visiting Searcy. The pictures don’t do justice to how cute this cozy cottage is! It also has a really nice backyard. The little touches and decor makes this a very unique space. The beds and furniture are comfortable as well. Thank you for such a wonderful stay!
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,We had a great time staying in Kari’s home! It was perfect for our family of four. The cottage was adorable and there were so many cute touches all over the home I even took inspiration photos to decorate back at our place! The kids loved running around in the backyard and it was the perfect location for us to visit family and get around Searcy. We would love to come stay here again!
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My family and I feel in love with the little cottage. It was clean, neat and adorable. we especially love the back yard. We plan on making this our go place to stay in Searcy."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We loved our stay! The house was cozy! It was just as described and even cuter in person. Nice bedroom space and the beds were comfortable. Close to Harding and downtown. We would definitely stay again!
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a great experience at Kari's place! It is super close to Harding University which was really convenient as we were in town for my son's college tour. The cottage was a great place to end each day with all the comforts of home and plenty of space. The beds were so comfortable and the living room is cozy. We didn't use the kitchen much but it appeared as though everything you could possibly need was provided.
I have stayed at many different AirBnB's and I really appreciate when a host goes out of their way to make you feel welcome which Kari did! We appreciated the book of local places and the welcome basket of snacks. If Harding is where my son ends up next year we will definitely be back to stay at The Cottage on Cross."

2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This was my 2nd time to stay at Conlee’s. It’s a great location to Harding and close to all the amenities of Searcy. It was nice going back to the same place I’ve stayed 2 months prior. I knew what to expect and felt at ease.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a delightful stay in Conlee’s house. The space was spotless and it was easy to figure things out. It was also very comfortable and nicer than staying in a hotel for our party of three. Beds are comfortable and the quality of linens is delightful. Dishwasher and laundry center work great and are quiet. Kitchen had everything we needed. The neighborhood is super easy to access and yet also very quiet and peaceful. I enjoyed strolling through the neighborhood and it’s very safe. The house is a duplex and the guests in the other side were quiet and noise was never a problem, and we had ample privacy. East and convenient off street parking too. Finally Conlee and Amanda were fast to provide help and local recommendations when I texted with questions. We had a wonderful stay, I’d stay here again in a heartbeat, and totally recommend this AirBNB and hosts."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We’ve stayed here multiple times and it always meets our needs. It’s an easy walk to Harding’s campus so we like to choose this place when visiting our son. Thanks for another great stay!

2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Description was spot on. Great place to stay for a great price!
2023-12-01,4,Stayed with kids,"Overall we had a good one night stay. The place was not as clean as I would have liked, but other than better dusting, there’s not much you can do because it’s an old house. The amenities were awesome though! Conlee provided mini sausage biscuits and a full pizza in the freezer for meals. As well as a full jug of cold water in the fridge. Plus coffee kcups and random groceries. Not only that but the kitchen was fully stocked with anything you might need which was impressive. The place was a 2 minute drive to a park where we let the kids run around and play after a long car ride. And it was close to plenty of places to eat."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed one night,Great place to stay. It was slightly difficult to find in the dark but other than that everything was great!

2023-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"Central location in Searcy, and a comfortable stay!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed one night,Very comfortable beds. Close to Harding University.
2023-11-01,4,Stayed with kids,"This home is one of the cheaper options in Searcy, and while we would say that a lack of attention to detail and shortcuts taken in reno/repair were obvious, expectations weren't super high. The property felt safe, was clean, and had necessary items stocked. We appreciated having two separate bedrooms, and sharing the bathroom was no issue. It was difficult to find the street number on the property when we arrived (there is a backlit plaque on the ground by the stairs, which we noticed was lit up one of the following nights, but not when we arrived.) and items like paper towels in the kitchen, and extra pillows in the bedrooms would have been appreciated. The walls are also very thin, and noises (even normal voice levels, and especially crying babies) could be heard extremely well from the adjoining unit. This wasnt really an issue for us, as we are used to a large family, but could be for light sleepers. Overall, this home was what we expected for the price. Thank you for having us"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place for a few days!
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We have stayed multiple times at this and another of Conlees rentals. Super wonderful hosts. Always responsive an easy to communicate with. As pictured and and clean.

2023-07-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Conlee was friendly and super responsive. We had plenty of space in the unit for four adults. Beds were comfortable, shower hot, kitchen very spacious. I was initially concerned about the area as some nearby houses appeared a little run down. We had no problems at all though, it was quite and we enjoyed walking nearby areas every morning. We would stay at Conlee 's place again when we visit family. I highly recommend the chocolate dipped homemade popsicles at Taco Day restaurant! located downtown Searcy, you can walk there from Conlee""s place."

2022-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"I needed a place to stay in order to help move our son out of his dorm at Harding University. This property was super convenient to campus, exactly as described and was more comfortable and affordable than the hotels we've stayed at in the past. Both of the owners were very responsive to my questions and pleasant to work with. I'd definitely stay here again the next time we visit campus."
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was my second stay at Bison Hall and it did not disappoint. A little different this time around for me was I needed to work while I was also in town to check in on relatives. The Wi-Fi worked very well for me over my five day stay as I was able to replicate my home work set up easily which was comforting. The place was clean and Conlee can offer many in the hospitality industry a master class in what top notch customer service is all about as he's always extra attentive to any needs. I've stayed at many area hotels and this Airbnb beats them all. From now on, any time I'm looking to stay in the Searcy area, Bison Hall will always be my TOP choice!"

Coming home to a peaceful, clean, and very comfortable space was a real comfort. Robin was extremely accommodating, very responsive, and did everything she could to help us during this hard time.
I would highly recommend Robin’s home to anyone looking for a centrally located place, and a modern but warm accommodation. Bonus points for a very comfortable bed and nice linens. There’s also a coffee shop within a 30 second walk.

And Robin was so prompt in responding to any questions we had. She's such a kind host. I only wish this place had been available sooner while my son was attending Harding.

Had a King bed that was comfortable for us. Such a good price having the 3 bedrooms and another bathroom in hall. Has a stove in kitchen, bonus! Really close to Harding, could walk, but If hot or raining only like a 2 min drive to Heritage parking lot. Maybe 4 min to some restaurants. Has a cute little front deck, back yard is still a work in progress, but we didn't need it at all. You will get check in code on day of arrival and they will answer any questions quickly.

2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,my mother was admitted into the hospital on Wednesday and because of this family emergency we had to quickly head to Searcy and book somewhere to stay for the next day. We knew we could rely on Carols Airbnb to be clean and easy to find. this is our 3rd time staying at one of her places and this time was probably the most significant to me.

2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"Carol’s place was perfect in every way! Just what we needed for a 18 hour stay! More efficient than a hotel and I love to support small business when I can! Carol even accommodates early checkin if possible!

2023-08-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Good stay. Stayed here previously.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"I had an amazing stay at the Alumni ""Shack"" haha, which is better than many rooms I've stayed in.
The only thing I'd say is that the internet is not fast enough to stream shows on my laptop. And the TV only has Direct TV and no access to streaming service (which is listed in the description). But if you're looking to type emails or watch a quick YouTube video, it is super fast.
Carol is an amazing host, and overall the room I'd say is better than described. Comfortable, spotless, and feels like home. If you're looking to visit campus look no further!"

2023-03-01,4,Stayed over a week,"This place is great if you would like to stay for a weekend or a few more days. I stayed for about 3 weeks and that was about 2 weeks to long. The place was clean, the bed was okay, and not having access to a washer and dryer was a little cumbersome. The wifi runs at about 15 mbps but saw that drop a couple of times when the property next door was occupied or when a storm came through it was gone entirely.
A few things I wish it had out side of a washer and dryer would be a vacuum cleaner instead of a broom. For those staying longer periods of time a broom and dust pan just dont cut it if you want to keep the area clean. I ended up buying a swifer and hand vacuum to take care of cleaning.
Lastly I want to say that Carol is great about responding and being respectful of the space you occupy when you are there. When i needed more towels and new sheets she would bring them within the hour. When internet was fussy she or her husband would come and reset it. Loved working with her."

I booked this nice shack the same day of check in and was given the code within the hour. We have one toddler and an infant and i was glad we were able to book something so fast. The place was super cute , king bed with clean sheets and an extra twin mattress to use, which was helpful since our toddler kicks us all night. Beautiful shower and kitchen area. Our stay was for one night but I’m sure it had everything we needed for an extended stay. Price was about the same as a hotel but way more comfortable as it’s your own place, bigger and it has its own entrance"

There's a single bed as soon as you walk into the front, enclosed porch, dining room, kitchen, nice sized living room, another bedroom, and the bathroom. All of the windowsills looked original, along with the doors to the enclosed porch. I really enjoyed the carport, because it was raining a little when I got there. I also appreciated the readily available ice!
Carol allowed me to stay an hour later than normal check-out, and even sent me an email that I could check-in early, but I didn't need to.
This is the perfect place for parents visiting their college kids, or doing a college tour, because you can't get much closer than this.
I look forward to returning and enjoying the Alumni House longer!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,Another great stay with Carol.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"Carol and her cute place made us feel so welcomed and comfortable. She was also very responsive and concerned with all our needs. It is so hard to find caring hosts but Carol was an exception. We left our mom's cell phone behind and she called me right away as she knows how important it is. Without any hesitations, she had given us ample instructions on how we could retrieve it. We will always look for Carol's place whenever we visit Searcy again. We can't thank her enough."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Carrol’s place was amazing. It was so homey and cozy. Truly enjoyed the beautiful location. It was in the middle of everything. The bed was so comfy. Would love to stay here again on my next visit.

2023-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We were in town to tour Harding University. This location was perfect! We were practically on campus! My daughter stayed in Sears dorm with her friend, which was just catty-corner from this home. This home is older and actually felt like we were just staying at some of our family's home. I kept saying how it felt like we were at my parent's when we go home for Chirstmas. It was just a short drive into town for dinner and breakfast. Very inviting home. We would definitely stay here again!"

2023-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,The house was absolutely lovely. The bed was by far one of the comfiest we’ve ever slept in. The floors are pretty squeaky which is to be expected in an older home but that was the only thing that was just a bit harder for us in keeping the kid asleep with us walking around. We would absolutely stay again and loved that it felt very very homey.

2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We spent Christmas weekend in The Alumni House. It is a nicely renovated, small but spacious historical cottage that is now essentially part of the burgeoning campus of Harding University. There is a one-car covered carport with additional uncovered parking out front. There is a coded lock and we received the code promptly at 3 pm on checkin day.
The decor is cozy urban farmhouse. Carol added seasonal Christmas decorations, which we enjoyed. There is a large, fully-equipped kitchen (even food!), a dining room with a farmhouse table for six, a living room with a couch, comfy chair & ottoman, and a rocking chair. There’s a bathroom with a bathtub and shower combo. The king-sized bed in the separate bedroom was on the soft-side for me and my back but my husband was fine. There’s a single day bed in the mudroom/bedroom and there is an extra mattress that will fit on the floor if you need to sleep four.
We were VERY comfortable over the holiday weekend. I’ll try to be a repeat customer!"

2022-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great location. The house was close to all the places we needed to go within walking distance. It was quiet and safe. The beds are super comfortable and had plenty of room. The bathroom was spacious and clean. The shower had sufficient hot water and water pressure. Kitchen was more than well equipped. There is cooking supplies, utensils, kettle, coffee maker, Starbucks coffee and even seasonings in the cabinet. One of my favorite things is that the kitchen has toothpicks in a holder hanging on the wall. SO CONVENIENT. That’s one thing I cannot live without. A toothpick. So I’m more than grateful that there were some lol. The WiFi was spectacular. Speedy and easy to connect. Checking in was super easy. Plenty of space in the driveway.

2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"All brick townhome subdivision in a great location of Searcy. It is located right off one of the main drags so if you want nature/parks etc then this isn't for you. We loved the location bc we were there for a family wedding and it was convenient to everything. Even though it's off a main road, the subdivision is on a dead end road, so it does not have through traffic and it is very quiet. The townhome was very clean and exactly they way it looks in the pictures. Everything was labeled and we had all we needed. Do bring your own shampoo and conditioner bc there is not any. The only negative was that the bathrooms are really small with a small mirror over the small single vanity. This made it challenging for us to all get ready for the wedding. I would recommend that the host put a full length mirror on the back of the door/doors in the guest bedrooms so others can get ready while someone is in the bathroom (or any mirror).
Overall, it was great and I'd stay there again."
2024-03-01,5,Group trip,Absolutely beautiful Airbnb! Fully stocked with everything that you could possibly imagine all the way down to a lint roller that I thought surely would not be there. Definitely will stay there again as it was very homey feeling and it was immaculately clean!

We enjoyed everything about our stay! Thank you!"

2021-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Wow! My 13yo daughter summed it up best when we got in the car to leave and said, ""That was the best airBNB we have ever stayed in!"" Josh has truly gone over and above to provide the best of the best; he even purchased a brand new Ninja blender for the townhome after I asked him if I needed to bring my own! There wasn't anything we needed that wasn't there already, and it wasn't cheap stuff either. No expense has been spared with appliances, utensils, and furniture. The beds were so very comfortable! There are nightlights and plugs everywhere, and the room-darkening shades were a pleasant addition as most AirBNBs don't have them. We don't have one negative thing to say about this place but hope it's available next time we go visit our daughter at Harding! Thanks, Josh!!!"

The location is very convenient for visiting Harding, and the host was very thoughtful in choosing the amenities. We would not hesitate to stay here again."
2021-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Who decorated this beautiful condo and can they come to my house?? It was a true gift to end our days in this spacious condo. The decor beckoned a cup of coffee in the sun room wrapped in one of the many throw blankets.
Strip plugs brilliant beside bed are so smart with todays phones, watches, cpap machines - all needing an outlet on both sides of the bed! One plus, IMO, is plenty of space for luggage to spread out your suitcase and/or unpack. The kitchen is WELL stocked and most items are brand new. Wi-fi worked well during our entire stay.
Staying at this condo is like having an endless supply of toiletries at your finger tips: top brand Shampoo, body puffs, cotton balls, Q-tips, soaps, whatever you can imagine that you might need, they have provided. They even left extras of the following for your usage: sheets, towels, blankets, toilet paper, dishwashing and laundry pods, umbrella, pillows, etc. To say this has the ""comforts of home"" is an understatement. Instead, this has the comforts of the ""home I wish I lived in""! :)"
2021-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,Nothing but great things to share about our stay. Communication was top notch and the townhouse was beautiful and has absolutely everything you need and more!

Particularly enjoyed having plenty of parking right at the door. It was also nice having a second bedroom with a bath close by it and tucked away, almost creating a second primary suite.
The only problem we encountered with our stay, was finding the password for the Internet. We did not realize that the door between the two units was actually the front door where we were to enter, so we did not see the sign in the foyer area. However, response to our email was immediate, and we were able to get our problem rectified.
Overall, we thoroughly enjoyed our visit and you have a very nice unit."
2023-12-01,5,Group trip,Michael was the best host. Very spacious and clean and very comfortable beds. Nice and easy to find.

Shower heads were appropriately high (yes - that's something we notice in rentals b/c we have tall guys in our family & they don't like to have to ""duck"" when showering). Other side of duplex was occupied, but we didn't hear them during our stay. Rooms were bigger than I expected. This property is the nicest Airbnb I've stayed at in Searcy & I've rented several.
