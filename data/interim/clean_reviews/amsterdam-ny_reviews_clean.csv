2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Priscilla‚Äôs home is very beautiful and she is an outstanding host. She is proactive and always available to help, everything from check in to meals was very smooth and she was more than accommodating. The home is very private and she goes out of her way to make sure all your needs are met. I couldn‚Äôt have asked for a better home to stay in during my trip."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,On a tour for the 2024 eclipse. Finding an available room was a god-send and a perfect fit for what I needed.

2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Pricilla‚Äôs home was the perfect home-base for us for the weekend. The surrounding area is peaceful and stunning! Perfect location for visiting the shrine of the North American Martyrs so near by.
Exquisite country home, immaculately clean, well appointed, and so comfortable.
Pricilla could not have been a better host. She is thoughtful, attentive, and so kind‚Ä¶and a great cook! Breakfast was better than any you get at a restaurant.
If you are looking for a place to retreat, here it is!

2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,We had a lovely peaceful stay. Spacious room comfortable King bed. Charming setting. Host was extremely accommodating and friendly.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"I had a delightful stay at Priscilla‚Äôs place. Her home is beautiful, comfortable and immaculate. This, along with the peaceful setting, her wonderful hospitality and delicious breakfast made it a 5+star experience. I‚Äôve already recommended her BnB to several friends!"
2023-08-01,4,Stayed one night,"The only reason I gave our overall and check-in experience a 4 was that there was a mixup with our reservation. When we arrived, one of the rooms we had reserved had been given to someone else. Much to Priscilla's credit, she did everything she could to make amends for the mistake. First of all, she graciously took responsibility and apologized. She also offered to refund our money and help us find another place if we wanted to leave. What ended up working out was that she prepared another room for one of us and gave us a small refund for the inconvenience.
We were very glad that we decided to stay. The rooms were very comfortable, the home was lovely and Priscilla made an incredibly delicious breakfast the next morning. We thoroughly enjoyed our converstions with her.
I do believe the mixup was a fluke and would definitely recommend her place.
Just an additional note for women traveling solo, Priscilla provides a welcoming and very safe place for either a stopover or longer stay."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Ms. Priscilla was a great host! We had everything we needed and the breakfast was amazing. Our kids loved her dog, Kita, and they had a blast playing with and walking her. Her B&B would definitely be our go to if we are ever near Amsterdam again."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"This is a lovely gem of a spot. From perfectly appointed bedrooms fulfilling both the desire for the lavish and the soft surroundings of country quaintness. Priscilla was a fantastic host. She provided the extra delight of a full breakfast, stave puzzles, a tour of rooms, and full use of the fire pit outside. There were binoculars for birds and cozy chairs to curl up with a good read. Everything was spotlessly clean and comfortable. Pricilla was not intrusive at all but very amiable and absolutely helpful with any questions or desires we had.
It was a favorite B&B by far and I really hope to return someday!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"I absolutely, positively LOVED my stay with Priscilla. Her Airbnb is in a lovely, peaceful location and meticulously clean. Priscilla is very friendly and welcoming. A plus was the huge breakfast she served with fresh eggs laid by her chickens. A gem of a place to stay!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"We absolutely loved staying at this beautiful, clean, welcoming bed and breakfast. Priscilla was wonderful and made us the most delicious breakfast and a campfire. The house is spectacular and located in the most idyllic setting. Could not recommend more!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The place was beautiful & she is a amazing host
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"I have been traveling for a few days and so far Priscilla‚Äôs place was my favorite. From the moment we‚Äôve meet I felt like I have known her for a long time. She showed me around the surrounding towns, took me to a great Dinner spot and we ended up doing a Town Yard sale tour. I wished I had booked 2 days versus just one. The room was cozy and comfortable as well as clean and organized. It was nice and quiet and I enjoyed our morning walk together to see the Goats at the neighboring farm. And of course she made a great breakfast for me and i enjoyed her company eating together."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,This place is amazing. So is the host! It‚Äôs a beautiful ride to get there! In the middle of Amish land!!! The house is amazing. Bed is soooooo comfortable! Priscilla prides herself in being the perfect host! And she sure is!!! From Her bowl of fresh fruit to the amazing breakfast she will cook for you! The frig is packed with assorted drinks and she has protein bars to popcorn! It truly was an awesome experience! It‚Äôs a hidden treasure!!!!
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"I had the most amazing time there. Pictures don‚Äôt do it justice! And Priscilla was so friendly, so accommodating! And her breakfasts were AMAZING. She literally spoiled me. I was so grateful! I am not use to all that! The ride to her house was beautiful! Her home is beautiful. She thinks of everything to make sure you are comfortable and without anything. The bed was probably the most comfortable bed (other than my own ü§™) that I have ever slept in. I was on a motorcycle and she was very accommodating where to park it because there was a storm brewing. I had to stay another day there because of the weather and there was no one booked. Let me tell you. If I had to be held up because of the weather. I was in the best place I could be in!!!! I cant say enough about this place or her. I do alot of airbnb‚Äôs. And this is number one. No one will ever top this! Serious!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Hostess was impeccably flexible and helpful. Accommodating with meals, outstanding breakfast, just like staying with family!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,Felt like walking in home! Knickerbocker farm house is a beautiful retreat and a great space to relax and recharge. Close to town but far enough away for that country feel üíúwill 10/10 stay here again!!
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"A gorgeous building from the late 1700‚Äôs, Priscilla has put great effort into the place and it shows! I highly recommend staying here for anyone wanting to stay in the area.
Priscilla‚Äôs a great host and great company to have! Highly recommend chatting with her.
Breakfast was very good, kept me going for the whole day, and the bedroom is immaculate and the bed very comfortable. The neighbourhood is calm and peaceful, with plenty of greenery all around. Good spot for a day of birding, and Priscilla has a bunch of guides available in case you might need some recommendations."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We loved our stay at Knickerbocker Farmhouse. Priscilla was an amazing host and could not have been nicer with us. She shared a lot of stories about the area and even took us to a Memorial Day Parade in her hometown!! The house is surrounded by nature with an amazing backyard where we could toast marshmallows on a campfire (our 10 years old daughter loved it!!). It is very well located and a perfect place to explore the surrounding area and walk or ride along the Erie Canalway Trail. Priscilla made us the most delicious breakfast we ever had with fresh eggs and a fantastic cake. The house is extremely clean, the bedrooms are large and cozy and the guest living room is extremely comfortable. Priscilla was so accommodating and helpful! She did above and beyond what we would have expected. We would definitely recommend her farmhouse!"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"This is more than a king bedroom - it is an entire wing!! It‚Äôs two bedrooms, a bathroom, a sitting area, and a sitting room
Priscilla could not have been nicer. And the breakfast was phenomenal! She was so accommodating on my (many!) dietary restrictions.
I am looking forward to my next stay at the farmhouse!"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Priscilla was an amazing host and a superb cook. Our breakfasts were exquisite and delicious. She has an amazing gift for hospitality. Would definitely recommend! A great place to go if you are visiting the nearby shrines at Auriesville and Fonda.
2023-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"I loved my stay at Knickerbocker Farmhouse; it‚Äôs quaint and located in a pretty country setting. It‚Äôs also convenient to the Erie Canalway Trail. Priscilla was communicative and welcoming. The living spaces were very clean. My bed was extremely comfy and cozy! Breakfast was yummy! I would definitely stay here again. Thank you, Priscilla, for sharing your lovely home."
2023-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"Priscilla and her dog were great , offered us to pick up our dinner . also, we had an emergency and had to leave early and she was super supportive and understanding."
2022-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,"What a lovely find! This spot is the quintessential B&B. It‚Äôs a well-kept old house surrounded by nature. Priscilla has made it so cozy, decorated with antiques while still maintaining a very up-to-date feel with plush towels, new toiletries and fresh, warm linens on the bed. Breakfast was a veritable feast with a warm fire going in the wood stove. I thought the mini fridge and snacks were a great touch! We really appreciated the thoughtfulness that has gone into this charming B&B."
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Everything about this bed and breakfast was EXCELLENT! Priscilla was a wonderful host and a great cook! The food was amazing! Everything was super clean and the living areas were to die for. I especially enjoyed the guest living room, the furniture was comfortable and fashionable. And the wood stove made the room very toasty, it was a real treat! It was also very cool to see the amish pass by via horse and carriage. I have already recommended this B&B to my friends and family!"
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"From the moment I arrived Priscilla made me feel at home. The location is beautiful and the scenery is breathtaking. This charming old farm house has all the upstate New York vibes I was hoping for. Clean, comfortable and very accommodating I highly recommend this stay for anyone. Whether it‚Äôs a base camp to explore the surrounding area, or a nice quiet retreat from the bustle. P.s come hungry, her cooking is phenomenal."
2022-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"Beautiful, beautiful home on a very pretty road. Priscilla is a wonderful host! Great communication, lovely space, charming home, enjoyable company!"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My boyfriend and I had a wonderful stay at Priscilla‚Äôs b&b. She went above and beyond to make sure we had everything we needed and even gave us some vegetables from her garden (: her and Dave had great recommendations for things to do and we made a jam packed itinerary based on what they suggested!
Recommend for anyone looking for a comfortable place to stay with extremely gracious hosts."
2022-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"A phenomenal stay! Beautiful home, delicious home cooked meal from the host, great hospitality, well organized and comfortable! Could not ask for more! thank you so much! 5 out of 5 across the board!"
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Absolutely lovely stay at the Knickerbocker farm! Everything was so nice. The house is gorgeous and furnished impeccably! We stayed in the king bedroom. The bed was so comfortable, we slept like kings! Everything was so clean! Priscilla made us the most delicious breakfast with fresh eggs and veggies from the garden! We were even able to bring our dog at the last minute. Priscilla was so accommodating and helpful! We were able to watch the Amish carriages ride by in the morning for church! Everything was so perfect! Close to lots of great hiking and Herkimer mines, we spent some time in Little Falls, beautiful views, close to the Erie canal trails. Would be a great weekend get away! 10/10 highly recommend!"
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This listing was everything I could've hoped for in a reasonably priced bed and breakfast stay. The house is clean, large, and private, with an amazing backyard, living area, and bedroom. The host Priscilla was extremely accommodating and extremely responsive. She provided service above and beyond what I would expect from an Airbnb host, providing custom order breakfasts in the morning, and being extremely kind and hospitable during my two night stay. I would absolutely stay here again given the opportunity!!"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The house is as gorgeous in person as the pictures indicate. The host was super friendly and offers a homemade breakfast. I highly recommend, especially for a romantic getaway."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,I had a great stay with Linda and Lawrence. They were lovely. A lot of care went into the room. The house is as described and a fascinating historical wonder. It was so interesting to hang out with them and here the story! Thank you both. Would stay again.
2023-07-01,4,Stayed a few nights,The history of this house was really great. Linda gave us a tour showing some ‚Äúhidden spots‚Äù that were really cool. If you are interested in old house renovations you will love this place and Amsterdam is a great little town!
2023-07-01,5,Stayed over a week,"Linda is a very friendly host. Honestly, every review (and reply to the review) was a great accumulative of what to expect of this home. It is definitely a work-in-progress fixer-upper, but don't let that deter you. The bedroom has everything one could need, and is comfortable. Everything you would need in the house is functional. Linda is also actively working on renovations."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Extremely comfortable and cozy, warm and inviting, friendly hosts.
Very good people, comfortable bed.
Great vibe to everything about the place.
All the best to them and their work in progress building."
2022-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"While it's an older place, it's good for the price and a nice place to get a good night's sleep after a long drive."
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great stay !! I recommend it to anyone in town my spouse and I had a warm quiet evening‚Äôs and the house is beautiful and Linda and the cats are also a warm welcome üôèüèΩ
2022-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"Linda's home is gorgeous and cozy, and it was easy to find. The town is quiet and there was no late night food other than the McDonald's, but all in all it's a nice area. I was too tired to hang out with Linda much, but she was very welcoming and helpful. I'll definitely see if she's available to host me again when I next make this drive!"
2022-09-01,3,Stayed one night,We were very surprised at how ‚Äútorn up‚Äù the house was. We didn‚Äôt expect it to be under construction. You couldn‚Äôt use the dining room or kitchen and there really wasn‚Äôt a living room. The bathroom floor was 3 different levels and could be considered dangerous. The Host was very friendly and pleasant to talk to. She admits that she has a lot of work to do with her house. I just wish we would have known this before going there. This house will be a wonderful place to stay when the work is finished.
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Linda was an extremely accommodating host. I felt very welcome and was exactly what I was looking for.
The location was perfect for splitting time between the Adirondacks and SPAC. Easy drive to Boston or NYC."
2021-12-01,5,Stayed over a week,Linda was a great host and this place was perfect for what I needed. Very close to many area and hiking which I so enjoy. Will stay here again
2021-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"Even though I didn‚Äôt get a chance to meet Linda, she was very good at responding to messages and providing me with all the necessary information. It‚Äôs an old house, so it can be tricky to be find things, but it‚Äôs comfortable and her two cats are very friendly."
2021-10-01,5,Stayed one night,This is one of the most unique places I have ever stayed at! The house has so many fun details and we loved having the cats around. Would definitely recommend.
2021-09-01,4,Stayed one night,Linda was charming and graciously opened up her quirky work-in-progress home for us to stay in. We enjoyed the colorful menagerie of analog artifacts and made use of the backyard fire pit for our one night stay which was a great getaway from the city. We made fast friends her cat Tiki who was very loving and spent the night with us in our tower bedroom.
2024-06-01,5,Group trip,The Refuge has peaceful serine surroundings. The home was very well equipped with amenities. Highly recommend! .
2024-06-01,5,Group trip,"Absolutely beautiful surroundings, huge outdoor patio, trails, ponds. Interior is clean, well kept and spacious. We thoroughly enjoyed our time there. highly recommend."
2024-06-01,5,Group trip,"My family and I enjoyed our stay at the refuge. We was in the area for a graduation at UAlbany, The Refuge was a great place to stay for a family of 8, we enjoyed the view and how spacious the backyard was. It was very peaceful to just sit outside and enjoy nature. The rooms were great and clean. Katie was very responsive leading up to our stay."
2024-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Our planned visit to see our 90+ y/o Mother; took a turn when tragedy struck our family, not once, but twice. The Refuge was already booked and additional family members had reservations to join us. It was truly the perfect ‚ÄúRefuge‚Äù for us to gather, reflect, reminisce and share meaningful, quality time together. Everyone felt the same way. It was a beautiful retreat and time was well spent."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,great stay
2024-03-01,5,Group trip,"Katie has been extremely responsive and super helpful when communicating/I have questions. She suggested recommendations that are local and catered towards our preferences. This to me, showcased her willingness to make our stay welcoming and feel at home. Even though we came up when it was raining, snowing, and hailing which were all out of our forecasts, Katie was responsive and able to make things work for us to ensure that we were safe and able to get into the driveway/house.
Entering the house, we were able to find everything as described in the listing and when unsure, Katie was able to provide clear instructions and even additional amenities when there were none left (i.e. tide pods and trash bags). We thoroughly enjoyed our stay here and would be delighted to come back should we all have the time in the future."
2024-03-01,5,Group trip,"The Refuge is an incredible family sized property for nature lovers, sunlight and wholesome amenities. The place was spotless, well thought out, and had enough room for our adult family of 8 to spread out and to hang out. Highly recommend for anyone looking to decompress and enjoy family time. (The area has tons to do and see but we were more interested in our reunion.)"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed about a week,Had a comfortable stay. I would highly recommend for future tenants!
2024-02-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Great get away for my family
2024-02-01,5,Group trip,"Our stay was great. House was clean as well kept. We arrived early and Katie was very communicative and flexible, kitchen was fairly well stocked, even a crock-pot (which was good because we forgot ours!). The property was beautiful, though it was a little too cold for us to do too much exploring, would love to come back in the spring/summer. We didn't actually realize from the description that the business downstairs was active and there were people there Thursday-Friday, but it wasn't a problem at all, we almost didn't notice them and when we crossed paths outside they were super friendly. We would definitely recommend Katie's place for a nice weekend stay!"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Great place for our family stay! We had a few inches of snow while we were there, and it was a beautiful winter wonderland with gorgeous views out all of the windows. Nice, easy, good communication from Katie & clear instructions."
2024-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We really enjoyed our stay at the refuge! Katie was a wonderful host. We loved being tucked into the woods with such peaceful and quiet surroundings. I‚Äôm sure the surroundings are beautiful in the right season. For the most part, the home was very well stocked for all our needs and the layout was perfect for our large extended family. Everything was good for our visit!"
2024-01-01,5,Group trip,"The refuge is on a beautiful piece of property with its own pond. The house was just as described. It was clean with no issues. We had 6 adults staying during the New Year's weekend and there was plenty of room. Katie was so responsive with every question we had, often getting back to us within minutes of sending a question. We would highly recommend the house to anyone staying in the Schenectady / Saratoga area. Thanks for a great stay!"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Katie was very very generous and kind to our family situation of kids flying in from out of town and the communication was above and beyond what you would want to feel comfortable and secure.
The house fit our 3 families wonderfully with a large living room with lots of seating! The beds were comfortable and even though the weather was cloudy and rainy, the birds visited us every morning thanks to all the bird feeders and the remote location.
Katie made our Christmas special with a Christmas tree all set up for us and Christmas decor giving a wonderful unexpected touch!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"It‚Äôs a beautiful property and home in a convenient location. Everything you need is provided with a host that truly is a super host. Proactive, clear instructions and checks in daily.
We highly recommend Katie and Greg and their properties."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We stayed here with family to attend a wedding in the area. The house was spacious with wonderful views from the bedrooms and living room and from the outdoor seating area. We had planned to have a campfire as it was so beautiful, but the weather was too cool to sit out at night. I was impressed with all the little extras that were provided. There were books and games, a fully stocked spice cabinet, every cooking utensil we could possibly want. One of our family needed a safety pin, and we even found that! Katie was very responsive when we made requests for ice (the ice maker was broken) or had questions. There was plenty of seating in the living and dining room for our group of 6. The living room could use better light as it was very dim at night, even with the dimmer on. The light over the dining room table is on a dimmer and does get very bright if you want to play games or cards at the table. I really appreciated the grab handles in the shower! It was a great week."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This is our second time staying at this location. We love everything about it. The house is beautiful and it has everything you need. Katie is an amazing host and very friendly. We highly recommend it.
2023-10-01,5,Group trip,"My family stayed at The Refuge for my daughter's wedding. The house was great - the scenery was amazing and it was so quiet. The layout of the house was great, beds were very comfy and kitchen was well stocked. This was our first Airbnb stay. Next time I need to stay up near my daughter, I would defintely stay here again."
2023-10-01,5,Group trip,absolutely beautiful area and a very comfortable home for a family get together.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This home is just at as described in a beautiful peaceful setting! We felt right at home me the moment we walked in. The patio offers a great outdoor space with a great area to relax by the fire. If you want the feeling of being in the Adirondacks without the huge price tag, this is a great at option. There are plenty of hiking trails nearby to explore. We enjoyed our stay very much!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed over a week,"A most quiet, peaceful and comfortable two month stay! Just what I needed.
May try for it again next year. R B"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Had a wonderful peaceful time at Katie‚Äôs.A Lots of land beautiful site, it was just so relaxing. Did not want to leave, if I headed that way again I will definitely look up Katie once again thank you so much,"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Great place for a family gathering. Plenty of space. Grounds were immaculate and the Gardens are beautiful. Well recommended for a family of four plus.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,Amazing place. Amazing host. Felt like a wildlife preserve. Held 9 family members comfortably. Katie even shared their homemade syrup and honey with us! Such a special weekend on their slice of paradise.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"The Refuge is just that, a very quiet, private, and spacious place that accommodated our family of 7 adults, 2 babies, and a toddler. Would highly recommend staying there."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Great place and Katie is a great host. The grounds are absolutely beautiful, even in the rain. We had family near by so we did not need to use the kitchen, but if we needed to, we would have had everything we needed."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,We loved watching the blue herons and a family of geese with adorable babies along the ponds. We were able to relax as a family! What a beautiful spot.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,Spacious accommodations for a large family among beautiful surroundings.
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We couldn‚Äôt have had a better stay at the Refuge. Our family of 8 had plenty of room. We took the canoe out on the pond every day (the kids loved it!) and my husband & I went running on the adjoining road. The property is just beautiful - so many birds! We explored Albany, the Shrine of the North American martyrs, Howe Caverns, Cooperstown and grabbed pizza at DeMarcos based on Katie‚Äôs recommendation (delicious!). We had a small issue during our stay that the hosts fixed right away. We would stay at the Refuge again anytime. Such a special, peaceful place."
2023-05-01,5,Group trip,Katie and Greg responded very quickly when we had a small issue and the house and land was awesome
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Katie‚Äôs place was hands down the best vacation home I‚Äôve ever stayed in. The grounds and house were beautiful, clean and thoughtfully designed. Stores and restaurants were a short drive away and the outdoor patio area was where we spent most of our time grilling and using the fire pit. Katie was very responsive and friendly! She made sure we had everything we needed. We will definitely stay again!"
2023-05-01,5,Group trip,What a great place! We always have a large group when we travel (family). Felt ‚Äúat home‚Äù. About 30 minutes to just about anywhere we wanted to go. Would definitely stay again. BEAUTIFUL property!!!

2023-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"‚ÄúThe Refuge‚Äù was a fantastic place. Everything we were looking for. Peaceful, very scenic. Wish the weather was little better!
We had a fantastic stay. Thank You"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Katie & Greg‚Äôs place was amazing. It‚Äôs Great from walks, has enough Space for everyone and was always responsive which made our experience fantastic"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Wonderful place to stay with our large family and dogs! Very friendly, accommodating, flexible and responsive host. We came from Florida and when the snow came in Katie brought us a well needed snow brush for our car and even helped us out when we had to unexpectedly leave early due to the Winter storm. She left toys and treats for our dogs as well! Will definitely stay again when we make our way back‚Ä¶."
2023-02-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Clean, spacious, all the kitchen things you could ever need, and great communication. The outdoor space is what really distinguishes this property!"
2023-01-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Very nice home with a very convenient layout (easy to section off kids / pets when cooking or work calls, for example). Driveway can be difficult to find when arriving after dark but location has almost no traffic so not a real issue. Internet is fast and reliable, the business on the lower floor is barely noticeable, though do be aware if you have dogs that are easily startled by voices they may occasionally get wound up during the work day. The grounds are beautiful, the kitchen is well-equipped, Katie is very responsive. Despite being a good bit outside town, the roads were promptly plowed and salted during our winter stay, so nothing to worry about there either. We look forward to staying here again soon."
2022-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Amazing home.
2022-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"A most fantastic get away location. Close to stores if you need somewthing but, remote enough to feel away from it all. We had our Thanksgiving family outing here and it was perfect. The kitchen was the most well stocked with pots, pans, utensils we have had at an AirBnb. The space was large enough for the kids to be playing games in one room and adults have conversations in other rooms. The outside is beautiful, with lots of room to roam and explore. Higly recommend for anyone looking for a country getaway or a family reunion. Dog friendlyis a great plus."
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Lovely property, great hosts!"
2022-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,We had such a wonderful stay at the Refuge! The home is so welcoming and cozy. The views are beautiful and we loved taking walks around the pond. The home is equipped with everything you need. BEST pet friendly Air B&B we have stayed at. The Katie was prompt answering any questions I had. Looking forward to staying next time we're in NY!
2022-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Very beautiful setting and really wonderful in warm weather. The accommodations were comfortable and had the things we needed. We will come again just to enjoy the beauty of the property.
Katie was so helpful when we left our granddaughter's ""blankie"".
Highly recommend!"
2022-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,Beautiful home. Great place to get away and relax. So quiet and peaceful. Plenty of room. Well stocked and very clean.
2022-09-01,5,Group trip,"A great venue, clean, well maintained, the grounds an unexpected bonus, lots of parking close by and an attentive host make this Airbnb a true ""refuge"""
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"It's actually hard for my husband and I to tell everyone about this gem because we want it all to ourselves. But that's not fair to Katie and Greg, so here it goes. First, Katie made it go right and accommodated us for a last minute check-in when we decided not to go home to the blistering California heatwave after all. The next couple of days were blissful. The pictures and descriptions don't tell the story - you truly have to experience this place. Even though it's all about the outdoor space, the house is spacious, very clean, upgraded, and well appointed. When a day of drenching rain thwarted our plans for an afternoon on the deck and an evening in front of the fire pit, the house was a cozy lookout to the outside splendor while I sipped tea and attempted a jigsaw puzzle. And the rain on the skylights in the bedroom... I don't believe we have every ""unplugged"" like this.
Even though it feels like an island on its own, it's only 10-15 minutes from town and 30 minutes from everywhere else - like the racetrack at Saratoga Springs and the Airport in Albany. Take out from Turf Tavern was amazing - the Herb Encrusted Pork Tenderloin was fantastic!"
2022-09-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"The refuge is the place to go with a big family. Plenty of room inside and out! Fully stocked kitchen with high end appliances. The view is breathtaking! Great for our dogs to run. We saw deer everday. There was not enough time to enjoy the ponds or the firepit. Hopefully we will be back again for that. The pictures do not show the size of this house. There is also a door that closes off 2 bedrooms and bath. That is great for 2 families. Plenty of windows and skylights that let the outside in. The price was certainly a bargin for all our people especially during track season. It feels like real country living but a very short distance for groceries, gas, restaurants and of course Saratoga Race track, Lake George and the Rivers Casino. Katie and Greg are great hosts. They get an A++++ from us. We communicated before and during our stay. She was quick to respond. Thank you for everything. I highly recommend staying at the refuge."
2022-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"house was really comfortable and had plenty of space beds, and bedrooms. house was fully stocked with everything you need. it was very quiet and the yard was great. our kids really enjoyed the canoe and paddle board. great location would definitely stay again."
2022-08-01,5,Group trip,"Our families were gathering for my oldest daughters wedding. We were coming from four different states and the Refuge accommodated ALL of our needs, from cooking for 11 people to several big areas for making all of the centerpieces. Wonderful spaces inside and out for gathering or just some meditation time..
extremely clean and inviting. The Refuge was absolutely perfect, it had everything we needed and more."
2022-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This was a most spectacular spot! The grounds are unreal. The kitchen is very well stocked with pots and pans and spices, oil, vinegar, etc. The sanctuary is truly a sanctuary. It is a pollinators paradise. The wildflowers and water lilies were beautiful. My favorite thing was probably sitting under the stars next to the fire. The outdoor area is well-lit in the dark and stocked with electrical outlets and tons of furniture. It was just so much more than I imagined. Communication was great. I hope to stay again!"
2022-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Absolutely gorgeous location! Enjoyed almost every evening outside on the beautiful patio and walking around the property. Our pups loved swimming in the pond!

Dear Katie,
I've stayed in many AIRBNB's and yours is Top Notch! Every room has a peaceful view, the home is well stocked, and I loved my morning stretches in the family room. My favorite part was sitting around the fire pit at night watching the shooting stars over the lake. Thank you! Lucia

Katie is a tremendous host who is very communicative and thoughtful. I was so impressed with how we really felt like her guests, but in a house all to ourselves. The house itself is lovely with amazing natural light all over - the photos don't really do it justice. We hope to come back again soon!"

2021-09-01,5,Group trip,"The Refuge was a fantastic getaway for my family and our friends! The location was quiet and stunning- the two ponds were beautiful. The kitchen was well stocked and the beds were very comfortable, as was the living room furniture. There is so much outdoor space and it was super easy to grill and eat outside. It was an ideal location for our group of 9 (and would be ideal for other runners and outdoorsy people- we had a blast at Mountain Ridge Adventure too!). One note- the water is definitely safe but does taste sulphuric. Outstanding value for the price! We‚Äôd come back in a heartbeat."
2021-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The Refuge is a beautiful and relaxing getaway. The views from the rooms are beautiful, there is a dishwasher and laundry, TVs in almost every room, and all the cooking supplies you could need.

Overall we had a great trip and Katie was an excellent host!"

The Wifi worked great and there was plenty of options when anyone wanted to watch TV. We loved everything about this space. We really appreciated the Farm Fresh Eggs, Waffle Mix and Maple Syrup among all the offerings that were available. This place was stocked with many supplies if we needed them. It felt like I was at a spa with the big shower head and warm sun coming in from the skylights, amazing hand soaps and bathroom spray. So nice with the canoe and paddleboard. We enjoyed walking around the ponds and some of the trails. We saw some deer, frogs, otter or beaver or something and lots of birds. Taking in the views and the sounds while soaking up the sun were so relaxing. My heart was so full watching our dog running all over enjoying the freedom with so much space to roam. I could go on and on but you will have to see and enjoy it for yourselves. The Refuge has it all and then some. Definitely planning to stay here again!! Thank you so much for sharing your place with us!!"
2021-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,We really enjoyed our stay at the Refuge. The house was perfect for our 2 families and had everything we needed for our stay.

Best vacation ever! Highly recommended!!
2021-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,This was a great spot for our multi family vacation. The house and landscaping was lovely.

We recommend the The Refuge as a great place to get away from the city to gather with family and friends.
2021-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,If you are looking to relax and get away from it all this property has it! What my wife and I loved the most was watching the sun go down reflecting perfectly over the tops of the ponds with the sounds of birds and frogs in perfect harmony! Katie is a kind and friendly person available to assist if you have an issue or need ideas for exploring the area.
2021-05-01,5,Group trip,"This place is gorgeous, inside and out. Nice and quiet location that is still accessible by Shipt, DoorDash, Instacart, etc. Plus you‚Äôre only 10-15 minutes from Target, Walmart, etc. and about 20 minutes to the Albany Mall.

Although I spend a lot of time on the beach it is a pleasure to retreat to a wonderful lakeside hideaway.
Katie was very professional and thorough with all the documentation and information about the house.
Being a person who rents out a vacation house others myself I can definitely appreciate the benefits of a well-run well-cost house
Something to consider is for those working remote it's a great place to spend your midweek as you can go hiking and fishing during lunch and later."
2021-04-01,5,Group trip,"The Refuge is not to be missed. It offered plenty of space for our large family and the dogs loved running around the lake. Katie is super responsive and thoughtful as she left local treats for us and the pups to enjoy. Kitchen was plenty stocked with cooking essentials for our Easter dinner. We‚Äôll definitely be back. Bring boots, warm layers and an extra towel for paws in the spring as it can get get a bit mucky while exploring. Thanks again!"

We are already planning a visit back next summer."

I really recommend this place. Hopefully we will be back again. Thank you for hosting us."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"My experience with Bishoy was nothing short of exceptional.

2024-02-01,5,Stayed over a week,"Frederick‚Äôs home and neighborhood is awesome ! It is such a great home and where the house is is fantastic also. From the big kitchen to the fantastic beds and bedrooms, the spacious living room and the bathroom with stacked washer and dryer we could not have asked for a better place. The driveway is big with a large backyard. Frederick himself was a perfect host. He showed up to snow blow twice after storms before we got home from work and before he went to work himself one morning. Cleaned everything up for us and put ice melt down. What a great guy and host. Would have stayed there longer as our job in the area has now ended. Would rent from him again in a heartbeat !!!!"

2023-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Frederick was an exceptional host. My family and I stayed here during Christmas. From the minute we walked into the home it felt comfortable and welcoming. There was Christmas decorations for us and even a list neighborhoods to look at Christmas lights with the kiddos. This was a perfect place for us to spend as a family, roasting marshmallows by the fire pit, making snow angels or just sleeping in on the comfy beds."

2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful house in residential area and edge of small wood; nice garden behind with chair and basketball basket; very large very comfortable house with everything you need; we really enjoyed our stay at Fr√©d√©ric's!
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,Brilliant stay
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great value for the price - lots of space! Quiet neighborhood - plenty of space to park. We were worried about warm weather, but there are plenty of window AC units to deal with that - we all slept well.
Floor plan is a bit dated - all 3 bedrooms upstairs, but the full bathroom is downstairs. There is a half bath upstairs. Kitchen is well stocked with dishes, silver, and small appliances.
We would definitely stay there again if we return to the area."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We had a great time! Frederick's home is in a quiet, peaceful setting that backs up to woods. We enjoyed sitting by the outdoor fire pit while drinking coffee.
The home is just as described. Note that it has window units, which can take longer to cool down bedrooms. Frederick was very responsive and helpful!"

2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,We had a great stay. House was clean and well-furnished. We super appreciated that there was a normal kitchen table & chairs (most places now have only barstools) and two recliners to relax in after a long drive. There are three beds with different mattresses so there‚Äôs something for everyone. It was also nice that host left the window fan on so the house was cool upon arrival.
2023-07-01,4,Stayed with kids,"My stay was great,except the half bathroom does close."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"It was just a place to sleep for us one night as we passed through the area, but we‚Äôd all like to come back and stay longer sometime. The kids loved the chess board and Twister. It was a quiet neighborhood. There were a/c units in all bedrooms and the living room. Everything was very clean. We had a great stay."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"The place was great and our host was the best! They even had mints for us!
It reminded us of the place we grew up!
Fantastic place worth every penny!
Frederick and his wife are incredible hosts and were very responsive to us throughout the process!
We definitely recommend this property!"

2023-05-01,5,Stayed over a week,"Great place for vacation and business trip. The parking lot is large and you can cook just about anything in the kitchen. there is a back yard, in the evening you can sit by the fire. fast internet, washing machine and dryer. Frederic also brought a cool chair, after work it's great to relax in it.
Best regards,
Aleksandr"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"It was a fantastic experience at The Blue House. It was only for one night, but I felt like I was almost in my own home. It was cozy, clean, and full of everything you might need. There is a lot of natural sunlight inside the house. The kitchen had all the necessary equipment for cooking. The yard is spacious. It's a very safe place to ride a bike or go for an evening stroll. Fred is a generous and friendly host. He suggested places to shop and eat locally. I will rebook this place again for sure. Possibly in the Fall when the leaves change. My husband can get a fire started and we can roast marshmellos and make Smores with the family."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"This place is definitely a one-of-a-kind. It is everything you could possibly ask for, and more for a quiet, peaceful getaway overlooking a beautiful stream with one of the best views around. The house has everything you could ever need, and the host was more than willing to accommodate every need.
Also, if you were like I am and it‚Äôs likely you forget something essential I bet the host will have it already waiting on you. There‚Äôs a backyard fire pit that I didn‚Äôt have time to use but it looked like it would be amazing. I believe the host is new at this, but I have rented a number of Airbnb‚Äòs and he ranks at the top with the super host for sure would highly recommend this place to anyone."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Pricilla‚Äôs BNB was exactly what we were looking for and absolutely we will try to stay here first the next time we are in the area. It was clean, quiet, and we felt at home. The breakfast was also delicious!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Robert is an amazing host who has created a true diamond in the rough. The space was neat, clean, and included everything needed. It felt safe, spacious, and parking was easy. It was quiet and relaxing, which is exactly what my fianc√© and I needed after a hard day of rock hounding in the surrounding area. It‚Äôs a centrally located space so you can get just about everything you need in a span of 5 minutes. It‚Äôs a great place to walk about and unplug without sacrificing urban amenities.
The kitchen and living area was fantastic, with lots of natural light and boho decor. The guidebook and Robert‚Äôs messages were very helpful and I felt truly relaxed.
The only downside was a fairly small/cramped shower, but it‚Äôs still leaps above most spaces you‚Äôll find in CNY/ADKs.
Overall, it was great to stay in and I would recommend Robert‚Äôs space and hosting skills!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Another awesome stay Robert. Thank you so much for helping make my trip memorable!!!
Hope to see you again soon."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"For a studio, this apartment felt huge. It is very cozy, comfortable and clean. The bed was perfect and I slept well. The location is great with a live venue theater across the street as well as a market/cafe. The second floor location ensured privacy. I especially enjoyed hearing the birds in the tree outside the window! I would definitely stay here again."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Had a great time! Everything from the kitchen to the washroom was clean and exactly like the photos. Quite a few stores and restaurants nearby too, so location was good. Would recommend!"

2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What a quaint, quirky, vibrant, well thought out studio space! I admired the textiles and artwork that was layered in the unit. Though on an active main street, very peaceful at night. The building is situated across from one of the most unique co-ops with lot of purchasing options. One of my favorites since I used to live in the area! Robert was quite kind and worked with me for check in and thank you again! This is a marvelous bargain since the impression is high end. I thoroughly enjoyed my stay with my family. The time sent was enhanced by my accommodations."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The Goldfinch is a little haven in Gloversville! We needed a comfortable place to stay while we took care of some business in town. Robert was communicative and flexible with our stay. Highly recommend!

2023-11-01,5,Stayed about a week,"The Goldfinch was a fantastic, cozy space perfect for any stay in the Upstate area. It was private, clean, spacious and had all the appliances, utensils, etc. provided. Robert was also a wonderful, friendly host and was very quick to respond. Great value and would definitely recommend!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"enjoyed staying at Robert's place. it was convenient, and had all the amenities described. the kitchen worked great for use to make meals for two people. the coop food across the street was very cute and had great local items for snacks, and food. we would definitely stay there again."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This please was perfect for the short stay. Thank you very much!
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"A great little studio apartment, highly recommend"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"A very well decorated and neat studio right in the center of an historic upstate town, surrounded by beautiful country. I would definitely say again. Got to meet Robert and he is very friendly and hospitable."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"What a great place! Robert‚Äôs apartment is a cozy, artistic spot in a nice town. We stayed here on a trip from Burlington to Ithaca, as it‚Äôs exactly halfway between. Would happily stay here again if we pass back through in the future!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,One of the best Airbnbs I‚Äôve experienced. Thank you!
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"What a beautiful space! Quiet, immaculately clean, eclectically decorated and about half the price of a hotel room (which would surely not include a kitchen). I wasn‚Äôt ready to leave after only one night, but we hope to stay again when in town for the holidays!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great stay, close to my meeting. Plan on staying again!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"Our stay was lovely. Robert was more than helpful and communicative throughout the whole process. The place itself is beautiful and perfectly suited us. The kitchen was fully stocked, the bathroom had every accommodation one could hope for, and the apartment was clean, comfortable, and beautifully decorated. Robert was so gracious and it truly seems as though he's thought of everything. We very much appreciated the handbook with details about local history, and local restaurant suggestions. Overall, our stay was wonderful and provided exactly the kind of lodging we were looking for. If we ever need another overnight stay in the area, this will be our go to!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Robert has a very nice place. He‚Äôs always available through the Airbnb chat. I would stay here again, than you!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Had an absolutely wonderful stay! It was clean, private, cozy, and affordable! The host was responsive and helpful. An ideal Airbnb. I highly recommend staying here."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great space! Had everything we needed, super walkable, and the bed was comfy! Only concern was no deadbolt, the only lock mechanism was the keycode."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,Great place to stay on my way through New York. The apartment was clean and had everything I needed and checkin was super easy and convenient. I was a little nervous arriving by myself late at night in the mostly deserted downtown and parking in the lot behind the building but everything was fine. I didn‚Äôt have time to explore the town but wished I had. Thanks Robert!
2023-08-01,4,Stayed one night,"Quick stopover on a long drive in the only place within my mom and I‚Äôs budget for a one night stay. Airbnb is getting so expensive! Thanks to Robert for keeping it somewhat reasonable. We were happy with the Airbnb itself but the surroundings were a ghost town and the constant sirens and screaming on a weeknight made us feel a little unsafe. I worried about my car sticking out with Ontario plates as the only car in the lot surrounded by abandoned or closed buildings, but it turned out ok even after a restless night of worrying. I wish I had done more research on the area since we had nothing to do in town by the time we arrived. Unfortunately not what we expected or hoped for. I wanted to love it and I have faith that an artistic renaissance is on its way! I hope this town finds its way back to former glory as there is so much potential. Thankful for a clean and comfortable stay. Nothing negative about the host or apartment whatsoever, just the surrounding area."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"Comfortable, well-equipped and clean apartment located downtown Gloversville. Robert is a very nice host. We had the opportunity to meet him and to talk with him. Highly recommended."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The design of the space felt like we were staying at an artistic friend‚Äôs place rather than renting an Air BnB. Big windows made for a place that was bright and cooled by a gentle breeze, with the tree outside providing privacy."
2023-08-01,2,Stayed a few nights,36 stairs to get in the room .this is not for any one over 60 years old.he shoud have said something about the climbing the stairs. In is ad .or posted pics of stairs. He sakd nothing.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"It was located in downtown Gloversville, which made it easy to get everywhere I needed. The unit was clean and comfortable. Comes with a full kitchen, so it was great to have a fridge available. Easy walking distance to a restaurant less than a block away. Access was easy. The unit overlooked Main Street and was quiet in the evening with minimal traffic. Would stay here again."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"Delightful space, tastefully decorated with care clearly taken with details. Clean, nicely equipped, attractive. Would certainly stay again."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We really enjoyed our stay. The studio was perfect for two and beautifully decorated. Appreciated the comfy bed, plush towels and local coffee!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Honestly very cute and sweet. The place around it was cute too. Not many options for taxi/Uber if you don't have a car. But everything is very walkable. The store in the front is nice and cute.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Excellent value for how nice it is
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"A non-conventional, delightful stay. Robert‚Äôs place is absolutely charming and super-clean. We felt like we were in our own little apartment with everything we needed. Very comfortable. Highly recommend."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Nice apartment in Gloversville with fully equipped kitchen and many parking lots. Robert is very nice and answers fast on messages.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"This booking is so incredible, the inside is beautifully decorated and super cozy! Robert was very kind and an amazing host to have!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a wonderful stay. Everything about the Goldfinch was perfect. Communication with Robert was great. The kitchen was well stocked, the cabinets are beautiful, the towels and sheets are high quality and the vibe in the apartment is fun. There is nothing I would change, except perhaps staying longer than three nights. We would definitely stay at the Goldfinch again."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"The apartment is really well decorated, with a fully stocked kitchen. Hiking at the nearby marshland was gorgeous, and check out the coffee shop/co-op market across the street for a great breakfast or lunch!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Robert has a great place.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Quaint little apartment above a business in downtown. Host gave great suggestions for local places and was always quick to respond to my emails. Location is quiet but so conveniently located to a very busy town with every store and restaurant imaginable. However, Jimmy's Deli and Grocery down the road is terrific and only walking distance. So very happy we stayed there. Only regret is I wish my stay had been longer!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"If gloversville is really poised for a mini-renaissance this puts you pretty close to Ground Zero. Host Robert is an early believer and if you‚Äôre ready to be a pioneer, and especially if you‚Äôre an artist without secure grounding elsewhere this is worth a look-see. Despite seemingly many down on their luck denizens of downtown-especially on a long holiday weekend - the neighborhood felt safe and surprisingly friendly. Robert and partner‚Äôs place is very tastefully, artistically appointed with everything short-stayers could ask for. Robert is a delightful gentleman, the kind of local resident any traveler would want and be grateful to meet."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"Super nice spot to stay! Robert was great with instructions! When at a new place you are always skeptical about how the neighborhood is. Well Robert has AMAZING security to ensure safety!! He gave great instructions, pamphlets to help us know the area, and the bed was soooo comfy! 10/10. If we are ever in the area again we will be staying there again!!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Everything was great! Clean and quiet. It's close to the market downtown.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,Great place to spend the night before checking out the nearby Adirondack Park. Didn't have a chance to meet Robert in person but he was friendly and responsive.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Awesome spot to rest after the dead and company show! I will book here again if I ever come to spac in sarstoga springs
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very cute studio apartment in the heart of Gloversville. I would definitely stay again. Robert was very hospitable and helpful. I highly recommend.
2023-06-01,4,Stayed over a week,Was in town for work and this location was comfortable and would stay here again
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I reserved 2 studio apartments across the hall from each other. Both Raven and Goldfinch were excellent choices! My adult children, 26 and 32, stayed in each and were very pleased with the comfort, cleanliness, and convenient location to both the downtown and my sister's house on Kingsboro Ave. They were able to come and go easily and joined us at their Aunt's house when they wanted. I would also be very comfortable staying there as a parent in their 60's (and my standards are much higher in general!)"
2022-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"Robert took care of everything. We got to visit with him in the Cafe. Wonderful host, friendly, knowledgeable, personable!"
2022-11-01,5,Stayed about a week,"The Goldfinch was in a good location for my visit to the lower Adirondacks. The space was neat and clean and had everything I needed for a comfortable place to rest after spending my days in the Adirondack woods. There was some occasional noise from the road below at night but was usually so tired that getting back to sleep wasn‚Äôt an issue. The space has a functional , full kitchen and a comfortable bed. Overall a great value for what you‚Äôre getting. Would stay here again."
2022-11-01,5,Stayed one night,great place ! clean comfy with all the comforts
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Truly is a great place to stay, being right there on main Street Gloversville."
2022-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"Robert‚Äôs place is in the perfect location when visiting Gloversville! Right across the street from the Glove theater and in the center of downtown. It‚Äôs an attractive and well furnished, and clean and comfortable place as well! He‚Äôs a gracious host, and be sure to stop in his cafe bookstore downstairs for a treat while in town. There is a steep staircase to get to the apartment however, and if you‚Äôre not used to sleeping with traffic noise use a white noise app or bring earplugs, because it is right on (above) main street. We will be sure to return soon!"
2022-10-01,4,Stayed one night,"Our stay was nice, everything is just the way its stated in the description. It doesnt have central air and heat but it does have a very nice heater that kept us warm. I would stay here again if i was in town again."
2022-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"The Goldfinch is an eclectic, well designed and unique studio apartment in the heart of downtown. A perfect one or two night stay in a lovely town. Had a great visit and would love to return again in the future."
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Robert's place was GREAT! It has all the comforts of home, it is super clean, easy to check in/out, plenty of parking and safe location. Loved heading downstairs in the mornings to his coffee/tea shop and being able to walk to nearby restaurants. The Glove theater and Co-Op are right across the street too. I would highly recommended to stay here!"
2022-10-01,4,Stayed one night,"The apartment was clean and Robert was kind. The surrounding area is not the best, but the room made up for it. Also, House of Pizza is a good place for dinner nearby."
2022-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"Robert was a great host, and we really enjoyed our stay in Gloversville! The apartment was very clean, and was decorated with such interesting pieces that Robert has collected from around the world. Hope to go back soon."
2022-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The apartment is very cozy, welcoming, and thoughtfully laid out. We had a wonderful stay!
The kitchen is absolutely beautiful -- I think it's nicer than the one we have at home! The bed is very comfortable."
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place with a lot of charm and character. I was so happy to find such a nice place to stay in the heart of downtown Gloversville.
2022-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"Don't be put off by the sketchy outer appearance of the building - it's cute and very nice on the inside. Robert was also really helpful - my husband and I needed to check in at 2 am since we had left directly from our wedding reception and drove 3 hrs to be near the Auriesville pilgrimage site the next morning. Robert made sure we were able to check in past the scheduled time, and his place was perfect to catch a couple hours of sleep!"
2022-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"The place is cute and colorfully decorated. it's generally clean, well lit, and overall a good comfortable stay. I knew it was on the 2nd floor, however i wasn't expecting such a long flight on steps up. The space also has a nice memory foam mattress, but the pillow was kind of flat for me, but thats just a personal preference. Would definitely reccomend."
2022-08-01,2,Stayed a few nights,"I would double check with Robert for the correct code when getting into your unit, because I was stuck with the wrong code an unable to get in. Once I was actually inside the unit was great."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,Robert was extremely helpful to us and made sure we had an amazing time at his place
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The unit was fantastic.
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Free off street parking, recently remodeled space.
Small, cute and exactly what we needed for a short get away."
2022-06-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Nice place, generally clean. The room faces a Main Street through town and since we had the windows open rather than running the window ac, we did get a lot of outside noises. There were ear plugs in the one drawer though! Kitchen is decently stocked with the basics, not a lot of extras. We were surprised that many of the shops in town were not open on Saturday morning. However, we did enjoy a lovely hike around Willie‚Äôs Wildlife Marsh Trail which is only a short drive from this rental."
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Adorable apartment furnished nicely with a very comfortable memory foam bed. The host is wonderful. He had great communication and was very friendly. I would recommend his place.

There is a steep flight of stairs that made carrying all my bags up a pain. But the exercise was needed!"

Robert was very kind and amazing at communicating with us. Every time we had a question he was quick to get back to us. My boyfriend had the pleasure of meeting him and said he was very kind.
We will definitely be back soon! There is so much history and many museums and places to visit. Everyone in town is very kind. And, you‚Äôre right on the outskirts of the Adirondacks. It‚Äôs truly beautiful."

This place is a sweet little nest above it all. Beautifully decorated. Comfortable and spotless. We felt very lucky to have found this spot on our drive north to Canada.

If you‚Äôre looking for a good starting point to experience both the Adirondacks and the Catskills, or even just a little getaway to small town America, The Goldfinch is this and so much more."
2021-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"We had a great time, warm spacious place to enjoy"

2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Thank you for having us as your first Airbnb guests to experience The Wobbly Cabin and all it has to offer.

The cabin itself is spotless, cozy, and provided all items necessary for an unforgettable memory."

2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful and historic place to stay on the Mohawk river. The hosts are responsive. Judd even helped us unload our car in the rain. We biked along the Erie Canal and hiked Saratoga Spa State Park and the Indian Ladder at Thacher State Park. We also hiked Prospect Mountain at Lake George which is also nearby. And as a special bonus, we were able to enjoy the deck and sunsets over the Mohawk River."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Excellent experience. We loved the place! Beth and Judd were very responsive to our questions, they gave us excellent recommendations for local restaurants and things to do. If you bring your kayak(s) be prepared to go to a drop-in area. There really isn't access for kayaks at the house. We went to Maalwyck park in Scotia ¬Ωmi east of the house. Very easy put in, flat water no current to deal with, a great paddle."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"We loved our stay here! We really appreciated how Beth and Judd were so responsive and provided helpful instructions. The interior is beautifully kept, and the yard and patio are adorable. The place is so charming, we wish we could have stayed longer!"

2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had an amazing time staying at Beth and Judson's Airbnb! They are fabulous hosts and always very responsive to messages.
We chose this spot to stay for the Eclipse event and drove from it up to the Adirondacks to witness it. This Airbnb was conveniently located and great to come back to after a long day of driving.
The space is beautifully decorated, clean, comfortable, and really just perfect. Being right next to the Mohawk River is a huge bonus and we enjoyed sitting on the patio at night and star gazing by the water. We will definitely book this spot again as we want to explore the area further!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"The kitchen was perfect for hosting a small family gathering. We loved the table and the living room space. The place had cute, simple items to make it feel cozy and warm. Super kind and helpful. They were super kind about the item that fell off the wall when we moved the couch to put it back. And the best part was the view of the river and the fenced-in yard for our dogs."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was a terrific location for our visit to Union with our pup along for the trip. Working remotely for a few days, great wifi, and such great hosts. Amazing to be able to take a quick walk on the property by the river. Looking forward to our next stay."

2024-02-01,5,Stayed with a pet,My wife and I were waiting to close on our new home. The River House was 4 miles away from our new house and was extremely comfortable. We stayed for 17 days. The rental was also pet friendly which was extremely helpful as we had our supermutt Steve with us. There was plenty of space to walk him everyday on the property and nice fenced in area we could let him off-leash and get his zoomies out! if we have visitors to our new home and can't accommodate them River House is going to be the first place we suggest!

We brought our two dachshunds and were so happy to find a place that was pet friendly. The rate was so reasonable. The place was just what we needed. The bed and couch were so comfortable. The kitchen had everything we needed to make a quick breakfast in the morning, the provided coffee was a nice touch, and the place was just so easy to be in that we felt right at home. And the riverfront location was such a nice bonus! Beth and Judd were so friendly and warm and welcoming and very easy to communicate with. We‚Äôd love to come back someday and stay for longer."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We loved this apartment! We felt right at home and appreciated the farm house‚Äôs history. The views are beautiful, and the apartment is so cozy.

We appreciated the responsive and helpful hosts.
The best breakfast sandwiches are right around the corner. We were sorry to leave!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"This was a very nice and beautiful place, they helped us whenever we needed more instructions as we were first time travelers at the time. They provided the details on the house and our room. It was spotless and had provided cooking supplies and toiletries as we forgot most of ours, including some of our bedding. We had a great time i would definitely come back when the opportunity arises."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Loved it!!! Would 100% go again

Beth was an amazing host we will definitely be staying again!
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beth‚Äôs place was wonderful! It was so quiet and comfortable, and Beth and Judd were so friendly! I would definitely stay at their place again!"

2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is a fantstic place to stay, so much history and great hosts"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"I can‚Äôt say enough good things about the hosts & the rental itself.
From their immediate response & help with my booking mistake, the hosts were phenomenal.
The rental was amazing, with beautiful view.
Everything was absolutely perfect!
My son performed a set at Evolutions Festival 2023 & this location was so convenient. I‚Äôll be sure to book again in the future!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,Such a beautiful space! I loved walking the grounds with my dog. And the apartment was open and comfortable.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,Very welcoming hosts. Beautiful setting on the river in a historic house.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The upstairs space was roomy and clean. It had a great kitchen, comfortable bed, and nice view of the river. It‚Äôs true that the road is noisy. It‚Äôs 4 lanes and the cars are going fast. It didn‚Äôt get in the way of sleeping, though. The bedroom faces the river, not the road. The fan on the air conditioner drowned out the noise. The spot was very handy to our HS reunion just down the road at the Wolf Hollow brewery. I also took my bike over to Rotterdam Jct. and biked for Erie Canal bike trail. Nice."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Beth‚Äôs home is wonderful. It‚Äôs close to the road, as others have said, so there‚Äôs a bit of road noise from the front rooms. But the bedroom faces the back and I had no trouble with noise there.
The space is larger than the photos show, with a long hallway between the kitchen/dining area and the bedroom and living room.
Everything was really clean and the furniture was both comfortable and nice looking.
The backyard is extensive, with tons of room to explore. Having the boat launch with pretty shallow water around it was a plus for my four year old to be able to throw rocks in the river! (But bring water shoes if you plan to do something similar as the rocks on the riverbed and shore are slippery.)
Location was rural feeling but within 5 mins of a Stewart‚Äôs, Dunkin Donuts, a decent tavern/restaurant, a craft brewery, and a craft distillery.
Will definitely stay here again if ever stopping over in the Albany region!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"A beautiful historic home on the water. Really enjoyed the large windows, tall ceilings, and beautiful grounds. Everything was exactly as described, clean, and comfortable. The host was communicative, friendly, and provided clear instructions. Recommended!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This was a great place to land after seeing some shows at SPAC. It was clean and full of amenities. Felt like going home at the end of the night.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,What a wonderful property and family!! I stayed here for three weeks and this place was exactly what I needed. The river is beautiful and the property is huge! Beth and Judd were great hosts and were so communicative and helpful anytime I needed something! The kitchen has everything you need and the bed was super comfortable. I had a lovely stay!
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,We loved the views from the Mohawk River. You must make it down to the patio area. It was just what we needed after a long drive. We also loved getting a bite to eat at the local restaurant across the river- The River Roadhouse- great price and friendly service. Will definitely stay again.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Beth's place was amazing. We had the bad luck of being overbooked on a different platform and were scrambling to find a place to crash for the night. Within a half hour, we were welcomed with a smile in Beth's house. Great location. Excellent communication. And very clean. Great place to stay."
2023-06-01,4,Stayed one night,"Great place overall, with one issue, particular to me.... So, i'm a super light sleeper, and I made the mistake of not carefully reading the host's description. The traffic noise is definitely mentioned. It was not ideal for me, HOWEVER, as long as you're not like me w/ needing absolute quiet, it would be a shame to miss out on this GEM of a property. Case in point, I spoke with the other guests here on their way out, and they slept fine and had no problem with the noise. We agreed It's a great spot - immaculate, updated, well appointed, and comfortable, along with wonderful river views (make sure to take your coffee down to the deck in the morning for that), and a communicative, responsive and friendly couple as hosts."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Huge, clean space in a beautiful location right on the waters edge. Could not have asked for more!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The views to the river are nothing short of breathtaking. We had a peaceful stay and finally got to try out my inflatable boat I purchased. There were tons of extra towels, the space was spotless, and Beth and Jud were the sweetest. They really put thought into making sure your stay is special. I would definitely book Beth‚Äôs place again."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Perfect for the four of us, the environment is comfortable and we will go again if we have the chance."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Host was excellent with communication. The place was lovely, clean, with gorgeous views. Bed was comfy and had everything needed.
I also recommend the Schenectady Distilling Company right down the road and River Road House on the other side of the river."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We loved our stay here. The place was clean and easy to get to. The location is great, I was able to get to work downtown Schenectady within a 10 minute drive. The outside space was beautiful and incredibly peaceful. The hosts were very responsive and friendly. We will be back again!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"We thought of a very good night at Beth and Judd's place.
The house was well appointed and there was nothing missing!
Thank you!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Spacious second floor of a lovely, renovated mid-1800‚Äôs colonial house, on the Mohawk River. Lodging was as described. Close to Highway 5. Very easy river access, nice grounds. Beth and Judd were very friendly and pleasant to deal with."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was my first stay alone at an air bnb which could have been rather uncomfortable. However, this very kind, considerate couple made me feel safe, welcomed, and relaxed. Jud was mindful of my feelings as a female traveler and when he came to help me get in the apartment (check in would have been easy had I read the instructions!) he brought his toddler with him as a way to increase my comfort. The apartment is extremely clean, comfortable, and relaxing with the river running right by it and river views out the window. Bed is very comfortable as well! Thank you Beth and Jud for your kindness and hospitality!"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Another great stay here!! So pretty now that all the flowers have come up. Will be staying here again sometime!!

2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"Second time we stayed here! The apartment is perfect for a couple. I work from home, and was able to have a private space to do my work. The yard and river are great for walks. Beth and her family are very sweet! Hope to make this our main place to stay when visiting family in the area!"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beth has a beautiful Airbnb with a lot of history to the house! The river is literally in the backyard, and the area is beautiful."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Beautiful & historic house. This apartment is on 2nd floor & has the lake view. Loved it - i was there on a work trip and the space was more than enough for me and my dog.
Could get chilly at late night as it is right by a lake. Everything was good & easy. Thank you üôèüèª"

2023-02-01,5,Stayed one night,The hosts were super friendly and accommodating my schedule. Stayed up late and Made sure I got in . Nice location expect for the road noise which cannot be helped. Fresh linen. Kitchen amazing with necessities. Lights hand reached. Will definitely go back just to enjoy the waterfront and nice location for privacy and comfort. Thanks Beth and Jason for making this location accessible for anyone to enjoy who wants to book. I will surely tell all the good things to my colleagues and encourage them to come the Beth‚Äôs place and enjoy the best life has to offer with regards to home away from home. A place to stop relax unwind and just be fre and be yourself.
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We really appreciated how accommodating our hosts were, especially since I have allergies. It‚Äôs hard for me to find a breathable stay, and they went above and beyond to ensure that I could breathe in this space! The river behind the house was powerful‚Äîwe spent a bit of time sitting near it. It was a little less idyllic than we‚Äôd hoped but met our needs well. The hosts are truly exceptional, the best we‚Äôve had!"
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had an absolutely amazing time at Beth & Judd‚Äôs place these last two days. It really was everything we wished for in terms of a getaway from the city.

2022-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Nice 2 night stay! The River was beautiful aptly named the River House we would like to see it in the fall‚ù§Ô∏èJud and Beth were very responsive!
2022-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Beautiful river views! This was a convenient stop for us breaking up a long drive along the New York Thruway/Mass Pike. It was light and spacious and the kids were comfortable. We enjoyed the World Cup on the large TV and also enjoyed the lawn by the river in the morning. Would certainly come back. Thank you.
2022-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Beth and Judson were gracious hosts, and the location, amenities, and conditions of the AirBnB were all perfect. I will absolutely be choosing to come here again!"
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Step back in time with all the convenience of today. Immerse yourself
In the local history and local dining."
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I have now stayed here twice- once in the downstairs apartment and once upstairs. The hosts are friendly, responsive and pet friendly. The place is clean and the views are breathtaking. I would most definitely recommend!!!"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great place and super clean! As advertised, it‚Äôs right on the river! It‚Äôs super close to the highway so it was easy to get anywhere!"
2022-10-01,4,Stayed one night,Nice big apartment in a cool setting near a river. It worked out perfectly for my group as we were driving from Brooklyn to Montreal and needed an overnight place. We didn't have a chance to walk around the property but that would have been nice!
2022-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Nice spot to stay. Quiet out of the way, and on the river which is nice. It is also nice that the hosts live on premise as well in case anything emergent comes up. We had no issues ourselves, and it was nice to meet Judd and one of his daughters."
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was our second stay at Beth and Judd‚Äôs and it did not disappoint. The views were incredible, the space was clean and homey, and it was a delight to wake up each morning to a view of the river.
Be sure to read up on the fascinating history of the place: a framed summary is provided in the apartment. The lovely decorative touches made the place feel more like a home than a rental, and we loved spending a rainy afternoon in the spacious living room, which has an exceptionally comfy couch and large smart TV.
The kitchen was well appointed, and the expansive, attractive dinner table could certainly seat more than our two. We appreciated the desks dappled about the apartment for when one of us had to dip back into work. Gigantic windows bathed the place in sun in mornings and brighter days, and otherwise provided atmosphere that helped the space feel less closed in, more open to the treetops.
On warmer days we sat outside and walked the grounds: we had plans for other autumn activities, but it was frankly so beautiful by the river it was difficult peeling ourselves away. The bedroom view affords a beautiful look at the surrounding landscape, and in the morning you can see the fog rising from the river and surrounding hills.
Beth and Judd were again fantastic hosts, down to coming to the rescue when we had a snafu with our keys. The building is quiet, storied, and well kept, and going up the stairs to our rental had the feel of an old-world Victorian flat, which gives it a touch of romance.
This is the perfect place to go for some rest and relaxation, and while we were only two this time, this upstairs apartment would be a great place for a family trip or holiday with a group of friends. Highly, emphatically recommended."
2022-10-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Very comfortable, spacious and clean.
Upstairs level."
2022-10-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Great spot on the river! The house is amazing. Very comfortable and well appointed. It was a great place to relax with our family and dogs! Highly recommend and we will be back.
2022-10-01,5,Stayed one night,I like Beth‚Äôs house very well. It is clean and convenient. I sent her massages and she answered my questions very quickly.
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The location of the property was beautifully located on the tall banks of the Mohawk river. The scenic view from the property was spectacular. I enjoyed my morning walks through the property with an abundance of greenery and well maintained grounds. Next time I will bring our kayaks and enjoy the view from the river. The apartment was exceptionally clean and well appointed with comfortable furnishings.
2022-09-01,5,Stayed one night,Really enjoyed our brief stay. Location and accomodation were very clean and well-provided.

2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Cool old house on the Mohawk with beautiful views. The unit itself was huge with high ceilings and plenty of space. We‚Äôll be back!
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beth's place is very welcoming, and the owners are very friendly and friendly. It was nice to be welcomed, much less impersonal than just finding the keys in a box and how to be welcomed by old friends. The apartment is very well-kept and spacious. Super the coffee maker and the TV with Netflix, which the girls loved so much. Charming and charming river bath from the garden at home. Thank you"
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The apartment was very nice and has recently been renovated. We were in the 2 bedroom upstairs. There are 2 televisions with 1 in the livingroom and one in the master bedroom. the kitchen has a huge dining room table and plenty of room to cook and eat. The house is on a very large piece of property next to next to the mohawk river. they have multiple areas on the property to sit.

It‚Äôs got such a peaceful and serene feel to it, we loved everything about it. Truly the perfect getaway. Pictures are identical, you won‚Äôt regret staying here!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is perfect for peace and quiet! Not much to do in the area, however crossgates mall is 30-40 min drive depending on traffic. There‚Äôs a grocery store about 10 mins away, other than that not much. DoorDash will deliver but not many options. The hot tub was nice and clean."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We were looking for a weekend get away where we didnt know anyone. We lead very busy lives so to have a place that was almost in the middle of nowhere was really nice. Close enough to local attractions, but far enough away to get away from the business of town. We will be recommending this stay to our friends and hope to visit again soon."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very responsive host. Had easy communication before and during the trip
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The schoolhouse was a lovely peaceful place to stay! The decor was so appropriate for the old schoolhouse setting. The furniture was comfortable and clean, and the whole house was spotless! We very much enjoyed our stay!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Kayla‚Äôs place was perfect for our short stay in Amsterdam! It was well appointed, thoughtfully decorated and super clean.

Definitely a 5 star stay and would love to stay again if ever in the area!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,Great hosts- beautiful place!
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The little school house is a beautiful and relaxing gem. Kayla has thought of everything. The entire space just hums with a peaceful energy. We loved the hot tub, which was extra wonderful to use while watching an unexpected April snow storm."

2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Very clean, private, peaceful and cute place for a getaway. My boyfriend and I spend our birthday getaway here and had an incredible time. Perfect for just us two and time together alone enjoying each other‚Äôs company, the hot tub was amazing with the cool night breeze! Super grateful for this experience, we both would highly recommend!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Host went above and beyond expectations this felt like a 6 ‚≠êÔ∏è experience!

2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,Was in town for one night to see a show about half an hour away. Place was extremely clean and well put together. Basically only slept there but was much better dealing with a hotel. If we stayed longer we would have had everything you would need. Just bring some food to cook and drinks.
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This school house was beautiful and was such a great and relaxing stay for my partner and I! From the hot tub to the cozy fire place we loved every minute of our stay! Kayla was a great host and made everything so easy and accessible. Definitely recommending to others that would like a peaceful get away. We will be staying again in the future!!
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My husband & I enjoyed every minute of our stay at Kayla & Eric's place. The house is beautiful and exactly as described. You can tell that a lot of thought was put into making this home perfect. They truly thought of everything - from the extra towels & bathrobes, to the coffee (plus to-go cups) and extras found within the kitchen. It was super clean and cozy, including the back porch. We enjoyed the hot tub and appreciated the extra length they went to make it a private space. Instructions from Kayla were clear and both check-in and check-out were simple. We left feeling relaxed and refreshed, and intend to come visit again!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"From the moment you pull up/walk inside to the time you leave, you know that you found something special. Kayla was super helpful, a gracious hostess, and a terrific communicator if you have any questions. The place is spotless and I wouldn‚Äôt change a thing. Blown away with her attention to small details and eye for decorating. Loved the pillows and that BED!!!! Best nights sleep ever! Kayla spared no expense with anything in the School House. The fireplace was warm and cozy, and although we didn‚Äôt use the hot tub, there is always next time. Well done Kayla!!!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Kayla‚Äôs space was amazing! It‚Äôs the perfect spot for a couples, friends, or solo getaway. The house was exactly as photographed in the listing (it‚Äôs stunning!), the check-in was smooth, and the amenities are top-notch. The hot tub was our favorite part! We left feeling relaxed, rested, and rejuvenated. Thank you Kayla!!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This place was amazing. Perfect get away for my boyfriend and I. The check in process was super easy. We did not cook at the home but there was lots of different pans and pots we could have used. Everything was super clean and I felt comfortable immediately. If you‚Äôre looking for a cozy weekend getaway this is the place!
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Perfect for a relaxing, comfortable, short getaway to celebrate a belated Valentine's Day. Very well decorated and appointed. The hot tub was outstanding."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"The space was one of the most pristine and cozy places I‚Äôve ever stayed at. Every detail was meticulously taken care of! As a native to upstate NY, it was so lovely to see this type of effort put into a local place. Thank you so much!"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Kayla‚Äôs place was so beautiful. It was one of the most relaxing weekends I‚Äôve ever had. The home was perfect inside and out and there was nothing more than we needed. The kitchen had everything. Will definitely be returning!
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Hands down best place my wife and I ever stayed! We will be coming back every year!
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Me and my wife had an amazing stay! The house was very clean, organized, the kitchen has EVERYTHING (trust me, everything). It is exactly like the pictures, adorable and cozy! Perfect for couple. Kayla was very friendly in the messages and was always aware to help if we needed! Totally recommend."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed one night,This house was the perfect getaway for my boyfriend and I! Was gorgeous and very comfortable. Watch tv by the fire place or enjoy the hot tub. Perfect place to escape to.
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Absolutely beautiful place with so much attention to detail. Above and beyond our expectations. Ours was just a quiet getaway to escape the madness of our busy lifestyles and this house fit the bill so well. The host was kind and responsive to our needs. Luxurious and comfortable accommodations. Highly recommend and hope to return in the future when we feel the need to step off and find peace in our surroundings.
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We loved Kaylas place! It is beautiful and relaxing! Everything was perfect, except the hot tub wasnt working. Kayla, was very great at letting us know and giving us a good deal for that not working. The home was very clean and comfortable! Everything you need for a relaxing stay is there . Kayla definitely has the house set up wonderful for guests. Anything you need is there. I look forward to returning!"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Awesome get away we loved it !!!
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Kayla went above and beyond! Her beautiful home was the perfect getaway my partner and I were looking for. Kayla was quick to respond, providing local recommendations and answering questions to help ensure our romantic getaway was seamless.
On top of the incredible amenities, beautifully decorated space and charming d√©cor, the kitchen had all the supplies we needed to cook delicious meals together and feel right at home. Everything was as described (and more!) and the fireplace provided a lovely ambiance while enjoying our time together.
To my surprise, my partner had communicated with Kayla before our visit and coordinated a surprise welcome basket with everything to have the perfect charcuterie night - including a card, chocolate-covered strawberries and delicious cheese! I was completely blown away by Kayla's accommodation and hospitality and can't recommend her as a host and her beautiful home enough. We will definitely be back if in the area!"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful property for weekend away. It is a little remote and surrounded by farmlands which was one of the reasons we chose the property--but groceries and restaurants were only about 10 minutes away. Due to the weather we ended up cooking more than expected and the kitchen had everything we needed.
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I would have check in details and wifi information screen shotted before hand because there was no service available at the location. Other than that it was smooth sailing.
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Unique and tranquil beautiful place. It's put together with style, charm and grace. I definitely would stay here again."
2024-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"By far the very best Airbnb we have stayed at even in comparison to high-end hotels. The extraordinary attention to detail for decor, cleanliness, amenities, comfort, elegance, and proactive and extremely responsive host(s) made for a truly remarkable stay. Would definitely stay again if in the area."
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We stayed here for our 32nd wedding anniversary. It was wonderful.
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Our stay at the luxury Schoolhouse was fabulous. My jaw dropped when I entered. It is a historic space with exquisite style. it's clear that Kayla has an eye for design and it's lovely how they honored the space as it originally was. The hot tub and fireplace are wonderful amenities, especially in January. We had hoped to see more of the area but it was honestly hard to leave as we loved the property so much! Kayla was very responsive and made it clear if we needed anything she would happily assist. Overall a wonderful stay!! We will definitely book again!"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This schoolhouse is a wonderful place to stay. secluded and well thought out. Historic and charming but with all the things you want in a place. The kitchen is one of the best and most thoughtful I have ever used at an Airbnb.
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Kayla was very responsive and helpful with directions and reminders. The schoolhouse was perfect for a relaxing staycation and I would recommend to anyone! It was very beautiful and clean. I also loved the holiday decorations and everything that related to the original schoolhouse!!
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This stay was truly wonderful. I got it as a gift for my partner and I. Extremely peaceful and intimate. The hot tub was a bonus for sure. The place was one of a kind and we found so many wonderful spots nearby for food etc. Will definitely be back
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The schoolhouse did not disappoint in the least. It had been one of our absolute favorites so far with Airbnb. I would highly recommend it! Great hot tub! üòÉ
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The perfect place for a serene getaway. Can‚Äôt wait to stay again!
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The schoolhouse was wonderful! The Christmas decorations were beautiful, and the pictures and newspaper clipping hung up about the schoolhouse were so interesting! Kayla sent a list of places near by and we had such a great time! Would definitely recommend and would live to stay again!"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Kayla was very friendly, responsive, & made sure we had an exceptional stay. If we are ever in the area again we will book this awesome schoolhouse again!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Awesome secluded vacation spot to get away from it all!
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The schoolhouse was absolutely amazing! It was the perfect mix of stylish and cozy. The kitchen has everything needed to cook meals (and what gorgeous vintage-style appliances!) and was generously supplied in tea and coffee. The king bed is one of the most confortable we have ever slept in. Beautiful bathroom with excellent shower. We made good use of the gas fireplace and hot tub. It was just the perfect place for a romantic ""stay-in"" late Fall getaway.
Kayla was very friendly and proactive in providing instructions and recommendations in the area, it was a pleasure to interact with her.
All in all, we would stay at the Old Schoolhouse again in a heartbeat (we were quite sorry to go after our 2-night stay!) and strongly recommend it."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beautifully renovated old schoolhouse, looks just like the pictures. Clean, quiet & quaint. We loved our stay, everything was perfect."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My husband and I stayed at Kayla‚Äôs place and it was the perfect getaway that we needed. The area itself was quiet and far enough away for privacy yet close enough to grab any last minute items or a bite to eat. The hot tub was relaxing and a great touch on the bitter cold days. The house was clean, immaculate, and beautifully restored from its original structure. The inside was adorable! We even had a chance to visit Howe Caverns during our stay. I highly recommend! Kayla is a great host and there is truly nothing negative I can see about our experience."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This little schoolhouse was the perfect get away for a solo trip. The minute I walked in I felt right at home with the retro-modern kitchen, cozy fireplace in the living room, and grand bedroom and master bathroom. The back porch right off the bedroom was a favorite spot to spend quiet mornings, and have an evening dip in the hot tub. There were plenty of blankets, towels, and even bathrobes to help you settle in. It was nice and peaceful in the evening, and there was plenty to do in a drivable distance. It was a perfect spot and I am so happy I stayed here for my solo trip. I can also see how it would be nice for a couple‚Äôs retreat, or even a girls trip with a friend. Kayla was a great host, quick with responses, and gave great suggestions for things to do during your stay. Truly lovely, and I might find myself there again sometime."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Worth it 100%
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Kayla did an amazing job with every detail. My wife and I stayed at her place for an anniversary weekend and it was peaceful and relaxing. The pictures don‚Äôt do it enough justice. All the amenities were carefully thought out and the place was extremely clean. I would highly recommend this place.
2023-11-01,5,Stayed one night,Beautiful place

2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,This place is beautiful. The kitchen had everything we needed for baking and the hot tub was amazing. We really enjoyed the lights in the hot tub as well! Definitely would stay again!
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Kalya offers a beautifully renovated School House that's tasteful and quiet. The study is adorable (stocked w. pens & highlighters) and the fireplace was really nice in the evening. The shower is huge and the provided shampoo/bodywash smell so nice. There isn't much to do within close proximity so if you're looking for some R&R or a remote place to work- it is perfect. There is a Hanaford ~10-12minutes away so an easy drive to stock up for your stay. Hoping to book again soon, Kayla!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,beautiful place quiet will definitely be booking again.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"Oh My God! I have No complaints! Location was amazing! Very Private Environment. The School House Was Amazing! Had Everything we needed. I would say the robes could be bigger lol but thats small compared to the GREAT Experience we Had. Hot Tub To Die For! Bathroom was immaculate! Kitchen Fully Equipped and Clean. Living Space and Bedroom Gorgeous.
Kayla did a Great Job in Knowing what to leaving from the original space and what to update. Everything was amazing! Best Anniversary Ever! Not to Mention Communication Was On Point! We Will Definitely Be Back"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"This might be one of my favorite airbnb stays, the building is newly renovated and well designed. The appliances and kitchen were very nice, the hot tub and layout were beautiful. I was so happy with this stay and will definitely go back when I go upstate. Kayla put in a lot into this spot and it feels like she really cares about the space and comfort of guests."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,It's absolutely incredible! just a short drive to everything you need. The house was clean and adorable. Would highly recommend staying here!
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay. It was exactly what we needed: clean, comfortable, and stocked for the essentials. It was great to hear the wildlife and see the greenery.
Note: The shower is a tight fit. I don't think there's much you can do, other than reconstruction. The red arrow is partially covered with ""255"", but it is noticeable, even when arriving in the dark."
2024-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"Ainsley house was spotless, and very easy to find. Comfortable surroundings and very quiet. He is such a sweetheart!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,wonderful place peace and quiet ü§´
2024-04-01,4,Stayed with kids,very clean place. the upstairs floor was a little nerve wracking. mouse poop in the kitchen drawers but I guess that comes with being a cabin in the middle of the woods. parking is a bit inconvenient. upgrades are beautiful though.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Host was very helpful and prompt with getting back to me if I had any questions. Secluded location, peaceful and relaxing"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The cottage was very clean. The bathroom and the shower were a bit small but very functional. The beds are a bit hard but nothing significant. Again, my wife really appreciated how clean the place was. It was a very comfortable place. Living room is comfortable, great kitchen, and nice location. Really enjoyed our stay."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My stay at Ainsley's cottage was exactly what I needed and more! Incredibly peaceful and the house is all newly renovated and even more beautiful than the pictures. Great for a retreat into nature and solitude, we loved our stay and would recommend!"

2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Thank you
2024-01-01,3,Stayed over a week,"utensils and selection of cooking pots and pans, etc look like they are from a garage salel. The couch is old and nasty. Can‚Äôt get any local news. 1 tv ,no washer, dryer, tiny shower. That is all good if you pay half. Again, he was attentive, maybe in summer it‚Äôs nice. It didn‚Äôt work for us. Did not feel like home. First time using Airbnb. Live and learn"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed about a week,The house was very beautiful my wife and I enjoyed our stay. Everything was super clean and warm
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,Nice place
2023-11-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Place was nice and clean.. fairly decent size for 4 people.. the area is a little questionable but overall is good if you don‚Äôt play on staying at the Airbnb a lot
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Would love to stay here in the summer to hang out in the yard.
Ainsley has clear instructions for house entry and how to find the house. Very accommodating and responsive.
The house is clean and neat. Amenities were accurate and lots of coffee :)
Lots of hiking trails close by and Gloversville has all the stores you need.. best of both worlds!!"
2023-10-01,3,Stayed one night,Cute place in the Adirondacks. Was a bit difficult finding it in the dark. Overall stay was good.

2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"His day was very exceptional, and a very good secluded neighborhood, very relaxing and serene, and I loved it"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"The cabin was clean and worth the money paid. However, the area surrounding the cabin was very unkept; abandoned buildings. It was about 6 miles from Caroga Lake, which is all private deeded beaches where the public can not walk. A local person told us to go to Pine Lake, and that was absolutely beautiful.
Nick Stoner restaurant nearby was the highlight of our stay."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was our second stay at Ainsley's place . A cozy modern cabin with privacy on a quiet road in the Adirondack Park. Super clean with all the modern ameninities including wifi , Smart TV and walk in shower. Nice size backyard and patio for a campfire if wanted. Comfortable beds , a loft and spacious easy in easy out parking. Ainsley is a great communicator and always available if anything is needed. We would highly recommend Ainsley's place for a quick stay or an extended one ."

2023-09-01,4,Stayed one night,Was great very affordable and well kept
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"Very cute little place in the woods. Large loft with room for air mattresses if you have friends with you that share space but not beds. Nice firepit area, we were afraid we wouldn't be able to use it late but the neighbors were out using theirs so we felt super comfortable doing so. If you're planning to do this, pick up firewood in town on your way in. This was a wonderful place to stay after a show at SPSC."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We enjoyed our brief stay even though it was only for one night! Very quiet, crisp, cool evening with the windows open made for a great night‚Äôs sleep. Thank you."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great place, excellent host."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,A very beautiful and serene place to stay! The home was very clean and well kept.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,Great cottage in a private setting . Ainsley the host did a fantastic job with the decor making it modern yet cozy and inviting. Always responsive and was gracious enough to allow a early check in. Awesome host and awesome accomodations. Highly recommended.
2023-08-01,3,Stayed one night,"The first positive thing I can say is that the cottage is convenient to Gloversville.
The numbers on the mailbox are reflective, not illuminated. Reflective is fine, but it helps to know what you're looking for. The red arrow pointing down the driveway is no longer on a tree.
The step up to the front door is a non-standard height. The second positive thing I can say is that there is a motion-activated light over the front entrance.
The uneven floors are hazardous.
The lighting is harsh. Some lamps with softer lighting would provide a welcome alternative to the overhead lighting. One bedroom does not have a reading lamp beside the bed.
More positives: the cottage was very clean, and the bed I slept in was comfortable. The rate was very reasonable, and it can be rented for just one night."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Nice cottage, everything you need is available. A bit remote, but I immediately introduced me to the neighbors. Jack in particular was very nice."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"Quiet cottage, nicely equipped."

A very nice house in a beautiful environment. The house has everything you need. The garden is awesome and you can sit outside with enough privacy.
The house has everything you need.
A pity we had only two nights. We really would have liked to stay longer. Still much to discover."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I had a great time at Ainsley‚Äôs place, it was very clean and had everything we needed for a nice getaway."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We had a great stay that's for sure in the middle of nowhere but close enough for me to get to the things I needed too. Also would recommend a grill of some sort so we could spend more time outdoors. Brought grill able items and had to cook them in the kitchen with the smoke alarms going off. Other then the headache it was a perfect stay definitely would do it again that's for sure.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,Nice place to stay in the area. Made it very easy to settle right in and begin our trip.
2023-07-01,4,Stayed one night,"Nice lodging complete with 2 bedrooms and large loft area.

2023-05-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"The house was clean, host was responsive, and the patio would be nice for a fire. Unfortunately, beds were stiff and I‚Äôd recommend bringing your own towels if you need more than one. Overall good experience."

2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"A cozy place that feel like home, have very basic amenities like one kitchen towel, no chef knife, no lighter for the fire pit. The surrounding area were a eye sore. Very small TV and the kitchen stools were very uncomfortable, we make do and had a wonderful weekend."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We enjoyed our stay very much! 10/10 would visit again üòÅ
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Ainsley's place was exactly what it said it would be: a peaceful cabin away from everything. The way in is clearly under development at the moment, but once you get inside and go out the back door, you stop thinking about all of that.
Great place for a weekday getaway."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,A lovely little house tucked away in the woods. Couldn't recommend it more.

2023-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Huge snow storms during our stay and whenever we had an issue getting out of the driveway, Ainsley would send someone out to snowblow - she was extremely responsive and helpful; the property was very clean and cozy, loved coming back to it every night!"

2023-01-01,5,Stayed one night,House is super clean with full of utensils that you can find in your home. It would be very nice if there was hair blower. It seem like it was heating or ac sound that stop briefly and make a small noise during whole night. I can't figure out actually what was it.
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very affordable and nice play to stay
2023-01-01,4,Stayed one night,"Overall a nice place, very roomy, had everything we needed!"

2023-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,Nice place!
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a great stay at Mountain Lake. The space was clean and comfortable. Host was helpful and responsive. The location gave easy access to Gloversville and Johnstown as well as the spectacular Southern Adirondacks. The nature trains are amazing for snowshoeing, Royal Mountain is fun for alpine skiing, and Lapland Lake is fabulous for Nordic skiing."
2022-12-01,4,Stayed one night,This place has good value for the price.
2022-12-01,2,Stayed a few nights,what.

2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Perfect accommodations for girls‚Äô weekend escape to the woods. The cabin is modern and WiFi friendly, w/ great temperature control on a snowy weekend. Host Ainsley was quick to respond and provided a full kitchen w/ bonus coffee pods. We brought water so didn‚Äôt have any worries . The cabin was clean and had a great second floor for games , yoga or just as a second space to relax. Great spot to get some time in the woods and explore. We wish there were a couple of hand towels and at least one more bath towel for # of guests but otherwise , you have all you need here.for a great and relaxing stay. Even has all the streaming apps if you feel like cozying in . Highly recommend!"
2022-11-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Overall a solid little two bedroom space. I do wish there were more blankets available so if you want a couch blanket I recommend bringing one, but the heat did work well so wasn‚Äôt too cold at night, just while in the living room. The sulfur in the water was a big problem for me and my friend, but I did mention it to the host so hopefully it will be resolved soon. Check in was easy, communication was good, and overall it was a great little place for a weekend getaway."
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Ainsley's place is super clean and cozy for a few nights away from the city. Close to hiking plenty of hiking trails and lakes.
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Ainsley was a great host, and her Cottage in the Woods was beautiful. Everything was exactly as described and the place was super clean."
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Neat little place!
2022-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"Nicely updated airbnb with a kitchen stocked for basic cooking needs. Cozy living room, very small tv but not quite ‚ÄúiPad size‚Äù as a previous review mentioned. We didn‚Äôt use it but there‚Äôs a nice patio and fire pit out back, well lit area.
The surrounding abandoned houses and campers made us a little uneasy. Our stay was enjoyable though and I‚Äôd recommend checking it out if you‚Äôre looking for an affordable and comfortable place to stay. It‚Äôs perfectly nestled into the Adirondacks but still close enough to stores/restaurants/hiking areas."
2022-10-01,5,Stayed one night,had everything we needed and more! was a great stay and would come back again!
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Ainsley‚Äôs place was PERFECT for our family. Cute and comfortable. Close enough to town for stores, restaurants and more, yet far out enough to be secluded!
Fire pit was great for s‚Äômores with kids, my ‚Äúgamer‚Äù kid said it has better Wi-Fi than we have in our city üòÇ, no worries on sulphuric water, no one in my party cared. We watched comedians on Netflix, walked the property and the road. Beautiful foliage and great nights sleep. I highly recommend Ainsley‚Äôs home for anyone needing to be in Gloversville or Johnstown for any reason. BTW coffee on the patio in the morning is magical this time of year. A tie dye of gorgeous leaves, birds singing (if you‚Äôre into that lol) and a mountain smell to die for. Thank you, Ainsley!"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Suoer clean home. GREAT communication. Quiet, out of the way location. We appreciated having fire wood there so we didn't have to find somewhere to buy it. Check in was simple and directions were clear. The bed were very comfy."
2022-10-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Nice cabin, very quiet area. Exactly as the description says. The tap water smelt a bit sulphuric‚Ä¶"
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great communication with host.. accommodating and clean !
2022-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"The cottage was a perfect place to setup a quick base camp to plan a couple days of adventure. The place was clean and the water was hot. I only stayed 1 night, but wish I had stayed more. Can't say much only being there for a short time, but it was worth it. Communication with the host was quick and easy."
2022-08-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Nice updated house in a central location of things to do. Communication with Ainsley was perfect.
2022-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"A clean and affordable place to stay! Not much to do in Gloversville area, but close enough to enough of the Adirondacks that it might not be a bad base camp. However, the water does smell like sulfur so just be prepared! (Apparently that is the case for most homes in the area)"
2022-08-01,5,Stayed one night,Perfect place to stay for a wedding of our friends!
2022-08-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"The place was very nice. The appliances where all new and the house stayed pretty cool once you got the A/C unit running. The hot water was a new experience due to the sulfur in the water, but I talked to some friends in the area that told me it's normal for that area and harmless. The cold water was filtered and didn't have any smell to it."
2022-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"Cute cabin in a lovely area, wish I could have stayed longer."
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Very well equipped little house. Comfort surrounded by nature.
Very isolated, unfortunately the neighbor had to be abandoned the place.
Path with stones , be careful but feasible.
Close to Saratoga and lakes to enjoy the area."
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place! Responsive host! Sulfur water caused us to eat out and not shower.
2022-07-01,5,Stayed one night,Great place to stay off the beaten path!
2022-07-01,5,Stayed one night,Ainsley was very helpful if I had questions. Overall great stay and would recommend to people.
2022-07-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Great quiet place, very clean and has a great kitchen. We had a very nice time (regardless of the heat wave that made the house a little warmer than we are used to). Take note that the water is sulfurous which might be an issue for some people. We very much enjoyed the backyard which is quiet and wooded and we had the chance to be visited twice by a deer and had a little frog/toad visit us while we were stargazing during our stay which we will remember for a long time ^^"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great little cottage. Clean and well cared for. I was just passing through and it was perfect for a one night stop. My only complaint would be location, as the very close local neighbors left a bit to be desired."
2022-07-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Very clean place out in the country. Beautiful woods surround the property and it is very quiet. Get place to stay if you are looking to be out in that area. Only had one issue with check-in as Ainsley gave me the wrong code to get in at first. The house has a great kitchen! One draw back is the water does have a strong sulfur smell to it. The rooms are very nice, the beds are on the smaller side(not queen size). It was a good place for me to stay and I would go back despite my few knocks about it."
2022-07-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Ainsley‚Äôs cottage in the woods was exactly as it is described. We were further away than we wanted to be from Saratoga, but the accommodations were welcoming. The beds are full size and with not much to the mattress.. The only major issue we had was with the pungent sulfur smell when the water was used i.e showers, dishwasher, brushing teeth, etc‚Ä¶"
2022-07-01,4,Stayed with kids,Nice cottage with updates.
2022-06-01,5,Stayed one night,Seriously awesome place and a great value! Beautiful area and the cottage has all the amenities you would want and more. Ainsley was very accommodating and even let me check in early. Highly recommended !
2022-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Was a very relaxing place to unwind! The location is very quiet, back yard is amazing , all woods ! Went for a walk around the lake , it has everything you need for the stay !"
2022-06-01,4,Stayed one night,"The house is newly renovated with a spacious kitchen. The area is extremely quiet and peaceful, with plenty of outdoor space. It's down a rocky dirt road, but is accessible with careful navigation (just be aware if you have a small car). Code-lock check in was convenient so we could arrive any time.
*Migraine trigger warning: note that all lighting is fluorescent."
2022-06-01,4,Stayed with kids,Very nice cabin and great communication all at a good price
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Photos are very accurate of the inside. Definitely watch out for ants etc in the kitchen but otherwise the place was as advertised. Fan was loud, as others have noted, but it‚Äôs like background white noise. Ainsley was quick to respond to all messages and very professional."
2022-05-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Great small cottage!!
2022-05-01,4,Stayed one night,super cozy and cute inside tv was a bit small but not bad house was stocked and clean the surrounding area wasn‚Äôt the best but it was very quiet and peaceful :)
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We enjoyed our stay at this relaxing and well-kept cabin! The area was quiet and the backyard patio offered a great view of the woods. A friendly host and overall worth-while experience. We found some local hiking trails to keep us busy during the day and plenty of places to dine out at night.
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very clean and well equipped cabin. It was a quiet and very comfortable place to spend a few days.
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Thanks. We were happy in your Adirondack place. It is a nice little cabin in a lakeside community. The full size appliances were great. Water was not high sulfur, as I read. We were very comfortable with the beds, 27 inch tv, wifi, etc. Only issue was the driveway that really needs built- up due to the mountain rocks and run-off, but we knew how to drive such areas. It was close enough to our daughters place in Broadalbin. Thank you"
2022-05-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"If you really want to disconnect from things, this is a decent place to be. However, a few things before you book. The interior is very nice and well kept. The tv is the size of a tablet so that wasnt enjoyable. The water coming from the faucet smells pretty bad (sulfur). The town is very much a run down town. Lots of houses in bad shape, etc. Food in town is mediocre and costly for no reason. The surroundings of the rental is very ugly. You have a trailer home on one side in bad condition (eye sore) the so called ""pond"" in description is on another private drive across the way with another half way constructed structure. There are also 2 ""homes"" right across the front yard of rental in terrible conditions, possibly half way through a construction and stopped. Basically, all surroundings were awful. The rental is cozy and quiet. Besides that if youre looking to be active and do things i would do your research. There wasnt much to do here."
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The place was lovely, at first we were a little nervous driving to get there because we didn't see much diversity. But it was so worth it very beautiful, quite literally everywhere even the stores . Just amazing"
2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"beautiful place, perfect for a quick getaway"

2022-04-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Nice place to stay during the weekend
2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,My boyfriend and I took a weekend trip to Ainsley‚Äôs cabin for my birthday. The location was perfect for every thing we needed. The cabin itself was both cozy and stylish. Ainsley was responsive and quick to help. Would definitely stay here again! üòä
2022-04-01,5,Stayed one night,great place to stay and very clean and modern and spacious quiet and relaxing enjoyed our stay very much
2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Clean and private. The mattresses were a little small but comfortable. Modern amenities. 20 minutes from the Adirondack mountains. Excellent value and I would gladly return.

2022-03-01,5,Stayed one night,Ainsley‚Äôs cottage is beautiful and in a great location. Perfect for unwinding. The cottage was clean and had everything I needed. Would definitely visit again!
2022-02-01,2,Stayed one night,The home was very quiet and a very clean upon arriving there was ice all over the entryway the home was cold when I first arrived being that it‚Äôs the dead of the winter the heat should be set at a minimum of 68 especially if somebody is renting upon entry I turned up the furnace and it made such a horrible noise it sounded like I was at an airport in jet engines were above my head in order to keep the home warm the furnace needed to stay on it made such a horrible noise the bedroom is right next to the furnace room it kept me up all night long so if you rent this place bring your earplugs
2022-02-01,5,Stayed one night,Great place
2022-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This was a great space to hang out and relax in between skiing/winter excursions!
2022-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is a fabulous place for a retreat. Ainsley was communicative and the lockbox entry was a breeze. It's quiet, the kitchen has everything you need, and it's close to lots of outdoor recreation while not being too far from town. Loved it!"
2022-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"You won‚Äôt regret staying here, a nice cozy cottage in the woods with modern appliances and adjustable ac/heat. The house comes equipped with anything you may need (board games, pots and pans, towels, chairs, etc.) and the couch and beds were comfy. The TV was a bit quiet and small but it worked and had access to any streaming service you wanted. Great communication with the host and I really want to come back already!"
2022-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Inside the Adirondack park, if you love nature or are looking for a quiet, private and scheduled place to stay this is your place. It‚Äôs still close to grocery stores and some restaurants. Ainsley was a great host and I really enjoyed my stay while working remotely. I recommend it!"
2022-01-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Great value and as described! Very clean cottage with a wonderful location. Ainsley is very responsive and a super host! The heater was a little loud/squeaky, and the TV volume sounded pretty bad, but otherwise - great stay! Highly recommend!"

2021-12-01,4,Stayed with kids,"Ainsley place is really cute, provided the white Christmas experience for my kids.
The cottage is a definition of simplicity and style , very neat and clean.
My only regrets was not having any experience with snow
Ainsley communicates well and professional. i will definitely recommend this house.

2021-12-01,5,Stayed one night,The cottage is a perfect little get-away. Everything was perfect and the photos provided in the Airbnb website are exactly what it was like in real-life. The whole cottage was very clean and orderly. Great value and great secluded location.
2021-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Ainsley communication through our process was so professional. The cabin was clean and beautiful.
2021-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"Ainsley's cabin is in a great location. Secluded but easily accessible and not far from the main roads. The appliances and design of the cabin are surprisingly modern and well thought out, so if you're looking for something akin to a glamping experience this is the kind of place for you! It has great internet, very high tech kitchen appliances, a nice bathroom, all while being deep in the woods and surrounded by nature."
2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Had a great time visiting the area. Place is clean, secluded, cozy. Excellent view of the sky on a clear night. Would recommend."

Were gracious hosts and did everything to make our brief stay pleasant and enjoyable . We would gladly stay at their place again . The instructions were clear and the place was very nice . We have no complaints whatsoever and are happy to recommend these accommodations.
Thanks for the stay.
Dale & Christine"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,Very cozy. We are firm bed people and found the bed very comfortable. After a long day driving we slept really good there. The kitchen had everything we needed to make meals. The shower was nice. It was quiet. We were only there one night - just there to sleep one night on a roadtrip - but we felt comfortable. Jeff was quick to respond and accommodating.
2024-06-01,4,Stayed one night,"great place! quite and peaceful.
only thing is owners live on the otherside, so if you want privacy then not the place, however it was great for what we needed. owner didnt bother us at all. we were in town to see family so we only slept at the airbnb."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,loved this airbnb. plan on returning. all good.
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I can't thank Jeff and Dawn enough for opening up their gorgeous home to us. From booking to departure, they were engaged and on-top of everything! The home is clean, comfortable, and welcoming. All necessities are neatly labeled and easy to locate. Jeff periodically checked in to ensure we didn't need anything, he truly wanted us to feel at home. Thank you again for our stay, we will absolutely be booking again!"
2024-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful place with lots of attention to details. very clean and cozy. Jeff & Dawn are absolutely fantastic..very responsive and their warmth can be felt all over the house. Will be back again!
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,Great place to stay
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Cute little stay not to far off the 90. Comfy bed, nice kitchen, great living space, and having a large load washer and dryer was a godsend after a long trip on the way back east. Definitely a safe, clean and comfortable place to stay if you need to stop along the way. Only down side is a pack of available food options near by, so bring food with you if you plan to stay and don‚Äôt want to venture back out. Definitely worth what we paid though."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"This was our 5-6th stay on our annual trek from Cleveland to Boston.
Everything is always perfect. The place was ready early tho we arrived later than we expected. Stopped for ice cream at Summers best soft ice cream with great rich flavors like lemon and Oreo and black raspberry and chocolate peanut butter. We then ate at Partners Pub again delicious.

We always return!!"

2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is a great rental if you like off the beaten path, although very easy to get to. It is located in an agricultural area with alot of Amish presence.
When a snow squall occured overnight, our hosts even went as far as to sweep the snow from our porch and car as we were not prepared.
The rental is equipped with basic pantry food prep items, extra toiletries, blankets and numerous other items.
Very well appointed."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This was my second stay here, while visiting family in the area. A beautiful and peaceful home base with all the amenities you need. I love that I can do a load of laundry and take home clean clothes! The Netflix and wifi are great. Love seeing the horses and just adore this sweet, very clean guest house."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"Jeff is a wonderful host, very responsive, thoughtful, and the place is very spacious, clean, organized and comfortable. The bed is excellent. The surroundings are peaceful, lovely. I recommend driving in daylight to witness magnificent views of some of the most beautiful farmland upstate New York. There are fields of actual haystacks, right out of a Van Gogh painting, so catch it in morning or late afternoon light. Thoroughly enjoyed the experience."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,My family and I really enjoyed our stay. It was more spacious than we expected! We loved the neighborhood and loooved the farm animals out back. The space was very clean and felt very homey. It was a perfect short getaway from our busy day to day lives. Thank you Jeff!

2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"It‚Äôs was a beautiful weekend away for our first anniversary. The home was beautiful and set up very nicely for our getaway stay. We were easily able to cook our own meals, relax watching football while visiting the area."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"Jeff and Dawn's place was great! Beautiful location not overly far from the N.Y. Thruway but a world away among Mennonite farms, pine trees and country air. The place is well laid out with an equipped kitchen where we cooked our dinner. I appreciate that they compost and have a well thought out recycling system. Communication with them was always great. The bed was very comfortable and there were nice little touches like USB chargers on both sides of the bed. We'll be back."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Excellent place. I would highly recommend. Jeff‚Äôs house was very clean, spacious, and felt right at home. Jeff provided clear instructions and everything in the house was easy to find. Beautiful location as well."

A spacious apartment with lots of room to relax. The owners clearly put time and energy into running this gem of an air bnb."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We have stayed many times at Starhaven and the owners are very kind. Kind to the environment, kind to animals, kind to us. They care and their cottage is our very favorite respite between Boston and Cleveland multiple times a year. This trip we saw a local play at the Little Colonial Theater and it was beyond excellent. We also rode the trails on e-bike like quad near Cooperstown thru the woods. We worked remote as well and used the fully equipped kitchen. Everything is always perfect for us. Thanks Jeff and Dawn."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"quiet, clean and spacious and in a lovely location. Bed was very comfortable and the kitchen is nicely set up so you have everything you need to cook your own meals. I'll definitely stay at this location again when I am in the area again for work!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"A friend and I enjoyed our stay at this magical location! Starhaven Guest House was amazing and even better than the pictures! So spacious, peaceful, clean, private, and relaxing. Jeff was an awesome host, helpful from point of booking until departure! He met us on our arrival, was very friendly and welcomed us with warmth as he showed us where things were and made sure all our questions were answered.
Obviously, lots of thought was put into furnishing the guest house; it was very warm and comfortable and fully equipped. Since we brought food to cook our meals while there, the setting was ideal with a well-equipped kitchen, enormous fridge and a large gas stove that works beautifully! The house was stocked with everything you could need.
My friend and I were thrilled with the ambiance, comfortable furniture and privacy offered in this spacious guest house that provided us with an all-around spectacular stay! Not one complaint! Not one!!! Thank you, Jeff."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"I was in the area for work and needed a place to stay for one night. It was lovely to arrive after a long day and unwind at Jeff's charming guest house. I had tons of space and was able to get work done comfortably (big table, fast wifi) before relaxing on the comfy couch for a bit. I slept like a baby in the big bed and had a great shower in the immaculate bathroom before enjoying a cup of (provided) coffee and heading back out to work. Worth noting: the eco-consciousness in the kitchen was commendable. I love that there were separate bins for different types of recycling, waste, and even composting. The instructions were easy to follow, so I knew where each thing should go. Bravo! I had a great experience and would not hesitate to rebook."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,This place is incredible. It exceeded our expectations in every way. Squeaky clean even in the nooks and crannies. The bed was so comfortable I didn't want to get up. Also how amazing is it to find a king bed ? Gorgeous decorations. Kitchen well stocked with everything you might need to prepare a meal and a dream to cook in. The surroundings are so beautiful and peaceful. I didn't want to leave and wished I was staying longer than one night.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We were pleasantly surprised with this air bnb. Most important to me is that it was very clean! It had all the comforts of home, very private , but the hosts were close by if needed. Nice property too!"

2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We enjoyed the peaceful country setting and the comfortable furnishings that made you feel at home. Jeffwas there to greet us and introduce us to the cottage layout and where to find anything we needed. The kitchen had all necessities for cooking, the living area had comfortable couches and rockers, the king size bed made for a restful sleep and there was a nice front porch if you wanted to sit outside. It was as the photos and listing described. The wifi was reliable., the waher and dryer a big plus on our long road trip.. The location worked well for us two elders, as we prefer peaceful country settings and it was close enough to drive to the trailheads of bike trails in the area we wanted to ride on. You can expect to encounter Amish traveling by horse and buggy on area roads, so drive carefully. This was a very clean and welcoming place with congenial hosts and a peaceful country setting, but close enough to towns for shopping and sightseeing."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,Excellent experience. Well worth it. Great location with lots to do. Thanks Jeff!
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,My partner and I stayed for one night since we were watching a show at Ommegang.

2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We absolutely loved our visit. Very peaceful and quite location, but still close to the interstate and local community. Great spot for a short-overnight while making a long multi-state trip. The guest house is just beautiful with stunning woodwork and furniture. We arrived during some severe weather and Jeff was very proactive with communicating updates while we were traveling and getting close to arrival. He checked-in multiple times and showed genuine concern for both our safety and comfort while staying. Would absolutely stay again and highly recommend."

2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"I can‚Äôt say enough about how extremely happy we were with this rental. We arrived around 5:30 P.M. after visiting the Baseball Hall of Fame in Cooperstown. Jeff came out to welcome us and introduce himself. He then took the time to show us around, making sure we felt completely comfortable. They have stocked up on everything you could possibly need in order to enjoy your stay whether one night or a week.

The home itself is cozy, well-furnished and very clean. We loved the rustic looking furniture and electric fireplace! The backyard is huge and green, and next time we will definitely try and meet the animals on the property.
The king bed was super comfortable and big enough to accommodate my husband, myself and two small kids. We appreciated the extra linens, flexible check-in and easy, clear communication with Jeff. Next time we also want to take advantage of the front porch and grill!
If you're staying in the area, this cozy spot in Fort Plain is a beautiful, peaceful place to relax and enjoy."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,It was very easy to work with Jeff. The place was really clean and well provisioned.
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Wonderful place to stay that was secluded and quiet. Comfortable furniture and bed. Nicely decorated.

2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"After a 6 hour drive, Starhaven was exactly what the doctor ordered: beautiful/quiet location (with horses and sheep), clean/spacious ""apartment"" with extremely comfortable bed, fully equipped kitchen and great internet service. There is even a Beatle ""puzzle"" for big fans like us! Jeff responded to our emails quickly, gave us a tour upon arrival and checked in to see how we were doing in the morning. Only problem was that we could only stay for one night so we'll be returning ASAP! Thanks for everything, Jeff!"

2023-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"Jeff's guest house is warm and welcoming with it's log cabin theme interior. The house is immaculate. Bed is comfortable. Although the house is attached to the main house, there is complete privacy. The outdoor back yard has a tree swing and near the house are horses and sheep.
A family could stay comfortably for a long period of time.
When we stayed, the temperature dropped quite a bit and we got ice on the care window. We didn't have a scraper so Jeff did it for us."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"My husband and I loved our stay at Jeff‚Äôs Airbnb. This Airbnb is spectacular, and is even better than the pictures. It is warm, inviting, and is furnished and decorated so beautifully. It‚Äôs roomy and has everything you would need, including a washer and dryer. Everything was very clean as well. It‚Äôs in a safe, more rural neighborhood, and there is off-street parking right in front of the entrance to the cottage, so it was very easy to carry everything in. The property is really gorgeous, and I only wish we would‚Äôve had more time to hike around a little bit. It snowed quite a bit when we were there, and it was like a winter wonderland outside, with the cozy fireplace inside. I liked that Jeff and Dawn were nearby in the main house in case we needed anything , but we also had the privacy of our own cottage. Jeff was very helpful in showing us around when we arrived and telling us the history of the cottage as well. If you need an Airbnb in this area, you just can‚Äôt do better than this!!"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed one night,We had an amazing stay @ this Air Bnb. Everything was perfect and we especially enjoyed seeing the horses and sheep in the backyard when we woke up! Thank you to these awesome hosts!
2023-03-01,5,Stayed one night,We had to cancel due to inclement weather and Jeff graciously extended a partial refund.
2023-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Stayed when my family and I visited town for a family birthday party. Was close by to where we needed to be and was quiet, clean and family friendly. We will be staying again!"
2023-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"Beautifully appointed, well-equipped private guest wing next to main house. Easy to find, convenient access, and pristine condition of the quarters. Very spacious LR, DR, BR, kitchen, and full bath. Just bring your toothbrush and personal items -- everything else is provided. Friendly, outgoing host who is conveniently available if you have any questions."
2023-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"Jeff's place was amaaaaazing.
compared to the other options, this was outstanding for the area (hard to find thing around). I stayed on my road trip through they were so communicative about getting off work and rushing to clean the space and make sure it was ready - very kind of them.
Jeff tried to make everything as great as possible and even showed me around and greeted me once there and salted/sanded where I'd walk/park.
He even brushed the snow off my vehicle the next morning!
Just very above and beyond, kind and enjoyable family with adorable horses you can see first thing in the morning from the back and bathroom :).
Everything was so clean and EVERYTHING was thought of and there.
I have marked this as a stop when I go through from now on."
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Second time at Jeff's place. It was as great as the first time. I will return again if I'm back working in the area and it's available. If it appears to meet your needs, it's a great place to stay and Jeff is a great, accommodating host!"
2023-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"great to communicate with and a very beautiful setup, I would highly recommend"
2023-01-01,5,Stayed one night,Thank you Jeff for the beautiful Airbnb!
2023-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,We had a very nice three nights at Starhaven! Everything matched the listing and Jeff stopped in shortly after we arrived to check in. We were in the area to visit family and the location was convenient and served as the perfect home base for our busy visit. Our daughter especially loved Jeff and Dawn‚Äôs sheep and horses that we were able to visit on the property. We would stay here again and recommend it to others!
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Jeff, the Host, was extremely courteous, helpful and polite. The property and guesthouse were immaculately clean, the bedding and linens fresh and cozy. There was everything and more that was in the description online, even cozy new sheepskin slippers! There were lovely paths through Amish cornfields to hike nearby.
Jeff went out of his way to mail me an item I forgot and went to check multiple times for other items.
I had an excellent restful stay."
2022-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We had a great stay at Starhaven over the holidays, visiting family in the surrounding area. Jeff's place is very clean, spacious for 3 people including a 5 year old, and we loved walking on the trails and saying hi to the horses and sheep. The area is very rural and beautiful...no traffic and lots of Amish! Great for long country walks. The internet connection was great. Starhaven is the perfect mix of clean, homey and comfortable. Bed is comfy and we also used the pull out couch. We did a good amount of cooking and found all the pots and pans that we needed. Highly recommend!"
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My daughter and I stayed at Jeff's cabin while she interviewed as a potential DVM at a local veterinary clinic. I worked remotely, and the Wi-Fi worked perfectly. The cabin is clean and homey, bed is comfortable and there are plenty of Keurig coffees. Even though the cabin is attached to their house, I felt we were in a private separate home. Jeff was very communicative. He let us know as we were driving there that they got an unexpected amount of snow and that the last few miles to the house would be on unplowed roads. Yep...he was right. But the driveway was plowed and the steps to the house cleared. If I'm ever in the area again, I would gladly stay at this lovely cottage."
2022-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"I really recommend jeff and dawns place if you‚Äôre looking for a peaceful, clean space. Their horses on the property are so cute and friendly. There‚Äôs not much really close by but you can find lots to do just 15-20 minutes away. Check in was very easy and the hosts were very responsive."

2022-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"My husband and I stayed with Jeff for our anniversary getaway this past weekend and it was AMAZING. They really take pride in their Air B&B. A beautiful home with all of the essentials included. Coffee with all the fixings for the morning, plenty of fresh towels and wash rags, extra blankets, clean atmosphere, and a beautiful fully stocked (with all the utensils and cooking pots) you could possibly need. Their communication was amazing, and they really made us feel like we were home! We will be back when we have more time to explore the area! Would highly recommend this B&B."

2022-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"If yall are around this area, stay at Jeff‚Äôs place! The 40 min drive to and from Cooperstown wasn‚Äôt even a big deal because the scenery was amazing! The house was clean, comfortable, and had everything we needed! They left detailed instructions for the house that were super easy to follow,. The check in process was as smooth as it could get. You will not regret staying here! If we ever return to this area, this is where I would stay again. No questions asked! Bravo, Jeff and family!!"
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Starhaven is a wonderful place to stay. It's very comfortable and homey. So comfortable, in fact, that it's a good idea to set an alarm or else there's the possibility of sleeping too long in the morning. It's Immaculate and the hosts are very attuned to providing an excellent airbnb experience. Really top-flight!"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Please don‚Äôt hesitate to book this stay, it is worth it! My wife and I had an amazing time here. The location was as described and clean, just be mindful if you are traveling in the dark you might miss the sign to the entrance. The location is secluded enough to unplug. The interior is well decorated and quaint, with an electric fireplace. Jeff, the host is very kind and knowledgeable about things to do in the area and welcomed us when we arrived."
2022-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"Our stay was perfect, other than the dreary weather which is beyond the owners‚Äôs control. Highly recommend for anyone seeking an accommodation in the Mohawk Valley / Southern Adirondacks."
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Perfect place! Clean, spacious and the owners are very kind!"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Sunlit, spacious, super quiet and our 3rd or 4th stay!!! The main road just outside Starhaven AirBnB is GORGEOUS in the fall--a sky high tree lined drive!!! We ate at Partner's Pub about 15 min away---homemade food and the manager came over to every table to thank us for coming by. Jeff, the owner of the Airbnb, came by to make sure internet was ok--it was excellent. We are already planning to return in the spring."
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We really enjoyed staying at Jeff‚Äôs place! It is a very spacious, quiet place in the country. The king sized bed was extremely comfortable! Jeff greeted us when we arrived and told us the basics of what we needed to know about his place and gave us suggestions for things to do in the area. Jeff‚Äôs place is reasonably priced and worth every penny. We would definitely stay here again if we are in the area."

2022-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"This is my return visit and while I'm in the area for work, this is where I'll stay!!"
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"II am delighted to write a review of our stay at Jeff‚Äôs Starhaven. My husband and I happily stayed there on September 16 and 17, 2022. We only wished it could have been longer.
If Starhaven were located anywhere else, it would be remarkable. Here in Fort Plain, it is amazingly and unexpectedly OUTSTANDING.
Jeff certainly deserves the title of Superhost. He is a lovely person, and made himself available at check-in to walk us through the house. Jeff showed us how everything worked and where everything was. And in this case, ‚Äúeverything ‚Äú consisted of a great deal! Guests could easily stay here for a few weeks and need nothing except fresh food. Jeff and his wife ( who was not available that weekend) have thought of everything a guest might need ‚Äî and provided it. The house was not only extremely clean, it was Covid sanitized, while retaining a warm, comfortable feeling throughout.
I really think that the AirBnB description of Starhaven and its surroundings was the first I have found to be understated. It surpassed our hopes.
The only suggested addition we would make involves the Starhaven sign at the beginning of the driveway. We would have liked a brighter, larger, light over the sign, or perhaps on the ground . This would serve to alert the driver that the turn into the driveway was coming up. This would be especially appreciated in the evening, as there are no street lights.
My husband and I highly recommend Starhaven. You won‚Äôt regret booking a stay!!"
2022-09-01,5,Stayed one night,Great place!
2022-09-01,5,Stayed one night,We had a wonderful stay at Jeff's place - he even gave us good birding advice!

2022-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Starhaven was perfect - the space was beautiful, very clean, and serene. Communication was fast, easy, and clear. Jeff was a fantastic host who greeted us, kindly gave us a tour, and was very helpful.
The sky was dark; the surroundings quiet; the bed, incredibly comfortable. And, delightfully, there was composting and recycling. We also appreciated that there were no scented candles no air fresheners, as well as no lingering scents from cleaning agents they may have used.
One of the very best AirBnb experiences! Looking forward to staying there again in the future."
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Starhaven was the perfect place to unwind. We were visitng family and since there are no hotels in the area, this was an amazing find. It is off the beaten path, but close enough to be able to sightsee and get around. The amenities were great and it had anything you could want. The bed was extremely comfortable, the kitchen well appointed, good wifi and an array of tv stations."
2022-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"great place.very big,clean and peaceful.

2022-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"Almost new (2017), clean, good-sized, well-maintained apartment, great kitchen, comfortable bed--and nice cool central AC was sure handy for the heat wave during our stay. Great quality for the price! Jeff was reliable with communication, answering any questions we had very quickly. We were only there for one night but the place was so sweet we wished we could have stayed a little longer. It's a bit out of the way (there's not much to the town of Fort Plain so you will be traveling to get to restaurants, entertainment, etc.) but once you are there you will be comfy and happy. Say hello to the horses and sheep out back for me. :)"

2022-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"Beautiful place - super clean, lots of nice details, lovely location, super communication. We used the sofa bed pull out - the mattress is excellent, very comfortable, we slept like logs on it - it felt like a regular mattress - everyone agreed on that! Very interesting surroundings, close to Saratoga National Park. Jeff had a thorough book of information and brochures that were helpful - great dining recommendations too. The local ice cream shop makes homemade ice cream - and it was delicious!!! We will return when we come this way again."

2022-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"What an oasis. This home is in the Amish country surrounded by farmland. it is a perfect place to get away from it all and yet is close enough to neighboring towns like Cooperstown to be convenient.

2022-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Jeff was a great communicator, and had experience with guests cycling the Empire Trail including some local knowledge on the best route up to his place. The unit was beautifully clean, and the property was absolutely wonderful. Being tucked away in the woods in a huge cabin was a real contrast to so many sad small hotel rooms or Airbnbs I've stayed in."
2022-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"This place is like heaven on earth! It‚Äôs peaceful and relaxing and shows another side of New York. The place was very clean and had everything we needed and more.

2022-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"We spent a night at this wonderful place while cycling the Erie Canalway trail. It was a little out of the way but Jeff offered to pick us up with his truck at the trail because the afternoon was stormy. We were drenched and thus appreciated the cozy warmth of the stove, and dried some clothes in the dryer. We cooked a hot meal in the kitchen and relaxed. We highly recommend Starhaven BnB!"

We are truly grateful to have had their place to stay through all of the moving chaos. They have been a shining light and a comfort for us. This is a great place to stay, I highly recommend it!"
2022-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"I was cycling the Empire Trail, Erie Canal and stayed here. this is about 5 miles off the trail and is a wonderful ride thru Amish Country. Location was easy to find, clean with a comfy bed and hot shower. I planned my meals accordingly because I did not pack food."

2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The owners, Jeff and Dawn, have created a haven--and not just of stars. There is peace and such quiet--we relaxed a couple days after a long drive from Ohio. The place is huge for 2 of us --lots of chairs/sofas/pillows/blankets and a full kitchen and large dining table in an Amish theme. Plenty of lighting/plugs everywhere--which is so important to me for reading, journaling and prepping for the next days' activities! The bed is comfy, towels luxurious and everything looks brand new--this is our 2nd stay here and we intend to keep returning. We sat on the porch this time and there is a grill there too. Out back are many bird feeders and 2 horses and a sheep. We brought our own food but there is a huge binder of info all organized, including sections on restaurants and things to do and see. Gorgeous sunset from the kitchen window above the sink!!"

2022-03-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"My two sisters and I had a lovely stay at this guesthouse in the Amish country! We really appreciated the guidebook/folder and tried out a couple of the suggested hikes. The space was even nicer than the photos and the kitchen was incredibly well-stocked for all of our cooking adventures. It was quiet, well-heated, with plenty of space for the 3 of us. It's definitely ""in the middle of nowhere"", but great for a getaway in the woods."
2022-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"This is our second stay here, and we just love it more every time!! Jeff has such a cozy and welcoming place, it is just so comfortable! The bed especially! But the living room with the fireplace is definitely a favorite spot of mine! Truly defines cozy, in my opinion! We love staying here and I absolutely recommend it!

We even left behind a personal item that they will mail home for us. Thanks for having us.

Can‚Äôt say enough good things!"

2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We needed a place to stay for a long weekend trip to go boating/fishing on Great Sacandaga Lake. So glad we found this place to stay within a short distance from the lake. It was clean and inviting. Loved the king sized bed - so comfortable! Erin was a great host.

It was a quick 20 minute drive back after a busy day of water fun at the lake and for some much needed rest. The townhouse is only about 4 minutes off route 30. It was so welcoming! Everything is fresh, new and nicely decorated. The smart TV gave us a vast assortment of viewing options. Beds were comfortable and it was so convenient to have Stewart‚Äôs right next door. Her place is pet friendly should we decide to bring our dog the next time we return to the lake."

2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"William is the perfect host with a lovely space. He communicates quickly to answer any questions or needs as they arise. The space was perfect for 4 adults to spend a couple days away, who had no interest or need to cook. The kitchenette was small, but just right for the 4 of us to sit together and enjoy our morning coffee. Our host even supplied some freshly ground coffee from beans that come from a local shop. My favorite part of the property and our visit was the gorgeous landscaping and koi pond with sitting area in the back yard. We sat each evening around the pond and enjoyed beverages and conversation. William also gave an amazing tour of the rest of the home, which is STUNNING, and gave the history of the house and it's family. We couldn't have asked for a more perfect location, host, and property for our needs! We thoroughly enjoyed ourselves!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"William's place was phenomenal. The home and gardens are very beautiful. The accommodations are everything that you can ask for including very beautiful and comfortable bedrooms, interesting and well thought out decor, and elegant bathrooms. The area is very walkable and the neighborhood is wonderful. William and Wally were very kind and generous. I highly recommend their home and Johnstown."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,A lovely home with friendly and accommodating hosts!!
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Thank you for hosting us, we had a wonderful stay."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"We absolutely loved staying at William's property. The property itself is gorgeous, beautifully maintained and cared for. The accommodations were so comfortable and all the little details (such as the little satchels of lavender on the bed posts), really made this place special.
Highly recommended!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"William was great. We only stayed one night while passing through, but the place was lovely and William was very helpful. Thanks!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,It was great but the stairs to bedroom need to be in description and emphasized. Great place to stay and great hosts
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Such a sweet place with beautiful decor, super comfy beds and quality linens. Very kind and gracious hosts."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"William‚Äôs place is just beautiful. The decorations and the ambience was like being in a different era, a real experience. The location is quiet and in a beautiful neighborhood. Bathrooms are beautiful, clean and spacious and William was quick to respond to any questions and incredibly polite."
2024-05-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"William‚Äôs place is a hidden gem. Immaculately cleaned and decorated, located in a relaxing rural neighborhood (we woke up to roosters), with Saratoga Springs just a 40 min drive away. Would highly recommend this property to family and friends (as long as they are okay with stairs as they are quite steep). Thanks for an amazing stay!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Safe and inviting neighborhood to walk around day or night time.
Great recommendations for food, activities, and a perfect location and setting to relax and unwind.
Very friendly and attentive hosts who treated us like family.
We look forward on a return visit with high recommendations to stay here again."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"I highly recommend William's place. I would absolutely stay there again, or even look for a reason to come back so I could stay again. It was stocked with everything we could need and even a lot that we wouldn't expect. The hosts were friendly and helpful, and a delight to meet, and they welcomed our Beagle like she was family. It is a beautiful and very comfortable house and the furnishings were top notch. The bed in our room was one of the most comfortable beds we have ever slept on - some type of layered memory foam that was more comfortable than our Tempur-Pedic at home. There is a set of slightly steep wooden stairs to the bedrooms that might be limiting for people with issues with stairs, but that is the only possible negative. Highly recommended!!"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed one night,A beautiful home and very gracious hosts :) perfect for a last minute Xc ski getaway
2024-01-01,5,Stayed with a pet,We had an excellent stay! The house is beautiful and easy to find. It's in a quiet neighborhood and made for an easy nights rest!

2024-03-01,5,Group trip,Chad was very friendly and responsive and I‚Äôll definitely be back in the summer to use that pool.
2024-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,"My family and I had a great stay at Chad‚Äôs place. Overall the home was spacious and comfortable. The kitchen was well stocked with appliances, cookware, plates, cups, mugs, utensils, etc. Before booking, I reached out to Chad for clarification on bed sizes in each of the rooms. He was quick to respond to this question and others that I asked, which was very appreciated! Some beds were firm and another was soft. The downstairs TV worked great but the upstairs TV was a bit too far out of range for the Wi-Fi to connect; but once I connected with a hotspot, it worked great. Both the checkin and checkout instructions were simple and easy to follow. It‚Äôd be great to stay at this home in the summer when the pool is open!"
