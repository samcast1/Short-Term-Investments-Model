2024-01-01,4,Stayed with kids,Kylee was very quick in her communications. Her house was in a great location in Wapak. My large family stayed while we were in town for a family funeral. It was nice to have a place where we could all fit instead of having to cram into multiple hotel rooms. My husband and I both commented that the bed was very comfortable.
2024-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,"2nd stay at Kylee’s house. Place is always clean. Noticed she’s even upgraded a few pieces of furniture since our last stay.
Also appreciated the sidewalk and steps were shoveled and salted before our arrival and again the next morning after more snowfall."
2024-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,"I was very impressed with the entire house, in a great location, clean and very comfortable"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"I recently had the pleasure of staying here. Even before I arrived Kylee greeted with warmth and hospitality that truly made my stay memorable. The accommodations were not only comfortable and well-maintained but also reflected the care and attention to detail that the hostess had put into creating a welcoming space. Throughout my stay, the hostess went above and beyond to ensure that I had everything I needed and more. Her local recommendations and willingness to assist with any queries I had were invaluable, making me feel like a welcomed guest rather than just a visitor. Would totally recommend staying here!"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,Perfect place this is our second time to stay at Kylee’s. We will be back again in March. We love the place
2024-01-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"The only thing not great was the dog poop not cleaned up in the back yard. The cleaners and previous air bnb people staying should have cleaned it.
Other than that, the kitchen was awesome! It was stocked super well and there was alot of towels and everything was great!"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Perfect home away from home for Christmas! Kylee allowed us to check in a little early, and the house was clean and welcoming when we arrived. We appreciated the extra details- like decorating for Christmas. The house was spacious and includes an upstairs loft area with its own sitting space. The fenced backyard was perfect for my two dogs. We have recommended this home to future visitors and will definitely stay their again ourselves!"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Kylee was wonderful host. She was very accommodating. Allowed us to check in a little early and the house was gorgeous, and perfect for our multi family."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,Great! Highly recommend if you are staying in Wapakoneta.
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Kylees place was great for us. I had just had a baby a week ago by c section so comfort was a necessity for us, and this place was perfect for us. My sister and brother in law from Colorado also met us there and the parking was great and right in front. I would recommend this to airbnb anyone considering it."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Very clean, spacious and well decorated. We stayed here while visiting nearby relatives and will stay again. Great value for the price."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This newly renovated , clean and spacious Air B and B close to downtown Wapakoneta was perfect! It was pristine and clean and has everything we needed and wanted. The home smelled amazing and there were nightlights in each hallway so we could make our way in the dark without awakening anyone. We had no need to reach out to the host because the communication from them was clear and timely. There is plenty of room and even the couches were comfortable and clean enough to sleep on!
Highly recommend, we will be back !
Thank you"
2023-10-01,5,Group trip,"This was an overnight stop on our way from Detroit to Nashville, so we didn't spend much time here. It was more than adequate for our needs. After check-in we ventured out for dinner, clueless to the fact that many streets were closed for a Halloween parade! We eventually got some direction/advice from a local, found parking, and had great burgers and drinks at The Side Rail, with a front row view of the parade. Such a charming downtown area, and the locals were quite friendly to these Michiganders LOL. We really had no complaints and would certainly stay here again if the need arises."

2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Very lovely house. Clean, modern and had everything we needed. The front porch was great to sit out on in the morning. The outdoor grill was a plus. The only recommendation we would make is blinds on the bedroom windows to keep the sunlight out."

2023-02-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Kylee's house was the perfect balance of laid-back & uncluttered. We loved having a fenced in back yard to let the dogs out and plenty of space for all of us to move around inside and plenty of comfortable seating when we had our family visit. We had my elderly mother with us and she was able to get up and down the front steps with help and able to access most everything on the main floor of the house with her walker. The kitchen was so nice and roomy for us to be able to prepare meals for our extended family that came over to visit and the picnic table in the dining area worked out great for us as well.
2023-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,Very clean and felt like home.
2022-12-01,5,Group trip,The house was warm and cozy. Kylee even provided holiday decorations and a tree. The location was perfect and the house was emaculate. I will definitely be returning. Thank you Kylee.
2022-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,"I'm originally from here, but moved to TN after high school. I needed a place to stay while coming home to visit family. My grandmother lives in a nursing home and came to spend time with us everyday we were there. It was very comfortable and decorated so cute for grandma to be in the Christmas spirit. The house is so spacious and thr grands had plenty of space to make ornaments and decorate cookies with her. The upstairs was perfect for the kids to play when they started to get loud. After a long day the beds were perfect for a goods night sleep!"
2022-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,Easy check-in. Great communication.
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This location & house were great. It’s clean & has lots of space. There is a fenced in back yard that is helpful if you have children with you. An easy walk with stroller uptown to visit stores & get coffee & donuts.
2022-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"With 2 big dogs, it's hard to find places willing to accommodate. Kylee was very gracious and I highly recommend for people traveling the area with pets. The backyard is fully gated and large, great for them to run around. The layout is open yet separated, wonderful especially for multiple couples or larger families. Lots of recommendations in their Welcome book, easy check-in and very clean house."
2022-11-01,5,Group trip,Very cozy home in a quiet part of town. Really enjoyed being so close to downtown.
2022-11-01,5,Group trip,"Stayed here with my brother visiting from Okinawa and my sister-in-law from Kansas to visit my 90 year old Aunt who actually lives only two blocks away. We were very comfortable and really enjoyed our stay. If the weather were not so cold we would have really enjoyed the rocking chairs on the front porch and the firepit and Bar-B-Q pit in the back yard! Maybe next time....
Kylee was a great host and provided all the information we needed."
2022-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Great place to stay, great communication. Will stay again!"
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Kylee’s place was great and just what we were looking for. Everything was very clean and the communication was great. Would recommend to anyone.
2022-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,Great place to stay.
2022-10-01,3,Stayed a few nights,"The house felt new and looked freshly redone which was nice. The kitchen was nicely stocked with a lot of appliances. There was a big couch and a ton of TV's all throughout the house.
The place was mostly as described it just wasn't very comfortable to stay in. It felt more impersonal than a hotel room. It didn't have any sort of comfortable home feel to it.
The bed me and my wife tried to sleep on was so sunken in that it was unbearable. We had to sleep in different beds which still didn't help much. We both woke up with extreme back pain. I understand a bed that's been used and broken in but this was a completely different level. It was the worst nights of a two week cross country trip.
Also the bathroom had some hairs in it when we arrived. There were a lot of checkout rules and instructions that made it seem like the host wanted to do as little cleaning as possible."
2022-10-01,5,Group trip,Lovely home with spacious living areas. Great front porch for rocking and relaxing. Perfectly located in Wapakoneta. We would book again with no hesitation.
2022-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,Great house
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We needed a house to hold my family coming out of town for a wedding. This home was perfect close enough to Dayton Airport and Very Quiet Part Of Town... Do Not Hesitate To Book 😁 Thank You
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great stay in a lovely home in a safe neighborhood. Everything was as advertised and shown.

2022-09-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Kylee's place was a very thoughtfully remodelled older home. We could tell she put a lot into fixing it up. Great bathrooms with good showers. Comfortable and clean. A very cute little town and nice neighborhood. Great place to rest on a long drive up I-75.
2022-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Excellent AirBnb. Very impressed. 5 smart TVs add to the luxury feel. Spacious, clean, and comfortable. Good part of town. Already made reservations for next time I need to stay in the area!"

2022-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"A picturesque slice of a small town. It was a delight to sit on the front porch and watch the neighbors stroll by.
The location was a perfect distance to the downtown area. The house was charming, spacious and clean.
We hope to stay there again in the near future."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We enjoyed our stay here. Clean home, comfortable beds, plenty of space, plenty of towels to use, a wonderful host you can rely on - we forgot our USB stick we save and carry children’s nursery rhymes and Ms. Kylee graciously agreed to mail it to us.
Safe neighborhood, safe off-street parking."

2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Loved the place !!! Best one we have stayed in so far very clean and well taken care of house amazing grill !! Comfortable beds and furniture!! By far our favorite stay so far !!! Highly recommend!!!
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This place is immaculate, newly renovated, and very well kept. Kylee was incredibly responsive and accommodating. We arrived very late (midnight) and were towing a utility trailer. The lights were on for us, the air conditioning was running comfortably, and the curbside parking was very safe and had plenty of room for our SUV w/trailer. The inside is set up very nicely with comfortable beds, sheets, and pillows, and with plenty of different seats and couches to relax on throughout the house. Although we didn't have a lot of time to sit and relax, due to our late departure, I can say that all of the amenities worked very well (multiple TV's, WiFi, dedicated office space, coffee makers, and all appliances). My only regret is that we weren't up and at it early enough to enjoy a cup of coffee on the comfy front porch seats. I highly recommend this location for a safe, comfortable, and relaxing visit. From what we saw of the downtown, a few blocks away, I would recommend that future visitors plan in some time to walk around to try out the area food and shops."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed one night,Great cozy place to stay. Would stay again if we were in the area.
2022-07-01,5,Stayed one night,Wonderful!
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What a gem! Can’t wait to book for our next visit! You can’t beat the cleanliness, space and convenience!
Thank you for creating this space! You have a house guest for life with us."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My husband is a man of few words, he said it was great and perfect. I absolutely loved it, the decor made it very homey. Absolutely gorgeous, spacious and extremely accommodating. Communication was easy, prompt and friendly. Definitely would recommend it to anyone! My son felt confortable better than any hotel we have stayed in in Ohio so far. Thanks!"
2022-06-01,5,Group trip,Very nice place!
2022-06-01,5,Stayed one night,Everything we hoped it would be! Clean and cozy and quiet! We enjoyed our stay at Kylee’s place! And will certainly be back!
2022-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great place in Wapak!! Very clean and cozy, in a nice and quiet neighborhood."
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This house is probably my favorite of the Air BnB's I've stayed in. Pictures do not do this home justice! Its gorgeous inside and out and very clean. Kylee was easy to work with and the neighbors kept to themselves. The backyard was perfect for my dogs and the huge bathtub was great for soaking in. I loved the location! 15 minutes from Lima and only a couple of minutes from all of your basic necessities! I highly recommend this rental and its hostess!
2022-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,5 out of 5. Great house in a great neighborhood. Very peaceful and quite. The house was very clean and neat. Plenty of room for large families. Great host and great communication. Will definitely book with them again.

2022-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"We absolutely loved our stay! Kylee was a wonderful host and we were so happy to have such a spacious, clean, and cozy place to stay after my husband had a race in Lima. Kylee was so helpful and friendly and helped make our stay so easy. Between the three bedrooms, my husband and two friends had plenty of space and had the best time. The rocking chairs on the porch were an added bonus since the neighborhood is so cute! Check in was also very easy, especially since we didn’t get there until later in the evening. We will definitely be coming back to stay next time we have a double header race!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This is one of the best air bnb I’ve been to. It’s decorated like my own house and the house had everything I needed for cooking, laundry and bathroom was fully stocked with essentials. It was very clean and comfortable!"
2024-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is our second time staying here and the experience was as good as the first. It is a short drive to our daughters home so it is just perfect for us. It is quiet, directly across from the police station and has a garage to pull into, what more could you ask! We know that we will be back."
2024-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very comfortable place. Host responded quickly to resolve minor issue.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"Cutest little house! We only stayed for one night, but I would have been perfectly happy to stay for a week!

2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We drove from Louisville ky to Wapakoneta ohio for my cousins wedding. Not a bad drive at all and the place was very cozy and clean. We felt at home. Spent most our free time playing trivia. We definitely enjoyed our weekend getaway. 10/10 recommend. We will definitely be back.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Definitely a great find! Everything was clean and comfortable, and the host was super helpful!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,We only stayed one night but enjoyed it very much. It is a lovely home.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We rented Emily's place for the eclipse. What a great find! The price was comparable to what we would have paid for a budget motel but instead we had a house with front and back yard. Well equipped kitchen (with a Keurig!), plenty of space for sleeping with 2 large beds and a queen air mattress. Bathroom had essentials and plenty of towels- good water pressure. There was a garage with remote we could use but just kept our minivan in the driveway- such a safe neighborhood. We met the family next door renting her other property- a very friendly family from Virginia where the father was in the Navy and son was a junior investigator for NASA. They brought high powered telescopes, tripods, cameras, computers. They let us in on their findings during the eclipse- what a great experience!!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,Second time I’ve stayed on the property
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We really enjoyed staying at the Janis Eleanor, it was one of the most comfortable Airbnb’s we have had the pleasure of staying at. Loved the little touches and the family sentiment."

2024-03-01,4,Stayed with a pet,there was a sock and something else left under a bed in the back from a previous guest or someone. also there was an odd hatch in that room floor.
2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,Great place to stay and very clean. Great communication. Would definitely recommend.
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We are originally from Wapakoneta and live in North Carolina. We always try to stay here! It:s perfect for us and our dog, Louis!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,She was great and recommended people to come !
2024-02-01,5,Stayed one night,We stayed only one night passing through but loved the house. We felt very comfortable and welcomed. The neighborhood is quiet and peaceful. The house was very clean and decorated beautifully. We would definitely stay again.
2024-02-01,5,Stayed with a pet,We enjoyed our short weekend stay very much. The location was very easy to find. Home was clean and nicely decorated with plenty of room for everyone. We appreciated the availability of a snow shovel and ice melt when we woke up to (unexpected) snow on Saturday morning (it's wintertime in Ohio but snow was not in the forecast). Emily was very easy to work with to adjust our reservation when our pet-sitter cancelled on us and we ended up needing to bring our dogs with us. We would definitely book again.
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We arrived late at night, and had a little trouble with the key box, BUT, we didn't realize that the little door of the box just falls open, so that's on us. Everything was at expected, and we felt right at home in no time. What a luxury to also have use of the garage! The kitchen is well- appointed, and the great room looks and feels very spacious. I really appreciated the work area with a desk to work at.
The beds were very comfortable, as were the couches. Don't hesitate on this one, just book it. 👍"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Emily provided a great place to stay. The location is very convenient to the interstate and is in a safe neighborhood. The home is well stocked and the lighting is great. Nice clean home with an attached garage which is great in the cold or rainy weather. We would defiantly stay here again when we come to visit family.
2024-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,Thank you for hosting us! We enjoyed our stay. We appreciated the games and kids toys and the cozy blankets!
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Tastefully furnished. Noted how good the lighting was. Comfy and cozy. Really enjoyed the attached garage for practical purposes. Nice that the bathroom and kitchen were well stocked for items we might have forgotten to bring.
2024-01-01,5,Stayed one night,Beautifully set up home by people who obviously take pride in their home and in the guest experience. Very safe neighborhood right across from sheriff’s headquarters. Nice and warm on a cold winters night. Great communication and flexibility shown by the hosts. Plenty of room in the home with enough but not too much furniture. Close to downtown and the main drag. Great bargain at the price.
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great place, have stayed here before!"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Awesome place felt like a home and would do it again
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Wapakoneta is our hometown and we love staying at this Airbnb! It's like home away from home for us!
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very nice place to stay. Clean in a nice area right next to the police station. Washer and dryer are very helpful as well
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Emily's place was perfect for mine and my friend's quiet Christmas getaway. The only plans we made were to go to the Armstrong Air and Space Museum, which is just a few minutes away. Emily even let us do a late checkout so my friend's dog could rest at the house while we took our time at the museum.
The house was clean and uncluttered. My friend kept commenting on how comfortable the couch was. The kitchen was great for cooking all our meals. There are a couple of grab bars throughout the house. As someone with mobility issues, I greatly appreciated them (and wish all AirBNB hosts would put them in their rentals). There are a few steps to get into the house, but once inside, it's barrier free with plenty of room to move around with a mobility device. The attached garage would be nice to keep you out of the cold or bad weather (there are a few stairs to get inside here, too).
If I ever find myself in Wapakoneta again, I wouldn't hesitate to stay here again."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Clean, convenient and very accommodating host! We have already rebooked for our next trip in May."

2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,All good. We were very satisfied.
2023-11-01,5,Stayed one night,A beautiful home that is quickly being discovered by others. When coming back to see our family it is a home away from home.
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"The hosts have gone out of their way to make sure every amenity you could need during an outing is available. The house is tidy and well decorated, feeling like home and smelling like grandma’s. Even the towels smelled wonderful, which we’ve found is surprisingly more uncommon than one would imagine through Airbnb’s. It’s in a peaceful neighborhood, right across from the sheriff’s department. It’s close enough to the highway to get of town quickly, yet very quiet. The attention to detail makes the price you pay an absolute bargain. Highly recommend!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,Great place to stay. Had everything we needed. Would stay again.
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Emily was very engaged and responsive from first contact. We were traveling and arrived late and left early so sadly didn’t enjoy what the town offered. I put a high premium on feeling safe and we felt very safe at Emily’s place. Comfy bed and linens. Cute touches throughout the house.Her tribute to her grandmother was very sweet. We would definitely stay again when passing through the area, which we do annually."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed about a week,We stay here when we are in Wapakoneta. It's always a great place to stay! Kurt & Emily are terrific hosts!

Easy access to highway, police station across the road, a home away from home."
2023-10-01,4,Stayed with a pet,"Overall a great stay, safe location and had everything I needed as well as pet friendly! With that I will say it did have a bit of a pet urine odor to it."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Hosts were informative and responsive when needed. The house was clean and the neighborhood was quiet and safe.

2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Emily’s place was cozy, comfortable and extremely clean. Immaculate, actually! It was exactly as described in the listing, but felt even better in person with all the personal decorations and the attention to details. The house was fully stocked with anything you could need. There is an open field across the road that we took my toddler and dog to run around in, that was so helpful after a long day of driving. If we’re ever in the area again we will be booking Emily’s place without hesitation!"

This house is easy to get to from the highway or any other main road in the area. The surrounding area is pleasant and quiet. Inside the house everything is clean and orderly. It’s easy to feel right at home here. I also appreciate Emily’s hosting. I had planned to bring a pet but instead she stayed with family. I let Emily know, just to communicate, and without my asking she refunded me for the pet fee. If you’re trying to stay in the Auglaize county area, this is a great place."

It is close to the heart of town, quiet, small but spacious enough to be comfortable. We didn't cook there because we were in town to see our daughter but a quick peek through the well organized kitchen showed there was about everything you would need. Loved the garage, which is big enough to accommodate most vehicles."

2022-04-01,4,Stayed with a pet,"Adorable little house close to I-75. This home has a great layout and everything we needed for our one night stay while traveling. Emily was very responsive and kindly remembered my request in advance to avoid using air fresheners in the house before our arrival. Use of the attached garage was a plus, as it was raining when we arrived. Check out J. Marie’s Wood Fired kitchen nearby for some excellent pizza and craft beer. We would definitely stay here again if circumstances allowed."
2022-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,A very nice place with all the amenities one would expect. Location is a bit out of town but then only still a short drive to town. Clean and nicely decorated.

2023-08-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"We enjoyed our time in Lima. The house was comfortable. The only thing we found disappointing was watching TV. The large window in the living room has a very thin, light colored curtain. The reflection from outside hits the TV so you can’t see the screen."

Bonus-very well stocked coffee station, complete with snacks."

2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Gillian’s place was just what my sister and I were looking for on our visit to Lima to attend our aunt and uncle’s 70th wedding anniversary. It was comfortable with cozy beds and comfortable linens. It was spotless. Nice big backyard. In a quiet neighborhood. If you plan to cook, you will need to bring everything you need. There were no condiments, oil or salt and pepper. Only Keurig cups and sweet and low sugar, a couple of bottles of water and a few snacks were supplied.

2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"Gillian's type of communication is friendly and helpful. She offers her support outside of business. You feel well taken care of. It makes you feel “safe” in a foreign environment.

2023-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"Had a quick yet lovely stay here just passing through for one night. The location is excellent, right on the main strip in a little town, so cute and charming. The apartment rests above a bar and grill which is convenient and fun. It is exactly as pictured, and the bed is super comfy. The host communicated very well so it was a smooth and easy experience. Would recommend!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,great place to stay. right down town.
2023-11-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Kaitlynn & Will's place is a great value. This was our 2nd visit. It's open space on the 2nd floor of an old downtown building and was a great place to bunk while we visited family in Wapak. It's over J Maries, a terrific restaurant. There is restaurant noise that drifts up until 9pm, but is quiet after that. Being in an old building, the space is charming quirky. K&W are great communicators."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,We will definitely stay here again when visiting family!
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,They were quick to respond and very helpful and kind!
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Nice and clean place. It was very convenient the restaurant is right below the apartment.
2023-09-01,2,Stayed a few nights,"WELL WELL WELL FIRST OFF THE AC WAS MAKING ANNOYING SOUNDS DAY AND NIGHT LIKE THERE WAS PLASTIC SPINNING AROUND IN A FAN. SECONDLY, THE FLOOR WAS STICKY AS HELL, THOUGHT I WOULD ENJOY A NICE HOME COOKED MEAL AND THE PLATES WERE DIRTY. NOT TO MENTION THE CUPS WERE LITERALLY STICKING TO THE CABINETS. ALL THE DRAWERS WERE GLUED SHUT PRETTY MUCH TOOK ALL MY STRENGTH TO GET A FORK. OH, DONT FORGET THE BLARING MUSIC AT LIKE 11 AT NIGHT. DONT FORGET THE STAIN ON THE PILLOW!!!! Also, sorry about the trash. we couldn't find the trash bags, lol."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The apartment was clean. Although there were some issues with the apartment left by the last guest, the hosts came right to the apartment to fix it.
The communication was great and the hosts are extremely responsive."
2023-08-01,2,Stayed with kids,"Although it was one of the cheaper end airbnbs in Wapak and we mainly were at the fairgrounds, this one was not worth it. If I hadn’t needed consistent Wi-Fi for work this week, we would have just stayed in the camper for the same pitiful result. The parking spot we had we either never got or was blocked in. The stairs felt like they were going to break every time we carried our child up and down them. Oh and there’s only a window ac unit, not actually ac. But make sure to check the heater to make sure it’s not on heating up your area too because it was in ours. The bedroom is big enough for a king but only has a queen so for hot nights count on one of you sleeping on the couch (not that it’s any better - no ac remember). Also the only tv is in the living room so hope you don’t need it to fall asleep too. Oh and shower head leaks and has like zero pressure, definitely needs replaced. Hope you like retail tp because that’s all you’re getting here."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Had a great stay and time in Wapakoneta at Kaitlynn & Will’s place. Their communication and place was great. Jmarie’s below is a great spot for a good meal and drink!
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,They were extremely responsive and helpful. We really enjoyed our visit. It was located right in the heart of town. Would definitely recommend!!!!
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"It was wonderful, the listing matched the apartment perfectly. I was very pleased with the hospitality of the host, We arived during a festival so the streets were blocked the host went the extra mile to meet us at the entrance of the ally way to show us how to access the apartment. Went over and above to make us welcome. I will definatly return if im ever in the area again."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Very cute, clean and perfect little place! Has all the normal amenities. Host was great with communicating. All around great experience from check in to check out. Highly recommend this listing. Also check out the restaurant J Maries that is below the Air BnB. Food was delicious! And great atmosphere!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Hosts were very responsive and accommodating. The property was perfect for our stay! The area was safe and the locals were friendly!
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great location. The apartment sits right above
JMaries restaurant which is a fantastic spot to eat.
We would also recommend The Side Rail that is walkable.
The apartment is simple, clean, and you can’t beat the price!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Older, upstairs apartment. Was great for the one day stay!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Everything was great at Kaitlynn and Will's. Easy to get to, and they accommodated my big work vehicle which was nice. I had dinner at their restaurant downstairs, and it was fantastic. Shops all around, which was awesome! Apartment was clean and as described. I would definitely stay again"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"For the same price as a two bedroom hotel, this was a great stay and It’s right in between the two big lakes for easy access to great views and activities.
I had a good time and I just don’t think you can get any better for the price."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"The apartment was just as described! Very cute little place in a very cute town. Lots of little stores, some coffee shops and restaurants that you can walk to. Hosts were very responsive and friendly!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"This cute little old apartment is the perfect place to stay. My husband and I crashed here after a comedy show in Fort Wayne, IN. We didn’t have any issue finding and accessing it, as the instructions given were clear. Kaitlynn and Will were quick to respond once the reservation was made. The sun shines in quite early, and you can hear the folks on the road and down below. I knew to expect that, though, after reading other reviews. If you can deal with that, this is the perfect place! It’s older with a modern hint, which I thought was adorable! Be sure to bring your own toiletries, too! Thank you, Kaitlynn and Will for accommodating our stay on such short notice and for being such wonderful and responsive hosts! Wapakoneta was such a quaint little town with lots of neat little murals and monuments, too! Definitely check it out!"
2023-05-01,3,Stayed about a week,Very clean they were helpful several times. However due to the noise below and outside and the stairs I could not recommend this to anybody else
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"Will was very accommodating! Communication was great. The bed was super comfy! The apartment was clean. I will have to say, I was surprised to find it to be NOT a single apartment above a restaurant, but rather a multi unit situation. I will have to say, it was quiet enough though. The shared stair and hallway area could use some update and maintenance. The neighborhood was quite adorable. Very easy to work with host!"
2023-04-01,4,Stayed one night,Great space for what we needed. Right next to local shops and restaurants!
2023-04-01,4,Stayed one night,"It was our first time to choose an airbnb above a business. The building is older; historic. The business below us was a restaurant. The location in on the main street in the town so there was traffic noise and noise (music) from the restaurant below, but everything quieted down at 9:00 pm. It was actually very quiet at night. The apartment was older, but clean. I appreciated the coffee pods, coffee creamer and sugar to use with the Kuerig. Some places only provide the pods so the sugar and creamer was great. We were there for only one night and it was very rainy which kept us from exploring the town. Wapakoneta is a very charming place to visit."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"It was super cute, almost had a simple realistic Tuscan Italy vibe to it. Bedroom is beautiful too with a lot of light."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,The apartment was fine for a night and met our expectations. Nice location.
2023-04-01,5,Stayed about a week,Loved staying here again.. it was convenient and clean thank you so much
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place was so cute and being right in the middle of the historic town really sealed the greatness of this place. Everything is so close for either walking or driving. They were great at communicating and quick to respond. I recommend this place, and will be back!"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed one night,Great
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Had an awesome stay. Thank you so much for giving us a clean comfy place to stay 😀
2023-02-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"We enjoyed our stay with Kaitlyn & Will, and we hope we can book again on our next visit. It was a good fit for our needs and an excellent value. The bed was very comfy, and the apartment over all was spacious. The apt is in a revitalized downtown area with fun shops/eateries/waterfront nearby. Parking was a bit tricky since overnight parking on the street is not an option - we could park behind J Maries (the outstanding restaurant immediately below the apartment) but had to park so that the restaurant staff was not blocked. The stairway access from the rear to the 2nd floor is sturdy, but very exposed (the low railing is nerve-wracking for those us nervous about heights). The stairway access from the street is through double doors (that do not lock) and is a long ascent to the hallway landing and apartment door. Other guests have noted the music from the restaurant below, but it stopped about 9:00 and did not keep us awake. The one negative: there are no hooks/closets in the apartment"
2023-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"This was my second time using this location, and I will again in the future. Extremely helpful and open communication. Also, it’s the most comfortable bed I’ve ever laid on 😂"
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Good place
2023-01-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Mske sure to visit jmaries restaurant underneath apt. John owns and runs this place and it is very good food
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I had great communication with Kaitlynn and Will. The check in instructions were very easy to follow and accurate. The apartment was very cute and perfect for my momcation!
2023-01-01,5,Stayed about a week,.
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Spent week at location for work. Good location and parking next to building was abundant. Plenty of dining and shopping options within walking distance or very short drive. Apartment is in an older building but plenty to like.
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I have stayed here before and was happy with the accommodations. It is a cute apartment with everything you need to feel at home. The bedroom is spacious and the bed is extremely comfortable- didn’t want to get up and go to work! The sitting room was the perfect place to sit and have a glass of wine and watch TV. you are above a restaurant and can hear the music but with the TV on it was not a problem. The music was off 10 so was no problem sleeping This trip I took a day and walked to all the cute shops , did some shopping and enjoyed my coffee in the coffee shop just a block away and ate dinner J Marie’s which did not disappoint! I will definitely stay here again especially since I signed an extension on my travel nurse assignment ."
2022-11-01,5,Stayed one night,Great hosts and will look to book here again!
2022-11-01,4,Stayed with kids,"Overall very nice place, no where to hang up your clothes but the owners were very nice and had great communication"

2022-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"What a fabulous place to stay! So much to see and do and in such a lovely little town, hope to come back soon!"
2022-10-01,4,Stayed over a week,"Will was very accommodating and friendly. We felt very welcomed by everyone in the community and his staff as well.
We had a great view to downtown, which we loved! We would definitely stay again."
2022-09-01,5,Stayed one night,Wonderful apartment for overnight/weekend stays. Great location in downtown Wapak! Very clean space and hosts were accommodating.
2022-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"The apartment was perfect. Great location, I am a travel nurse and wanted to try something other then a hotel! Will definitely stay here again, decor was nice , bed super comfortable and had everything I needed to feel at home!"
2022-09-01,5,Stayed over a week,"The apartment was easy to get into with the lockbox and communication with the hosts was good. Some other reviews mention the restaurant music below. You can definitely hear the music, though I honestly found that the car alarms going off on the street/street traffic to be louder than the restaurant downstairs.
The location is downtown and there are several restaurants and shops on the street. The donut shop across the street was tasty! The kitchen in the Airbnb does have some things, but if you’re staying for a while and plan to cook I’d recommend bringing some of your own essentials. For example, I brought my own cooking spray, baking sheet, and spatula. There also weren’t oven mitts available during the time of my stay.
The bathroom was clean and nice. There is a heat lamp above the shower, which was so nice! There’s no ac in the building, but I didn’t feel too hot with the fans running and window ac unit.
Overall, the place is as described and my stay was what I expected!"
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay downtown Wapakoneta.
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Clean, comfortable. Great location. The restaurant below has delicious food and friendly, helpful wait staff. Will communicated in a timely fashion and had good recommendations for local activities."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very neat little apartment. Private area. Super nice for a single person to stay or a couple. Plan on coming back a 3rd time at some point.
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,One of the best Airbnb’s I’ve ever stayed in. The bed is incredibly comfy and the entire place has a cozy feel. We got a chance to meet the maintenance man and he was so sweet and really funny. Would definitely stay here again.
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great, trendy place to stay in the heart of Wapak. It’s a little on the warm side being that it’s an old building with high ceilings & only a window unit for air conditioning (and we came in July). That aside, it was prefect for what we needed. Great communication, friendly hosts, soft clean bed, and a cute town to explore. We’ll definitely try to book this place every time we visit!"
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Wonderful host! Nice area it was perfect for us! The restaurant in which this apartment is located over is the BEST the food is wonderful the service is better! It is a great location small mom and pops stores all around we had a great visit everyone was so friendly! Visited the space museum just a few blocks away also it’s a must see! Can’t say enough about the trip definitely will be returning!
2022-06-01,5,Stayed one night,Awesome!
2022-06-01,5,Stayed one night,The places as accurately described and pictured. Kaitlynn answered my question in a timely manner. She let us have a late check out when asked. No complaints!
2022-06-01,3,Stayed a few nights,"Lots of downtown noise until around 11pm. Bed very comfy, couch was filthy but i understand it was replaced right after i checked out. Bring your own: bath soap, dishsoap, hand towels.
A/C in bedroom, ceiling fans in other rooms. No cable tv."
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Clean, spacious and in the heart of town. Communication was excellent and we knew exactly what to do at check in and check out. A must book if you are staying in Wapak"
2022-05-01,4,Stayed about a week,"Great place, great location, amazing communication."
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very comfortable apartment in the heart of downtown “Wapak.” J-Marie’s downstairs is super yummy and reminds you to go have fun. :) I can’t wait to return to check out more!
2022-04-01,5,Stayed one night,Very nice place to stay.
2022-04-01,5,Stayed one night,Fun walk-up with super cozy bed & lots of space! Communication was outstanding & everything was delightful for my quick in-and-out stay!
2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great little town birthplace of Neil Armstrong I did not know that until I got there. The apartment was grea. clean comfortable bed great value
2022-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"Wonderful communication, assistance to help above and beyond just booking your stay."
2022-03-01,4,Stayed one night,Met our needs nicely. Well furnished. Would be great for those wanting to check out the town. Above a pub so a little noisy but they shut it down by about 9.
2022-03-01,4,Stayed a few nights,This spot is a great value in a very good location. Hosts are wonderful about communicating! They were also quite hospitable & helpful. Just understand you will be climbing some stairs to access the apartment.
2022-03-01,4,Stayed a few nights,This is a great spot to stay if you are in the area. Just be aware that you will be climbing stairs to get to the apartment. The hosts are very attentive and helpful and great about communicating.
2022-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"This was a wonderful stay for us. It does get a bit loud between the busy downtown and the restaurant. However, we would stay here again."
2022-03-01,5,Stayed one night,Fantastic stay great communication between us and the renters 10/10
2022-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"Our host was so kind and extremely helpful in accommodating all of our needs. The apartment was very nice and roomy with lots of amenities like toiletries, coffee, and kitchen utensils. We stopped in at the bar/restaurant beneath the apartment which had really great food and a full bar. You could definitely hear the music from the bar til about 10 at night but it didn’t bother us too much. Might be good to keep in mind if you have kids or like getting to bed early, however. Overall we were super comfortable and would definitely stay again!"
2022-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We enjoyed our stay here. It felt as if we stepped back in time. Love that the place had coffee and bath supplies. Cozy and fun place to stay. We walked everywhere and enjoyed local shopping, dining, and the Alpha!"
2022-01-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Great location, clean and very comfortable bed!"
2022-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,My only complaints are that the wifi is the guest wifi from the bar downstairs and that the music from the bar is quite loud until the place closes. Luckily it was only 9 or 10 o’clock but it can be a nuisance.
2021-12-01,5,Stayed about a week,"The apartment was exactly as advertised. Small and cozy with out being cramped. Right in the historic down town, there are great places for food and coffee within walking distance. Check in was super easy and clear directions were given. I would definitely stay again."
2021-12-01,5,Stayed one night,Amazing communication! Place was easy to find and super cute! I will book with them again for sure!
2021-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great host. Clean home. Bed was very comfortable.
2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great host, loved the welcoming and hospitality."
2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"across the board 5 stars. I was delighted to stay in Kaitlynn and Wills apartment for the weekend. several things I recommend for all looking at this place, meter your expectations and recognize this is not the holiday inn express. for the value this place was exceeding all expectations. with the privacy and space of a full unit, I was blessed to have all my needs and creature comforts met. they provide a wide array of amenities to make your travels more comfortable. the bed was perfect. it was apparent that they have made some remodels, most noticable was the bathroom. you could really see the love and care put into trying to make this home the absolute best. I appreciate Will and Kaitlynn opening their abode in this manner and for all the communication to help with the check in process as well"
2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Quick contact with the owners of the house for answers to all questions. Access to the premises is possible without any problems at any time. Good location of the house in the city center. Convenient large free parking next to the house. Very warm and clean in the rooms, in the kitchen and in the bathroom. There is Wi-Fi. There is noise and music from the restaurant on the ground floor, but it stops at 10pm. We will gladly recommend this place for relaxation and travel."
2021-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,Kaitlynn and Will’s property was very clean and very well decorated. The location was great and within walking distance of many shops and restaurants. They reached out to me a few times to make sure I had everything I needed. Check in was a breeze and I loved the privacy. Would definitely stay here again.
2021-10-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Great area. Loud on the weekends but kinda expected that with the location. Very reasonable rate and would stay again.
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This apartment is in a super location close to everything downtown. The apartment has everything that you need and more. And the hosts are super. Very responsive and will answer any questions.
2021-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"This apartment was a great alternative to a hotel in downtown Wapakoneta! The host was very communicative and the apartment was fully stocked with extra toiletries in case you forgot yours. As others have written, the train is super close by, so I don't recommend this stay for light sleepers."
2021-10-01,2,Stayed one night,"I understand there were personal and COVID related situations going on but this was not a good experience. The code provided to get the key was not accurate so 2 people had to come and get me in. The listing says there are parking passes but there wasn’t one so I had no idea if I was going to wake up and my jeep was gone. There were no washcloths to take a shower. No instructions on how to use the tv, not a power strip so that all 3 devises for the tv could be plugged in at once. The bedroom furniture is horribly positioned to where you can’t plug in your phone and accessories to charge while you’re sleeping. Consider taking your own coffee accessories and be prepared to wash any dishes before using."
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great place, great location and cheaper then a hotel on hamburger row!!"
2021-08-01,5,Stayed over a week,The best place to stay in Wapakenta. Make sure to visit the Temple of Tolerance. The hosts made us feel right at home. There is nothing that would have made our stay any better. My very best experience at an Airbnb so far.
2021-07-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"FABULOUS location, exceptionally clean! Trains run through downtown at night fyi and there is no parking on the street in front overnight! Kaitlynn is wonderful to communicate with and helps in anyway she can. It is stocked with necessities of all kinds. Restaurant below is wonderful and there are several other bar/restaurants nearby. Don't miss the candy/coffee shop a block down!"
2021-07-01,5,Stayed one night,Sweet little apartment! Just the right space for a night away when traveling! I want to come back and explorexall the little shops downtown!
2021-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great place, cool town, and friendly people."
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great place to stay, great location and hosts are great at communicating! Would definitely stay here again. Comfortable and cozy."
2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay and fantastic Hosts! Loved it!
2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We had a great stay at Kaitlynn & Will’s place. Really nice and cozy downtown apartment for a really great price. I would highly recommend it!
2021-06-01,4,Stayed one night,"Very comfortable bed, spacious and was the perfect location for my stay. Thanks again!"
2021-06-01,4,Stayed one night,"Nice apartment at a good price. Comfortable bed, cute decor. We only stayed one night, and the main thing I would change might be more dark curtains or coverings on the windows, as it gets very bright early in the morning. Otherwise, cute place in a nice little town!"
2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The downtown apartment was just as promised. Clean, comfortable and easy. So much better than a hotel. Definitely will have to stay here again."
2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Cute little apartment in a cute little town
2021-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"Very clean, good place to stay at, has a great restaurant to eat at below."
2021-04-01,5,Stayed one night,Kaitlynn& Will’s place was a very cute place to stay—we enjoyed it very much and would stay again.
2021-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"Clean, comfortable, and spacious apartment with a comfortable bed."
2020-12-01,2,Stayed about a week,Take pictures before and after
2020-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Highly recommend this cute apartment!
2020-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Perfect spot! Great communication. Cool space.
2020-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The apartment was cute, and very clean. The location was right in town, above a really neat restaurant. I recommend the buffalo chicken mac and cheese."
2020-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great Place. Great location.
2020-08-01,5,Stayed one night,Our stay was great! Hosts recommendation to eat at J. Marie's was so worth it. We enjoyed the quiet livingroom space and the movies that were provided. Shower necessities were available if you had forgotten and multiple kinds of coffee. We will definitely keep this place in mind for the future! It was a great value too!
2020-07-01,4,Stayed one night,The hosts were very hospitable and quick to respond.
2020-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Very nice cool room, very simple and comfortable, highly recommend for a few nights in! Great lighting and a supply of movies in case you forget to bring your own"
2020-06-01,5,Stayed over a week,.
2020-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"Perfect place, very clean and comfortable for a reasonable price. Quick communication. I will definitely come back."
2020-01-01,4,Stayed one night,Nice place
2019-12-01,5,Stayed about a week,Everything was great. Staying in Lima for a few weeks for work. Only reason I didn’t rebook was because it booked up before I could rebook! Hosts were quick to respond to questions! Nice place!
2019-12-01,4,Stayed a few nights,The apartment was adorable and at a great price! My husband and I live in the country so the trains and the traffic outside made it a little hard for us to sleep. But the apartment itself was adorable and wapak is a cute little town. We only needed Kaitlynn and will once and they answered my questions right away!
2019-11-01,5,Stayed over a week,"I was an extended stay guest. I was visiting from out of town for work and stayed for about 6 weeks. I was absolutely enamored with the old town feel of downtown Wapak and was met with kindness on a daily basis. I was very pleased with the place, everything is as they say it is. As others have said, the bed is extremely comfortable...I slept like a rock. The noise from the restaurant downstairs can be a little loud at times but they shut down at a reasonable hour and a fan In the bedroom drowns out any residual noise. The only thing I missed was local television, especially being an extended stay guest. Hulu live saved me during football season!! The hosts are fantastic and responded to any questions I had immediately. I would look forward to working out of town again if I could stay here.
Also, I don't believe the Amenities stated that pots and pans are included...they are. This was a pleasant surprise."
2019-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,It’s a very nice place very private if you like stairs and the exercise you’ll like this place that’s the only bad thing the stairs
2019-09-01,5,Stayed over a week,Very nice place right downtown Wapak!!
2019-07-01,3,Stayed a few nights,"Great location downtown, comfy bed; pretty basic accommodations, but a good price."
2019-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great location, thoughtful hosts, highly recommend."
2019-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,It is what they say it is great place
2019-07-01,4,Stayed one night,Great little apartment in a small Ohio town! The decor is really cute and plenty to do. I would highly suggest checking into this place!
2019-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Highly recommended...in a great location, clean, affordable and comfortable."
2019-06-01,5,Stayed one night,Was a good place in a good location
2019-06-01,5,Stayed over a week,"I will be back in one month, thanks again !!"
2019-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"Nice cozy little place above a terrific restaurant. Had a nice morning walk along the river, watched the geese. A few stairs to climb but the bed was nice and comfy."
2019-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Super stylish place, much bigger than I expected. Restaurant downstairs is amazing, and they will treat you even better if they know you're staying upstairs. I stayed on a weekend, and while the living area had a lot of noise from downstairs, the bedroom didn't. I will definitely plan a trip out here again!!"
2019-05-01,4,Stayed one night,This is a really cute place that probably shined at one point getting the 5 star reviews but it seems to be slowly getting a bit less attention. The price at $50 is great but with all the fees added at $85 you might be better off at the motel 6 in Lima. There was some spots of mold above the shower and the kurig/coffee machine looked like it hadn't been cleaned or restocked in some time. Otherwise it's a fine place to stay and very comfortable.
2019-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Stylish, comfortable loft type apartment in a Victorian building with a super restaurant downstairs."
2019-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Nice place.
2019-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I will rent this place again.
2019-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Nice place. Well located. Very responsive hosts.
2019-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Nice apartment. Located in the heart of town. Perfect base for working in area.
2019-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The apartment is so well located. J Marie's restaurant downstairs is wonderful. Nice coffee shop across the street with incredible breakfast burritos. Place was clean and roomy with nice soft sheets. It is so much nicer than staying in a hotel. Hosts were very quick to respond to any questions. Check in is easy. Close by street parking with pass provided by host. There is some light coming in windows from being downtown, so if you are sensitive to that a sleep mask may be desirable."
2019-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The place was nice, clean, and efficient. I will come back!"
2019-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The space was very roomy and comfortable, close to neat stores and a great restaurant down below."
2019-03-01,5,Stayed about a week,Great place. Great location. And great food downstairs. Would definitely recommend to anyone in the area.
2019-03-01,4,Stayed about a week,"This quaint apartment is a wonderful alternative to a boring hotel room. It offered a comfortable space to relax, a spacious bedroom and a kitchen with many amenities including a full-size refrigerator and stove. As Floridians, we were so pleased that the heat kept the area toasty warm. The owners were super responsive with questions and information. The check-in and check-out processes were quick and easy. The restaurant downstairs is considered the best in town by our friends who are locals."
2019-03-01,5,Stayed over a week,I stayed here during my clinical rotation at St. Rita's Medical Center. It's about a 20-25 minute drive from this location to St. Rita's which was super easy. The apartment is right above J.Maries which is a super cute restaurant right below if you don't feel like cooking. J-William and Kailtynn were super easy to get in contact with and were really good about answering back promptly if I needed anything at all. There's the Wapak Athletic Club (WAC) within walking distance and some other really cute boutiques in the town if you are also in the mood to shop!
2018-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We really enjoyed our stay. The location was great and they were easy to work with.
2018-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My fiancee and I stayed here over a weekend while visiting family in town. The location was fantastic, with restaurants and shopping all within walking distance. The bathroom is a little bit on the tight side and the shower is rather low, if you are 6 feet tall or above you will be ducking, but it gets the job done. There was a full kitchen including a fridge/freezer, stove, microwave and toaster. Netflix on the tv was a plus while relaxing at night. The bed was super comfortable, if you are sensitive to light in the morning, maybe bring a face mask because it was rather bright in the room. All in all, we enjoyed our time here."
2018-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"Small and quaint,comfortable bed ! Great restaurant down below @ J.maries must eat there!"
2018-12-01,5,Stayed over a week,"I stayed here for a month while working in Lima. A great little place! Definitely the best I could find in the area. Very cute, modern and stylish inside. It sits right above their restaurant J Marie’s which in my opinion has the best food in the greater area. I’m a California Bay Area native and am used to a certain level of cuisine, J Marie’s was the only place who could compete! On top of the house and restaurant, they were excellent hosts. During my stay they went through a traumatic and tragic family event, yet still did their best to stay in touch with me and make sure I had everything I needed to have a comfortable stay...beyond great hospitality! I would mention it can get loud at times with the restaurant being right below, but I honestly never found it to be an issue. With the TV on the sound was easily blocked out and in the bedroom the fan and heater being on would also do the trick. I would definitely recommend this place with my highest regards to anyone who finds themselves in need of somewhere to stay in the area!"
2018-10-01,3,Stayed a few nights,Communication leading up to the stay was terrible. Bathroom was dirty and in serious need of remodel. Bedding appeared to be dirty but they said they were clean. This was the place chosen for son and his wife on the night of their wedding as they are from out of the area and wanted someplace close to the venue. Planned to stay 2 nights but only stayed 1 night because it was that bad. Daughter-in-law wouldn't even shower there.
2018-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Second time enjoying my stay here in Wapa. Really the best airbnb for location and price in town. Great value.
2018-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Awesome apartment on top of J Marie's restaurant. Had a great stay and would recommend to future visitors.
2018-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The apt is as described and the location excellent, for me anyway. Many places within walking distance, local theater, bakery, coffee houses, dining, antique shops, etc. The restaurant below is popular with locals but I would not describe the noise as excessive. I do come from the big city so other reviewers may differ. It ceases when the place closes and the parking pass provided works except for the specific hours mentioned on the pass. I used it for 3 days with zero issues. The apt is a great space and good value for the area. Shotgun style floor plan and has every room expected. Enter through kitchen, with stand-up shower/bathroom then living room then bedroom which looks out towards the main blvd. Tastefully decorated and everything works, strong WiFi, window unit AC that did the job. Communication was excellent and would say John is well on his way to being a terrific airbnb host. Recommended"
2018-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"Expect a well ventilated, spacious apartment with an amazing bed and living arrangement. It’s only my 3rd time using Airbnb and this was easily my favorite. The parking is right outside by tons of places. I’d stay there again without a doubt."
2018-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We had a great time! Visit the restaurant below the unit.
2018-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"Beautiful building with cute apartment. Take the time to have dinner at J Marie’s. Great food, service and locals to visit with."
2018-08-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"A nice cozy one bedroom apartment in downtown, historic Wapakoneta"
2018-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay while in Wapak!
2018-07-01,5,Stayed over a week,Nice simple apartment.
2018-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Really cute space with everything we needed. It is very loud at night between the restaurant downstairs (died down around 10:45pm) and the train that goes by periodically throughout the night. Hosts are very open in disclosing about noise, so not a complaint, more of an additional heads-up. Bed was super comfy! And Netflix on the TV made my night! :)"
2018-05-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"This place was great and cozy! There was a tv with a smart DVD player that had Netflix capabilities, and a Keurig. It was in a great part of town that was convenient for getting coffee and food! The only downsides were that there was a permeating smell and it never went away no matter what we did. Windows don't open and so without AC it gets quite hot, and the cable box wasn't and couldn't be hooked up."
2018-05-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"A super cute place in a hip building. Check in was easy and the accommodations are just as pictured. My only discomfort was the lack of A/C. There are high ceiling fans and I pulled an oscillating fan from the closet but the windows don't open and when the temp was warm, the room was even warmer. Lots of cute places to walk around downtown and though others have mentioned parking problems, we had no issues with the parking pass provided."
2018-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,So nice! Awesome surroundings! Very patient and pleasant hosts.
2018-05-01,5,Stayed one night,Great location and very accommodating hosts!
2018-04-01,4,Stayed one night,Last minute stay and it turned out great !! Thanks !
2018-04-01,4,Stayed one night,Downtown Wapakoneta was surprisingly fun and lively and neat to explore. The apartment is perfect for a fun weekend getaway. Would suggest the free street parking a couple blocks away. We were given a parking pass that said we could park overnight in the downtown area right in front of the apartment but my friend got a ticket anyway.
2018-03-01,4,Stayed one night,"Great spot, adorable furnishings and decor. Owners are quick to respond and flexible with checkin—willing to ensure that your stay goes off without a hitch. The bed is super comfy—definitely provides a good nights rest! I recommend a this space to anyone!"
2018-03-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"John-William and Kaitlynn place is decorated nicely. Matches pictures. Bathroom is a little smaller than what I expected but it does the job.
The apartment is on the second floor above there restaurant. They do play music and have trivia nights. The restaurant does close at 10 during the week and 11 weekends. So the noise is done 30-45 minutes after closing.
It is located on the old Main Street so lots of neat shops restaurant....unfortunately I did not get a chance to check them.
There is no overnight parking on the street. You can park 3 short blocks away in a church parking lot. The property is a 100 year old building or older so not much insulation to absorb noises. The space is toasty warm due two electric fireplaces.
They are very quick to respond to any questions."
2018-02-01,5,Stayed one night,place was great....highly recommend when visiting Wapakoneta.
2018-01-01,3,Stayed over a week,"Communication was great. Hosts were very accommodating. There isn’t free parking on the premises. I’d recommend this place for a night or two, but not a long term stay."
2017-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I loved the location in Wapak! Such a fun place above a restaurant and a donut shop across the street. The hosts are very accommodating and easy to communicate with. The space is historic and quaint with modern touches. It also had a smart TV with Netflix and a comfy bed. I encourage anyone to stay here!
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Overall really great experience for a quick weekend getaway! Campground was very nice and the tiny home we stayed in was great! Super clean and had everything we needed.
2024-06-01,4,Stayed with a pet,"The spot was perfect. It was convenient for fishing and to see the ducks. The home was cute & we loved the deck/outdoor area. We liked that it was only a 10 min drive to town.
There were some things we did not like, however.
-The pictures are misleading. A tornado had recently gone through the area so most amenities aren’t able to be used. I was not informed of this until 3 days before our check in and it was not included in the listing. This was too short of notice to find somewhere else to stay had we chosen to do that.
-The cleaning fee seems too high. The linens and towels did seem clean, but the floors and shower did not. My husband ended up going to the store to get Clorox wipes so I could clean the shower before we used it. I understand wanting people to wash their own dishes and take out their garbage, but the $120 cleaning fee should cover the rest of the cleaning.
Overall, we did enjoy our stay."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,We enjoyed our stay. We will be back in the summer to enjoy everything they have to offer.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The house was even better then the pictures. Comforts of your own home but away from all the hustle and bussel. We came in for our annoversary and the races ar Eldora. It was nice to come back to a place that felt like home and not a hotel room after long rainy days at the track. I have saw some reviews about the sulfur smell of the water but we are from the country and used to well water it isnt over powering. We are planning more trips to Eldora and this will be our choice of placea to stay as ling as its available. The park its self seems fun and has a lot of thing to take part in and enjoy especially furing the main season. The only downfall was matresses could be a little better but it beats the ground. 10 out of 10 for us. And we drove 7 hours.
2023-10-01,3,Stayed with kids,"Everything was nice, heat did not work though me and my two young children had a hard time keeping warm at night"
2023-09-01,3,Stayed a few nights,Was a beautiful park. Cottage was nice. Lots of amenities for kids. Down sides were High sulphor smell from water and zero service. If looking to disconnect from your phone or electronics this is the place. Kitchen was well stocked. Recommended upgrades would be be a better mattress( very uncomfortable) and a broom would of been nice. Outdoor fireplace was not working yet. Overall nice place for the price.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,We had such an amazing time on this stay. The tiny house we stayed in was so adorable. There is so much to do at the glacier hills lakes resort and rv park that we didn't want to leave! The whole community was so welcoming and friendly. The house was spotless and had everything we needed.
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Was in town for work and needed a quite place....this was perfect

2024-06-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Emily is a first-class host and is very responsive. This is the second property of hers we have stayed in and both more than met our needs. The only two down-sides for us were no tv's in either bedroom, and the carpets appear to be very dated."

Our stay was only for a night, but we are already planning on coming back to her place to see more in the area.
We enjoyed Max’s Dairy (great little ice cream place) and breakfast at the City Bakery. Highly recommend them & her place!"

And what a plus to have use of the garage. Emily and Kurt were both very responsive and helpful. Don't hesitate. Just book it, Danno!"

2024-01-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"WHAT A GEM OF A PLACE!! We actually had a two-bedroom home (part of duplex) that actually had an available garage. The home was cozy and comfortable with all the ammenities. Wow, Emily had us stocked for snacks and mini meals (even sausage biscuits for the morning) ans about all the dishwear we could imagine (so many AirBBs no longer provide the extras and have cups, glasses, cultery, and dishes missing, though they charge increasingly more like it's an easy gravy train, not a guest-based business!!). Lots of good restaurants in the area, and lots to do in the general area. we hope to get back later this year.
By the way, Emily also took the time to write a review on us as guests, something that today's AirBB hosts don't seem to want to be bothered with. I no longer write host reviews until I receive notification that the host did first as Emily did.
You can't go wrong with Emily's property here!!"

We brought our dog and toddler, with the community center across the road it was a great place to stretch our legs.

They even gave me directions to the closest CVS when I realized I had left all my make up at home! Thanks so much for a great stay!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Emily was fantastic and this AirBnB was perfect for our little family plus our beagle.

One thing that I wish I had known prior to booking was the house is in a triplex. If I had been traveling with children I probably would book elsewhere out of concern my kids could disturb the neighbors."

The price was very reasonable for a room with a private bathroom and access to the kitchen, living room, and porch with chairs/table. Don communicated effectively and informed us of the code, how to check in, where to park, etc. Coffee, tea, and water were provided, and there was much room to store food in the refrigerator/freezer. The rooms were painted and decorated with professional care, and we enjoyed the two pieces of candy left on the bed tray. If you have time, you should take a self-guided tour of the historic homes nearby, too!"

Thanks."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Charming, spacious & immaculate! The Victorian Guesthouse exceeded our expectations & is nestled within other historical homes in a safe, secure, small-town neighborhood. Check-in, parking & check-out instructions were crystal clear. It’s obvious Don is a seasoned traveler as his attention to detail ensures a comfortable stay for all guests. He & his on-site staff have carefully thought of “extra touch” amenities that just make your stay more pleasurable whether it’s complimentary coffee, tea, local restaurant menus, bedside tissues or extra blankets. The entire home is tastefully decorated, spacious but not overdone with unnecessary “fluff.” I cook while traveling as my husband & I nourish with only fresh food. The kitchen was fully stocked, & appliances, sink, dishes & utensils were spotlessly cleaned. We live in a 200 yr+ gothic revival & felt right at home in the Victorian guesthouse. Our stay was perfect. Thanks, Don!"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed one night,We enjoyed our stay at Don’s lovely home! Every detail was carefully thought of and provided for. The home is beautifully appointed with period furniture and paintings.

I would highly recommend staying here. It’s close and walkable to all the bars and eateries. And a block away from St John’s church if you are in town for a wedding.

2022-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"Don was extremely responsive and couldn’t have been easier to work with. The property was absolutely gorgeous. I highly recommend the room we stayed in - Room #4. Don supplied everything you’d hope for, from cushy towels and excellent pillows to lovely extra touches like a welcome station in the communal dining area with bottles water, snacks and self serve coffee, easy to find extra blankets and even little extras like chocolates in the room. I also love that in his welcome email with building and room entry codes he explained everything in detail. Even though Don was very quick to reply to texts, we only had to look to the email to find the answer to all of our questions (where to park, wifi password, check in and check out time, where to find things we needed, etc.). I would definitely stay at the Victorian Guesthouse again. Even if you live in or near Delphos and just want to have a lovely staycation, we say check it out! Thank you Don!"

2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Lori's place was great as always. I'll stay here evrytime I'm in town.
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Lori's place is great as always!!!
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"nice place, clean, comfortable, great price"
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Lori was an amazing host! And her home was gorgeous! Would definitely visit again!
2022-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Wow! I stumbled upon this place because I was looking for a halfway spot between me and my mom for a girls' weekend. Lori, your Airbnb was SO welcoming. I had my two little kids with me, and the four of us were totally amazed by the attention to detail to create a welcoming place--right down to Christmas decor! Everything was cozy and comfortable, and the house itself was far bigger than I was expecting! It was a nice walking distance to the downtown shopping district and very easily accessible off the interstate! We were grateful for the fully functional kitchen as we made all our meals while we were there--there were plenty of dishes, cookware, utensils, etc. We will be back!"
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Second time we stayed here. Excellent value and nice accommodations! We were visiting family in the area.
2022-11-01,5,Stayed over a week,"I have stayed at Lori's place several times and love it!! Always clean, well supplied and always a special note to greet one!
I just can't imgine staying anywhere else!!
Thanks Lori as always for a wonderful place!!
David & Carol Close"
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,What a great place to stay within walking distance to the fairgrounds very clean and even offered you snacks. We really enjoyed our stay and we’ll see you in the spring.
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great place to stay. Clean, welcoming, cozy, large rooms, big bathroom, just enough space to move around. One of the cleanest places I have stayed and I would definitely stay again."
2022-10-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Highly recommended! The house is very comfortable, and Lori is an excellent host."
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Such a cute place in such a nice quiet neighborhood of Wapak! If it is available book immediately!! We will definitely be back.
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We have stayed at this property many times. Lori is always so great to work with and the home is always super clean and has anything you need. Highly recommend staying here.
2022-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,This house is great! We were in town for just a few days and loved our stay here! The house is very roomy and welcoming. I loved the music playing and welcome note on the table at check in. Very nice touch! Beds were very comfortable and the house was incredibly clean. Definitely recommend!
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Lori's 707 was perfect for our stay in Wapakoneta for our WHS Class of '72 50th reunion. The location is easy to get to, on an improved side street far enough away from the sound of the trains, but close to everything.
The patio is private, but open and relaxing for morning coffee, afternoon relaxing, and evening dinner. The lawn is beautifully tended.
Don't hesitate—just book it . . .but don't take MY dates. I don't want to stay anywhere else. 😉"
2022-09-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Lori was very kind at the beginning, and answered all of my questions. Was very hospitable and you could easily see the difference between someone you can feel comfortable communicating with, and someone you might wanna stay away from. The house was very nice and roomy. It was clean, minus some strands of hair and spider webs, and though they were not necessary for me personally, Lori did provide quite a lot for your stay. Towards the end of the stay, I stopped feeling that warm hospitality from Lori. Especially when check out day came. I worked night shift, and my hours were shared with Lori from the beginning. Just to be considerate of the security/alert system I figured she would have. Of course I’m sure Lori had other things going on, but I just feel like some consideration would have been pretty cool. I wasn’t sent any check-out instructions, so when I went to check if the 12th was still open, so that I could ask if it would be okay to check out a little later than 11am, even if it meant pulling sheets, doing the trash (which I did anyway), and just making her job easier in any way, I saw that just the 12th was crossed out and the rest of the week and following week were open. So I figured right there was me being told to wake up extra early😂 This morning I checked and those empty days are now crossed out, so I really didn’t bother asking what else I could do. Again, I’m sure it was nothing intentional. I just feel like giving someone more than 4ish hours to sleep after a 12 hour nursing shift, and communicating to them check out instructions would have been a lot more considerate. Not required by any means, just a caring and kind thing to do☺️And to my POC searching for a safe(r) place to stay, this area of Wapakoneta treated me just fine. Everyone seemed very chill and to themselves. It’s pretty quiet. There’s a Walmart down the street that I went to when it was dark, and no one paid me any mind. I felt no discomfort, and if anything…the ones who did speak seemed very nice. Only place I felt kinda uncomfy (more so annoyed because I was sleepy😭) was in Saint Marys at the Kroger Gas Station. Nothing serious, just an older man staring quite intensely. Things do close very early here though, so keep that in mind when out and about."
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Lori is an amazing host who will promptly reply to any questions, before and after your stay! The house was very tidy and exceeded our needs. My friends and I came to the area for a wedding and actually helped the bride get ready there because the lighting and set up of the house was better than a hotel suite that she rented out for the day! I will definitely be back in the area to visit family and this place will be my first choice everytime. Location is safe and downtown has a fun, local atmosphere which is an added bonus!"
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Lori’a place is wonderful, cozy, and perfect location for quiet time."
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Super clean with thoughtfully spread throughout this home. Great stay and I highly recommend

2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great house, very clean and stocked with lots of items, quiet neighborhood, great patio area for afternoon or evening drinks.

Lori was very responsive and gave recommendations for the area.
We will definitely stay again if our travels brought us to the area."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very nice place. Nice friendly people in the neighborhood. Great host.
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had the good fortune of staying at Lori's place while working in Lima. We arrived late on Monday night and were so happy to find snacks and cold water after our flight and delays from Texas.
The home is very nice inside and out. The two bedrooms were very comfortable with high quality linens and bedding. Both were well appointed, very clean and everyone reported a great night's sleep.
The bathroom was nice and had good hot water. Water pressure was good and towels were plentiful as were amenities like shampoo, conditioner, etc.
The living room and den were well appointed, with comfortable seating. We didn't watch TV while there, but I'm sure it worked well as everything else in the house. We enjoyed the siri controlled music and AC.
We enjoyed sitting outside in the evening. There are several places where you can relax. In the winter, there's a fire pit. There was a very nice gas grill that I would have enjoyed using had we stayed longer.
The neighborhood is quiet and friendly. We saw kids out on bikes, walks, etc.
This is a wonderful place to stay. Highly recommend!"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Lori was a great host, she responded to my messages immediately, no wait time at all, had great seating for everyone outside, we didn’t use the fire pit, but that was a added bonus and the jet tub was amazing after spending 3 days at the country concert. Will recommend to anyone!"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This a very clean, comfortable and well appointed home. Lori has thought of everything a traveler needs. The location was central to everything we needed to do in town. We'll definitely rent this home again."

2022-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,Lori is a great host! The house was extremely clean and very well put together. If we are ever in that area again we would definitely stay at the house.
2022-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Loris place is my favorite air bnb yet!! It’s so perfect for what I needed and cost effective! Lori was very flexible when I needed to adjust dates. Super close to all the places I needed to go in wapakoneta. So many good attractions. It was too hot for a campfire but that’s a great perk to this home as well. Plus a grill, patio for kids to ride scooters etc. the beds are very comfty and the house was really well supplied. I’ll def be back"
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,My husband and I attend the race at Eldora yearly. Before we had always rented a hotel room which was always crowded. This house allowed us to rest and relax with space!
2022-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,Lori is a wonderful host: kind and thoughtful. And the home is peaceful and beautiful. It's a great floorplan. There are even some storage containers provided for your leftovers! There are plenty of dishes. It is a very well thought through home. We are definitely keeping this place in mind for return visits.
2022-05-01,5,Stayed over a week,"What a fantastic two weeks plus two days my parents had while staying at Lori's place! Everything was clean, the neighborhood was safe, all the amenities were wonderful and more than what was already described. Having a grill with outdoor seating was also highly appreciated. Off street parking was a bonus. My mother, who is legally blind, had no trouble navigating the house. before they visit from out of state again we will be sure to book available dates at Lori's house :-)
they were so many unexpected extras: from snacks and Keurig coffee pods, to both plastic and glass plates. Having lighting on a timer was a bonus for when my parents got ""home"" late from our house."
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Perfect all around ! Great house, cute neighborhood, total communication ! Nothing negative at all ! Would stay there again and again !"
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Book it if you can.

2021-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Lori keeps an excellent home. The beds are very comfortable, the kitchen and bathroom has everything you need (including bath jets!), and some aspects of the home can be controlled via Alexa which is very cool. The five stars do not lie, the stay is quality and the price is a steal.
Our stay included more guests than normal and she accommodated us without a second thought. We even broke a couple of her wine glasses by accident but she was very understanding. If I ever need to stay in Wapak again, I will be staying here!"

2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Lori’s place is the best home you can book, clean, cozy, comfortable; definitely recommend to anyone coming into town. Lori has exceptional communication skill and is always there to help and assist you with your needs. Couldn’t have found a better place to stay. Extremely satisfied!!!"
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This AirBnb is probably the best we've ever stayed in. An entire little house that is immaculate and beautifully decorated, with everything you need. We were able to do a little cooking and laundry, and the beds were very comfortable. We'll definitely be back!"

2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Lori does an absolute fabulous job with her Airbnb. I highly recommend this home to others. However because she does such a fabulous job we do not get to rent as often as we would like. Keep up the great work
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We give this charming home six stars out of five. This was the best AirB&B or VRBO we have ever found on our many travels. It was just perfect for our stay. Clean, comfortable, cozy and quiet oasis. All the extras - fluffy towels, snacks, 2 TVs, BBQ, lovely backyard for relaxing. Lori provided everything we needed and is very responsive to questions. Her decorative taste and attention to detail makes her home delightful. We would love to return in the future. Lynne and John Becker Colorado Springs CO"
2021-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We had an amazing stay in this cute home!! Lori made sure we had what and more of what was expected!! Very clean, extra towels, toiletries, small snacks, and most of all COFFEE PODS!!! The home is located in a very quiet and friendly town! We will definitely stay here again if available next year when we visit…. Again thanks for letting us in a few hours earlier than check in, this was not an expectation, but was a PLUS for our family, as we drove from Florida overnight 💕❤️💕"
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Tom and I have traveled the world staying at AirBnBs, we are also hosts on the platform, and I have to say Lori has one of our top homes! So much thought and care has gone into the house we immediately felt at 'home'. Lori added little touches that did not go unnoticed like the cabinets were arranged to easily and logically find things or a fully stocked first aide kit or the universal charger by the bed. When we picked Wapakoneta for our Ohio adventure I wasn't sure what to expect but we fell in love with the Temple of Tolerance and Lulu's Diner. Without our streaming services we spent nights roasting marshmallows and talking, reconnecting. As a well seasoned traveler, I wish I could give Lori's home 10 stars!"
2021-09-01,5,Stayed about a week,"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay and appreciate all the little details. It was very clean, spacious, and welcoming. A nice quiet neighborhood with easy access."

2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Fantastic place to stay! Quiet neighborhood, clean place and comfortable bed and couches."
2021-08-01,5,Stayed about a week,"If you’re in the Wapakoneta area and you need a Beautiful homie place to stay during that period Lori’s home is a wonderful option. It’s a perfect location for: cleanliness
attentiveness from owner
convenience
homie
And easy relaxation from ones travel.
I give Lori’s home a 5 star ⭐️ only because 10 was not an option! Definitely the best place I’ve had the privilege of renting! Thank you Lori!!"
2021-07-01,5,Stayed one night,This place was amazing! It was extremely clean and comfortable. One of the best bnb’s we’ve stayed at. The check in process was smooth and we had the entire house to ourselves. Highly recommend.
2021-07-01,5,Stayed over a week,"I couldn't be happier with or more strongly recommend Lori's place! The host went ABOVE AND BEYOND with not only all of the essentials one may need while traveling, but also included countless extra special and incredibly thoughtful touches in and around the home. We came to Lori's for some R&R and family visits in the middle of a cross-country move, and truly being able to feel ""at home"" between homes was such a blessing. I'm glad we have family in the area simply for the fact that we can hopefully stay here again in the future. Ten out of ten!!"

2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This property was a wonderful place to stay for location, value, and many comforts of home. Lori thought of everything as an air B and B host. We had room to relax and rejuvenate. Furthermore, Wapak is a historical small town with great restaurants, local shops, and a variety of summer family fun."
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was an absolutely perfect stay! Lori was amazing in getting the house ready and available before check-in. The house was clean and more than what we thought it was, so we were pleasantly surprised. Definitely will be coming back to Wapakoneta!!!!!!"
2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had the privilege of staying in this newly renovated Airbnb June 19-21, 2021. It was beautifully decorated and immaculately clean. The kitchen was well appointed with everything we needed for cooking and serving meals during our visit. There was a Keurig coffee maker - much to the delight of my coffee drinking family members! The dinnerware set was especially pretty and added a little something special to each of our meals. The bathroom was was well stocked with extra toilet paper and other bathroom essentials (& included thoughtful extras like a blow dryer, hair towel wraps & such). The tub had jacuzzi like jets in it (this was a nice treat after 10 hours of traveling). The towels were the large, thick, and luxurious. The bedrooms had new comfortable mattresses. There were a couple of extra blankets provided so that even the coldest natured person in our group slept comfortably. If we had gotten to stay longer, we would have definitely taken advantage of the fun family games that the hostess thoughtfully included. These are just a few examples of the many kinds of thoughtful touches throughout the home that gave hints to the owner’s thoughtfulness and hospitality.
The neighborhood was nice, quiet, and a great place to take an evening stroll. The back patio and beautiful backyard were very inviting places to hang out.
Getting back to the owner’s thoughtfulness and hospitality — she went above and beyond all expectations to make sure that this asthmatic guest could have a safe place to stay. In addition to making sure there were no plugins or other artificial fragrances, she actually washed of all the linens in unscented detergents and thought to change out the hand soaps & toiletries to unscented varieties.
The owner was also very prompt, gracious, and very helpful with her responses when we were messaging back and forth.
My family and I loved this home and all the many thoughtful, fun, practical, and beautiful touches that the owner included to make the guests feel extra welcome. As my husband aptly put it, this owner and her new Airbnb deserve a 10 out of 10!!! We would highly recommend this home to others!"
2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay will be doing it again when I need to stay in town.
2021-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,Lori did and amazing job setting up this house. It was very comfortable and felt like home right away. She was very helpful when needed and even mailed me my debit card back after I had forgotten it. House was beautiful and we hope so stay again when we are in the area.

2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We booked the Loft last-minute for two nights mid-week and were totally pleased. This place totally suits our preferences: nicely refurbished apartment in an older building. In the middle of small, friendly Wapakoneta and easily accessible to restaurants, coffee shops, antique stores.
Jo was our main contact for our stay and I cannot adequately express how helpful and quick she was with her replies to a couple questions we had AND to requests for recommendations for dinner, coffee, and craft beer! The apartment itself has plenty of room for two, a VERY comfy bed, nice shower, and very clean. A nice touch was an “I forgot” jar in the bathroom vanity for any essentials one may have forgotten to pack; we didn’t need it, but appreciated the thoughtfulness of the hosts.
We’ll be eager to stay here again when the occasion should arise!"
2023-10-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Estate was good. The place is very quiet. You don’t hear the street noise bed was very comfortable. Plenty hot water for the shower cupboards had dishes if you wanted to cook in we did not. Overall, I think the value in the location was perfect for our visit. Will use you again when we come back to Ohio."

2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a very nice three night stay at this lovely apartment. It is clean, well-equipped and very comfortable. The location is very central to all the shops and restaurants downtown. The bathroom is rather small and there is no elevator up to the second floor location, but these minor quibbles are more than offset by the many nice features of this well-appointed apartment."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Exactly as described and pictured. Cozy, clean and charming. Perfect for our weekend getaway. The extra touches - coffee, snacks and a binder with lots of info on local history, restaurants, and shops added to our positive experience. Follow Jo's guidebook recommendations, especially Lulu's for breakfast and Krave for ice cream! Would definitely stay here again when visiting the area."

Marie’s and The side rail were fantastic), lovely shops, and amazing locals. You’ll feel like your in a Hallmark movie town. Just entering Wapack; the buildings are so well preserved and the newer businesses work around the original beauty of the towns architecture. It’s truly like no other. As far as the stay, it was perfect. Very clean, felt like home, and the owners are very attentive to detail. Will be returning!!! Highly recommend!!!"

This charming apartment had everything I needed and felt like home. It was in a great location, so I was able to explore downtown and go for runs along the river on warmer days. Jo handled all of my questions and helped me with recommendations. I hope my work takes me back there so I can stay here again!"

2021-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Wonderful Airbnb! My two kids and I loved this Airbnb. It was clean, cozy, and had very thoughtful touches. The location is perfect. Parking was easier than I thought it would be. One thing to note if you happen to bring kids who nap: there is no door to the bedroom. Maybe the listing included this info, but I don’t remember seeing it. Overall it was just great!"

I had some trouble with the keypad lock, which was totally my own fault, but Jo replied to my message for help in less than five minutes. Very responsive! The personal note they left for me and the treats in the fridge were just icing on the cake. I would stay here again in a heartbeat if I am ever back to that part of Ohio!"
2021-10-01,5,Stayed over a week,Great stay I love the location everything is really walking distance the communication was amazing would definitely go back
2021-10-01,5,Stayed over a week,"This loft felt like home, the convenience to everything in downtown, the safety to walk anywhere I needed to go was a nice change from the hustle and bustle of metro USA. Being able to support numerous small businesses made it feel like I was contributing to the town even as an outsider. The apartment itself was spotless and very comfortable for my stay. Everything i needed including a keurig for my morning tea. Plenty of closets and storage for the longer stay of mine but equally quaint for a long weekend. The hosts are all fabulous and very respectful of privacy. The building was secure with keypad access, no need to worry about a key. I will come back next time in the area."
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Excellent place to stay in a wonderful small town!! Had a relaxing time and was not disappointed! This place is really awesome!!
2021-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,Def a nice place and tucked away in the best location. It's in the heart of downtown and so many shops to explore.

2021-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,It was very clean and well decorated . All the special touches were great !

2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place !
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Wapakoneta is a great town with a beautiful river walk. There is a new parking lot behind the building for overnight parking. Bed was very comfortable and the livingroom/kitchen was well stocked for one night or a whole week. Location was great for walking to restaurants, coffee shops and even a movie theater. Loved it."
2021-07-01,5,Stayed about a week,"This is a perfect place to stay for a lone traveler or a duo! Great location, sweet hosts, cozy space. Best Airbnb experience I’ve ever had."
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This apartment was perfect for our weekend stay! It had a great location right in the very heart of the little downtown; it was very comfortable for two people; and it was spotlessly clean. Check in was easy with the keypad lock. There were no issues with noise (there are other tenants in the building), so we were able to relax and sleep well. There were even some little goodies in the fridge to welcome us!
The hosts went above and beyond to find us places we could park overnight, since much of downtown (including where we could normally park) was closed for a weekend festival. We really appreciated that, since we arrived fairly late after a long drive and did not have to drive around hunting for parking.
When we return to Wapakoneta, we will definitely hope to stay here again!"
2021-07-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Alright; let me just start off by saying the apartment itself was in a fantastic neat location, clean, comfy bed/pillows, and extremely cute. In a cute old building right on the main strip with adorable little shops below. All hosts left cute little gifts from the candy store right below (which made us buy lots or candy for family), they left us a nice wine 🍷, and other little treats! Thank you!! They communicated with the checking in schedule nicely and left cute notes.
A few things to note while staying:
- If you cannot lift your luggage/bags or you are in need of a elevator do not stay here- stairs all the way up.
- There is really not adequate parking! This is literally the only reason for the 4 star instead of 5 star. ~ The parking was told to us that we could park in the back lot during the night and that there was off street parking for during the day and a new parking lot coming (which was done while being there). OK well the parking for night time is for 530pm-7am and parking off street is 2 hour max and no parking between 230am-530am. So you have to be up before 7am to move your car onto the street or public parking which just finished and is still only 2 hours or your car gets towed. When I say that, I mean it. Our rental car was TOWED from the lot for not being out of there right at 7am. I'm not blaming anyone really because that's my bad but maybe figure out a deal with the landlord to get a pass that guests can use while they're there. Ohio is 3 hours ahead from where I'm from and we came from a concert every night so we were exhausted and wanted to sleep in just to come out to find our rental gone. Luckily it only cost $100 plus a uber to get it back, but $100 more than I wanted to spend. If your able to get a pass to leave in the BnB so guest don't get towed in the middle of the night or early morning that would really be best.
All in all I had a great time and the apartment was wonderful to stay at. Thank you."
2021-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,Great place! Super nice host and excellent value. We had an awesome stay!
2021-06-01,5,Stayed over a week,Cute place near many downtown shops and restaurants. Great place for a weekend get away or extended stay.

2024-06-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Great alternative to a hotel.
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"The Moonflower Inn was a quaint little place for a quick getaway! It was very clean, and except for some traffic noises, very quiet! The evening stay was budget-friendly, and I do plan on returning in the future!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We were in town for a graduation and this was the perfect place for the two of us. Very clean and comfortable. Host communication was great! I would happily stay here again!
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay. Super friendly and helpful. During my stay a bad storm came through and Michelle offered me to come over to her house when tornadoe sirens were going off. I politely declined but it was nice to know that was a choice I had. I've stayed in several air b and b's and never thought about what to do during bad weather.
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,I love the care and detail. Put it is voice and it set up really nice. A very nice small place to stay if anyone's looking for a place to stay in this town.

2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Most reasonable price, with few limitations. No pool, sallow sink. But quiet, spacious enough and sufficient lighting to read and work.

2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Nice little place
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"This adorable unique tiny house exceeded our expectations. We arrived later than planned, but Michelle had the lights on, radio on, it felt like I was walking into my house at home. While we didn't stay as long as we had hoped, our time at Moonflower Inn was delightful. The water temperature varied a little in the shower, but the super clean linens, towels, and comfy bed more than made up for the water temp variance. It has been thoughtful appointed, and could only be improved by the planned fence and flower garden! Michelle had amazing response time and directed us to some of the best places to visit in town. Thank you for sharing this little haven of rest with us!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Moon Flower Inn, is the perfect little oasis. Just a pit stop to lay our heads for adventures in Dayton. I would stay here again over any hotel. The value, the ambience and ease getting around to nearby areas."

2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Had to reschedule due to the weather. Michelle was accommodating right from the start. We spent presidents day weekend here to visit with our son who attends UNOH. The place is truly a gem and absolutely feels like a home away from home. There were lots of extras for a personal touch such as the sound machine, TV, and radio were playing when we arrived. If you have forgotten something, chances are it will be there and if not, the owners are more than receptive to helping you! We truly enjoyed our time here and thank you for making our stay perfect!"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed one night,Air b and b fees have gone out of control hotels are cheaper I like this location because it is a nice cozy place to relax.i am not sure how much more I can stay at the air band b locations unless rates are lowered

2023-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"We really enjoyed our stay and what you did with the tiny home. Just perfect for a quick in town visit for the Mayberry Market. It was very comfortable, clean and loved the decor."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is the second time I've stayed at the Moonflower Inn. Both times it was a very pleasant experience. I first stayed there in Apr-May 2022. I found the place charming and the service provided by its owners above all expectations. There were added little extras that no one expects. The radio softly playing classical music when I walked in, delicious snacks in a basket on the counter in the kitchen, bottled water in the fridge.
I'm originally from Wapakoneta, and the Moonflower immediately became my home back home.
This time, I arrived at night. It was a happy sight to see little decorative lights lit on the porch railings and the porch light on. The key was where Michelle had told me it would be and when I walked in, lights welcomed me in the interior as did classic rock playing softly on the vintage-style radio. I immediately noticed new improvements: the shower had been comfortably enlarged and there was a new armchair in the sitting area.
The Moonflower is simply the best!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I don’t quite understand it, but occasionally this place reminded me of many of the familiar homes of my life. More than once I noticed the Moonflower Inn described as a home away from home. This small space felt like a second home to me and I endorse that account. It’s also a close and short walk to Auglaize St, the downtown area. When I return, this will now be my first choice for lodging."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The stay here was excellent! Everything was clean, exactly what was listed, and was such a beautiful place. I would highly recommend staying here!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My husband was in the area for several days and was looking for a safe, comfortable spot to stay in. This more than met his expectations. Michelle communicated with us regularly before his stay, and was flexible with check in time as his schedule was somewhat unpredictable. Michelle's place was clean and very comfortable; it exceeded expectations. I would highly recommend a stay here."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"I Love Staying here Whenever I'm in in the Area.Very Clean...Easy Check in,Safe,Very Comfortable.The Host is Wonderful! My Third Time Staying Here.Love it!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great comfortable getaway for up to 2 people. The many little things make it feel much like home away from home. Comfortable, inviting, and relaxing. Quaint little town to enjoy during the day.
Just don't plan to cook a big meal here...simple meal prep or eating out is the way to go."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Michelle came over to greet me and it made my trip worth the drive. The tiny house was larger than I expected and was beautiful inside and out. I really had a great visit and would recommend Michelle and The Moonflower Inn to anyone who is visiting Wapakoneta, Ohio. it's a beautiful, historic town and Michelle's place for right in.

Everything said and described was accurate. It was comfortable, clean, smelled good, quiet and the bed was very comfortable! Michelle was responsive to messages. We enjoyed seeing Wapakoneta and eating at Bob Evans. It was nice for our one night stay, but would certainly be great for a longer stay. We would truly recommend this cute place to anyone.
Thank you, Michelle!"

2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Michelle’s place was perfect for my stay. A very cute and eclectic old Sears and Roebuck house that her and her husband have fixed up. Place is perfect for 1-2 people looking a short stay. Both she and her husband are super nice and would recommend chatting with them if they are around.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This little house was the perfect place to go for a little weekend getaway! perfect size for two people, clean, comfortable and so lovely.... the vibe, colors, decor all fantastic.

2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Stopped in for a quick overnight stay and this was the perfect destination! This is the cutest tiny home and made a great sleepover spot for me and my little sister.

2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Nice, friendly hosts, comfortable and welcoming accomodations. Enjoyed my stay."

2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Awesome stay as before .. affordable and very comfortable. Love this little house and am hoping to create my own some day. Michelle’s place had been a lifesaver 100 times better then any hotel 😀
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The space was quite comfortable, easy to find, and very well maintained. The kitchen was a little more bare-bones than expected, but still workable for a couple nights stay without having to eat out for any meals."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,An absolute gem!!! I work nights and slept so well during the day. The house is clean and comfortable! I really enjoyed my stay.

2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place was perfect for us! We were in OH for WGI World Guard Championships. Our 16 year old stayed at another location with her guard, so it was just my husband and myself. We arrived late and were able to check in without issue. Very attentive owners, wonderful communication! Michelle and Rob had everything we needed in their tiny Sears house, including Charmin toilet paper and Q-Tips! Loved their guide to things about the town. We tried out one of their dining suggestions, and it was delicious! Would definitely stay here again and have already recommended to friends."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We LOVED all of the Wapakoneta decorations, readings, etc. Very easy and comfortable place to stay. Friday night some bad storms came thru the area and Michelle was over to see us on Saturday morning to see if we were okay and needed anything. Wonderful host!!"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed about a week,"This home was the perfect AirBnB! The host, Michelle, was friendly and kind. She would occasionally check-in on me via message to ensure everything was going well during my stay. The home was clean, quiet and safe. It was in a great location, as the local grocery stores, restaurants and gas stations were only a block or two away! Thank you again!"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Michelle's little tiny house was extremely convenient and easy to get to. This is a cute little bungalow style house that is an original Sears and Roebuck mail order house. I love the two wingback chairs in the little entry. she has made great use of the space. Super comfortable bed and she has included a sound machine for the traffic. however we were never bothered by it. Michelle is dedicated to making your stay positive, recommending some amazing places to visit, making sure you have everything you need and supplying you with cookies. She is also very respectful of your privacy! Thanks Michelle, we had a great visit, even though we never mastered saying the name of the town 😉🤗"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed about a week,Fell right at home with this one. It has such a good vibe to the place. Clean and comfortable. Quiet area but everything is right around the corner it's a real convenient spot.
2023-03-01,4,Stayed one night,Rob and Michelle are very accommodating. They tried their best to make sure the guest feels right at home. The place was spotless and lovely.

2023-01-01,5,Stayed one night,very cute place.
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Always a great stay with Michelle. She constantly checks in, and makes sure you’re having a good stay/need anything."
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This space is perfect for my husband while working in the area. Michelle has been so friendly and hospitable each time my husband has stayed here. I’m sure we’ll be back soon!
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very cozy and had great additions such as a sound machine and black out curtains which was perfect for sleeping during the day for night shift.
2022-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,This tiny house was great and worked well for traveling with an infant. It had a curtain that blocked off the entry way so baby could sleep while we could still access the rest of the place.
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Michelle was so helpful & friendly. She helped us adjust our stay when weather impacted travel and made sure we arrived safely. The Moonflower Inn was everything she described. Very cozy and tons of little touches to make guests feel welcome. There was music playing when we walked in and treats waiting for us. It is a charming tiny house that is bigger than it seems at first. Michelle & Rob were very quick to address an issue we had with the shower (within an hour) and even vacuumed after being in the cottage. The bed i& linens are very comfy. The whole experience was wonderful with a neighborly, small town feel. Our visit was over Christmas and during horrible blizzard conditions but the Moonflower was warm and sturdy. It is a tiny house, so as long as you are prepared for that and able to adjust it is great. Two minor challenges are the lack of space in the sink area and furnace noise, but neither are a major drawback. Overall an excellent stay - small town gem!"
2022-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"Michelle was very flexible and proactive and allowed me to change my reservation to a day earlier to avoid the upcoming storm.
Check in was easy, parking was simple and right at the door.
The snacks were a welcome surprise and although I was only staying the night during a long drive it felt very welcoming!"
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was a very cozy place in a small community. Quiet, quaint, and way better than any of the hotels around. The hosts were very friendly and spent quite a bit of time chatting about the town. Highly recommend if you're swinging through Wapakoneta!"
2022-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great little place, easy to find and easy to check in. I recommend it to anyone."

2022-11-01,5,Stayed one night,I love this place always very peaceful and comfy!! There was a couple things but Michelle took care of it!
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Really cute little place. Clean, well decorated. I liked the extra supplies at the house, like a deck of cards, a crossword book, etc. It's private. very warm (even though it was super cold outside while we were there). Michelle was nice and told us everything ahead of time."
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The tiny house was close to the two places I intended to go as well as main street shopping, restaurants etc. Very convenient. Mostly I appreciated the intimate hermitage like space. I was there when the weather was cold, rainy and snowing. The unit was warm and comfortable."
2022-11-01,5,Stayed one night,Perfect little place! It was so homey and comfy feeling…you don’t always get those at air bnbs. You can tell there was a lot of thought and care put into making us feel at home and to have everything we may need. The town is cute and I wish we would have had more time to check it out more. Would definitely recommend staying here.
2022-11-01,5,Stayed one night,Great small house

2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The moon flower Inn was absolutely perfect for my husband and I. Michelle is a perfect host messaging you to see if you need anything. We loved being able to visit family all day in Lima come back and rest. Outside the landscape has the cutest details. We didn’t get to sit outside where there’s a little fire pit on chilly nights. Inside is decorated so cute, it’s just soooo cozy, it may be the salt rock that sets the calming mood. We had breakfast at the cutest diner called Lou Lou’s DELICIOUS!! Due to our short weekend visit for my husbands surprise b-day we didn’t get to meet Eric & Michelle but will next time. This is our stay place when visiting family from now on!!"

2022-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"The Moonflower Inn is truly a hidden gem. We were looking for a unique place to stay during an impromptu road trip and this little house proved to be the perfect spot! From the moment we stepped inside the weariness of travel was replaced by delight as the cozy and inviting interior welcomed us “home” for the night. Michelle has done an amazing job selecting the perfect decor for the space and providing all the necessities. The road can be somewhat busy but, we slept soundly thanks to the Homedics sound spa conveniently located in the bedroom. We won’t hesitate to stay again if our travels bring us through town."
2022-08-01,5,Stayed one night,thanks for having me. we are active hosts and curious what your average occupancy is in a smaller town.

2022-07-01,5,Stayed one night,Beautiful little space quit very accommodating
2022-07-01,5,Stayed one night,Michelle was a great host! Super friendly and responsive! 10/10 would recommend
2022-07-01,5,Stayed one night,Clean and comfortable little house. Michelle is a great hostess. Having a white noise machine was nice since I usually sleep with a fan and forgot to bring one.
2022-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"This tiny house is quaint, comfortable, and very reasonably priced. Though we were only able to stay for one night on our way from NY to IL, we will definitely keep this in mind when making that trip in the future! Michelle’s place has such a warm feeling and we felt welcome the second we opened the door. We’d highly recommend this to anyone staying in the area or passing through- a gem!!"
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This is by far the best Airbnb I’ve stayed in - perfect size - fits the tiny home vibe but bigger and better - a historic Sears home that’s quiet and comfortable and laid out perfectly! Shower and bathroom are great - kitchen amenities are great - beautiful neighborhood and friendly city! I recommend to anyone! Perfect!
2022-05-01,5,Stayed about a week,"The Moonflower Inn in a unique space--clean, cozy, well-appointed and homey. The owners are friendly, courteous and ever available to meet their guests' needs. The place is a short walk from historical downtown Wapakoneta, equally close to grocery stores and chain restaurants on the outer edge of town near I-75, and less than two blocks from the famous Rock Garden. A really great place to stay."
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Found this cozy little place while looking for a place to stay while visiting family! Was definitely better in person than the pictures, and it was extremely comfortable place with personal touches all over. It included a few snacks and a lot of general things you’d need in case you forgot. It’s also near downtown which has quite a few new restaurants and a plant shop. Definitely would stay again when visiting in the future!"
2022-05-01,5,Stayed one night,So charming! Michelle is an amazing host and the beautiful house is filled with all kinds of personal touches. Best airBnB I've stayed in.
2022-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"This is the most adorable little house! I've always wanted to see a Sears house and took advantage of this opportunity. It is decorated adorably. So many little special things were provided--seasonings, coffee, tea, and snacks in the kitchen; a bed tray; personal items. The check-in process was simple, and the hosts were very accessible."

2022-04-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"What a cute, quirky tiny house! The owners have made efficient use of every available space to create a comfy atmosphere. It was easy to find but the location is a bit noisy at night with trains and road traffic, so may not be the best for a light sleeper. Overall we had a very pleasant experience."

Michelle is a great communicator and a top-notch host! Hope to visit again in the future."
2022-01-01,4,Stayed one night,"Very cute and cozy small place. The only thing that could have made it better would be a more comfortable bed, it was a bit hard."
2022-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The Moonflower Inn is incredibly cozy and comfortable. There were small comforts that made it obvious Michelle really thought through the details. The location was close enough to walk anywhere you wanted to go if you wanted. Michelle was wonderful to work with! If I’m ever in the area I will definitely try booking with her again!

2022-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great stay!
2022-01-01,5,Stayed about a week,This stay and tiny home were absolutely immaculate. Check in was contactless and simple. Michelle was beyond accommodating. We will be returning every time we need a place to stay in Wapak (if it’s available!). Way more comfortable/convenient/ and a better value than the hotels in town.
2021-12-01,5,Stayed one night,This is the second time we stayed here and everything was great! We will definitely be staying here next time we’re in town.
2021-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Cozy and inviting !!!’

2021-12-01,5,Stayed over a week,If you need to stay in Wapakoneta I would definitely recommend Moonflower Inn
2021-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"I asked before hand if they had regular tv, because I love OSU football, and didn't want to miss the game. Michelle wasn't sure, but she came over before hand, and tried to find it for me. I think that was wonderful, as I usually have a hard time with new tvs. She just said to leave the tv on while I went to my event. She also brought over a drink & snacks.
The Moonflower Inn is so cozy & lovely, the entrance is a wonderful sitting room. Then there's the bedroom, with a very cozy bed! It had everything I needed to pass the night safe & well rested.
The kitchen was adequate for my needs. I'm happy not to cook!
If the weather had been warmer, I would have sit out & enjoyed the yard. Maybe another time. I hope I have an opportunity to stay again. Such a neat little place."
2021-10-01,5,Stayed one night,More beautiful than can be communicated by pictures alone
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Michelle’s tiny house is just right! The bed was very comfy and linens were nice. I liked the convenience to downtown and being able to walk there on that beautiful autumn Saturday.
The check in/out instructions were straightforward. The kitchen included basics so I didn’t have to worry about going out for coffee & breakfast after arriving late the previous night. The artisan soaps and bottled water are a nice touch. Next time I’m in the area I hope to stay again."
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay that’s close to everything west central Ohio has to offer. Michelle is a great host .
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This Inn isn't for large or tall people, thought it's awesome for us little folks.

2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This tiny house is a terrific place to stay in Wapak. You have the place all to yourself, and the friendly hosts live across the street so super convenient if you need anything. Walkable to downtown; short drive to groceries and Armstrong museum. Comfortable sitting room, big bed, quiet. Not a complete kitchen, but you can make simple meals easily. We were there 5 days and never needed to go to a restaurant. Ask Michelle where to get the best cinnamon rolls in town!"
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What a great little place! We were here for a very short time and really just needed a place to sleep, but wish we had had more time to spend in the area, maybe next time!"

2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Super happy with my stay experience. The cottage was easy to find, quite comfortable, and the check in / check out process was a breeze. The location is such that there is early noise from folks starting their workdays and from the train, but I was up early anyway so it wasn’t a bother. If I had wanted to sleep in, I would have used my earplugs since I am a light sleeper."
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very close to my childhood neighborhood. Wonderful area close to local restaurants and downtown. Comfortable and cozy.
2021-09-01,5,Stayed one night,Always a Great Stay at the Moonflower!! Very Clean..Good Location...Very Cute Place.My Second time Staying here!!I Loved it!!
2021-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"It was a very short stay, but Michelle’s little house was perfect."
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Even though the listing says tiny house for 1 or 2 people it's not that tiny it's actually quite roomy, about 300 sq.ft. I'm 6' 6"" and the only issue I had was I bumped my head into the light fixture in the bathroom bathroom a couple times other than that no issues. The place was really clean, actually super clean!
It's well stocked with just about anything you could think of utensils, cups, coffee maker, popcorn, candies, sheets, pillows, bath soaps, towels, even cotton balls and cutips for makeup. I really didn't need anything other than some drinks & snacks and food I bought to eat that went into the college sized fridge.
There is a kitchenette with enough for meals for 2-4 and a hot plate but no stove. No kitchen sink but across from the bathroom is a sink in the common area. Front and rear entrances. Fire pit with 2 chairs.
Smart TV with plenty of channels. Decor is nice and plenty of outlets for portable device charging. Made my business trip comfortable in the evenings. I'll definitely stay again.
Never met the hosts but they live right across the street & super quick responses to questions and they even washed the hot plate despite me going to my meeting and forgetting to tell them I left it on the porch.
Too good you say? Ok only 2 small things. It's one property off a main road and about 100 yards from train tracks. So there was road traffic noise and while I was there and probably a dozen trains passed by nightly. Not annoying but I heard them watching TV & in bed."
2021-08-01,5,Stayed one night,This tiny home is one of our favorites now. It had everything you need and more. It was extremely clean and well organized. The restaurants in the area were amazing as well as the extra amenities in the home made this the perfect little get away. We will deffinatly be booking another stay!

2021-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"Very good stay, cozy and comfortable, wish I could’ve stayed a little longer! Photos are accurate, it was super clean and the check in was so easy. Definitely recommend!"
2021-07-01,5,Stayed one night,My husband and I loved staying here! It was the perfect place for the 2 of us to stay. Michelle does a wonderful job!
2021-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"Relaxed, refreshed and renewed, with also the comfiest bed ever, in this cute little ‘zen pod’! The space was cozy and welcoming, every amenity needed was provided, the location is walkable to restaurants and coffee shops… definitely highly recommend!"
2021-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"I can't say enough good things about Michelle and this wonderful space. When I walked in, I was so blown away by all of the eclectic details and the coziness of the house. Michelle was incredibly communicative, and offered wonderful suggestions for things to do in the area. The bed is super comfortable. The pictures really do not do this place justice. I highly recommend staying here, and will definitely be back!"
2021-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"The inn was exactly what I needed on my trip. Clean, cute and just right for a solo traveler."
2021-06-01,5,Stayed one night,It was a very convenient location and super cozy. I would highly recommend.
2021-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Cute little place to stay! The host came and welcomed us once we arrived, and gave us recommendations on where to go for dinner. Clean, plus there were fun touches specifically related to the town, which added a lovely extra element to the space."
2021-06-01,5,Stayed one night,Michelle is super wonderful! Gracious and accommodating! Very quick to respond to messages. The bed was very comfortable and the space was just the right amount. It felt like staying in a hotel without having any other guest to be mindful of. Everything was exceptionally clean and easy to use. And the ambiance was relaxing. I hope to stay here again in the future!
2021-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"What a great place! It’s tiny, but awesome. Cozy, comfortable, clean. Lots of little details have been thought about. Looking forward to another stay… hopefully it will be sometime when I am able to do more than just sleep here."
2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"If you’re traveling through wapokeneta and need a place to relax, this is it. This place is 20 times better than any hotel around the area, I highly recommend."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,Would highly recommend you booking with rewa very kind and respectful and always there if you need anything if you text her or call would definitely be back to visit again 🥇
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,Great value lots of space for several people would stay again for sure!
2023-10-01,5,Stayed about a week,Great host. Shelley was very responsive and accommodated our later than usual check-in.
2023-10-01,4,Stayed with a pet,"Place was great! Only complaints would be that the mattress was not comfortable at all and the water had a terrible odor. Other than that- the place was well stocked, super clean and we felt right at home."
2023-10-01,4,Stayed a few nights,We enjoyed the area and the model we stayed in. It was nice to have access to a full kitchen and open living room. Lots of storage options and a full deck. Plenty of activities for all.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,What a great place! So much to do! Will be back for sure!!!!
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful mini house absolutely love it, I most definitely would recommend the host gets a blow up mattress for the loft that would make everything so much better. But everything was beyond amazing and most definitely would stay again. The campground it self was so peaceful and so clean and everyone was so friendly. I definitely would recommend this to anyone. Shelley was super easy to work with as well."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We enjoyed our stay. I think there could be less younger children (10-14) driving the golf carts in the resort. The site we stayed at was right across from the lake. It was a nice view. The unit was really clean.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Great place at Glacier Hills. Newer module. Lots to do for family onsite. Safe area
Allows pets. Nice dog park on property to let dogs run off energy.
Quality bed, bath and kitchen linens. No extra blankets.
Games, deck of cards, coloring books/crayons, DVD player with several movies.
Rental was clean.
Water is well water so bring bottled for drinking. Okay to wash dishes and bathe in but definitely not tasteful for drinking.
Bed not very comfortable but okay for couple nights. Recommend bringing air mattress for extra guests as fold out mini couch and portable mattress in loft not adequate or comfortable for adults. Kids will be fine.
Plenty of cookware and utensils. Would suggest metal spatula made for grilling as there is only plastic kitchen spatula.
Widow AC units in living room and in loft. HVAC system did not seem to be set up for AC. Bedroom in back quite warm at night. Needed fan to be comfortable.
Guest WiFi weak, seldom had signal. Cell service spotty."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We really enjoyed our stay and had wished we would have booked it for a day or 2 longer. Other than our unlucky bout of rain, it was really a great stay!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,Great place to stay. Only thing it’s missing is a broom and some extra blankets
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This place (and the campground it’s on) is so cute! Lots of amenities that aren’t listed on the app. The bed wasn’t the most comfortable thing I’ve ever slept on, but the surroundings more than made up for it. Sitting on the deck overlooking the pond (with a creek behind the house) made my soul happy.
Amenities: Kitchen is fully stocked, board games, movies, linens, extra pillows, coffee. It’s located at an RV campground. Quiet, cute place with a great pool, playground, lake, mini golf course, pickleball court and more. People are super nice there and the office staff are helpful. The community has a gate with code to drive in.
The assigned host in the app was slow to respond and there were no checkin instructions provided, but just go to the office and they’ll take care of you!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a great stay. Beautiful, clean and lots to do."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"A beautifully decorated home to match the lake theme. Loved having extra toys, amenities that were child friendly. Our stay was perfect to be near family during our visit."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The house is exactly what the description says. she provides a very helpful book so making check in and check out easy, places to eat, and things to do. The houses are close together but still very peaceful and quiet. The water being so close makes it very convenient to throw out a line in the water."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"Highly recommend this place! Perfect location, clean and Sarah made it super easy to communicate and help with any issues."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed about a week,"I love staying at this location. It is a nice town and everything is walkable from this apartment. I recomend Winans coffee a rosy the street, and Alpha Bar 100 feet down the street."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,She was amazing. She responded so fast and the place was so cute with a great view.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed over a week,I stay here every time I work in this area. This is a fantastic location.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed over a week,Another reviewer said that this place makes you feel like the Mayor of Wapakenta; I agree. I loved this place because of the location and view. There is plenty to see and do all in a short walking distance. The weather was perfect while I stayed and all the windows offered a fantastic cross breeze. I have to mention beds too. They are quality mattresses which makes all the difference to me. Thank you Sarah for a great place to stay. I will be booking again.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed about a week,Good place.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,This place will make you feel like the mayor of Wapakoneta. It’s situated with great views of the entire downtown block. The place is so big I could play hide and go seek with my daughter. You can tell the host has done some stylish improvements but the place retains a great retro vibe. It is a short walk from many great restaurants and and shops.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Very clean, tidy and spacious AirBnb apartment. It had everything that we needed and more! Beds were comfortable, and Sarah even provided earplugs in case of nighttime noises. Sarah is a great host and was very responsive to every question we had. We had a great stay, and would stay again!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"Beautiful location, sweet little town, and extremely clean. The rhinestoned handles made the stay :)"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful place and fun quaint location. Parking could be easier but no fault of the host.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Sarah was so welcoming and super easy to communicate with.
She felt like chatting with a girlfriend!
Cannot wait to stay again!
Be sure to check it her custom boutique just downstairs below as well!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,Sarah’s place was perfect for our family to stay in for a couple nights! Beautiful location and beautiful inside.
2023-05-01,3,Stayed with kids,It was OK.
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Thank you!
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Sarah’s place was spotless and comfortable. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay, and the location is perfect for walking to all things downtown. We were attending my Uncle’s 90th birthday party next door at the Eagles, and this location could not have been more convenient.
A lot of my family has lived in the Wapakoneta area their entire lives, or grew up there and now visiting from out of town/state, so it was fun for them to take a quick peek inside this historic building:)
Thank you, Sarah!"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"We had a fun girl's night at Kelsey One. It was clean, comfortable and well appointed. Close to restaurants, shops and super easy to find. We'll be back!"
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Sarah's place was a great restoration of a large historic apartment. The amenities were very good and spot on with the listing. Beds were very cozy. Overall the apartment was very spacious and just steps from interesting shops and good restaurants. Sarah was an instantly responsive host and a great conversationalist.
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Perfect location - great apartment! Our stay was amazing!
2022-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We had a wonderful stay at Kelsey One. It’s more beautiful than the pictures. It has everything you need yo feel right at home. The town is so quaint with shopping and restaurants. We had so much fun at Rhinestone lipgloss, it is absolutely fabulous. Our girls trip was definitely a blast."
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great
2022-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"The place is excellent and the host, Sarah, is wonderful. She has gone out of her way to accommodate our needs for our unique needs. We definitely recommend this place and the wonderful host to you."
2022-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We enjoyed our stay at Sarah’s place very much. The location was very good, and the size of the unit was amazing. The listing was very accurate. There were a number of stairs to get to the second floor, but we were able to negotiate them well with a bunch of infant supplies, pack n play, suitcases, etc. The kitchen was clean and very well stocked. I appreciated the complimentary coffee, too! The rooms were very spacious. My only suggestion would be to put up a heavy curtain or door between the 2nd bedroom and hallway leading to the bathroom as that bedroom had no door on that side, and every time someone went into the bathroom, the light would shine in the bedroom. We will definitely stay again when we return to Wapakoneta!"
2022-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"This apartment is fabulous!
Great little touches and very nice! We will return!"
2022-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"Sarah created a perfect place to stay after our wedding night! She knew we had just gotten married and provided us with snacks and champagne once we got back to the air bnb. She also had rose petals as you walked in the door! It was the perfect way to end our night!
The house was very clean and provided anything that we forgot. The communication was great leading up to our stay and even after our stay!"
2022-08-01,5,Stayed one night,Didnt get to stay long enough in this little piece of paradise!! Will most definitely be back! Thank you Sarah for providing such a great place to stay in such a lovely historic town!!
2022-08-01,5,Stayed one night,Great location and very clean
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We have stayed at AirBnB’s around the world, in at least 10 countries. Sarah’s place was a perfect quiet place to stay. It was near shops and food that we could walk to and enjoy. It’s huge so was very comfortable with our friends. There were spices to cook with and coffee too! Very clean and the beds were comfortable!"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed one night,Great place. 2nd time I have stayed there
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"My husband, MIL and our 1.5 year old stayed for a weekend. The location is amazing, we enjoyed walking to the antique stores and restaurants. The blackout curtains were great for nap time. The windows are new, which makes all the difference in a historic building. It was a 90 degree weekend and we were very comfortable inside with the AC units. There are so many thoughtful details throughout. Would love to stay again."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"I am so pleased with my weekend stay at Sarah’s apartment. The location is right downtown which was within walking distance of restaurants and local shops. This was perfect as we had a family reunion in St Mary’s and it was the weekend of the Wapakoneta Summer Moon Festival.
Check in/out was simple and Sarah was easy to communicate with.
The apartment is just as the photos show, was clean and the design and decor were wonderful. We would definitely stay again!"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The space was exactly as advertised and was perfect for what we needed it for! Communication with Sarah was great as well!
2022-07-01,4,Stayed about a week,Nice apartment
2022-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"The pics don’t do this place justice. Location, space, and little extras are all here in this cute apartment. You will not be disappointed!!"
2022-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Great place, great location and excellent communication from the owner."
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is a very nice place to stay! Very clean and stocked with everything you can think of. They even offer ear plugs in case the train is a bother, we never paid it any attention. Loved being right on the Main Street. All the shops were fun to shop in and see the historical buildings were amazing! If we are in that area again we will definitely stay in the same place."
2022-05-01,5,Stayed one night,Sarah was very quick to respond to questions during our stay and was very accommodating. The apartment had everything we needed to stay comfortably for the weekend. The beds are SO comfortable!!
2022-05-01,5,Stayed one night,Great stay
2022-03-01,5,Stayed one night,This apartment is super spacious and clean. The host was very responsive and let me check-in a little early. Some of the other comments talk about the train noise but I only heard one train pass through and it didn't bother me. Would definitely stay here again!
2022-02-01,3,Stayed a few nights,"FYI: I contacted the host prior to booking to let her know I was traveling with someone with some disabilities.
Pros: Nice beds, great towels, lots of thoughtful touches in bathroom.
Cons: Parking is remote, 24 STEPS up to unit, boiler was malfunctioning so we either froze or were broiling hot, tried using space heaters as directed and blew fuses, which made the TV go out, no instructions for Roku, host's mother came and fixed boiler and became our contact person because she was understanding. We came home sick from the heating issues."
2022-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"Super communicative host. We were doing a last minute trip and she was immediately responsive and made it work for us. The place itself is brilliant, it felt like an NYC loft. Great info book put together by host answered all our questions."
2021-12-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Nice place, but bring earplugs as you are one block from the railroad tracks and train blows through at 5 times after midnight each night."
2021-11-01,5,Stayed one night,Cute place in downtown Wapakoneta. Lots of space. Note that you are near railroad tracks and trains go thru at night - but it didn’t really bother us. Instructions were clear. We enjoyed our stay and would stay again the next time we visit family in the area.
2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great stay! We were able to walk to everything but the Air and Space Museum. Thank you! We’ll be back!
2021-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great comfortable beds & warm comforters! Felt like a new york loft! Awesome place, fun decor, great location & easy self check in! Great full kitchen & dining space. Great coffee service too. We came to visit the Rustic market. Wish we had more time to stay & shop longer! So much to do here."
2021-11-01,5,Stayed over a week,Very clean and elegant! Will definitely check in again !
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The place is large and so conveniently located in the heart of downtown. I was able to visit Winans for coffee in the morning, the farmers market at the courthouse and a host of great restaurants. Also really appreciated beingable to use a keurig to make my own coffee."
2021-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"This apartment is clean and large and it’s in a great location! The beds were really comfortable too! There are little added touches like the q-tips, cotton balls, extra towels and blankets if needed and it’s stocked with coffee pods. I love the bling on the cabinet hardware! I will stay here again next time I visit the area!"
2021-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Great, unique apartment! We loved all of the windows in the living room and even enjoyed hearing the trains. :)"
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is a nice old apartment with high ceilings and lots of space. I also loved the location of the place being downtown and within walking distance of other attractions. If you are a light sleeper like myself, the biggest drawback was the train going through town late at night. However, it is a great place for the price! Sarah was a great host. She let us check in an hour early! Would definitely stay here again."
2021-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,Was beautiful. Clean. Reminded me a lot of Newyork. Loved it.
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This apartment is elegant with a touch of home! Beautiful views of downtown Wapakoneta and walking distance of everything we needed. I highly recommend and the owners are a dream!
2021-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,Very clean and spacious. And wonderful location!
2021-07-01,5,Stayed one night,Great alternative to a hotel.
2021-07-01,5,Stayed one night,This place is adorable! Right in the middle of town. I love the vintage oven and whole vibe. The bedazzled handles were a favorite as well
2021-06-01,5,Stayed about a week,"We loved this place, and stayed for 8 nights while doing some bicycling in the area. The place is very nicely decorated, and has a wonderful old fashioned charm. The memory foam queen beds are ultra comfy and each bedroom has a ceiling fan which is great in the summer! There is a small sitting room attached to the larger living room. Each has a recliner couch I guess I would call it. Both are the most comfortable chairs I have ever used. My wife agrees and we are going shopping for one this week!
If you want to watch Amazon Prime or Netflix or other premium stuff you need to bring your own Roku or Fire Stick, and there is no cable TV. That was kind of a nice bit of downtime for us we discovered.
The front room can be pretty loud during the day and early evening as Wapakoneta must have cornered the market on obnoxiously loud motorcycles and trucks. Not a problem for sleeping though, things calm down at night. The noise is my only knock on the location. Other than that, there are a lot of interesting places on Auglaise St. The Side Rail and J Marie's are both a minute or two walk down the street and have friendly staff and locals, and both have good food.
The kitchen has a very cool stove/oven from the 50's. It is completely functional, and my wife and I cooked some pretty amazing meals on it and enjoyed using it."
2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Our stay at Sarah's exceeded expectations! Located right on the main street shopping and dining are all walkable! If you are in Wapakoneta, be sure to visit the Temple of Tolerance and talk to Jim and take the walking tour of the main street. Fabulous."
2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Fantastic lodging and location!
2021-05-01,5,Stayed one night,The apartment was very spacious and clean. I stayed in it the night before my wedding with my bridesmaids. Sarah was always quick to answer any questions I had!
2021-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great place for your stay in Wapakoneta! Many shops nearby in town, and has a great view is great of the downtown area."
2021-04-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Wapakonta is a super cute town. Lots of nice shops near the air bnb to explore. We enjoyed our stay at Sarah’s. We felt comfortable and at home. Sarah was also quick to respond and super helpful with our needs.
2021-03-01,5,Stayed one night,Sarah'splace was great. it's near some great restaurants and shopping. the place was clean and comfortable
2021-02-01,5,Stayed one night,Such a cute place and absolutely loved our stay!! Highly recommend and the town is such a historic little town!!
2021-01-01,5,Stayed one night,Beautiful place in a nice town. Definitely enjoyed ourselves and the hospitality. Would gladly stay again. Checkout her business downstairs too.
2021-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,"It was a clean, comfortable, perfect spot to visit family we hadn’t seen in a year due to the pandemic. It was much needed for all of us and the apartment was absolutely perfect."
2021-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,In our small town there isn’t a lot of downtown housing available for rent that you’d “be proud” to have people visit. Sarah’s place is literally downtown next to all of your local shopping and eating on historic Auglaize Street and classy enough to even host a business meeting or dinner.
