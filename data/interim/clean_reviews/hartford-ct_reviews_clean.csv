2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Place looked exactly like the pictures, super easy check in. Very convenient location around many shops and restaurants. Host was very quick to respond to any questions I had. Overall great experience."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Beautiful apartment in a nice building with wo deeful hosts. This is a great place to stay in the Hartford area, I would happily stay again & recommend to anyone."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"it was an amazing place, the host were very nice and even helped within minutes me get back in when I took the wrong set of key. I would definitely stay again."

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,We had very nice stay with Yasmina and her wonderful father Riaz. The flat is luxurious and comfortable. I would recommend it for everyone.
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"Ocean Place was the first AirBnb I booked when I got here in Connecticut. I was new to the city so my main concern is my safety. I usually work during the night so I can say that the location was safe that I had no problems traveling from the AirBnb to my workplace during the night. The room was also spacious enough for me and my husband and the kitchen and bathroom were well maintained. We stayed for more than 3 weeks and the place felt like home. You can hear people in the kitchen sometimes but that didn‚Äôt bother us and I got the best sleep during the day when I get home from work. We had everything that we need and the supermarkets, food parks, bus stops, train stations are stone‚Äôs throw away! The owner constantly communicates with me asking if I have concerns. They are also prompt in providing our requests. Many thanks to Ocean Place! You made our transition here in this new state smooth and stress-free. Wish you best of luck!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,Very responsive host!! Very clean accommodations and amenities were as described. Very close to the bus station and access to the train going to New York or Boston!!
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,Ocean place is a home away from home ü§ójust get real & enjoy ü§ôüèΩ
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Probably the cleanest Airbnb I‚Äôve ever stayed in. It‚Äôs pretty vintage so that‚Äôs up to everyone‚Äôs liking, I myself loved it. Host is very easy going and easy to communicate with. Mattress was perfect, not too soft. There‚Äôs not a lot to Dixon the area but 10 mins from the door, the local bus takes you to Hartford downtown or West Hartford for good Restaurants etc. The location was perfect for me though, because it‚Äôs a short drive to the I84 highway. The rooms all attach to the kitchen directly so you might hear others if they are in the kitchen, didn‚Äôt bother me at all but eventually worth mentioning."
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,I booked here a few times and it never disappoints. Thank you ocean place!
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great host, every time I book it never disappoints!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Great place with amazing views
2024-06-01,3.0,Stayed over a week,"Great apartment to rent. Parking though is inconvenient as you have to navigate a busy and dangerous roundabout. Overall, good bang for your buck"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The place was nice and clean. Looks exactly like the pictures
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Second time I stay here and I will certainly do so again.
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was my second time staying at Ronnie‚Äôs place and it always feels like home. The actual unit is my favorite place about the apartment building. It‚Äôs a nice amount of space, nicely and minimalistically designed. This wasn‚Äôt the exact unit that I stayed in before, but it literally looks like the exact same thing just flipped. So regardless of the specific unit number I book, they all look nearly identical and all give the same comfortable vibe. This is my go-to Airbnb. Same day booking too, and Ronnie is always flexible."
2024-06-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"This apartment is perfectly adequate for staying in the city. I believe that it‚Äôs being sold, because there‚Äôs a lockbox on the door, and the furniture in the place reflects that, being a low quality and somewhat sparse (no bureau).
That being said, the bed was very comfortable. The kitchen was very adequately stocked with convenience machines and everything you need if you were just one or two people staying there. The place was very clean.
I always felt safe, even though I was a country mouse visiting the big city and all alone without my husband.
The parking garage was under construction, so my car had to be parked blocks away across a busy rotary with no sidewalks. That was the hardest part for me, but that was not Ronnie‚Äòs fault. Just be aware that that might be the situation for you as well.
Ronnie was a responsive host, and was able to help me out when, for instance, the Internet was spotty. She was able to provide me with a better network that worked well."
2024-06-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Ronnie‚Äôs place was as described and I enjoyed the stay. It was a slightly dirty in a couple areas but still overall fairly clean. I would still recommend the apartment. Thank you!
2024-06-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Ronnie was very responsive & made sure my check in was smooth. Apartment was very clean & comfortable, close to highway & downtown Hartford."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,good home
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I had a great time at Ronnie's. She took good care of our needs and the assistant was one call away. I would highly recommend this. I think the pictures I saw were slightly different in terms of the windows and the orientation of the kitchen and the room, and that maybe because she has more than one listing. She was a great host!!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Ronnie was an AMAZING host! The place is just as the pictures had it and she was responsive about every single thing in a matter of an hour or less. I genuinely would stay with her again when I go to Hartford!! She is amazing and the location is perfect! Close to everything!
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Ronnie was very easy to communicate with and goes beyond to make sure you are comfortable and resolve any issues you may experience while you stay
2024-04-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,perfect location 10 min walk to XL center 5 min walk to other restaurants ..8 min drive to Walmart parking was two streets over but u can clearly see ur car out the living room windows! perfect stay I would highly recommend
2024-04-01,3.0,Stayed with kids,Ronnie is a great host and the place matches the description. My wife and I traveled with our infant to Hartford for the weekend. The parking situation is inconvenient.
2024-04-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Overall a good place..I was on the 3rd floor. Good location with Bushnell Park in front of you, Main street behind you and easy access to I-84 &I-91. Unit didn't have a microwave and parking is definitely an issue.. the lot is free, but a good 5-10 walk from the unit, which becomes more and more of an inconvenience coming & going. If you're traveling without a car- you can't beat it, super comfy bed, good internet but have your web tv device (firestick, roku, YouTube TV etc) if you plan on watching TV. I hope to rent on of the other units next time I'm in Hartford!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"The second time I stayed in this property within last two months. My comments are same as last time. It is clean, well located and fully equipped. Ronnie is very responsive each time I contacted her."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Ronnie Place is a wonderful place to stay; it's well-designed and at a prime location. I would highly suggest this well-kept flat to anyone considering a brief stay. If needed, I would reserve this space once more."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Very clean place! Would stay again
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Absolutely amazing experience! Ronnie went above and beyond to ensure our stay was exceptional, from the warm welcome to the thoughtful touches throughout. The property itself was simply stunning, impeccably clean, and beautifully appointed. Every detail was carefully considered, making for a truly unforgettable stay. We can't wait to return! Highly recommend to anyone looking for a top-notch Airbnb experience"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great clean place and great host. The only thing I would say is parking is a far walk.
2024-04-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,nice place. very convenient to downtown.

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place was a god send, the host was very accommodating and I ended up canceling my hotel to stay here."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Very central location. Lovely apartment. The building was not of the same standard though.
Parking was in a lot about a ten minute walk away.

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great spot for easy excess into downtown Hartford.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Nice view, would doing it again and recommend it!"
2024-04-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Ronnie‚Äôs place is beautifully decorated and looked just like the photos! It‚Äôs a great value for downtown Hartford.
I did experience some issues with the Wi-Fi, and found it was too unstable for work or streaming anything. Therefore, I used my cell hotspot.
Ronnie was always responsive and did offer other network connections which still did not work.
The location was ok, but there were some issues getting the keys from front desk. Also, I found a couple pieces of broken glass in the bedroom - I believe from a previous guest‚Äôs dropped glass.
Many of the items in the apartment seemed brand new, like the dishwasher still had its packaging inside. The lamp pull chains still had plastic on them. This just struck me as odd as though I was the first guest in this place!
Finally, there was unfortunately some noise from neighboring apartments. The parking was also not the best, but there were options.
All in all 4/5 - great value, responsive host. You‚Äôll like it. It‚Äôs just not a 5/5 for me"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Words cannot express my gratitude for this host went above and beyond for me didn't have to !.
The place is a beautiful wonderful spot located in a perfect spot. Godbless thank you so much I will be back"

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,It's an excellent value in the heart of the downtown area with beautiful views.
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"I enjoyed my stay and it was perfect location right across from Beautiful bushnell park with Starbucks and coffee, restaurants all within a 5-10 minute walk. The building is undergoing some exterior renovations but not an inconvenience. Security guards 24/7 and parking though on street was easy to find. Would stay again."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,As advertised
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,very comfortable place to stay
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Absolutely loved staying here it was everything you see on the pictures & more. Ronnie was very communicative & clear on instructions & a pleasure to rent from for a week. Thank you Ronnie for everything I really appreciate you.

2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"A perfect spot for my night stay to see a show at the Webster less than 10 minutes away. Her space looked better in person than in pictures, much spacier and roomier! Bedroom was really cozy with a tv to relax with. Little kitchen was perfect, and the back door entrance came in clutch. Prior to arrival was proactively sent key code and parking information making check in a breeze. Will definitely be staying here again if ever in the area and would highly recommend it."

2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"What a perfect Air Bnb. My boyfriend and I were attending a convention at the XL center and this was conveniently 10 mins away.
The apartment was very spacious and clean! No issue with any loud neighbors. The apartment is close to shopping centers with multiple restaurants and grocery stores. The bathroom looked recently renovated & the bed was comfortable!
We absolutely will be back next October. I highly recommend anyone too stay here. It was prefect for 2 people. Latoya sent the best instructions on how to enter the apartment.
The only thing is that parking spot in the back is very tight. Best for a small car."

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Airbnb told me there was a lockbox but never gave me the lockbox code. Thankfully, Latoya was available to let us in. The place was wonderful, just as described and the pictures were accurate. Parking was very convenient and as noted. Note there is no central air but there is an air conditioning unit in the kitchen area that kept the main area comfortable. Because of my night flashes, I could have used a fan in the bedroom but I survived. ;-) Latoya was a perfect host - quick to respond and very accommodating. I look forward to staying here again. Someone had mentioned in their review that the area was a little 'interesting', but overall, it was okay. We didn't walk around - just drove where we needed to go, and it worked out just fine. Thank you again Latoya! it was a great weekend!"
2023-07-01,4.0,Stayed one night,Comfortable place with all the basics.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Stayed here for a family member's wedding. It was walkable to great restaurants and bars. It was very clean and comfortable. The airbnb was very secure and you felt very safe with multiple locks as well as security cameras. Only downside was the parking space was extremely tight as its close to a fence even for a smaller car. Other than that I would highly recommend this location if visiting the Hartford area.

2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great cozy place that has all the right things you need. Spent there one night but left me wishing I could‚Äôve stayed longer. Clean bathroom and amenities were good.

Very easy parking, friendly neighborhood, close to restaurants and downtown. I was staying for a convention in town and the apartment was very peaceful, quiet and spacious.

They were not being paid for this. She also seemed genuinely concerned, and turns out I had heat cramps from the weather and walking. I took Uber back to the train. (Make sure you plan accordingly in this heat. That part was on me, not them!) Their home is chock full of Jamaican finds, mementos of a warm family life. My bed was comfy and I got addicted to a new tv show on Netflix. Coreen took the time to show me how to use the tv. My only complaint is the neighborhood. I walk and didn‚Äôt feel comfortable. It may have been an off day and I would still love to return. Their kindness is rare."

2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Hidden Gem...
My room has a twin-bed, basic cable, fridge, and desk, etc. Wi-Fi is fast. Rooms are up the second floor. Plan on taking off your shoes when you come in the door. Try not to fumble with luggage or packages AND open the front door. You need both hands to open the front door. Stephanie's home is tastefully decorated. There is carpet in the rooms. The windows open a crack for fresh air. The room is Conveniently located just a few mins from the highway exit. As a tall adult, the Twin Bed intimidated me. It seemed ""small and soft"", but I'm used to a King Bed. I was surprised by how VERY COMFORTABLE I was & how quickly I was able to go to sleep. I woke up rejuvenated. I slept through the night. It was prefect. And as a Guest, I was able to fall asleep faster, knowing the Host/Owner was on-site to help with any questions.
The Bathroom was well-lit and CLEAN. Stephanie is generous with ""emergency toiletries"", but I was sure to leave a bottle, if I used theirs."

Stephanie was very accommodating and thr check-in process was smooth. My only issue was the are in which the AirBNB is located. It's not a particularly safe neighborhood.

2020-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Spend a wonderful two nights at Stephanie‚Äôs home on a cold and snowy weekend in January 2020.
Loved the heat after arriving in on a bitter cold Friday night. The place was very convenient and centrally located for me attending a company event at the Hartford Convention Center. However on the Saturday night as we finished we were greeted with a snowstorm. Arriving back at about 10.00PM after dinner with some friends I was faced with an empty snow covered street and wondering where to park my car. I had parked on the street on Friday night. Stephanie‚Äôs son was in the back shovelling out a spot for me to park my car behind their house. Did I breathe a sigh of relief.
A wonderfully warm and loving family, I met Stephanie‚Äôs husband also.
Definitely on my next trip to Hartford I know where I‚Äôll be reserving my AirbnB.
Oh! Bathroom spotless, shower wonderful, bed cosy and warm, and snacks awaiting my arrival.
What more may I ask you,
does a weary traveler need."

She has put meticulous thought in designing the room and I was really impressed by what I saw. I have stayed in many airbnbs before but this is the first time that I saw all the amenities in one place! You literally do not have to step out of your room except for the bathroom which is the next room! She has stocked everything from extra towels to basic stationary in the room (I even found a spare battery!) Stephanie was a very pleasant person to have a conversation with. The area was safe and there is a school nearby. I will stay in Stephanie's room if I come to Connecticut again. Thanks Stephanie!

2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Debra's home is beautiful and located perfectly between countryside and metropolis of Hartford! She is a wonderful energetic woman with lots of information about the area and very generous with her personal story and personal items. She allowed me to use her garage to work on assembling and packing my bicycles and also offered to help me load and unload my vehicle. The house is filled with her own artwork and beautifully crafted furniture. The house itself is gorgeous and filled with positive energy, including her lovely doggy Max. I am a dog lover and felt very comfortable with her pets. I felt very comfortable and at home using the appliances and her kitchen area. I really liked having solo use of the bathroom right next to my room. The home is warm and very peaceful. It was perfect for my cycling adventure in the area."

2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"A really great place to stay. Less than 5 minutes from the center of West Hartford. Her street is very quiet and her house is not in direct view of the road. This was important to me since I rode in on a motorcycle and didn't want to leave it in a parking lot of a big hotel. Many things I did not use, but were very nice and available were the back yard, living room and kitchen. My focus was parking, bedroom and bathroom. Parking, fantastic. Bedroom quite large and I found the bed quite comfy. Bathroom is also quite large. The Shower has great pressure and heats up rather fast. Max is a very sweet dog. Advice to others is that is to check every drawer. Debra has thought of everything. If you are wanting anything, it is most likely in a drawer or the closet. Many more amenities than I expected."
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Wonderful spot, lovely host in a beautiful location. Would definitely stay again. Max is an absolute sweetheart."

2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Debra & Max are wonderful hosts!
I needed a place to stay because I had a family member in the hospital right outside Hartford. In a really difficult time this turned out to be the perfect solution. The location is fantastic. I woke up to hearing the birds chirping, and the bees buzzing. Beautiful flowers in the yard. Really nice to be able to walk outside in the morning,and play with Max, have coffee. Debra gave me some great recommendations for restaurants close by. The room, and bathroom were very clean. Plenty of drawer, and closet space. She even acted as my Uber driver to make it easier to move around. I would have booked more time already if it wasn‚Äôt already fully booked!"

This is very much a five star review, but understand if you intend to do much more than have a nice, comfortable bedroom, this may not be the place for you as there isn't a living room, TV, or public spaces other than the kitchen."
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,This was my first time using the Airbnb service and i have to say that i am quite impressed.

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I had a great stay at Erik's house. I was in town just for the night so just needed a place to sleep. But this felt much more than just a ""bedroom in someone's house."" The room is so nicely done that it was like a nice hotel room or a traditional B&B. Erik was easy to communicate with and the location was easy to find, convenient to get to, and in a quiet neighborhood. I look forward to staying here again in the future."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Erik is super cool. Definitely my favorite host to-date. His house is brimming with clever little smart gadgets, like motion sensor night lights.
At my house, I have to trick a mouse to run on a wheel in order to burn toast; but Erik has a science-level super toaster that cooked 6 pieces of toast perfectly all at once. Crazy
Mostly, I appreciated how clean it was, and how comfy the room and bed were. It felt private and safe, and I could sleep easily. Had a nice home vibe, as I didn‚Äôt really feel like I was intruding on someone else‚Äôs space."

2020-09-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Staying with Erik is everything you can expect from the listing and more. He‚Äôs a great conversationalist as well. The house overall is very clean and the bed was probably one of the most comfortable beds I‚Äôve ever slept on. I also really appreciated how he really maintains a safe environment in the house during this pandemic which made me more at ease. For sure wouldn‚Äôt hesitate to stay here again.
2020-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,I never stayed at a airbnb so I was very nervous but Erik was very helpful through out my entire stay very quite and comfortable i would definitely recommend anyone to stay at his home good location he doesn't mind u helping your self to any of his food but the only thing for me was the bed being on the floor very low but yet I would still stay there again
2020-09-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Checking in is smooth. It is a quiet neighborhood. I didnt stay much because I am taking care of some business on my old apartment before I fly out of US.
2020-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Nice house and friendly host

2019-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great value and Erick is a thoughtful and very kind host. I look forward to staying with him whenever I‚Äôm visiting Hartford!
While Erick is still adding finishing touches and the stairs can be squeaky, if not walked on with consideration, the place is super clean, Erick‚Äôs packed the refrigerator with all sorts of available food, and washer and dryer are brand new and cavernous. The best part about the experience was Erick himself! I have rarely met such a thoughtful and caring person. He really has his heart in the right place."

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great stay !
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We loved how close this Airbnb was to the XL Center, shops, and restaurants. Parking nearby was super easy. Finally, Obinna was incredibly responsive and helpful! I will stay again if I'm ever visiting Hartford."

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Amazing find, right in center of city, lots of natural light and great views from the apartment. The place was spacious, beautifully decorated, comfortable, and meticulously clean. Small things like the speakers around the house made it fun to stay in too.
Obinna was a great host; we never met in person, but she was proactive and really helpful with questions we had while staying.
Would stay again‚Äîhighly recommend!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very clean & spacious! Obinna was a great host and always quick to respond to any questions!

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Really wonderful stay! The beds were cozy and the apartment was really cool‚Äî very responsive and kind host.
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Perfect location if you‚Äôre planning on going to the XL center . Parking was fairly easy , place was clean and it‚Äôs a walkable neighborhood. Lots of noise outside but that‚Äôs expected since you‚Äôre in the heart of the city also recommend newer tvs and darker curtains . Excellent stay thank you"
2024-06-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"It really is a great clean place in the heart of Hartford The shower was incredible. I was traveling for business and it was really unfortunate the constant loud noise until 3am. It would have made a world of difference had it been disclosed in the description of the the air bnb.
One other thing that I wasn‚Äôt accustom to with airbnb‚Äôs is not getting check in information at the time I‚Äôm allowed to enter the property. I did not get in until late and did not have the information I needed until I let her know I was at the property and outside the door to be let in. It made me feel a little uneasy.
In the loft itself was very well furnish, felt like home, and had good accommodations."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Such a perfect convenient location to the event that we attended at the arena & The Fun restaurants & music on Pratt street.
Beautiful place, spacious, clean, modern and comfortable. Loved the public space on each floor.
Blake was a great host that was attentive, flexible, and easy to reach."
2024-06-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Blake‚Äôs place was a good downtown alternative to the hotels. Blake communicated the rather complicated check in process clearly so I had no issues at all.
Bed, bedding and towels were present but of very low quality. The shower and shower curtain were mildewed, and I wished I didn‚Äôt have to use them without shower shoes.
Location is central to lots of restaurants and nightlife. I did have trouble sleeping due to noise both in the apartment complex and on the streets outside and light from outside coming through the semi-transparent shades, and I‚Äôd recommend people consider earplugs and an eye mask.
Overall, this is a fine option for downtown Hartford."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Everything was perfect!
2024-04-01,4.0,Stayed one night,Good
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This was the perfect location for my wife and I. We ended up booking this place because we had a show to catch at The Bushnell performing arts center which was a quick 12 minute walk. We walked through this beautiful park called Bushnell Park.
The airbnb was modern and clean. Instructions were easy for check in and check out. It was not noisy at night and actually quite peaceful.
By the entrance of the building there is a coffee shop called Emory‚Äôs which was great. At night you can go in and catch 196 bar which is a speak easy. A true hidden gem that gives this airbnb more brownie points.
My wife and I would certainly return to this place in the future. If you are thinking about a place to stay this is it."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"During my stay at Blake,
I found it to be in a great location. Blake was incredibly helpful and accommodating, making my stay even more enjoyable. The place itself was impeccably clean, and the surrounding area was beautiful. I would definitely love to come back again in the future!‚Äù"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Very nice unit. The actual room is very nice and has a cool aesthetic. Directions to check in were very clear and easy to follow. The one negative aspect is that the common area on the floor was incredibly loud at night with people carrying on until late into the night. Reminded me of life in a dorm room. Not a big deal for us but might be for someone who is a light sleeper or staying here needing a quiet night sleep. Also the trash was piled up onto the floor in the common area and emitted a strong odor that filled the whole area. Didn‚Äôt spend any time here so didn‚Äôt really affect us. Overall would recommend the place and stay again.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great stay
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Loved her apt unfortunately I had to leave due to family circumstances but, I would definitely stay here again in the heart of Hartford."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Very clean, nice area."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Love the place and the location. The parking instructions are listed in the check-in, but if you miss it, there is a paid safe lot behind the building. Great downtown location!"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Very nice stay.
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Awesome apartment, very clean, great location!"
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great spot to stay while in-town on business.
2024-02-01,4.0,Stayed one night,Blake‚Äôs place was a perfect location for what we had planned! It was directly across from the XL Center! We did get waken at 1am from people playing pool and ping-pong in the common area but other then that we had a great stay!
2024-02-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,The pictures on this listing are not of the unit. Looking at the pictures it appears there are multiple rooms. It is not it is an efficiency. Also I was there for work the tv was not connected to wifi the host was not aware how to get it to connect. It was not a typical remote usually connecting the tv to wifi is simple. Not the case I went entire stay without being able to watch tv and wanted to see a game so had to go out in snow.
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Very informative and amazing space
2024-02-01,3.0,Stayed one night,We were only in town for one night and the space was just what we needed. We had issues with the number of pillows and blankets but that is something that can be easily remedied and Blake was incredibly responsive. The building was safe and clean too.
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We arrived a few hours past routine check-in time and didn‚Äôt experience any issues. We were able to find street parking easily. The area was clean and free of clutter. The pillows and towels could use an update but other than that, we enjoyed our stay."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Thanks for the nice stay
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"Great month-long stay for work. Had a slight snafu when checking in, but Blake was super responsive and we got everything resolved quickly."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I have to say this is the first time I‚Äôve ever done Airbnb, normally I stay at hotels, but I‚Äôm so glad the hotels were booked when my son and I were in CT this month so we had the chance to stay at Blake‚Äôs! This apartment was beautiful, we felt right at home and the location was great. I would definitely recommend this apartment to anyone. If I‚Äôm ever in CT again, we will stay there for sure!
Thanks so much Blake"
2023-10-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Cute little street right around the corner to grab dinner or coffee in the AM!

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great location! Clean modern apartment with everything you will need
2023-07-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"It was a really beautiful and well maintained apartment in a great area! The instructions are very clear and detailed which I appreciated a lot. However, there is only one photo of the apartment I stayed in on the listing, so I thought it would be a lot bigger than it was, and there was a TV but no remote, checked in every drawer for it but couldn‚Äôt find."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,The stay was easy and comfortable. 10/10 would stay again.
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Clean, simple, industrial, and modern. Had all the amenities we needed, and 3 step key fob security made it feel safe. Love that it‚Äôs a top floor unit as well. Free street parking on nights and weekends, and was easy to find a spot. Would definitely recommend and hopefully it‚Äôs available on our next trip to Hartford."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Clear directions, clean space, great location. A no-fuss booking!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Place was nice, and Blake is responsive and helpful."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Lovely stay at this apartment in Hartford. Check in was flexible and Blake was a very responsive host. Great location next to many shops and stores. The apartment does face a street with some noise but wasn‚Äôt anything too loud that ear plugs couldn‚Äôt take care of (note: I‚Äôm a light sleeper). All in all a wonderful stay!
2023-05-01,4.0,Stayed one night,Only stayed for 1 night. Blake was very responsive and her place looked just like the photos. Ordered take out from Dhaba Wala located around the corner and their food was delish!
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Friendly host. Entrance a little tricky to find since there are two entrances marked with the building number, but Blake was super responsive on Airbnb chat. True entrance really is on Trumbull.
Instructions to enter were very clear and no prob grabbing key fob and getting into unit. Note that key fob is required to call the elevator before you press the Up button.
Our unit was on 5th floor, and the floor has a common area with mega-kitchen, eating area AND a half bath - all in addition to the kitchen and full bath in the unit. Common area comes in handy if you eat takeout!
Unit itself was spacious and as described. LOTS of storage. Bed was comfy and linens clean. Great shower with handheld and overhead. Always hot water. Full galley kitchen with mini fridge. Nice streaming tv with cable. Strong Wifi.
Quiet area. Central to city. Some late food choices (go to Feng Sushi). Easy checkout. Great value compared to hotels in area. Would stay again. Thanks Blake! -May 2023"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The place actually exceeded my expectations. We stayed for barely 24 hours but visited the park, Four Dad's Pub, and Trumbull Kitchen (great bartender and a good happy hour) all within a short distance. We attended a play at Bushnell Park. Everything was super clean and the neighborhood was quiet. Such a good value vs. the hotels too!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Blake‚Äôs place was great. It was really convenient to the XL Center. She was very responsive and gave us great recommendations. Would definitely come back again.
2023-05-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,The apartment was very nice. The neighbors using the common area kitchen at 1:00 AM was a bit inconsiderate but that was about all of the bad experience I had . As always I would suggest putting Kleenex in the place. It seems every property owner on AirBnB is Kleenex averse
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great location, quiet building, and lots of great food in the area!"
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Place looks just like the pictures! Great stay!
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Nice accommodations if you are visiting for a few days. Great location a block away from a large park. I would stay again!
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,We enjoyed staying here. It has a great location...close to many restaurants and Bushnell Park. Although It was difficult to figure out parking especially if you don't know the area. Would have been helpful to have parking as an option in the price of the room. It has been recently renovated and was very clean. There is a communal kitchen that has everything you need to cook. There were some other items we needed but they were promptly delivered. Security measures are great.. There was a glitch in getting into the building initially but the owner responded quickly. Will definitely consider staying here again when in Hartford
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Nice house and hospitable hosts
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This place is as beautiful as in the pics . In a quiet area , was lots to do around . The place feels very homey and relaxing . Definitely would go there again . Highly recommend.. Charles was amazing. Was on point with help with any questions and this place has everything already with it .
Thank you again for letting my family and I stay."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"House was clean, and the host was extremely helpful and always replied.
Would definitely recommend and book again."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Very easy to find, parking is a bit of a walk. (It was raining when we were in Hartford so the distance to parking was challenging, otherwise would not have been an issue.) Great area, a lot of restaurants. Very walkable while in downtown area. Ronnie was great, very quick to respond to any questions we had."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"It was a comfortable and very convenient apartment, close to all supplies, restaurants, shopping, and dealing with them was very comfortable and communication was continuous. I recommend this apartment to everyone. It was a wonderful vacation."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Ronnie's place in downtown Hartford is a cozy haven blending modern comfort with city life. The room is stylish and caters to millennials and Gen Z, with fast wifi and all you need for a comfy stay. Though finding the thermostat might be a small quest, it's part of the fun. Just a heads up, the toilet may be different, so adjust accordingly.
Despite being downtown, it's not too noisy ‚Äì just enough buzz to feel alive. Ronnie's care for guests shines through, making every stay special. Overall, it's more than a place to crash; it's an unforgettable experience. Book your stay and get ready to be charmed by Ronnie's place."
2024-06-01,4.0,Stayed over a week,Ronnie reacted fast on our needs. The park just in front of the door was perfect for us as a family.
2024-06-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"Nice host, apartment was just as pictured."

2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Great stay, we extended our stay!"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"needed more towels!!! besides that, the perfect stay."
2024-03-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place looks like the pictures shown. The furniture and decoration look modern and new. The location is great as it is right in the downtown area. However, the bathroom is very old and smells like pee. The building is very old and, from the outside, it looks like it is falling apart. There is construction happening around and there is big puddle of water in the entrance. The common areas smell like food and look dirty and you can hear a LOT of noise coming from the other apartments at night."
2024-03-01,2.0,Stayed a few nights,The location was good but the there was construction noise and debris which was mentioned. The cleaning staff should be replaced and the owner needs to inform guest of the ongoing Smells and Aroma in each h and every room it was nauseous.
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great clean place with amenities. Description was accurate to the actual apartment.
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Great place! looks just like the pictures shown. I would say that parking was a bit of a struggle. if you are bringing your car, its a 7 minute walk to the parking lot‚Ä¶ in which you have to pass a busy roundabout with no crosswalks.
The place was just the right amount of space for 2 adults. Amazing property."
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Perfect place but even better host! Already planning my next stay. Clean, nice interior design. Mirrors throughout. Nice location in downtown Hartford"
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Ronnie was a great host for her beautiful apartment. We had lots of fun hitting local bars and restaurants, and even took a short drive down to New Haven. Ronnie's place was in walking distance from lots of great places! Would absolutely recommend."

2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,the space was great for me perfect location close to my work. apartment was clean and comfortable.
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great place extremely walkable to the convention center! The unit is modern and clean but walls are thin, we bought ear plugs for sleeping but the place and location were all fantastic especially for the price. Highly recommended."
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Host went above and beyond to ensure we were taken care of prior to check in, post check out, and responded quickly to any inquiries. The recommendations provided for food in the area was a welcome addition that we took advantage of. Walking distance to the convention center and restaurants was well within an acceptable range. Would absolutely stay with this host again."
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Great place right in the middle of downtown! Ronnie is extremely responsive and manages well :)

2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"If I‚Äôm ever in Hartford, I‚Äôll definitely want to stay at Ronnie‚Äôs. I felt safe, beautiful view, and it was clean. I always hesitated to stay in apartments to avoid noise from the neighbors but this apartment was quiet and peaceful. Ronnie is amazing and quick in terms of responding back. The bed is also comfortable and the sheets are clean. I stayed for a week and I enjoyed my stay."

2023-12-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,was clean as it was in the pictures but it's a little hard with the parking you can't find very hard parking
2023-12-01,4.0,Stayed over a week,"Ronnie is a very responsive host, which I really appreciate. And I liked the unit, overall. I get the impression, however, that the building is not very well maintained. There was an outlet in the kitchen that wasn‚Äôt working, which made using the kitchen difficult."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My Airbnb stay was absolutely fantastic! The place was impeccably decorated, creating a cozy and stylish atmosphere. Every detail was thoughtfully arranged, making it feel like a home away from home. The host's attention to design and comfort truly elevated the experience.

2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Ronnie was an excellent host!
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Ronnie's place was perfect for our needs. We needed to be close to Hartford Hospital for a family member, and needed an affordable place where we could sometimes sleep 2, sometimes 3, and once 4. It was comfy and easy to get to, and a great location. Building residents and security were all friendly and polite. But best of all, Ronnie was beyond helpful with anything we needed. I haven't found a better or more responsive host in any of my AirBnb bookings. She really strives to make her guests feel at home and to care for their needs. My wife and I would book again with her for sure!"

2024-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Greg & Judy's ""loft"" was a beautifully charming and cozy space to spend time in. Attention to detail was obvious everywhere. There are two fights of stairs to access the loft but well worth the climb once you arrive. The kitchen was stocked with absolutely everything needed for eating in plus many extra snacks. . The dead-end street was quiet and featured 12 stylish Victorian row houses on each side of the street. The private deck located off the kitchen overlooks a green park and was a great bonus location for breakfast/lunch. Greg & Judy were so welcoming and quickly felt like old friends. This place is a real find !"

2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I was extremely well received by the hosts, who were patient when I was trying to find my words in English. The accommodation is spotlessly clean, the kitchen makes you want to cook, and the bedding was particularly comfortable. Dream accommodation! Merci encore"

2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"One would be hard-pressed to find a lovelier place to stay in Hartford! We are very grateful for Greg & Judy's generous and meticulous-yet-unobtrusive hospitality. Not only were the space and our hosts wonderful; so, too, was the location, which provided easy access both to Hartford Hospital (where a family member was being cared for) and to Frog Hollow's culinary and cultural delights (chief among which for us were Story & Soil, Fire by Forge, and Trinity College's Cinestudio). We could not recommend this Airbnb more highly!"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"A lovely retreat in downtown Hartford. The street and surrounding area were surprisingly quiet, with close proximity on foot or car to restaurants, parks, and cultural venues.
We found we had shared interests with our hosts, and learned so much about the focus on trees and nature in the city from Greg.
We will definitely be choosing their B & B on our next multi-day trip to Hartford!"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Greg and Judy‚Äôs place is clean and convenient. They are both personable and ready to give recommendations if needed. This was my second stay with them and I‚Äôd stay there again.
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We had a lovely time in a really beautiful space. The apartment is so thoughtfully designed. It would be a cozy space to write! The hosts were more than welcoming and gave us a great breakfast recommendation! We did wish we‚Äôd known that there wasn‚Äôt really separation between the loft and the hosts‚Äô living space‚Äî the loft is at the top of their staircase with no door or curtain for privacy. Definitely not a huge issue though and we still very much enjoyed our stay, but something to consider if privacy is very important to you."
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is our third year, staying with them as we come up for the Connecticut flower and garden show and each time we have spent five days at their accommodations.
For us, it feels like we‚Äôre just coming home and the amount of space you have is more than you‚Äôll need, very homey"
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Greg & Judy are great hosts, very friendly and make sure you have everything you need to make your stay with them a great experience. They are always available if needed and are more then happy to suggest different things to do locally. This was my second stay with them and every bit as enjoyable as the first stay. Their loft is cozy and very well equipped with every you would need. I was in town to attend a few UCONN Husky women‚Äôs basketball games, which were within walking distance from their beautiful home. Whenever I bumped into either of them, they were very friendly and pleasant to speak with. The loft was very clean and spacious with lots of sun in the daytime and very quiet at night. I would recommend their place to anyone interested in visiting downtown Hartford and plan to return again myself in the future. Thank you for everything, wishing you both well."

Thanks,
Eleonora"
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great space and friendly hosts; was super convenient for the weekend. Only thing I‚Äôll say is the roads to get there are a little confusing and you need to drive a bit to get to anything
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was the second time I stayed at Judy & Greg's place, and I think I appreciated it even more this time than I did the first. This time I actually took them up on some of their local recommendations and got to see a bit more of Hartford this way. The apartment is in a great location and is spacious, clean and well-stocked, but the thing I like the most about this stay are the *hosts!
*Note that they will stay completely out of your hair unless you want to chat. But they are super kind and interesting and worthy of chatting..."

The bed and pillows were super comfortable and felt very high quality which gave both my fianc√© and I a wonder nights rest. Lots of great attention to all the details!
As mentioned in the description, there is no door to the stairs leading down to the 2 floor but it was no concern and actually rather comfortable as if visiting family because of how nice and genuine Greg and Judy was. Having the whole top floor in the townhouse was wonderful.
Definitely going to stay here again when we come back."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We went to Hartford to see Joe Gatto at the Bushnell. The loft was a perfect spot to spend the night while in the city for a short time. We felt right at home and cozy in Judy & Greg‚Äôs home.

I loved the view overlooking the park on this quiet street. Everything was perfect and I found the space larger than the pictures show. It was located close to everything I wanted to do. Greg and Judy are very nice people and checked in to see that everything was ok and offer directions to places I wanted to go. I would recommend this little gem to anyone and can‚Äôt wait to come back in a few months to stay again."

It‚Äôs clear they put a lot of thought into curating the whole experience, right down to the bookshelf full of interesting books that were appealing to look at. Although I was there for work, the space made me feel like I was on vacation."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Greg and Judy's place is a beautiful and comfortable space. The location is very convenient to downtown Hartford and the tourist sites. They were very friendly and helpful. We'd like to come back in warmer weather to enjoy the deck.

2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"My daughter and I had a wonderful stay at Judy and Greg's place. Such a unique and charming apartment which had all the comforts of home. Fully stocked kitchen and very thoughtful snacks were much appreciated. Bed was warm and super cozy. Plenty of pillows and extra blankets. The home is located in a quaint and quiet neighborhood with a lot of history.
Our only complaint is we wish we could have stayed longer as there were so many things to do and see in the area.
I would highly recommend Judy and Greg's place they were perfect hosts."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was such a wonderful place to stay while attending a work event. It is a spacious third-floor apartment with a well-outfitted kitchen, a cozy living room, and a comfortable bed. The little deck off the kitchen was such a nice place to sit with my laptop and get work done. Judy was kind and communicative and gave great recommendations for restaurants. It was such a nice experience to stay in Greg and Judy's beautifully restored historic home."

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Perfect place to indulge in Hartford history and experience a piece of historic loft living. Loved all the personal touches! Judy made me feel right at home. Great location being walking distance from several places to eat. And the value! You'll pay more for a run-of-the-mill hotel around here! Skip that and stay here instead.
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I really enjoyed my stay here! The home itself is beautiful, and the third floor guest suite is spacious. The hosts were very patient with my travel mishaps and changing plans. There are a lot of cute local restaurants within walking distance.

It would have been nice if we had known from the description that there is no door to the apartment (the stairs from the second level lead directly into your room). It was no problem for us but it might be for somebody else.
Still we recommend this place if you plan going to Hartford!"
2023-10-01,4.0,Stayed one night,Excellent hosts who were eager to help.
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a great stay. They're at the end of a block of rowhouses, right on the edge of a park, so it was green and serene, surrounded by towering oaks. Yet walkable to restaurants, downtown, Trinity College. Charming, cozy, clean, with free coffee!"

2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"What a lovely, well appointed, spacious loft, with everything you could possibly need! Greg and Judy radiate warmth and hospitality. We were close to everything in the city yet we also found ourselves among plants and flowers, next to a quiet park. We drank coffee on the deck under the canopy of an ancient oak and read books between other activities. We were well provided for in this lovely historic home."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Comfortable space to relax in between sight seeing. Close to Mark Twain house/ museum which was our main reason for going to Hartford. Judy and Greg were warm and welcoming and gave us good sight seeing and restaurant recommendations.

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Loved my one nighter at Greg & Judy‚Äôs place. It had snacks, coffee and Judy was available for recommendations. The suite is on the 3rd floor so you must be able to climb stairs with your luggage. My only critique is that the bed wasn‚Äôt super comfy; a little hard for my taste but it was an enjoyable stay!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Interesting little slice of Hartford with charm, a small neighborhood of brick workers housing. And a large open attic loft to stay in, with a balcony overlooking a park at the back. No door between the attic stair and the 2nd floor, but that was not a problem, I think the owners live mostly on the ground floor. Look forward to staying there again when back in town!"

2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Greg & Judy‚Äôs loft was just what we needed for one short night of rest before an early flight back to Florida! Wished we had more time to enjoy it and to see more of Hartford.
Judy personally greeted us upon arrival and spent time telling us about nearby places to eat, things to do, and showed us all the convenient little extras they provided to make our stay more comfortable. This was a special touch we haven‚Äôt experienced at most of our Airbnb stays. It was very appreciated!
It was very comfortable, relaxing, well appointed with everything you could need, and the hosts added unexpected extras like water, coffee, snacks, and toiletries. This was better than most nice hotels!
This home is close to some great restaurants, coffee, ice cream, and many of the sites Hartford has to offer. It is only 20 minutes from the airport making it very convenient for travel.
We would definitely stay here again when we come back to Hartford."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Was only here for a night on my way to Maine but had a wonderful stay! The space was immaculately clean. Greg & Judy were very welcoming and I would love to come back for a longer stay to see more of Hartford in the future.

By far the best deal youll find around here! Thank you!!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a great stay at Greg and Judy‚Äôs house. They are wonderful hosts and their historic house is really unique. We were able to walk to the Capitol Building, Bushnell Park ( downtown) and to Mark Twain‚Äôs house. Several of the attractions were not opened on the week. Just a good idea to check. The Airbnb is very well located.
There were a few restaurants down the street from the Airbnb which was great,
Judy and Greg are exceptional hosts are are very responsive and provided suggestions, good instructions and were easily available.
A few suggestions would be to provide blinds or more opaque curtains for the bedroom as there are lights coming through the bedroom windows at night.
Also perhaps provide a mattress topper for those who do not like very firm mattress.
Overall we had a wonderful stay and a visit to the Capitol Building, Bushnell Park, Elizabeth Park Gardens and Mark Twain‚Äôs house are a definite must."

Their loft is comfortable and spacious, and it‚Äôs walking distance to so much, including some fun local food venues (around the corner from a great local vegan lunch spot & juice bar). I would definitely stay here again."

Besides that minor detail, the stay was perfect. Thank you Greg and Judy!"

We enjoyed our stay and hope to be back soon."

2022-08-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"Friendly hosts in a historic house. The loft is clean and spacious and well equipped with kitchen, lounge and balcony. There‚Äôs a small park next to the house useful for morning exercise if you‚Äôre so inclined, and restaurants around the corner. The only caveat is the bed, which we found on the small side. It would be a perfect space for someone on their own."

The house and street have a national historic designation and the whole Frog Hollow neighborhood is fascinating with its architecture, shops and restaurants, and convenient to exploring Hartford.

Highly recommend!"

If we come back up east we will definitely be staying here again!!"

2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Greg and Judy‚Äôs place is AMAZING. Judy was very sweet and flexible with check in as we hit a lot of traffic on the way in. She was SO kind when she greeted us and had plenty of recommendations for places to eat and things to do around Hartford. The apartment is spacious and has a fully stocked living area, bedroom, bathroom, and kitchen. There‚Äôs also a cute little balcony to sip coffee on. I would just be aware that this is on the third floor of the brownstone home and there is no door at the top of the staircase to separate the apartment from the rest of the house. That being said, the bedroom is hidden from view of the stairs and altogether the space still feels quite private. I wish my trip here had been a longer stay because it was just an adorable place."

2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"An awesome house and hosts. All the amenities I would want in an airbnb and nice extras like popcorn and other snacks. I was on the last two days of 6 marathons in 6 days in 6 different states so I really needed a great place to unwind, relax, and recharge, and this was certainly the place for that."
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"If you want to stay in a historic part of Hartford, in a delightful setting with lots of space, here‚Äôs your opportunity. Spacious loft and gracious hosts, this was a perfect solution for me during a busy 3 day workshop. (Be prepared for some degree of noise from I-84, note there‚Äôs a full-sized bed and some stairs to climb to your third floor loft. But this is such a unique setting and Judy and Greg are so hospitable, that once you‚Äôve ‚Äúarrived‚Äù you‚Äôll find it absolutely delightful."

The State Capitol Building is about a 20 minute walk to the east and the Mark Twain House is about a 20 minute walk to the west. This makes it an ideal location for exploring Hartford.
The apartment is a third floor loft - the stairway has 28 steps. The loft space is divided by partial walls into a living/dining room, a bedroom and a kitchen. There is a small balcony off the kitchen. The apartment is clean and quiet and the kitchen had everything we needed. The wifi works well. The living room is very comfortable with antique furniture and even a networked printer for guest use.
Greg and Judy greeted us for both check-in and check-out. They are very friendly and gave us good recommendations for places to eat in the neighborhood.
We had a great stay and hope to stay with Greg and Judy the next time we visit Hartford."

2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Greg and Judy‚Äôs place offered exactly what we needed - comfort, hospitality, conversation, recommendations, and a place to unwind.

2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Greg & Judy‚Äôs home is a quiet stay in a beautiful part of town. They are both extremely welcoming and it feels more like staying in a family members house then it feels like renting an Air B&B, you are situated in the loft which includes everything you might need and even complimentary snacks and water which was an unexpected bonus, both Greg & Judy are very kind and friendly people and would recommend this to anyone as a go to stay."
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This was just as listed and so worth the stay! It's such a lovely home ‚Äì both Greg and Judy were super accommodating, and knowledgeable about the area. Just wonderful people! It's on a quiet block and the house is very peaceful which made for a very relaxing stay. Would definitely come back!"
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,My only complain is that Airbnb won't let me give an infinite number of stars.
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I had the most fabulous stay at 23 Columbia St. Judy and Greg are so kind and helpful. The loft is charming and comfortable. I couldn‚Äôt have asked or wished for a better stay. I was in the vicinity of Aurora‚Äôs, Story and Soil, The Belding Theatre, The Wadsworth Atheneum, and the ballet studio, all the places I wanted to be. It was perfection. I‚Äôm filled with so much gratitude."
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Greg and Judy‚Äôs loft is lovely and has all you need for a comfortable stay. It‚Äôs a beautiful old home and the loft has a great vibe.

2022-03-01,2.0,Stayed a few nights,If you are looking for a room this will be way beyond your expectations. But if you are looking for a place to yourself this is not it. Was not enough privacy for my partner and I looking to spend time alone for my bday weekend. Was very disappointed that the listing stated it was a place to ourselves because it was not. I wish I had read more of the reviews.
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Lovely little space with a private bath, kitchen, living room, bed and deck! I felt bad about coming in later at night with the older floors squeaking but the space more than met my needs! It was an enjoyable stay on a quiet little cul-da-sac :)"

2023-07-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"The room I was in is a semi-basement, so it's possible that I was the only one who was a little difficult.
The landlord is kind and has everything.
Value for money.
It's not easy for women to stay alone"

2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"Brandon was very accommodating he always said that he wanted to make sure I was
comfortable. He said anything I needed just ask. He was always pleasant to talk to.
""The Little House That Could"" was very cozy, clean, and quiet. It was nicely updated
and has a nice backyard with a grill. The bed was comfortable and having the laundry
on the premises was very convenient. It has everything you need. I would definitely
stay here again. I can't say enough how much I really liked this house and the host.

2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"Great place to stay! Clean, nice cozy space, perfect for a short to medium length stay, especially someone working in the area for a few months. Brandon was a great host, with clear instructions and great communication. Place matched the description and photos. Very comfortable spot with privacy and accessible to West Hartford and Hartford- close to highway. Really like this place and would definitely recommend!"
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"We stayed at Brandon's place for 10 days around the holiday's while visiting family and friends in the area. The house was perfect for the 2 of us. Brandon provided very clear instructions for check in. Upon arrival, we found a welcome gift and a perfectly immaculate little house. It was comfortable and and homey, uncluttered and just what we needed after driving all day. Kitchen is well equipped, bathroom included soap, shampoo and conditioner along with plenty of towels. Off street parking was a plus. This house is conveniently located minutes from highways, shopping, West Hartford Center (which is lovely), and Hartford. A binder with helpful information is provided and includes places to eat, hike, drink, and visit. The back yard includes a lovely patio and sitting area, however we were not able to enjoy that space as we visited in the winter (during a very cold spell). Brandon checked in to insure we had everything we needed. Would definitely return to this gem."
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The little house that could was cozy and had everything we needed for our week in Hartford. The place may be even better in the summer because the backyard is huge!

2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"Fantastic experience! I cannot say enough how wonderful a host Brandon is as well as how much pride and thoughtfulness went into this ‚Äúlittle‚Äù house (BTW it‚Äôs not a ‚Äútiny‚Äù house.) Everything was immaculately clean and new and Brandon was so responsive to any questions. We would love to stay here again! Thank you so much for our wonderful experience, I highly recommend for any business traveler, nurse or couple visiting the area. It‚Äôs like your own home away from home. ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è"
,,,Bad neighborhood and not a quiet comfortable place. Do not recommend especially for a female.
