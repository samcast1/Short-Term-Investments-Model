The house was perfectly and tastefully decorated with Christmas decor that did not clutter but added a perfect holiday touch. We were also greeted with several snacks available which were appreciated! The pantry even had some basics like flour and sugar and even some Mac and cheese. This was a pleasant surprise. We had 6 people staying in the house and had a small approved gathering to celebrate the graduation. It was perfect! A true diamond covering all 4 C’s! Comfortable, convenient, clean, and super cute!
We also had a bit of a challenge in that the day of graduation was raining and the school moved graduation to Saturday instead of Friday. We had planned to leave on Saturday. Checkout was at 11 but graduation was not until 3:00. Maddie was awesome and worked with us to extend our time in the house. Top Notch Host!!"

The decor was top notch, the beds were extremely comfortable and plush, there’s a tv in every room, extremely clean bathrooms, and that kitchen! Stunning. And the view of that wide open sky in the backyard is simply amazing. It’s especially perfect for a quiet couple’s getaway.

Denise did a fabulous job of adding extra amenities such as shampoo, conditioner and body wash in the showers, a few snacks and bottled water and a jar of candy! This house was super convenient to the university, shopping, food, etc. The only drawback (minor) was that this house is located in an older part of town that needs some TLC. Some homes were in dire need of repair or demolition, yet many of them were being renovated, and it was evident there was a movement to improve the area overall. My daughter and I felt safe and would recommend staying there again!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,The Clinton Cottage is a quaint little spot right near the Tarleton State campus. It’s perfect for a family or just a quick couples getaway. The rooms are thoughtfully decorated and well furnished. We’ll definitely try and stay there again on our next visit. Thank you!

The only restaurants we ate at were what she suggested in the binder. They were great. The only time I contacted Dennise was to let her know we left and loved it. It was that nice and smooth! 100% stay here again.

2024-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"We had such a great stay at Melanie’s place. It was very clean and secluded, but still close enough to town that everything was accessible. This was the cleanest AirBnb that we have ever stayed at. We even loved the red heeler that was the welcoming comittee when we got back to the AirBnb that night and he hung out with us on the porch. He was so sweet! It was a very good value for the price. We also thought it was awesome that there were fresh eggs on the porch in the morning. We will definitely be back!"

2024-04-01,4,Stayed one night,"This place was perfect for a one night stay for two. We were in town for a wedding so we weren't needing anything big. Just something for a quick change and to rest our heads at the end of the night. When we arrived the place was neatly kept and smelled fresh and clean. It was a little hard to find, but was cute and quiet and had a great country feel. We were also pleased with the cost as hotels alway raise prices on a busy weekend, but again for what we needed it was perfect. Melanie was kind to allow us to take our small dog for a small/fair price this also was a plus when we were looking for somewhere to stay."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,Such an amazing stay for one night! I had a blast and will forever be thankful for how peaceful and private my stay was!
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"What an amazing stay! This would be perfect for a couple looking to get away to a peaceful property. We didn’t get any pictures as we were just there for a short time (hit a deer on the way in, had to leave early for the eclipse), but the pictures Melanie has listed are exactly what it’s like in person. The bed was so comfy and soft and the towels were plush. Melanie was the best with her prompt communication even though I messed up some things when I booked the place. She graciously adjusted and made our stay as comfortable as can be. Definitely recommend."

My husband and I were so impressed with the home!"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The design elements and details, put into this home, are incredible. Every aspect was carefully curated. The use of space was comfortably designed, and we had plenty of room. It is definitely a showcase home, straight out of a magazine, and while the cleaning fee is really high for less than 24 hours in the home-I understand why. If you know retail brands-the furnishings & linens are all 5 star and the home is immaculate. It is an excellent Air B&B, and we will definitely be back, as our daughter will be a freshman at TSU next year, and her sister the following year. 💜💖"

2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We stated at The Patricia house in Stephenville for our daughters wedding. This was a great house to be able to share with her and her friends while getting ready for her big day. This house is very nice and has been remodeled beautifully. It is downtown and within walking distance of downtown, the park, a wine bar, and restaurants. Barbie was very responsive to any and all our needs and the visitor book was very informative.

2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The Patricia was a well equipped and a great place to stay, Barbie was super sweet, welcoming and responsive.. The home had everything we needed to be comfortable especially while we escaped the unseasonably warm heat during the heart of the day.
The beds were comfortable and my girls loved the room with 2 queen beds..
Not being use to hail and having a truck with a sunroof I had a bit of a scramble when we got some golf ball sized hail and I had to scramble at night to find cover.. this isn’t a negative on the place but it would have been great to have some covered parking so I didn’t have to worry at night the rest of the stay.
We would be happy to stay here again on our next visit.."

2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Cannot recommend enough. A well appointed home with no detail missed not to mention a high standard of cleanliness. Great location too.
2022-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We have stayed at many vacation rentals, from LA to Istanbul, but this one was probably the most impressive. The place itself is lovely, a home redone with thoughtful attention to detail everywhere. The location is great. There are not a ton of restaurants on the square but you can certainly walk to a few. We loved sitting outside at the firepit and letting the kids roast marshmallows. Stephenville is not far from Glen Rose, Dinosaur World, Dinosaur Valley State Park, and Fossil Rim. So if you are looking for a great jumping-off point that is beautiful and comfortable, this is it. But we were most touched by the many little details added (details that many owners would not want to spend money on): from the plentiful amount of K-cups for the coffee maker, to the candy jars in the pantry, from the gold laminated book that told you all about the space and the town to the beach towels in the closet, from the pancake mix, oatmeal, and other necessities on hand, truly every want or need was anticipated. I loved the counter-top crushed ice machine! We will definitely stay here again whenever we are in the area. My two boys LOVED the house and referred to it as The White House, asking often if we could live there. Thank you for a wonderful stay!"

2022-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The Patricia is a fabulous place to stay. It is close to downtown where there are boutiques, restaurants, and a very cute wine bar. I also really enjoyed that the house is only a couple of blocks from the city park. My daughter and I would go on walks frequently there. The house itself is gorgeous and you will feel so welcomed with Barbie as your host. We stayed for an entire month and this is truly a home away from home. I cannot recommend this place highly enough you will not be disappointed!"

2024-06-01,5,Group trip,"Our stay was AMAZING! The Purple House was super cute, we came for my MBA graduation so the Tstate decor was perfect for our weekend!

2024-03-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"The home was cute and very nicely done inside and the furnishings were comfortable. Kitchen overall was very clean and the spacious fridge was perfect for all the food we bought for the party. We came for a birthday party for our grandchild, so we didn't spend a lot of time in the home except for early AM and evening. The island was great for preparing food trays to take to the party. It rained the whole weekend and we were glad it had a concrete drive. but had to angle park my Tahoe to keep it out of the street. Would recommend extending drive alongside of the house a little for the longer vehicles, but obviously a smaller vehicle would fit just fine. Overall, it suited our needs well."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,When we first entered the house we said it was very nice. Very clean. The bed was so comfortable. Jordan made sure we had everything we needed. He even offered to bring us a hamburger one evening. We will definitely stay here again.

2024-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"we didn't have any issues while we were there, but Jordan was very responsive with all my questions before I got there.

2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Our preferred home away from home while in Stephenville.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"A great place to stay, everything was perfect and Mimi was super responsive. Definitely would stay here again if we’re in Stephenville!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"While drive-up appeal is simple, the moment you open the door, you feel welcomed, warmth and coziness. My kids kept saying how cozy and comfortable they felt. We all slept so well in the beds. The decor is simply charming and delightful, and the attention to cleanliness and crispness throughout every corner was beyond impressive. It was really easy to do laundry - detergent and static sheets included - and therefore meant not coming home with work to do! We will make this our regular rental when we are in Stephenville again."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful home! Came for college orientation and wanted to be close to campus, it was exactly what we needed. Miriam is very responsive and attentive. Would love to stay again."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This is a lovely and comfortable home. Miriam was friendly and responsive with our every need. We appreciated all the attention to detail and enjoyed the coffee/tea bar too! Looking forward to our next stay in December.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,Mimi’s Place was such a cute & cozy home! Check in was very easy. The house was supplied with everything you would need. We look forward to our next visit.

2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The home was so inviting and comfortable. The beds and linens were great and cozy. Everything about it felt like home! We will definitely look at this house for future visits to TSU!
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,Had such a lovely time at the little house. It was perfect for outlet family of four. Well decorated but not cluttered which is a nightmare with small kids. Very comfy and was a place of respite after visiting with family. Had everything we needed and we will be back.
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I'm so pleased with my decision to sandwich my 110 mile gravel bike ride out of Hico between nights at Miriam's place in Stephenville. The clean, homey place was only 20 minutes or so drive away from the start of the ride. It allowed me to prep for the ride night before, sleep well, get up at a reasonable time, prepare my own breakfast, and make a short drive in. Afterwards, I didn't have to drive all the way back to Fort Worth. I returned, hosed off my bicycle, did a small load of laundry, grabbed a bite from any number of familiar places on the South Loop, slept and headed home in the morning. I could see a small family or two couples making this a base for a trip to the area. However, don't plan on it for Gravel Locos, I may have it already :-)..."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Cute house, easy access to the places we needed to be!"

2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I’m hesitant to give this glowing review because I don’t want Mimi’s to be booked by others while we’re there visiting our daughter at Tarleton in the next four years. But we have to tell you it’s perfect, for us. Quiet neighborhood, very close to Tarleton, and completely updated and fresh inside. It had everything we need, and extra items we didn’t realize we needed (that our host did). We’ve stayed at many AirBnB locations over the years, but none more fitting. Easy but secure number lock entry, extremely well-lit grounds with fixed and motion lighting, and well-maintained grounds. Extra coffee and teas, butter and eggs in the fridge, multiple sets of towels, and clean, very soft sheets. It’s a gem."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"House is in a quiet neighborhood close to center of town. Very clean; heat worked great for the chilly weekend we were there. There is space in the fenced in back yard if you have kids and a nice covered porch to relax. Plenty of coffee, washer and dryer easy to use; felt very homey. Would definitely stay again."

2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"My husband, son and myself stayed here for a mini-vacation. We had plans in Glen Rose, only takes 30 minutes to get there. Great location in town, close enough but not so close that it’s noisy. Make sure you check out Caam’s Pizza and Grumps Burgers… 6 minute drive to both! Downtown was charming and close.
Jamie was a great host, she gave us clear and timely instructions, and was very friendly.
The entire townhome was absolutely spotless, and comfortably decorated without being fussy. The attached garage was a great perk! Perfect amount of space to relax and just hang out together. We immediately felt at home!
This will definitely be a place we keep on our favorites list!"

The toiletries were great, there were a few great snacks, the beds and bedding were so comfy that we asked for the links (which were promptly sent to us), and we have now ordered them for home! We will most certainly stay here again if the need arises! You will not be disappointed!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We loved our stay here. Self-checkin was super easy and instructions were clear. The unit is in immaculate condition, very new and on top of that, everything extremely clean cleaned the amenities were just right. Beds comfortable, the space was perfect for us, great garage parking as well as extra parking. We used the washer, dryer and dishwasher - all the appliances were new and worked as expected. Bathrooms were as clean as they could be - I can’t say enough great things about the property. I won’t be staying in Stephenville very often but when I do, I hope to return to this property."

2024-02-01,5,Stayed one night,I cannot express how helpful and hospitable Jamie was. Due to an issue with the first home we were staying in we had to quickly find other accommodations. Jamie went above and beyond to help make our transition from the first place to her home easy and efficient. Her kindness made what could have been an unpleasant ending to our trip a very enjoyable one. The home was beautiful and welcoming. We look forward to staying with Jamie in the future.
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This townhome was a great place to stay at the beginning of our road trip! The home was very clean, easy to access and cozy. Although the pictures made it appear a little more spacious than it was (my opinion), it was still more than enough room for two people. Overall, the host was very responsive and cared greatly about our stay and made sure to check in. She even offered a partial refund due to unforeseen work that was being done to the unit outside. We would be happy to stay here again in the future and would highly recommend this space to anyone!"

WiFi was accessible, satelite TV if I wanted, lighting was perfect for reading. If I was staying longer I would have taken advantage of the pool and hot tub. It was just a couple blocks from Tarleton campus, which is perfect for me. When I showed the pictures to the other moms they were completely envious. They had stayed in hotels and did not receive the same quality of care. I also appreciated the sitting area in the room. Perfect for reading."

2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,Everything was great.
2024-04-01,4,Group trip,"The house is older, but nice. It’s worth noting there was a sewer smell that started the last day we were there. I did not notify Jenny about it because it was the evening of our last day there and we just dealt with it. Also the first night the air conditioner was erratic - in the middle of the night it dropped the temperature down to 65° - the comforter on the bed in the master bedroom is thin - not warm and cozy so I woke up freezing having a hard time warming up. My husband got up and figured out the thermostat, so night two was better…but again it’s worth noting - bring an extra blanket with you! One of the spare bedrooms did not have a comforter on the bed but we found one in the master closet. A little annoying considering we pay cleaning fees. The pool was also dirty, and not sparkly clean as pictured; and there was no welcome snack basket as pictured in the listing either. However…with all of that the house fit our needs for the occasion we were in town for."
2024-03-01,5,Group trip,Second time staying and love it
2024-02-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Everything was wonderful!
2024-02-01,4,Group trip,"The place was priced right, good location, plenty of room, there was nothing on the rental description that it was on a septic system and they had a sign in eat bathroom saying no toilet paper down the toilets so u had to put it in trash cans, that completely grossed us out, the water pressure in the kitchen Barley came out to wash dishes in the sink or too take a shower and the heater control was erratic, rooms were not controlled evenly. The windows were sealed shut and. Couldn’t be opened so in case of a fire we couldn’t get out. There was not enough toilet paper, trash bags or dish soap but when I called Jenny, she brought it right over right away. The house is old but quaint. Decorated cute, furniture comfy, and layout great for family time. All and all we had a good time."
2024-01-01,4,Group trip,"This is a very nice place to stay. We had 7 adults in our group and the accommodations and sleeping arrangements were great. Very clean and had everything we needed. The only complaint I have is the septic issue we weren’t aware of, and not being able to flush the toilet paper.
Other than that it was a great place to stay and would be great in warmer weather to be able to use the pool and outdoor space."
2024-01-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Lots of room. Very nice location and would be an ideal house for the summer with the lovely pool.

Since my son is in college in Stephenville, we will book with Jenny again. Thank you for a great place to stay!"
2023-11-01,5,Group trip,Excellent place to be in
2023-10-01,4,Stayed with kids,"One of the cleanest I’ve stayed in however not noted prior to our booking was the hot tub not working. And it was a shock to get there and find rules telling us not to flush the toilet paper down but to put it in the trash. Eww.
Definitely will confirm next time everything works as it should prior to booking. That alone made the price a bit steep.
Having said that the house was nice and very clean. Jenny was helpful but not as forthcoming with some details that would have impacted our decision."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Stayed here for Tarleton family weekend. Location is as great, not in the middle of all the craziness by the school. Very clean and had everything we needed. Enjoyed the backyard and the pool."

2023-09-01,5,Group trip,"Jenny was great! We were coming into town for a college tour and football game. Jenny worked with us on an early check-in so that our belongings didn't have to sit in our hot vehicle all afternoon. The house was super clean and there was plenty of parking. We didn't get to really enjoy the pool due to our schedule, but it was nice to put our feet in the next morning after a long day. The cleaning/check-out instructions were clear and not over the top like some places I've stayed in the past which we all appreciated.
We all agreed we would stay here again. Thank you again, Jenny, for the fantastic stay."
