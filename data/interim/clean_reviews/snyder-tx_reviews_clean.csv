2024-06-01,5,Group trip,Best place to stay üòç‚ù§Ô∏è
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great host! We enjoyed our stay.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,The Garden Cottage is a very nice house. it was comfortable and relaxing. Kaleb & Renae are great hosts!
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Amazing little place. Had a very comfortable stay. Entire house was clean and well appointed. Plenty of hot water, great A/C, comfortable beds and linens, good wifi, modern electronics, etc.. everything you would expect in a home hosted by Kaleb & Renae. Would definitely stay again."
2024-04-01,4,Stayed with kids,"If you have no other reason to come to Snyder, TX, just come to stay at the Garden Cottage. This cute little (spacious) 2 bed/ 1 bath embraces you back to its original era but with modern amenities. Renovations are top-notch -- the large opening to the living room through the top 1/2 of the adjoining kitchen wall, offers cross-communication throughout the house.
It may not be standard, but if you're arriving late, there were even current fixings for a quick spaghetti meal ready at our disposal. Also, if you don't want to go out for your morning fuel and forgot to bring your own? Not to worry, they thought of that too. There isn't anything we can think of to leave you wanting here.
Even with a hiccup with the Internet (most-likely caused by a proceeding storm -- it happens), Kaleb & Renae were quick to reply, help troubleshoot, and offer partial credit, as it just wasn't possible to fix before we had to leave.
The common theme among us, was that we only wished we could stay longer."

2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My husband & I stayed here for a fishing trip at Lake JB Thomas & this beautiful little cottage home was even more than we expected.

This is one of the coziest places I have ever stayed & we look forward to come back for another trip."

2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Was a perfect place for me for a quiet writing retreat. Bed was super deluxe and comfortable and kitchen and yard were great. It was quiet, with occasional neighborhood car stereo bass playing that could be heard, but that can perhaps be expected on a weekend and was no fault of the host. Conveniently located near pretty canyon landscapes and a short drive to Lubbock."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I can not say enough about our host Theresa or her property. we visited here for the devastating circumstances of burying my son in law, helping my daughter and 5 young grandkids. The cottage was immaculate and so comfortable, the mattress beyond perfect! Was cold and snowy while we were there at first the heating was a little confusing but I contacted Theresa who immediately got back with me explained and even immediately went fiixed the settings and explained how it worked. she was super friendly, helpful, and very empathetic as to why we were there. even before I booked she was extremely helpful. she has another property located in post ( rustys cottage I believe) another family member booked it and loved it! Post is small and of course we had family staying in all the lodging areas and from their comments picking Theresa's cottage was hands downbe will be visiting as possible and will always book either one of Theresa's cottages!!!! thank you Theresa see you soon!"

2023-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Very cute cottage house located close to everything I needed for my stay. Theresa was very helpful and quick to respond to my questions. Didn‚Äôt have any issues with the neighborhood. Post is a very peaceful town. Will definitely return in the future. My daughter and I really loved staying at the cottage house.
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"I stayed at Theresa‚Äôs place twice already and both times have been absolutely wonderful. The bed is really comfy and I loved that it had a fenced back yard for my fur baby. It was a very quiet neighborhood which I loved as well, after a long road trip. Definitely would be staying here for future trips :)"

2023-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Theresa‚Äôs place was perfect for a quick overnight stay. The fenced yard was very nice! Theresa was fast to communicate, friendly, and accommodating. Would stay again if passing through the area.
Only downside is the bathroom is pretty small. Not a problem for most people, but if you‚Äôre a very tall or wide person, you may find the shower entrance a bit narrow or your knees touching the sink when using the toilet."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great, small & cozy place to stay for 1 or 2 people for a short stay - would stay again!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,As advertised.

2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"For just an overnight stay, Theresa's little cottage was perfect for me, just what i wanted. The full kitchen allowed me to bring food from home to warm up in the microwave, guaranteeing me a healthy wholesome meal while on the road. The small but stylish bathroom has a wonderful shower. In spite of being over 100¬∞, the AC was efficient and quiet. I slept very comfortably. Thank you, Theresa, for a great stay."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Theresa‚Äôs places was small but soooooo warm and comfy!!!!!! It was sooooooo cute and amazing, and the patio and backyard was cute specially during the sunset and sunrise moments! Plus in the backyard there was a cute swing that was comfy, and very nice."

We picked this place and it was great! We got burgers from the local drive in burgers, it was delicious. In the morning we walked to Jack and Jill‚Äôs donuts. Such a cute town and great stop! Amazing we could bring our dog as well. If we are ever driving through again we will definitely stop here!"

2023-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"The house was perfect for us and our dogs. Large fenced yard with a comfortable swing. Though it is small, it's just what needed. Comfy bed and a good kitchen (with plenty of coffee!). Excellent price."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,This was our second visit to Theresa‚Äôs Cottage. Perfect for our needs as an overnight for our travels from Colorado to Texas. The place is clean and comfortable with various goodies for the bathroom and kitchen. Theresa is a great communicator. I‚Äôm sure we‚Äôll be there next year.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Adorable space, very compact but serves its purpose well. Theresa is very responsive and communicative and the lock-box entry enables easy check-in! Will hopefully be back next year!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,nice little place
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"The Cozy Cottage was a quaint, peaceful place for one or two people. Although it is a tiny house, it has all the amenities needed for an overnight stay or extended stay. It is located in a residential area but is within walking distance of a grocery store and if you are an experienced walker even to restaurants (less than 1/2 mile away).
The cottage was very clean and provided a full kitchen for cooking and dining. I would recommend The Cozy Cabin. Theresa was quick to respond to texts and lived right across the street if there was any need for her attention."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Traveled to Post for a family reunion and the Cozy Cottage was like a home away from home. I enjoyed the privacy of not being in an actual hotel setting. Whenever I return to Post it would be my first choice to stay if available.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Cottage was very clean! I was eager to get there after my 8 1/2 hour drive and pulling up under the carport gave me a sigh of relief. Nice little backyard for my dog, clean area, VERY comfortable bed. I rested very well that night!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Second time staying for overnight return from Colorado. Second time as good as the first!
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Theresa's place was a perfect spot for the night. I was traveling from Colorado to south Texas and needed a place for myself and my dog. Truly appreciated the fenced-in backyard for her to run around. The home was cozy, just like the name, and very well kept. I would definitely stay again as I make this trip a couple times a year."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"Very conveniently located. The stay was better than expected. The people in Post, Texas are very friendly and welcoming."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,On the way to the mountains and stopped to rest. It was last minute decision to stop and Theresa accommodating last minute. Super easy and convenient to find when driving awhile. Doggo‚Äôs loved the bed provided. Would definitely stay again!!
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,I believe the best review I could give is that when we travel to and from Colorado we only stay here.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Enjoyed my stay at Theresa‚Äôs place!
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Ideal place to rest overnight after a long drive out of texas up north. Clean and organized.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Thanks for a wonderful stay. We loved having the carport to park under. A storm came trough with hail so, having our vehicle protected was a huge bonus! The fenced in backyard was enjoyed by our fur babies so, we were all happy. Theresa was a wonderful host."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Perfect little place to hunker down with the pups for a few days! This was my base camp for exploring Caprock Canyons SP, and I loved it. It was a bit further from the park, but it was so worth it. Full kitchen, comfy bed, backyard for the dogs to run around ‚Äî couldn‚Äôt have asked for more!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Very relaxing and cozy. We hope to stay again soon.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,Great place. Really clean and host is very responsive.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,We loved staying at Theresa‚Äôs cozy cottage! It was even more cute and homey in person than in the pictures. The backyard was amazing for our dogs! We have nothing negative to say about this place!
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Cozy spot for a west Texas layover. We‚Äôve stayed here a couple of times, and will be back."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"I was traveling through and stayed for one night and this was perfect for me.
There was a hail storm (which was fun to watch roll in from the lovely backyard) but really nice to have covered parking just feet from the front door.
Kitchen is well stocked with equipment/utensils."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed over a week,"I‚Äôm giving the cozy cottage 5 stars because Theresa is a great host. The rating is relative; for its location - an older, very small house in West Texas - it was fine. My stay was relaxing and Theresa was quick to respond to my requests. The rollaway table at the foot of the bed (‚Äúdedicated work space‚Äù) took some getting use to but once acclimated, it was functional. Bathroom is small, particularly the entrance to the shower- I‚Äôm a large person and I had difficulty squeezing through. The carport was a big plus, providing a shelter from the sun for my vehicle. Kitchen was fully stocked and met all of my needs. Front porch was a definite plus and a relaxing place to sit for morning coffee or an evening after a long day. Theresa and her husband were very friendly - I enjoyed visiting them when they came to see Theresa‚Äôs mom, who lives across the street."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great little spot that was just right for what I needed. I was disappointed that I had to bolt a day early and wound up missing the second night there. I hope next time I am in Post it will be available!
2023-04-01,4,Stayed with a pet,Theresa has a cute homey spot for an overnight. Liked the fenced yard for my dog and the covered parking. As others have noted the bathroom is tight but there was only one of me - and had there been 2 it would have worked out. I appreciate natural light and open windows in nice temperatures but this place doesn‚Äôt offer either. I felt safe taking my big dog for a walk around the neighborhood and there was a grocery store 2 blocks away. All in all a nice stopover.
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Excellent location, grateful you are on AirBNB"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Very nice host - We needed to stay an extra day and Theresa was very accommodating and helped set it up for us. We also loved the private secured back yard for out doggie. We stay here again when we come back to town to visit family again.
2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,A lovely little place to stay! Very comfy and has everything you could need and more. Recommended for anyone coming to Post or passing through üòä

2023-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Thank you
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was a really lovely stay. The cottage was cozy and cute and has everything one needs. The bed and sheets were really comfortable and allowed for great sleep.

2023-02-01,5,Stayed one night,I enjoyed my stay!
2023-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"Everything you could possibly ask for in an Airbnb while traveling. Well lit, safe covered parking, and close to town and main travel routes."

2022-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,total Gem!! So comfortable and cozy and exactly what we needed for a quick stop when passing through.
2022-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Theresa's place was a nice overnight on our trip across the panhandle. Comfortable and convenient, this little place is a real gem. We were able to cook our dinner and nestle in for a good sleep. Wall heating and cooling unit was loud, so we just kept it off during the night and were quite comfortable."
2022-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"This was our second stay, and it remains our preferred stopping play to stay between Houston and Santa Fe. While it is small, it is very efficiently set up, with no lack of amenities. We enjoyed our dinner at the recommended and not-to-be missed George‚Äôs restaurant, too!"
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great stay! Host was friendly and responsive! Home was very well kept and exactly was was pictured and expected! Will stay again when up in the area!
2022-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"Thanks to the hosts for working with us to figure out a way to charge our Tesla overnight, something very useful in this part of Texas where the superchargers are few and far apart. The cottage is lovely and compact; larger people might have some issues with the tiny bathroom."
2022-12-01,5,Stayed one night,We are so thankful for Theresa and this beautiful Airbnb! It was the perfect spot to rest after a long day of driving. It was clean and the bed was comfy. The yard was perfect for our big dog! Theresa was so kind and even had a gift basket for us. She truly went above and beyond. I hope we get the chance to come back!
2022-12-01,5,Stayed one night,This was our second time staying here - we love the cozy cottage! Theresa is super responsive and a great host.
2022-11-01,4,Stayed with a pet,Very quaint little home. The backyard was nice to allow our dog to run around off leash and us some outdoor time as well. Appreciated the dog bed and bowls also. We would definitely stay here again.üòä

2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I was a solo traveler and the cottage was a perfect place to stay for a few days. It was warmly decorated, furnished with all the amenities I needed, conveniently located, and I felt very safe. I really appreciated the small fenced back yard and the carport too."
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"One of the best AirBnB‚Äôs I have stayed at! Amazing amenities, amazing location, amazing host!"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed one night,Cute as a button. Bed was super comfortable - slept like a baby.

Thanks for being so hospitable, Theresa!"
2022-09-01,5,Stayed about a week,Excellent little place with a nice backyard
2022-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"Such a wonderful cottage for an overnight stay in Post! Theresa is just lovely and our check-in couldn't have been easier thanks to Theresa's clear directions.
The A/C worked wonderfully and Theresa even left us a lovely goodie basket with soaps, lotions, and a candle....so thoughtful!
The bed was comfortable and the kitchen was well appointed. I really can't say enough good things about this cottage!"
2022-09-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This place is easy, traveling with pets you will feel at ease because they can just well be pets. The sheets are ridiculously soft and clean and comfortable. I would love to know how the host is able to aquire such softness. My son and I were safe and that matters when traveling alone long distances. I really can't express how relaxing it was to just take a deep breath and snuggle in. Highly recommend."
2022-09-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Fantastic, cute little place to stay! Had everything you could ask for for a night or a little vacation getaway. Theresa was very communicative and was an awesome host! Would definitely stay here again."

was staying in town for work
was so cozy I didn't want to go to work.."
2022-09-01,5,Stayed one night,Great spot if you're visiting Post or driving through! Has everything you need and very comfortable
2022-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"Cute tiny cottage with kitchen and back yard. easy parking and comfortable bed. There is a grocery store, gas stations in the small town but not a lot of dining. I stopped into Mooseknuckles Bar for dinner and a beer.
Easy check in and out. Thank you"
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The Cottage was a very cozy and clean place to stay.
2022-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"I so enjoyed my stay at the Cozy Cottage. I loved the quiet neighborhood and peaceful backyard setting.
Comfy bed, cool TV, and a nice hot shower.
I felt totally at home and I will definitely stay here again when traveling from Austin to Albuquerque!"
2022-08-01,5,Stayed one night,Cute place. Great for a short stay.
2022-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Very quick to respond. Comfortable. Great yard for the dog. Multiple relaxing places to sit outside. I loved the swing in the back yard. Cozy relaxing and pet friendly. I would stay here again. The host was amazing. Had issues on our drive there and Theresa responded every time I gave an update. The night ended at this oasis.
2022-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Exactly what we needed for our overnight pass-through stay!
2022-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"The Cozy Cottage was perfect for us. It was clean and comfortable and offered the privacy that was truly welcomed after a long day driving. In the past we have stayed in motels on these trips to the western states. With our dogs, especially, it‚Äôs always inconvenient and difficult. With a one story house to ourselves and an enclosed backyard it was ideal. The dogs got to stretch their legs and we got to relax without having to run through a motel and up and down stairs. Theresa warns you that the cottage is small, especially the bathroom, but it worked fine for the two of us. The inside of the cottage is clean, well equipped and very attractive and inviting. We will definitely stay again on our next trip through Post, Texas."
2022-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Very comfortable place that makes excellent use of the space. Great yard for our dogs. Absolutely perfect for a stop after a long drive. Exceeded our expectations. Thanks!
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,I was passing through Post on a road trip and this place was a perfect stopover for one night. Theresa was very helpful and communicative and was able to accommodate my dog and me on only a couple hours' notice. Pet food bowls and a bed are thoughtfully included if you're traveling with a pet. One thing to keep in mind if you're a light sleeper is that there's a somewhat noisy air conditioner that turns on and off throughout the night. This bothered me for a little while but eventually I got used to it. It's also possible there's a setting to change this and I just didn't know how to work it. All in all I was very happy with this stay.
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Perfect for an over night stay! The cottage is very cozy and had everything we needed
2022-07-01,4,Stayed with a pet,Loved the fenced in back yard and the double swing. The cozy cottage was easy to find and easily accessible. Great communication with the host.

2022-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,This is an excellent resting spot. Theresa is a great host. She anticipated every need I could have needed and made sure everything was well communicated. We had some vehicle challenges and she was extremely supportive and understanding as we worked through it all. I highly recommend her listings.
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Perfect place for us to stop during a long journey.
2022-07-01,5,Stayed one night,Second time to stay at the Cozy Cottage to break up my trips to Ruidoso. Theresa is so prompt and courteous with her communication and makes me feel at home. My large breed Labrador is welcome and the host provides a dog bed and dog bowls. The Cozy Cottage is clean with a comfortable bed and a kitchen with all of the amenities needed for an overnight stay. My favorite feature of the Cozy Cottage is the privacy fenced in back yard with plenty of room for a large breed dog to stretch their legs and outdoor seating to relax after a long drive. I highly recommend the Cozy Cottage for your overnight stay!!
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,very cute loved it

2022-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This cozy cottage is exactly as described. Very small, but for two adults and one medium-sized dog it was perfect‚Äîbecause of the fenced back yard. Extremely clean and orderly. The location is fine for anyone who is just traveling through, as we were."
2022-05-01,5,Stayed one night,Great little place to stay in a cute little town!
2022-05-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Second stay in Theresa‚Äôs Cozy Cottage. Awesome each time. Perfect for the wife, myself and Ollie our fur baby. We will back be a third time I‚Äôm sure."
2022-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"An absolutely wonderful place to stay in Post. Everything was perfect. Comfortable bed, nice kitchen, makings for coffee. Even tho the bathroom was a bit on the small side, the shower was bigger than expected and supplied with individual shampoos, conditioners, body wash and lotion. Theresa was quick to respond when I texted her and a great hostess. There was also a covered spot to park which was much appreciated. If looking for a place to stay in this area this is it!"
2022-05-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Enjoyed my stay at the Cozy Cottage! Traveling from Texas to New Mexico with a labrador retriever and the Cottage was perfect for us. Theresa was very prompt with communication and provided all details, clear instructions, and answered my questions upfront. I appreciated the open communication and high level of customer service! The Cottage was clean with a very comfortable bed and a nice large breed dog bed was provided. There was no pet smell in the Cottage and no indication other pets had stayed there, which I greatly appreciated. The privacy-fenced backyard was peaceful with multiple seating options, a beautiful Magnolia tree and plants, and overall a great place to relax while my dog played and stretched his legs. I will definitely stay again at the Cozy Cottage!"
2022-05-01,5,Stayed one night,All good!
2022-05-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"I really enjoyed this place, it was very comfortable with lots of nice touches. I really appreciated the dog bed that was provided, thanks Theresa! Highly recommend."

2022-05-01,5,Stayed with a pet,The cottage is super cute and has about everything you need. The space is small but very unique.
2022-04-01,3,Stayed one night,"The space was great! The dogs enjoyed the fenced in back yard. The dogs loved the bed provided and the water bowls. The thing that got me was after I left the home, I got a message that there was poop on the comforter and I needed to pay to clean it. Turns out she never saw poop on the comforter but accused me of it anyway. To be accused of something when your took great care of their home, it‚Äôs frustrating. Take photos if you decide to stay here."

There are some nice hole-in-the-wall restaurants nearby, so even though this is a small town, we weren't bored.
Only con is that the bathroom is small. Functionally everything worked, but as a 6' tall guy, it was cramped. It was otherwise quiet, cozy, and had any amenity we could need."

2022-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Wow! It‚Äôs was so much more than we expected. Very spacious! The decor was a perfect blend of antique decor and modern amenities. Being able to over look the square was fun. The house being as old as it was had squeaks and slopes but just added to the charm of an old house. They offered a great selection of old books we throughly enjoyed reading. Great options for seating and tables so we could play games. They had a baby gate for the stairs we really appreciated. The kitchen had some dishes and pans but we had to run out and buy forks, measuring cups and spoons. It‚Äôs such a unique place to enjoy so don‚Äôt miss out! We will certainly stay again!"
2022-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The pictures simply do not do this place justice. It is the coolest, large upstairs apartment above a shop in downtown Snyder. 3 bedrooms, along with a living room, sitting room, dining room, kitchen and kitchen table. Plenty of room for our family of 6. We cooked ourselves dinner in the spacious kitchen, as well breakfast the next morning. The square was just the right mix of bubbling stores (even a coffee shop!) and peaceful quiet at night. We loved our stay and will definitely be back!"

2022-06-01,3,Stayed one night,"This is a quirky cool little place, but a pretty steep set of stairs to get into it, it‚Äôs located next door to the probation office, you really have to watch your step since there are step up transitions that aren‚Äôt plainly marked, and the cleanliness leaves something to be desired. Some improvements could be made to turn this into a fun little place."

The entrance right off the street takes you up stairs, and it's like walking back in time with a modern feel. It is very spacious and roomy. The host communicated very well and made sure everything was taken care of. I would highly recommend staying here."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We had a wonderful time at the Blessed Hideaway! Deborah was extremely helpful whenever we had a question and was very responsive.

Deborah was very responsive and helpful with any questions we had before we got there and any issues we had when we were there. Cute little hideaway for our two-night stay. The beds were clean and comfortable, the AC wonderfully cold, and the space is cozy. The added benefits of TVs to watch, a playground outside, and basic amenities like towels and shower supplies are great if you're traveling from out of state like we were. The house also has a carport which in the Texas sun was a HUGE blessing."

Not only was it clean but Jacqui was very intentional with making sure that there was things that are useful from card games for the kids, to ibuprofen for the random headaches and even USB ports near the bedside for phone charging."

2021-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,Five stars ‚≠êÔ∏è ‚≠êÔ∏è ‚≠êÔ∏è ‚≠êÔ∏è ‚≠êÔ∏è !! Amazing! My family adores all these properties by Jacqui. They are always decorated perfectly and super clean. The beds are so comfortable it makes it really hard some mornings for the hunters to get up & make it to the deer stand. They over slept a morning or two.
2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Jacqui went above and beyond to make sure we had a great stay. The duplex was very clean and very nice too. She had snacks and bottled water waiting for us when we arrived. All of the furniture in the house was very clean and well kept. There were plenty of linens, tableware, cookware, etc. All we had to do was show up with our clothes and whatever food we wanted to cook. Jacqui was also very flexible with our schedule as well and communicated well with us. Definitely will be booking with her again."

2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"It was the most beautiful air bnb I have ever stayed at. Just perfect and the price was reasonable. She is awesome with communication and we will definitely be back!!!
Thanks Jacqui"
2021-07-01,2,Stayed over a week,"The best thing about this AirBnb was that they allowed us to book before anyone else would book, as we were long term guests, going on month to month. Initially, we booked one of their other properties, upon arrival the place was not cleaned and the bedroom was a literal health hazard. They informed us on their other properties and we went to go look at them. We settled for what we thought might be the best one, as it was getting late and we were tired.
The next morning we discovered the place had not been swept, dog hair was everywhere in the kitchen, stuck to the chairs feet, as well as the couch was covered in dog hair. We rented this AirBnb for 8 months and paid the same price throughout our stay, and not once did they drop off any cleaning supplies, we had to purchase it month after month, even though the initial price of the first month, included cleaning supplies for the house. Personally, we do not think that it‚Äôs fair that we had to do this in order to keep their property clean. The fridge also had problems, causing all our frozen items to spoil, not once, but twice. I do have to say, they were on top of getting the exterminator out on a regular basis, but that did not stop the bugs, or scorpions, from coming in to the house.
We also had constant problems with the wifi. They might want to consider changing to something that will work in that area.
This place is definitely affordable for weekend visits, but highly overpriced for monthly stays."
2020-11-01,5,Stayed over a week,Nice and comfortable

It is a nicely updated home that looks exactly like the photos. What stood out was Alana's care and responsiveness when we reached out with questions. She responded immediately and went above and beyond to make sure our stay went well. We will definitely consider Alana's property the next time we are in town! One tip - this rental is in a neighborhood in a west Texas town, so on occasion, we heard a barky dog or a passing train. I always travel with ear plugs and white noise apps, but I slept fine without using either."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Alana is an excellent host! She would respond almost immediately whenever I needed anything. The Rhapsody is possibly the best Airbnb I‚Äôve stayed in.

Private parking spot was provided. There was a lot of room in this house and very neatly laid out, especially with having a TV in every room which doesn't seem to be the norm for a lot of places.

Alana has a good water filter & great coffee - 2 essentials.
The home is super clean,
The beds comfy,
And plenty of personal touches to ensure you feel like you're staying at a good friend's home!
To top it all off, the final price is decent!!!
->We'd pretty much stopped even looking for places to stay using this app precisely because the final price is up to 350% of the list price! Soo many extra fees negates why Airbnb was successful in the first place!
Alana's final cost is reasonable."

Alana is a super host that goes out of the way to make her guests feel comfortable. We checked in late and there was some internet issues; she worked late into the night to resolve it for us.
The place has some of the best television sets that work and comfortable beds. All equipments are of high quality and each bedroom has a tv as well.
The towels and toiletries are clean and good quality.
Overall we couldn‚Äôt get enough of the place since we stayed there for a pit stop enroute our long drive from the west to east.
She also discounted the price when there was delay in resolving the internet issues."

We aren‚Äôt use to firm beds like what seems like memory foam. I didn‚Äôt mind it but our toddler woke up uncomfortable throughout the night. There are no ice cubes/trays available here either. Other than that I recommend this place for a short stay (:"

There is a hair dryer along with shampoo, conditioner, and body soap. The towels were super soft and made me jealous that I have not been able to accomplish that softness in my own towels!

The beds were very comfortable and bath fixtures performed seamlessly.
2024-04-01,4,Stayed with kids,"Overall a decent place to stay. Had everything you need. Nice cold AC. Some items could use attention- stains on sofa, drip bowls under burners on stove needed cleaned (had to clean before use because they were smoking when turned on), and other small cleanliness items. The worst for us was that you had to hold the handle on the toilet until the flush was finished or it wouldn't flush everything (even just #1 and tp), and then wait several minutes for it to fill up before anyone else could go. It did not hamper our trip and we enjoyed our time."

2024-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"My husband and I were delighted with Theresa's cabin, it is a very beautiful and romantic place, Theresa has put so much attention and care into every detail and has created a dream place, on top of that, she is super friendly and attentive. Even our dogs had a very fun time in the backyard. It is definitely the best Airbnb we have ever been to! üòçü§©"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This cottage shows the amount of love that Theresa has put into it. It is a fairly small house, but was great for the two of us. The kitchen has a full-size stove and fridge and the location was very convenient to the local United Supermarket. The bed was comfortable, and the linens were very clean and fresh. Nice roomy bathroom with lots of mirrors, but as others have mentioned, there is no shower and the tub has high sides so we both had to be careful when stepping out. Theresa did have a great non-slip mat which made me feel more secure. Overall, it was a great stay and we appreciated Theresa's consistently quick response time and pleasant manner."
2024-04-01,4,Stayed with a pet,"Theresa‚Äôs place was a convenient stop on our roadtrip and we appreciated that it was dog-friendly and had a fenced-in yard. It is a small space filled with lots of big furniture, so we struggled to move around comfortably and had to even move a piece of furniture to be able to close the bathroom door. Furniture more appropriately-sized for the space could make the cottage a real gem. As is, it met our needs for a quick overnight stay."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"smaller than I thought, but not a great day because of the weather."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"Clean, cute and comfortable. Tub is nice but heads up there is no shower or shower attachment."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"Theresa is a gem. I can say the same about her cottage. My bf and I were driving from CO and needed a place to hang our hats, late night. After a literal shot-in-the-dark search we discovered her place in Port! Although Port wasn‚Äôt our final destination it was so nice to feel cozy and safe in a new & different place before continuing on to San Antonio. <3"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I enjoyed our time there and if there were any issues, Theresa and her husband had taken their time to resolve the issue. I am very grateful for having Theresa as our host, I have no complaints and will continue to do business with her. I am very satisfied staying at their location. Thank you Theresa ü•∞! Hope to do more business with you soon!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great place to stay in Post. This cottage is one of the better airbnb‚Äôs we‚Äôve seen, and you couldn‚Äôt ask for a better host. A quality airbnb in a small Texas town is a rare find, so travelers should take note."

2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Rusty's Cottage is quaint and comfortable for two. A couple of highlights were the basket of toiletries Theresa left for us and the patio with lighted pergola and firewood stocked fire pit, which we put to good use! The location is easy to find as it is only a couple of blocks off the main highway in town. Highway noise was not a problem. The Cottage is very quiet. We enjoyed our stay and would stay here again if we are ever in Post again."

2024-02-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This place was amazing! My husband and I stay in Post every few months on our way to New Mexico and usually stay in hotels, this will forever be our go-to stay in Post! The house was so cute and had so many sweet touches, and the back yard was so unexpectedly lovely and large for our little pup!

it was a cute little place for the two of us.
We stayed there to go to a wedding in Tahoka and it was an easy drive.
on Saturday we walked through The main street and popped into several shops. Everyone was extremely friendly so we got the best of rhe home town feel.
Somehow we missed that there was only a tub but it was pretty easy to adjust.
The patio was wonderful and we had the perfect weather to eat lunch outside. I only wish we had gotten in early enough to use the firepit!"

Theresa is a great host and is super responsive. Definitely recommend Rusty‚Äôs Cottage! Would love to stay here again."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This place is incredible. Clean, quiet and in a great location. We (Cowboy, my constant Labrador companion) stopped for the night on our way from Colorado to the Texas Gulf Coast. It was blazing hot outside when we arrived, but the house was dark and cool. Teresa left a dim light on in each room to make getting in easy and the air was on to cool down the space. The patio was perfect for Cowboy. The bed is very comfortable and I got my best night‚Äôs sleep in months. Highly recommended."

2023-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Rusty's Cottage is just as described. Clean and cozy with a great small fenced in yard. Everything is designed for your comfort. Great stay!
Be sure to read the description - the jacuzzi tub does not have a shower. The tub, however, is fantastic. The only awkward thing about the cottage is that the toilet is extremely low to the ground.
This is a hidden gem in Post. I would most definitely book here again!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed over a week,"Theresa's cottage was cozy and had everything I needed for my 10 day stay. She was attentive and answered my questions. The cottage had everything I needed to cook my own food, do my laundry, and even relax a little, since I was on a work trip."

We enjoyed our stay & made use of all the amenities both inside & out. The outside has a Weber grill, a pergola with lights, chairs, a fire pit, washer & dryer. The inside didn‚Äôt disappoint, the kitchen was fully stocked with glasses, cups, wine glasses, dishes, pots, pans & a table with seating for 2. The living room is cozy & inviting. The king size bed is very comfortable & has great sheets. The bathroom is equipped with a jacuzzi jetted tub (no shower), towels, tons of mirrors & a thoughtful welcome basket with bath accessories.
We enjoyed our stay in Post & plan on returning again to Rusty‚Äôs Cottage!!"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Great place to stay for rest from driving all day from Texas to Colorado.
We loved having a early check in to take a little nap before going out to dinner. The yard was perfect for our two little yorkies. The linens were luxurious & so soft, and we slept very well once we got in the bed.
The bed was a little big for the room, hard to get in on one side, & I wish it had a shower.
Quiet and peaceful,"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Would definitely recommend this place for those needing a stop over. There‚Äôs not much going on in the neighbourhood and honestly it felt like the cottage was one of the nicest places around. Didn‚Äôt seem like the safest place but that being said, we had 0 issues.

The house is clean, cozy and comfy and being pet friendly was a big plus as we had our dogs with us.
If you‚Äôre traveling through West TX and need a place to overnight, or just happen to find yourself in the quaint town of Post, don‚Äôt pass up this excellent deal! We‚Äôll be back for sure!"
2023-02-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Theresa‚Äôs home in Post was the perfect stopping point for my husband and I on our long trip back to Houston.

2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"On our round trip through Texas we stayed two nights at the cottage. The place was very clean and the kitchen was well-equipped. The hot tub was totally great after a long drive and the bed very comfortable. The cottage is lovingly furnished and the terrace is nicely lit in the evening, unfortunately it was already too cool for us to use it. It may be worth mentioning that a pump runs diagonally opposite the neighbor in the front yard, which, however, did not bother us,as it cannot be heard in the house. Communication with Theresa was flawless."

2022-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Theresa is an amazing host! I am so glad I didn‚Äôt make the full drive from the Grand Canyon to Austin in one day because getting to rest the night in this cottage was perfect. The back patio was great for my dog and I had everything I needed (including AC). She even left a little card with a mini spa basket - so sweet and it was the first place in a while to provide me with real lotion.

2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay with even better host. Theresa was very Intentional and Adamant from the moment I booked to make sure we had a perfect stay.

2022-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"Theresa is incredibly nice and made sure we were right at home in her cottage. We felt safe on the property and in the neighborhood; no issues with noise. Finding the place and checking in was a breeze. The entire home was well stocked with anything we might need during our stay (bath/beauty products, kitchenware, appliances, cleaning supplies, etc.). It comes with a HUGE bed that was very comfortable and super soft. The backyard was very spacious, private, and accommodating with seating which made it perfect to enjoy a meal outside. The bathroom was very nice and clean, there is no shower, but the bathtub is very nice and even has jets! There were lots of extra towels provided and everything smelled freshly laundered. It honestly felt like we were staying in a honeymoon suite. Overall, this place is definitely a go to for couples looking for a nice getaway in a small town.
Overall 5 ‚≠êÔ∏è- Star Experience!
P.S. Try out MooseKnuckles for a delicious burger.üòã"

Her Airbnb is absolutely fantastic there was no complaints at all it's a beautiful. the jet tub in the bathroom is a great added feature to relax. There's a comfortable space outside to sit down and relax or to have a little fire if the fire ban is taken off. This is definitely a place to stay if you're going to Post Texas

2022-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We stopped at this cozy cottage on our drive throughTexas. The location was just right for our stop and this option was so much more fun than a hotel, especially with a dog! There is a super cute side yard for hanging out in and Theresa had added all sorts of cute lighting options to the space - outside and in. I made dinner in the well-equipped kitchen and we watched a movie in the comfy living room before turning in for the night. Nice way to end a long travel day."
2022-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I tried to find a criticism, you know, to be balanced...yeah, I came up empty. Rusty's Cottage is an oasis of comfort in Post. Calm colors, fun spaces (stocked fire pit outside, full kitchen inside and a jetted tub) and a comfortable HUGE bed. Thank you, Theresa!"

2021-11-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"We enjoyed lots of R&R at this quiet, cozy cottage. Our host was very kind to include a dog bed and give us yard access and also offered to bring extra kitchen items by at our request. We put the kitchen to the test, as we cooked all our meals for 4 days/3 nights, so there were a few implements lacking for our purposes. We really loved the patio -- it was our favorite space. A very clean, quiet, and comfortable stay. Thanks again!"
2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great little place! Comfortable and in walking distance to everything Post has to offer! Theresa is the best host! Would definitely stay here again!
2021-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"My dog and I stayed one night on a multi-day road trip - I loved the big bath and bed (that bed!) - he loved the warmth, back area, and couch cover. Thanks so much Theresa!"

2021-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"Rusty‚Äôs cottage is a beautiful house! The hosts are the kindest I have met. I love the jacuzzi tub and the candles. Also, the little bathroom items as they smell so good. Also, it was nice to find hot chocolate and popcorn üçø. I was having a difficult time traveling after my mom passed away.

2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I was in Post for a family reunion and normally we would stay at the Best Western however I decided to give Airbnb a chance.

2021-09-01,4,Stayed one night,"If you are an elderly person you might find getting in & out of the bed difficult. It is very high with only one side of the bed to get into, even though the bed is very comfortable. The hot tub might be difficult as well. There is no shower. Also, if you are planning to keep a small pet in the beautiful patio area, it will be able to get out under the fence."
2021-09-01,5,Stayed one night,This is a great place. We would recommend and will stay again. The bed was super comfortable and made for a great nights sleep. Theresa is super attentive and responds quickly.

2021-08-01,5,Stayed one night,My father and I stayed here for one night (with my dog) while on a long road trip. It was a great place to relax and recharge. Communication before the trip was great and everything was all set up and easy to figure out when we arrived. We especially enjoyed relaxing out on the patio at night with the lights and the bed was super comfortable (and huge). Would definitely stay here again when passing through!
2021-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"Very nice upscale cabin, carefully decorated. Teri puts a lot of care into the home and it shows. About the bed: be forewarned - it's very high, but there is a step stool. Once you're up there, you are in for a treat. VERY VERY VERY comfy, BIG bed. Great place for a couple or single. Well stocked supplies."
2021-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great, cozy, comfy place. I slept better than I have in a very long time."
2021-07-01,5,Stayed one night,Time seems to slow down at the cottage. The Jacuzzi tub is amazing and the bed is beyond comfortable. Anyone traveling from Texas to Colorado (or vice versa) needs to make this place their overnight stop!

2021-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"My new go to. She has everything you need there. The bed made for a fantastic sleep with no aches after driving 8 hours the day before! The town is very quaint as well. I know that the house is only 2 blocks from the highway, however, I heard no road noise from inside the house."
2021-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"I have to travel through this way often to visit family. It is close to the highway...but I couldn't hear any outside noise from inside.

2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very nice little place !
2021-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"Theresa's home is lovely. The space is smaller, but very cozy. Each room in the house is unique and enjoyable. The bathroom jacuzzi is an obvious highlight and very enjoyable. The bathroom and bedroom feel very lavish. I stayed here on my way from Eastern Texas to New Mexico. I usually stay in Lubbock or Amarillo, but the value of the airbnb made going out of the way very much worth it. I would absolutely stay here again."
2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We were attending my graduation from TTU but all hotels/airbnb were either sold out or ridiculously expensive. I let the owner know the reason of our trip, and she went out of her way to make our stay extra-special. She included thoughtful decorations (and wine!), which was above and beyond. Her cabin is cozy, clean, and so comfortable. We enjoyed sitting outside in the patio in the evenings, and enjoyed a small fire in the firepit and the accent lighting. I am so glad we found this hidden gem and we hope to return sometime. Thank you Theresa for the wonderful hospitality... just don't find that in hotels! This was truly a home away from home stay :) I highly recommend to out of towners looking for a peaceful, cozy retreat."
2021-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"Live 2 hours away! Came for a last minute Saturday night getaway! This place was exactly what we were looking for! Picked it for the jacuzzi and also location!

2021-03-01,5,Stayed one night,Wonderful place would reccomend!
2021-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This little cottage is perfect for a getaway. Theresa had the fridge stocked with breakfast items, and the Keurig supplied with coffee and hot chocolate. Such a nice surprise! The cottage itself, is beautiful. Cozy and welcoming, with a massive bed, jacuzzi tub, and really great outdoor area. I cannot say enough good things about this place.

2024-03-01,5,Stayed about a week,Amazing place
2024-02-01,5,Stayed over a week,"This place is incredible, out in nature so you get views of wildlife and the night sky that are impossible to beat. House has an amazing kitchen? Comfortable beds, and awesome bathrooms! The deck is great for hanging out and grilling, and the area nearby is walkable with quite a bit of room to kill time doing whatever you want. The best host I‚Äôve ever had, and the best airbnb I‚Äôve ever stayed at. Don‚Äôt pass this place up!"

2023-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Comfy, clean, and the host was communicative."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Jennifer was super nice and accommodating. Her directions were very helpful. The place was very clean.
The river wasn‚Äôt an option for us, a little challenging to walk around in a boot, but the lake is not very far (maybe 20 miles or so.) We found a good swimming spot.
The skies would be great for star watching, when the moon is not up. And there is a very comfortable porch to view them from.
The fenced small yard was perfect for our little dog. The beautiful outside soaker tub was very tempting to watch stars from! But we enjoyed relaxing baths in the big inside soaker tub.
The propane grill came in real handy to cook our evening meals. We lucked out on temperatures, so the morning coffee on the porch was awesome.
Also you are not far from Snyder and lots of places to get any supplies/food you might want or need.
We were looking for a quiet weekend, away from traffic, pet friendly, with a lake nearby to spend a day. This place checked all our boxes."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Great place to stay!! Perfect size!
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was a great place we came to have a lake weekend! It was like it was our own little lake house, the public boat ramp wasn‚Äôt too terribly far so it made it worth it. The house is adorable and clean with everything you need!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Awesome place to stay, nice quiet getaway. The house was spotless and felt brand new when walking in. It was fully stocked with extra towels and bed sets, plenty of bottled water to drink. Good Wi-Fi and pretty good cell service considering the location. 5 stars!"

2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Plenty of pillows! Quiet/secluded area . Use her directions and pin drop or you will get lost! 1.5hrs from downtown Lubbock Texas tech area 20-30 mins from Snyder /post/Slaton
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,If you love the outdoors this place is Amazing! The house itself is adorable! Very very clean! Super comfortable beds!

2023-03-01,5,Stayed about a week,"If you're looking for secluded and private, brand new accommodations under the stars, look no further! We stayed here for a week and wish we could've stayed the full month. There is no better way to start and end your day with these amazing sunrises and sunsets. The house is fully stocked with kitchenware, toiletries, comfortable beds, extra linens/towels, TVs in every room, reliable high speed WiFi (video calls worked flawlessly), etc. The host is exceptionally kind and thoughtful. We highly recommend staying here, you'll be glad you did :)"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed over a week,"I had the pleasure of being the first guest. Wheather you are traveling for work and looking for a place to stay, or just looking for a quiet getaway from the city, Jennifers place has you covered. This place has all the appliances and pots and pans you could imagine. Jennifer was always responsive and never hesitated to reach out. I stayed here for 3 weeks and didn't run into any problems while I was there.
The place is clean, spacious, and modern. There are zero neighbors, and the outdoor tub is super relaxing to soak in after work or a long day. At night, expect only hearing the crickets chirping, the wind breezing by, or the occasional coyote howling in the distance. Depending on the moon's position, it can get pretty dark at night, but the bright outdoor lights made it a non-issue. Or just leave the lights off and it's perfect for stargazing.
I am looking forward to my next stay if I'm ever in the area again. 5 stars across the board!"
