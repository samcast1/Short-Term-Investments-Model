2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Kimberly is a great host! This was our third time staying there! Very peaceful. We will return again!
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Kimberly was an absolute breeze to book with. Communication was prompt and she was very accommodating. The home was exactly as described. It was clean, cozy, and had all the amenities to make it feel like an extension of our home. The location was also secluded yet easily accessible and the view was unbeatable. We will be booking here next year for sure, can't wait!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Great place to stay and relax, amazing views"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"This is a special place. Beautifully maintained bright and airy with wonderful seaway river views and access. We dropped our kayaks in from the small dock, a little tricky with low water levels but totally doable as the dock is new and very sturdy. We also explored nearby trails as recommended in the guest book. Very comfortable and clean accommodation."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We had such a wonderful time during our stay! We enjoyed the firepit, the neighbors, the wildlife was quite plentiful. We got to see at least 3 ships per day going through of various sizes and so many beautiful sailboats on the water. We snorkeled, swam, fished; saw minks, a fox, deer, a wood chuck, loons, cormorants, red squirrels, chipmunks, crayfish a plenty and so much more. We enjoyed the ease of the kitchen space that we chose to eat in most of the time. We got great firewood from the amish saw mill up where the guest book told us to go with the cheapest price in town of $3 per bundle; they even had maple syrup there too for sale. We werent far from alex bay, or black river. It was a great trip and we really loved how cute and clean Kimberly's place is. We prepared ourselves for needing everything, but she truly already had everything there that we would need in the kitchen, bedroom and bathroom."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Wonderful place! Fantastic views! Second time staying here, and it won’t be the last! Thanks again Kimberly!"
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Could not of been happier with our decision to stay at the cottage. Inside we had everything that we could’ve needed and on the outside we had an absolutely beautiful view of the river. Already looking forward to booking the cottage again next year.
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Amazing Location if you were the river in Canada was very nice. The porch is grade to eat on with the view. The sunsets are amazing to watch from the porch.
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"If you need a relaxing get-away, this is it! Beautiful cottage, quaint small towns, small farms, and long country roads. Tough to get to it, but worth the 3 hour drive north of Rochester."
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is a beautiful cottage, very clean and well-appointed. We brought our own sheets and towels because that’s what we’re used to, but if we hadn’t they would have been provided for us. Lots of windows and beautiful views of the river.. I looked forward to the sailboats launching from Brockville Ontario on the far side of the St Laurence every day at 6pm. We found it to be a great base for exploring Sacketts Harbor historical sites, and Wellesley Island. Kitchen had everything you need in terms of appliances, utensils, and pots and pans. Kimberly responded immediately to any questions we had - Fire TV was new to us and we needed a bit of help. We highly recommend this charming property and our host."
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Lovely cottage on the water. Neighbors were friendly and the dogs had plenty of space to be dogs!
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Great little river cottage on the St. Lawrence.
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,This was our 2nd stay. Can’t recommend it more highly. Cottage is perfection with wonderful hosts.
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Lovely cottage, lovely view of the river and ships. Kitchen had everything we needed. We did lots of cooking, loved eating on the porch! Thank you for sharing this wonderful place with others!"

2020-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Lovely home, great view and wonderful host. Couldn't have had a better time."
2020-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We’ve now stayed 4 times and loved every time. The homes’ position on the river is magical, the simple design and airiness are some of our favorite aspects. Also, especially with kids, the state park down the street is a dream! Best playground! Kids love the house, too. It’s well equipped, cozy and just one of our favorite places to be. Thanks Kimberly!"
2020-09-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Wonderful cottage right on the riverfront. We especially enjoyed meals out on the deck/patio and the nice grill. It’s a comfortable, peaceful place for working remotely as well, particularly the cozy window seat. The views of the river can’t be beat and the kitchen is open and spacious. It was difficult to leave!"
2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful views, cozy home, I don't know what else I can add beyond all the other glowing reviews. It was our second time staying here and it's just such a wonderful place to spend a weekend. I would highly recommend it! Everything looks exactly as in the pictures and the scenery is beautiful. Be sure to spend and afternoon walking around Alexandria Bay, such a cute town, and just down the road!"
2020-07-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"Well appointed, tastefully decorated, steady wifi, good appliances, easy access, nice neighbors.
Hosts are good folks."
2019-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Amazing water front home outside of Alexandria Bay. Home was even nicer than expected. We enjoyed a quite weekend with lots of space for our dog to run. Nice trails and State Park just a few minutes away . Home is lovely with everything a small family would need. Wonderful views of river and Canada ..... don’t miss the beautiful sunsets over the water.
2019-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The pictures don’t do this place justice. The perfect slice of heaven hidden away from the busy life. Perfect for a weekend getaway or just to get away. Kimberly literally thought of everything! From the moment we arrived to the minute we left we were in awe. Love, love, love!!!"
2019-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This is a great little place on the river. Clean open romantic and a terrific place on the river. We stayed for 9 days, as we had both a wedding and reunion to attend. The view of the sunset and river are beautiful and sitting on the porch having coffee each morning was the tranquility that keeps you sane. We mixed in some day trips to local places with the kids, it was a good mix to keep them happy and busy. This is a very good value for the space and the amenities and if you stay you will have no regrets."
2019-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Such a wonderful cottage! The location was amazing, nice and peaceful! Lots of activities and local attractions! Will rent again the next time I am in this area!!"
2019-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Beyond our expectations. Beautiful cabin with all of the comforts of home right on the river. Our two toddler girls, dog and my husband and I fit comfortably. The open living/kitchen layout really worked for us for the kids. We loved the grounds and of course the incredible views of the river. Wonderful vistas from every window. We were in town to visit family vacationing in the area and enjoyed a large family meal grilling steaks and sitting on the porch while the sun set. Loved the close proximity to the park for the girls. Can’t say enough good things. Cottage impeccably kept. Thank you!"
2019-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This cottage on the river is even more beautiful than the pictures! The location is central to attractions yet private. The cottage includes everything needed for a great get away, including maps and guides, suggestions and much more. The host is quick to respond to questions and makes sure you have a great stay at their property!"
2019-07-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"The cottage is a great spot to escape for some relaxation. The view and atmosphere is what brought us here, and will most likely bring us back."
2019-06-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Absolutely amazing week we had!! The place is beautiful, the sunset is breathtaking. The river being that close is great. Coffee in the mornings with the view of the river,. There are no words to describe how wonderful that was. EVERYTHING was perfect!! The new added AC in the master bedroom is perfect and pretty much the only AC you will ever need in that house! Even though we didn't get to meet Kimberly, she made sure to stay in contact with us to make sure we were doing ok. Everyone is so nice!!! Definitely will be back."
2019-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This is a wonderful location for a calm and relaxing get away. Highly recommended.
2019-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This was our second time staying here. Excellent location and beautiful views.
2018-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This river cottage is dreamy, exactly the right size - not too small or too large. The views of the river, watching the weather, the occasional barge, and night skies are worth the visit alone; We spent a good deal of time exploring the trails at the state park nearby and visiting the new Blue Heron Trail at the Red Barn. Both spots are close to the cottage. This is a great space!"
2018-10-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"The cottage has a beautiful view, and was very cozy and clean. The stay was peaceful and relaxing (just what we were looking for). Kimberly responded quickly to our questions, and made us feel quite at home. We would stay there again."
2018-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,A private oasis on the river. The atmosphere was so relaxing and the view is spectacular. A great place for some needed relaxation!
2018-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Perfect place to get away for relaxation. Area had a lot to offer and the view was amazing.
2018-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Located in a picturesque spot on the St. Lawrence river, the house is light and airy and takes advantage of the surrounding views. Very comfortable accommodations with everything you need to relax and feel at home.
Kim was very responsive with communication and the house was clean and ready as expected when we arrived.
We will definitely plan on a future visit."
2018-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This house on the beautiful Saint Lawrence River is so lovely I almost hate to tell people about it because I don’t want it to become so popular a destination that I am not able to get to spend time there when I want to! It is a gorgeous home with all the amenities ,spectacular view, privacy without isolation, quality, comfort, tranquility, Proximity to local attractions... it is a home away from home . It is cozy in the fall and comfortable in the summer ;it is pet friendly and people friendly . It is spacious without being too much to handle. So much nicer than any hotel room ,Nestled in nature with wildlife abounding.It is full of light and From any given window you might see oceangoing vessels, or sailboats or fisherman, or deer or black squirrels or chipmunks or many different species of birds or waterfowl . It’s simply paradise!"
2018-08-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"A lovely cottage and beautiful location, with a stunning view of the St. Lawrence river and Canada. The house has plenty of space for a family to stay and such a bonus to have the use of a washer and dryer! Would definitely book this location again!"
2018-08-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,This cottage is beautifully designed with many lovely touches and great views of the River. We highly recommend it.
2018-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Beautiful cottage on the river. Very quaint, private, and obviously well-loved. Spent a long week here with my wife and our small children and had a great time playing in the water, paddling in the kayaks, traveling around the area, and sitting by the fire. Thanks Kimberly!"
2018-07-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"We have been renting cottages in the 1000 Islands for several years, I have to say our stay here was the best. The home is nicely decorated and comfortable in every way. Well stocked kitchen was a joy to be in. It was very quiet during our stay, something we really enjoyed. The owner's sister and father were friendly and helpful with any questions we had. We enjoyed visits from their dogs Bear and Lu. I don't know if we have ever been this relaxed on a vacation! We will be looking forward to spending more time here in the future. Thank you so much for opening your wonderful home to us!"
2018-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Kimberly's place was perfect for what we were looking for. Fantastic access to the river, a spacious backyard and beautiful home. Felt very secluded but was pretty close to stores and other things. My suggestion: if you're planning on coming in the summer and you want to rent a boat, make sure you call ahead. We didn't, and there were none available. All in all, everything we were looking for and more."
2018-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Perfect getaway if you want a private hideaway , or if you need a place close to all the North country attractions. So much nicer than all the hotels and less expensive too. The home itself is lovely and comfortable with a gorgeous view of the river and Brockville on the Canadian side. You’ll need nothing but your clothes—and food. Sit on the porch and watch the big ships or the small boats go by while you drink your coffee or sip your wine . You have your own dock with private access to the river for swimming or kayaking . From the moment I arrived I felt at home and I so hated to leave; in fact, before we left, we booked another long weekend there. It was the most peaceful, refreshing vacation I have ever had, and I have done a lot of traveling all over the world; however this stress-free, low-key five days on the St. Lawrence River left me with a feeling of serenity like no other."
2018-06-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a lovely stay at the cottage on the river! The hosts graciously allowed us to use their personal kayaks on the river. We enjoyed using the fire ring down by the river. All of the windows provided a beautiful view and made the rooms so cheery! One down side although was the fact that there were no curtains in the upstairs bathroom and three of the bedroom windows. We never did find anymore than one wash cloth and ended up buying some. All in all we had a great time, just a bit disappointing."
2018-06-01,4.0,Stayed about a week,"If you're looking for a spectacular view of the St. Lawrence river from a beautiful, spacious yard, this is the place for you! Kimberley's home is comfortable and clean. It's location in Morristown is only 10 miles from the larger town of Ogdensburg, which has numerous shopping options. We appreciated the neighbors on both sides, who offered helpful tips. All in all, we enjoyed a memorable week!"
2017-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This was an absolutely awesome place. Very quaint and secluded right on the river. I was impressed with the cleanliness and all the amenities. It is also located about 1.5mi from the Jacques Cartier State Park which has some good walking trails. I highly recommend this place as a good get away in the North Country of New York!
2017-11-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful place, very quiet, not far from Ottawa, very comfy."
2017-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,What a beautiful cottage! Very relaxing comfortable and cozy. Loved sitting by the window and watching for the ships come through!! Amazing time will definitely come back!! Thank you for sharing a beautiful place with us!
2017-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We loved being right on the St Lawrence river and in close proximity to so many outdoor attractions
2017-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Cozy, clean and comfortable cottage! Well stocked, great views, so quiet and peaceful! Easy communication! We will be back!"
2017-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We loved this place! The view was beautiful an we made good use of the covered deck for coffee, meals, wine, and reading!! It is a very quiet spot and the house was perfect for our needs. Kimberly was always quick to respond and the check in/check out was easy. We would definitely stay here again!"
2017-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful setting, easy check in, and wonderful having a full kitchen and lovely deck to enjoy meals!"
2017-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Once again, we very much enjoyed our stay at Kimberly's river cottage. The place was charming, clean and equipped with everything we needed. I just love the windows and the views of the St. Lawrence. Thanks Kimberly , your cottage was perfect!"
2017-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Fantastic, secluded getaway with a beautiful view of the St. Lawrence River. It was lovely waking up each morning with a cool breeze and the sound of the river and birds singing. The place is very spacious and clean, perfect for a couple, family or group of friends."
2017-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful location in the Thousand Islands. Nice and quiet, with plenty of space to enjoy the outdoors. We took advantage of kayaks, BBQ, and fire pit. Kim was very prompt with communication. Place was cozy and clean."
2017-05-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,I have stayed her many times when visiting my daughter and now my son at St. Lawrence University. I travel from Ohio so I like to make it a mini vacation. Love this house. It is about 35-40 min from St. Lawrence University. My daughter graduated this year so it's the first time I spent time in May here. Very lovely. We were fortunate with the weather. All you have to do is pack up your clothes. Nothing else is needed. Enjoy the local farms and the farm stands for your vegetables!!! We picked up some asparagus just before we left!!!
2016-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Kimberly is a very responsive host. She responded to emails very quickly and was more than accommodating. The house was wonderful. I'm a cooker and found the kitchen to be fully equipped; right down to a double boiler and crock pot. We were up for Family Weekend at St. Lawrence Univ. and loved our stay. We were able to sit down to a home cooked meal instead of going through the hassle of restaurant reservations. The house has wonderful space and a lot of light coming in through the windows. Sipping morning coffee and gazing out at the St. Lawrence River (which really is right there!) was such a treat. We're thinking about coming back in the summer to tour Ottawa and the Thousand Islands. There's even a vineyard about 20 minutes up the road in Ogdensburg that does wine tasting and has wonderful wines. We highly recommend this homey cottage. It certainly is more than a place to hang your head. It's a home away from home.
2016-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Kimberly's sister and father live next door and they were so welcoming! Love their 2 dogs and my little dog loved them as well. Great hosts!
2016-08-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful property on the water with views of Canada. A few spiders in the house, but nothing a little bug spray couldn't fix. Fun restaurant only a couple miles away and an easy drive down to Alex Bay and Clayton. Would definitely recommend this place to others!"
2016-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The cottage had everything we could possibly need. It was tastefully decorated, cozy and very clean. Loved all the windows and views of the river. The bedroom balcony was perfect for stargazing. The setting was quiet and peaceful...just what we were looking for."
2016-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,My family and I had such a lovely time at this air bnb property. The home is very inviting and has so much charm. There are plenty of windows so you have an amazing view of the St Lawrence river whether you're cooking a meal or relaxing in the living room. The rental has everything you need for a comfortable and relaxing stay. I would highly recommend this listing to anyone and we would gladly stay there again!
2016-06-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"This cottage exceeded any expectation we had! Kimberly knew we were on our honeymoon and was sweet enough to leave us a bottle of champagne! The view was absolutely stunning from the back yard, we spent every single night out there with a fire going. It was beautiful. The neighbors on either side were absolutely sweet and inviting. It was very very homey. The cottage was adorable and had everything you could need for a vacation. We absolutely will keep this place in mind for the next chance we have for a vacation. It was unlike anywhere we had ever been. I cannot say thank you enough!"
2016-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My boyfriend and I, along with another couple stayed here for two nights for Memorial Day Weekend and couldn't have asked for anything better!! The house was very easy to find, very clean, and had an amazing view. It was so perfect for playing outdoor games, barbecuing, and bonfires at night. Kim was always available if we had questions and was even nice enough to check in and make sure everything was ok. We cannot wait to plan another weekend getaway here and were so incredibly pleased with the best weekend!! Thanks Kim!"
2015-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Kimberley, The Cottage was so nice. The light and views were stunning. We were sorry we couldn't spend more time. It was too far from Canton and the university. I am hoping when Elizabeth graduates you are still renting your place so we can stay again.
Margie"
2015-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Such a beautiful place to stay. Kimberly was flexible with arrival and departure times. My son and I came for parents weekend to see my daughter at St. Lawrence Univ so this was a beautiful little short vacation for us. The pictures don't do it justice. Full kitchen was lovely because I love to cook. I can't wait to stay here again!
2015-08-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"We had a lovely stay at the cottage. The space is much nicer than the pictures can show. It was airy and comfortable. The master suite upstairs has a wonderful balcony, which was perfect for watching the stunning sunsets and viewing the Milky Way overhead on a clear night. Kimberly was wonderful, and her relatives are nearby (with their adorable dogs) if you need anything. The house had everything we needed.
It is a great, private spot to relax by the water, but it's also in a great location for seeing the North Country. We went as far as Alexandria Bay in one direction and the Eisenhower Dam in Massena in the other. A few notes about touring: there are several Amish communities nearby, so you will see buggies on the roads and in parking lots. There is a nice general store in Heuvelton that sells a lot of Amish crafts. Also, check out Mares Wares on Route 37. Marianne sells locals artists' work, as well as her own pottery. If you are lucky, you can sign up for a lesson! Of course, the Remington Museum in Ogdensburg is remarkable. The whole area is quite rural, so be prepared for long stretches of farmland and tiny little towns.
All in all, we had a wonderful time. Thank you!"
2015-07-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Kimberly was very good at communicating and very flexible with arrangements. The house is on a beautiful stretch of the St. Lawrence. The house had everything I needed.
2015-06-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"This home is truly a gem and right on the St. Lawrence river. Simply beautiful! We roasted s'mores and watched the gorgeous sunsets over the river for several nights during our stay. There was a master suite upstairs with a full bath and a bedroom with bunk beds downstairs with a half bath. We enjoyed the kitchen with a gas stove, dishwasher, large refrigerator and microwave. Beautiful hard wood floors throughout and a fireplace too, which we did not use as it never was cold enough to warrant this. One tip: the water has a mineral taste so we purchased bottled water to drink during our stay. I would definitely stay here again!"
2015-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This cottage is lovely, clean, comfortable and set well back away from the road. We cooked most meals there over our 2 night stay, the kitchen is fully equipped. We had a late frost so the wood burning fireplace added both heat and ambiance. The neighbour, relatives of the owners, was friendly and helpful answering our questions. We set up games on the lawn, had a BBQ, sat by the fire pit and watch an amazing sunset over the St. Lawrence. Next time we will stay longer and bring the dog!"
2015-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We absolutely loved staying at Kimberly's home on the Saint Lawrence River. The home was beautiful, cozy and clean, and the view was amazing! Our son was graduating from St. Lawrence University and it was the perfect place to stay. We had a lovely family dinner there, and the well cared for lawn was ideal for frisbee and other games.
I want to pick up the house (and the view) and move it to Maine, so I can live like we did that weekend all the time! Thank you Kimberly!"
2014-11-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"My mom and I stayed at the River Cottage for 2 nights in mid Nov. The cottage was very quiet and cozy for our stay. We enjoyed watching the ship activity especially while having breakfast in the great little breakfast nook. We didn't end up doing any real cooking there, but there is a full kitchen. When we arrived late afternoon, at dusk, there were a couple of lights on and the heat was going which was very welcoming. Kimberly was very easy to reach by e-mail/text when I had questions. I would stay here again if I am back in the area visiting my niece at St Lawrence University. The beds were very comfortable and the cottage was very quiet."
2014-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We enjoyed staying at the River Cottage so much that we wanted to move in! It was the best part of our first visit to the 1000 Islands area. We thank our hosts for providing a lovely stay and the perfect view of the St. Lawrence Seaway. We felt right at home and love this house. It was very quiet and the view from the balcony was spectacular. Travel guides were left on the coffee table in the living room and gave us tips on how to tour the area. Thank you for making our vacation the best ever!
2014-10-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,The house was lovely and the location on the river was charming.
2014-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Such a great place to stay, really quiet and such a great space! Huge for two people but we loved it. Kimberly was always a quick text away and very responsive! Check in was really easy and we got there late at night but still found it easily."
2014-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Kimberly was easy to communicate with and very flexible. The cottage was everything that we expected and more. It was hard to leave such a lovely spot.
2014-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place is so much better then the pictures!
it is on the river, has a great lawn and you can see the river from every room.
the place is very welcoming, we stayed a family of 4 (kids are 4yr, 1yr) and had plenty of space. the internal design is so very smart, you can see the river from everywhere.
thousand islands area is a quick 25 minutes drive where one can take a tour of the islands.
note that there is no way to the river from the yard to actually swim in it , but it's a great place to sit back and watch the ships go by..."
2014-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is an absolutely beautiful cottage. Very quiet and the views are amazing. You can even see geese eating a few meters away. It rained the second night but we didn't mind as the living space is very cosy. I think my only regret was not having blinds or drapes in the bedrooms but that is it - am already looking forward to our next trip.

Also, when doing groceries - best place we found is in Ogdensburg at Price Choppers."
2014-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The cabin was very cute and cozy. Very nicely furnished, clean and well equipped. The neighbors were friendly and we felt very safe there. We enjoyed the quiet setting and the views of the river. We were sorry that there was no easy access to the river from the cabin. We had a fantastic time at the cabin."
2014-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This cottage is terrific! It's lovely. It's safe. It's peaceful. The view of the St. Lawrence is beautiful. The owners and the people who live nearby are really nice. The design and decor of the cottage are terrific. Seriously, it's a great little cottage!"

2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Very clean, great atmosphere. I highly recommend it to anyone travelling solo to Prescott, ON."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,I needed a safe place to stop over so I wouldn’t have to drive home at night and found this little hotel in Prescott. Everything was super clean and there were a lot of thoughtful details. Easy self check in. The other guests were quiet and polite.
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great Stay! The Zens Inn is in a great location near the water with easy access to many dining options. Once you enter this amazingly unique space you’ll notice how spotless everything is kept not only in the common areas but in the bedrooms as well. Other guests were a pleasure to be around and the beds are nice and comfortable. Would 100% recommend and stay again.

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"LOVED this place. Zen Inn is so unique. It felt like a boutique hotel combined with a Japanese guesthouse. Everything was spotless and being able to have your private space plus space where you might chat with other guests is wonderful. Josee has thought of every detail to cater to your comfort from a handful of amenities in your room, in case you forgot something, to an array of breakfast items to have and a plethora of other thoughtful touches that make your stay extremely easy and comfortable. Keycode entry is fantastic! I loved the exposed brick and high ceilings of the common area and the overhead shower is very cool. I can't say enough positive things about this one of a kind place to stay that was perfect for this single traveler."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Josee's place is brand new. It is sparkling
clean. The linens are a brilliant white. The furniture in the common room that is blue very clean no stains. The rooms are abit compact basically for sleeping. When I was staying there there was me and one other guy so in the evening the whole place was to myself. In the morning he was not friendly but that was OK. The washrooms are in the food area. The bathing rooms are off the dorm rooms in the sleeping area. Joee's place is great if you need a clean place to stay for a night or a couple of nights. If you come in a group it works better for company in the common area. Everything is as advertised there is a good variety of breads, muffins, and bagels with a variety of spreads jams, Nutella and butter. Josee is very friendly she will explain anything about the town you want to know. And she is available by cell phone 24/7 if you have an issue."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Comfortable, clean and with a very large common kitchen lounge area. A great place to stop by"

Thank you for such a peaceful and beautiful stay."

2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Great place for single travellers looking for a clean, affordable night sleep. At least, this was what I was looking for. It has everything you can hope for, including a free simple continental breakfast. Also, a guest fridge you can use for groceries. Wifi is very reliable. Highly recommended"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great place. See my other review. It’s my second time here
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,only negative point for me. I think the bedroom area is very poorly insulated. We could hear everything.
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Very nice place

2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Beautiful small rooms, perfect for spending the night. Walls are thin so you can hear your neighbors but everybody tried to be very quiet during the night time. Clean and spacious bathrooms. Perfect small breakfast opportunities. Thanks!"
2022-09-01,4.0,Stayed one night,Perfect for a brief overnight stay en-route to or from the U.S. or else where in Canada. Convenient location for the border crossing just a few mins away. Very clean with ample amenities to prepare your own food etc.
2022-09-01,2.0,Stayed one night,"Despite nice common spaces and easy self check-in, we were very disappointed by our experience here. We booked the place as a rest stop, to get a good night’s sleep in the middle of a long journey. The bed was tiny (small single), the small room (a plywood box) had no ventilation or air flow, and we were awoken at 8 am by banging and a power drill in the plywood wall next to our heads.
It would be feasible for one guest if you just need a place to sleep, but not at these rates."
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Great little place, right location ,fair price for great value with all the amenities for any travellers, sure hope to return whenever visiting area just steps away from Brockville . Recommended as great alternative to any hotel"
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"A great concept. Modern and minimalist, clean, quiet. Room is small, but who needs more? It was fun and cozy and felt safe - although that depends on who else is sharing the hotel on the night you are there. Recommend!!"
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I work as a travel nurse and was looking for a comfortable and safe place to sleep between shifts. This place is very cute , clean and modern. Loved the blue lights under the bed. I felt very safe here and the bed and linens were so comfortable, like a 5star hotel. They go the extra mile to offer towels, disposable toothbrushes and paste. Headphones for a quiet sleep and more. There was coffee for breakfast and fresh croissants and breads. Great price and a wonderful Airbnb spot to rest! I would 110% recommend and go back!"
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This place definitely stands out- funky, modern, convenient, and very clean!"

2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Fantastic value for this stay. Kind of a high end hostel with great comfortable private rooms shared clean showers/bathrooms, and wide open kitchen/common area with a modern vibe. I was riding a bike to Montreal from Guelph. It was just what I needed."

2019-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"As several other reviews already said, this is a modern, somewhat stylish take on a hostel. Check-in is self check-in with a key code, both for the building and rooms. The rooms are small, but well arranged, so unless you're traveling with a lot of luggage, you'll be good. The bed is a single, but very comfortable. Everything is very clean. The breakfast in the common area is more substantial than you get at most hotels/motels: cereals, bread, fruit, yoghurt."
2019-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Clean and organized with nice practical touches like snacks, razors, all in place."
2019-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Very nice place and very clean. The host contacted me very quickly, all the information needed for my stay was there and everything worked perfectly once there. I wasn't expecting as many choices for my lunch and as much space. I was a little worried about the size of the room, but everything is really well thought out to make it efficient and functional. Especially the comfort of the bed and bedding it was wonderful. I discovered a great waterfront very close by the next day! I recommend it and would stay there anytime!"

Rooms were small but cozy, and the bed was super comfy. The common room had nice tables, big TV and kitchen. Solid breakfast with fruit, milk, cereals, coffee and toast with peanut butter and jam. The decor was really neat. Excellent location close to the waterfront, free overnight street parking. The host is not on-site, and so following the rules is up to each guest, but Josee is very each to reach and quick to communicate with if information is needed. I would stay again. Thank you."

Highly recommend."

2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We really enjoyed spending New Years Eve weekend here. The house was right on the water with great views in all rooms. Our 3 year old son enjoyed watching the big ships go by. There is another home on the property but nobody was there. The neighbors were home but far enough way to where we felt very secluded. We also got engaged over the weekend too making it a very memorable trip. Thanks again for everything, would certainly stay here again sometime"
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"The river cottage delivered with beautiful views of the St. Lawrence Seaway. The open floor plan and fully stocked kitchen made our stay extra comfortable. The king-size bed mattress topper was comfy and helped us sleep well.

2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Wonderful cottage on the river. Waking up to the splashing and view from the main bedroom was awesome! Wished we could have enjoyed the cottage and water more but we had commitments as we stayed here to visit SLU for parents weekend. Listing is perfectly accurate and Sean was great to deal with.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a wonderful stay! The house was exactly as described and we loved our time here. We traveled for the eclipse and Megan even left eclipse glasses for us.

The only issue we had was our GPS brought us past the house and wanted us to turn down a road that didn’t exist. Luckily, Megan had provided some directions, so we were able to find the house."

2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Place was nice good communication. Would recommend staying here
2023-01-01,4.0,Group trip,"Megan was a great host; very responsive to any questions we had. The place was very well appointed; many nice, considerate touches. The kitchen had everything we needed to cook Christmas meals to share with local family. The house was private and quiet but close to everything we needed. The thing we had an ""issue"" with was the heat in two of the bedrooms. Megan did offer suggestions to help but the regulation of the heat was difficult. Access to the bathroom for one of the guests was difficult at night. Megan made sure everything was clean and we had more than enough linens and blankets. We arrived just after a bad winter storm - everything was plowed and shoveled. I would not hesitate to recommend Megan's place."
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Great 3 bed/2 bath house for our family of 6. Perfect place for us. 15 minutes from Canton when we came to visit our cousin playing against SLU. Had everything we needed and great restaurant recommendations!

Thanks for being a great host!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Group trip,"This is a beautiful home that is wonderfully clean and packed with all you need for your family. Morning tea on the deck overlooking the peaceful St. Lawrence River, and the most gorgeous sunsets over the same, make this home extra special. The hosts were wonderful, responsive, and provided excellent instructions. Perfect place for our family, we look forward to returning."
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Amazing. Incredible. Show stopping.
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The stay at Marci's NY cottage exceeded my expectations. First, the place was gorgeous. Second, the place was immaculate. Third, there was coffee for first thing in the morning after our long trip! Last, my communications with Marci prior to and during our stay were excellent. I felt a strong sense of obligation to leave the place in tip-top shape. The sunsets were magical, the weather was perfect, the ease of being away from the hustle and bustle but also being close enough to fulfill our needs was the perfect combination. I would recommend this Airbnb to anyone who wants to be enveloped in god's greatest beauty. Those northern lights at night cannot be matched! And falling asleep to the rhythm of the water washing up on shore is so soothing. We intend to visit this place many more times. -Jill (9/11/21)"

2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Bring some water shoes and swimsuits! A quiet little fire by the river is very relaxing. Kayaking was nice and I was able to tie my boat up at the dock. The boat launch was just up the road 10 minutes after launch I was tied to the dock. Oh and the sunsets where amazing. The house is situated just right for them. Looking out over the river.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,What a gem of a cabin on the St. Lawrence River! We loved all the old time memorabilia and the dock and sunning rocks are calling us to come visit again. 😊

2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,I had a great stay at Cassie’s. It was just perfect. She even had wood for the fire pit which we ended up not using. But so gracious to provide. I just loved the location along the seaway. Woke up to loons and fog on the seaway the first morning. Cottage had everything I needed. A perfect first time Air BandB stay. Thank you!
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We stayed here for three nights and felt right at home. It's a beautiful and peaceful location. Hosts were very responsive, helpful, and proactive. At night, they even brought firewood for us to use even though we hadn't planned it, but it proved to be the perfect night for it. We had a great time. Will definitely recommend this place to others. We are looking to book another stay before winter."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We loved our stay at Loon's nest cottage! Our hosts went out of their way to ensure that ourselves and our dogs enjoyed our vacation from the very start!

The hosts thought of anything and everything you could need. It had a fully equipped kitchen with a dining table with a beautiful view. There was a fully stocked coffee bar with a drip coffee maker and a Keurig. All necessary linens were provided, sheets, towels, tea towels, etc. They even provided a little basket of toiletries which we were thankful for having forgot a few things!
There is a nice deck that overlooks the river. Perfect for reading or sipping drinking coffee. The dock was nice to sit on and watch the beautiful sunsets.
We loved our stay and hope to come back again soon!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Cassie’s cottage was very welcoming. She thought of every detail to make it relaxing and like home. She had bowls and beds along with treats for my dogs. The deck over looking the river had nice relaxing furniture and the yard with fire pits to enjoy. The dock included kayaks and even a stairs for the dogs to get back up. There was adequate parking for our truck and boat which she made accommodations for! The pictures were precise and the cottage was very clean. Looking forward to staying again in the future. Hands down would recommend!! Cassie and her husband did all the work fixing up the cottage bringing it back to life to be the cutest most relaxing vacation spot on the river. My only regret was having to leave.
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Ben and Jessica were wonderful hosts! They had great communication right from the start. All instructions for getting into the place, parking, etc were very thorough and helpful. The place itself was very clean and tidy. The decor was so neat and retro! Couldn't recommend this place enough!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Wow! The attention to detail is amazing. So much love has gone into the decor. Lots of space. Located on the main street with good food and coffee close by. We happened to be just passing through but this place is a destination.

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I was traveling with my teeming daughter. Both she and I enjoyed the unique ambience of the apartment, as well as the fact that it was spotless and had every amenity you could wish for. Moreover the directions to get to the apartment were clear and Ben was very responsive and accommodating. Highly recommend this accommodation and the hosts."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Our family went to Prescott for the eclipse. Ben and Jess were generous and attentive hosts.
Prescott is a lovely small town. The river walk is beautiful!
This is a very interesting apartment. There is a lot of fun memorabilia, mostly from the 40s, 50s and 60s. The interior walls are only 8 feet or so and the ceiling is at least 10 feet, so there is no sound or light separation from one room to another. This is not a complaint, as such, just a warning so others will not be caught unawares.
We enjoyed the location overlooking the main drag. We found it very quiet."
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Ben’s place is definitely a gem! From all the vintage furniture and the little details are amazing.. will definitely come again .. photos don’t do justice 10/10 recommend!

The images don’t do justice to such a pretty place, it is really spacious. Ben and Jessica are really sweet hosts and were available for any questions immediately. The whole experience was very smooth and I still cannot get over the decor and the aesthetics of the place. We had an amazing New Year’s eve."

The apartment is located in the downtown area, close to some shops and restaurants. It is not very far from the 401 highway.

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"We had a very relaxing stay! Pictures are accurate, but we were surprised how big this airbnb is. The kitchen was very clean, and had everything we could need.
The beds super comfortable, and bedding fresh. Living room had very cozy couches and tv with netflix, prime, etc.
We were so happy to go for our walks every morning on a beautiful walking path along the st lawerence steps away from the airbnb.
Wasnt an issue for us but for some seniors the stairs to get the airbnb might be an issue.
Ben was easy to contact and replied quickly.
Felt like home!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Ben and Jessica's place was a lovely apartment in the heart of Prescott minutes away from the river. The house was tastefully decorated with a vintage theme and they took every care to make sure the theme is well maintained across each room. The place was clean and very well maintained. Thank you Ben and Jessica.
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We particularly enjoyed our night at Ben and Jess's, especially for the kind attention to the arrival, the beautiful space and the typical decor. On the negative side, there is some noise outside and the rooms are not soundproofed in relation to each other (the walls do not go to the ceilings). But this is a detail and the apartment presents a great opportunity to sleep in Prescott! Thank you!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Me and my friends stayed at Ben’s place for 1 night and it was amazing! The place looks exactly like the pictures- even better. We loved the vibe.

2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Great place, lots of fun, a lot of thought put into the decorations. Ben responded quickly and we enjoyed our stay."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Ben was a great host. His place is lots of fun. Totally unique place to stay and very comfortable. If more than one couple are visiting it may be worth noting that the rooms are partitioned with wood which does not reach the ceiling meaning zero sound privacy.
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Really liked the extras that were provided. Grew up with pop shoppe and lucky elephant it was a treat to find it in the frig. The walls that didn’t extend to the ceiling were an interesting touch but tended to carry the noise a bit
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Very cool place very close to everything else you'll need in Prescott. Would go back for sure.
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Amazing theme home, walking distance to all places and it is right beside the waterfront! 100% would recommend anyone looking to stay in Prescott to check Ben's place out!"

Beds and furniture super cozy and comfy! Ben and Jessica were super proactive in giving us great instructions on where to park and access to the apartment was easy as pie.

2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Prescott is an up and coming destination
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Ben's place is great, and is as described. See other reviews for details. What struck me in addition is how great it was for me as a woman. Here's why:
Safe and reliable host -- very responsive, friendly, helpful, flexible, always available but non-intrusive
Place -- safe and secure location and building, conditioner as well as shampoo, more than one towel per person, clean throughout, thoughtful and generous touches and gifts, decor that is (very) pleasing to the eye, physically comfortable (e.g., beds, sofas, lighting), light and airy
Would stay again in a blink of an eye. Thank you, Ben"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Retro experience, at it’s best! Brought back lots of great childhood memories, including the 80’s treats provided by Ben & Jess, which were Pop Shoppe Pop and Pink Elephant Popcorn! Place was clean, cozy and a fantastic experience!"

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Lovely appartement. Ben and Lisa were great communicators and made check in very easy. Everything was spotless. From little bath bombs in the bathroom, to cold sodas and frosted mugs left for us in the freezers, this place was all in the details. Location was also great within walking distance of Prescott businesses and a short drive to more places in other towns"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"One of the very best Airbnbs I've ever stayed in (and I've stayed in a lot!) This is such a quirky place, and we loved the little touches from the hosts. Definitely stay here if you're passing through!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We had a fabulous stay at Ben's place! He definitely created an experience with the decor and lots of photo opportunities. Everything needed was there, and the rootbeer was a definate favourite. The beds were very comfortable and the music was the icing on the cake. Ben was helpful in recommending Bridgeview to eat at for dinner. Yummy food, great value and have an in-house smoker! We would definitely stay with Ben again."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"1 night stop on the way to Toronto, but what a great discovery! We loved the spirit of the apartment, the sought-after and neat decoration, the little touches of Ben & J.
Impeccable cleanliness, very well-equipped apartment and a very pleasant setting to walk around at the end of the day.
Great!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very cute!
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This retro-themed apartment is fun, comfortable, and well-situated . The hosts were very responsive and provided nice extras for guests. The air conditioning was appreciated, as was the coffee in the morning. The access is via a double set of stairs from the back parking lot, which could be an issue for those with mobility issues. Would definitely recommend this apartment, especially for proximity to the main street & the waterfront trail."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This apartment is amazing. It would take a few days to see all the vintage artifacts in it yet, it wasn't cluttered at all. Ben & Jessica went out of their way to make us feel welcome. We had a delicious fish dinner across the street at Bobby's Restaurant and finished our evening with a short walk along the Sandra S. Lawn Harbour/Marina. I would highly recommend this lodging to everyone and will definitely book a stay there again if ever in the Prescott area."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Great place ! Decor is absolutly amazing! Beds are very comfortable, very clean. Only downside is that the walls don’t go all the way to the ceiling, so not much privacy. But we noticed it in the pictures before booking and we are very happy with our stay!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Our first time being to Prescott (visiting friends in Cornwall) and we were not disappointed with this carefully curated, meticulously thoughtful guest touches to make our stay so enjoyable!
If you love one-of-a-kind properties and want to be transported back in time - book with Ben & Jessica!!
The retro welcome package, frosted mugs and ice ready to go for us. Coffee all set up for the morning, just needed to press a button and we had our caffeine! The radio was softly playing retro music when we arrived and the 8-track player in the headboard of one of our beds was AMAZING!!! What’s trip down memory lane😉
This is the best location to tour downtown and admire all the local entrepreneurs, history and architecture. We grabbed breakfast at Bobby’s and it was perfect!
We can’t wait to visit again - my heart is definitely attached to this space. Beds and pillows were so comfortable and we all know how rare that is - well done guys!
Thanks again for your wonderful hospitality!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great location and loved the little back deck! Easy check in. Had root beers waiting for us to enjoy on the deck. Went for great walk along StLawrence waterfront pathway system! Beautiful and refreshing after being in the road. Lots of quirky decor. Space is huge and great tv w Netflix was a plus. Lots of timmies k cups for morning. Comfy beds and hot shower. Was a great stay and good value. Very friendly!

2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"What a unique wonderful place to stay! Just a wonderful spot. Well appointed, and the host was there upon our arrival to make sure all was good. A great town to spend a few days in, and Ben has spared no expense on his wonderful spaces. We were lucky enough to see another unit upstairs and it was amazing as well. Everyone in town was extremely freindly and my overseas guests and myself and husband had a really, really enjoyable stay here. OUr only regret was we didn't have time to do a polaroid for the wall!!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Really loved the vibe of this place. So much to look at in the apartment. Area is very spacious. Great location.
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Really nicely decorated, spacious, clean, and comfortable apartment. Walking distance to restaurants and just across the street from the River Walk entrance. There were also some fun things in the apartment that really personalized the space. Comfortable beds, super-soft bed linens, nice towels. The apartment was also nice and cool when we walked in. Hosts were very responsive and provided tips on where to eat, events (Poutine Feast). We would definitely stay there again. Loved it! Thanks, Ben and Jess!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Ben & Jessica have an absolutely incredible place! The theme is the 1950’s we had A & W Root Beer & candy Popcorn waiting for us along with a personalized welcome on a Betty Boop sign🤩 The apartment was squeaky clean and had lots of nice extras in the kitchen! We had such a wonderful time, just a short walk to the river and you can walk for miles so pretty. We had a great brunch and also a dinner at local restaurants near by, both within walking distance! Prescott was our choice because it was in the middle of the areas we wanted to explore, and it worked out perfectly. All three of us felt this was the best Airbnb we have ever stayed at 💖. Thank you to our hosts😍"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is a unique place where the hosts have gone to a lot of trouble to decorate in a unique and quirky way. We loved the retro vibe. Kitchen stocked with coffee and tea and helpful cooking condiments. Beds looked new and were very comfortable. Nice linens and towels. Host were very communicative and super flexible with us - including allowing us to stay longer when a last minute work meeting prevented on-time check out.
The only thing to be aware of (as one other reviewer mentioned) is that walls don’t go to the ceiling, so sound travels in between the rooms of the apartment. This was OK for the two of us but may not suit everyone.
Prescott is a lovely place to visit and I would definitely stay here again."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Absolutely amazing experience. The hosts were so personable and thoughtful. They go the extra mile, think of all the little details and even go further than that. 100% best experience! What an amazing place to stop in and take it all in. So much fun and character!!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Amazing stay after 9 day of travelling from Ontario, through the states, New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, PEI and Quebec.

My daughter and I took a walk by the water and the short walk to Tim Hortons, very enjoyable. Amazing place and great hosts!"

2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Our stay was exactly as described and even had little extra bonus surprises left by the hosts to make us feel welcome. The location is perfect, only a 2 minute walk to restaurants and the waterfront. We will definitely be going back during the summer months to enjoy the local festivities."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This place is so cute! Like sleeping in a museum of the 50s-80s. Ben has thought of everything and makes you feel at home with a welcome pack, and kind gestures like leaving on the bedside lights. Follow Ben's instructions to the parking and it's a great location for the town. Note: may not be for snorers. As it's an old building, the walls are visual dividers only as they don't go to the ceiling. Will stay again."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"The apartment is exactly as described. Prescott is a small older village, for the area it was exactly what we wanted for private accommodations."

10/10 would come back again."

2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Overall wonderful place. Love the theme it is wonderful down to every little detail. The only minor thing that could be improved is the AC situation, it's not unbearable but it's also understandable due to the age of the building.
Thank you again for letting me and my fiance stay here."
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is an ""awesome"" Airbnb. The hosts are great the personal touches made it even more comfy. The Retro furniture and decor amazing.

2020-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"A great place to stay! We stayed for a weekend as part of our Anniversary celebration. The place in general is amazing - thoughtfully decorated, great amenities, cozy and cute touches, generally clean etc. Ben and Jessica were so great with prompt responses and helpful answers. Our only two complaints were that one, we could not find face/shower cloths to use for our showers, or a dish scrubber to use in order to put our dishes away for them! And two, some things (more lighting working, fan and bedframe mirror cleaner, more TV channels etc) could have been more convenient and/or comfortable for us. However, nothing enough to remove a star. The stay was definitely 5 ☆ and we appreciate it very much. We would definitely return. Thank you again, Ben and Jessica!"
2020-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Beautiful, clean and amazing place to stay. Good Irish pub nearby for food and drinks. Super clean and highly recommended."
2020-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Absolute gem just a 20min drive to Brockville. Totally unique space with incredible retro furniture in mint condition. Super comfortable beds and couches and all the amenities you need for a great stay. Ben and Jess were gracious hosts who responded quickly to all communication. Check in and out were easy and we can’t wait to be back!
2020-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Beautiful decor, location and as advertised in every way. To discover! It feels perfectly good and everything is very comfortable!"
2020-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"The hosts were amazing and very thoughtful and communicative. The place is exactly as pictured in the ad and very clean. One thing, there isn’t really anywhere in walking distance to get any groceries or anything, so come prepared with the food you need or drive to the grocery store ten minutes or so away. I would stay here again."
2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Ben & Jessica's apartment was absolutely charming! The decor was so fun and exactly as depicted in the photos. Jessica was quick to respond to any questions and we loved her dinner recommendation. The apartment was easy to find and a perfect spot for a walk along the beautiful waters edge. We would definitely recommend Ben's place and look forward to being able to stay there again.
2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The place is well located right in the middle of town. Close to everything you need. Also right around the corner from the beach and new splash pad.
Ben and Jessica are amazing hosts and always available. Had an issue with the lock on the first night and they came right over at 10pm. Outstanding communication and very open about everything.
The apartment is much bigger than I expected and anything needed is available like coffee, tea, lots of pots and pan and even a bbq. Ohhhh and lets not forget the bathroom with a huge claw foot tub....to die for.
Only 2 very small thing but it didn’t really make my experience bad would be just to have curtains in the back so it is darker in the early morning, maybe an extra TV in the smaller bedroom because if you bave kids only one TV is available now and maybe a fan in the master bedroom. But like I said it didn’t affect me but it would be a welcome addition.
Will be booking this place again for sure."
2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This was a really unique spot that I would stay at again, anytime I find myself needing a place to stay anywhere near Prescott. The built in radio in the bed was a neat touch!"
2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Great location, very large apartment, fully equipped and sparkling clean. Would recommend this place."
2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This apartment is absolutely unique! So much fun to discover all the little details that went into the design. Super clean too, and great communication with Ben and Jessica. Visitors should be aware that the walls don't go all the way up to the ceiling (as you can see from the pictures), which means that sounds carry very well throughout the whole place. We nevertheless had a great stay!"
2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Ben was a great host! Easily accessible and quick to answer any questions we had. Beautiful modern vintage and clean space :)
2020-08-01,4.0,Stayed one night,Great responsive hosts. Unique decor
2020-08-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"Ben’s place have a lot of interesting retro decor. The beds are really amazing. The building is a bit old, the location is very good. We enjoyed our short stay. Thank you!"
2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,This apartment is just as the pictures you see. Probably the coolest space we've stayed in. Ben & Jessica are very responsive and everything was ready and clean when we arrived. Everything you need is provided and the location couldn't be better - right on main street. :)
2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"A fun and stylish place, it felt like a trip back to the past! Really beautiful vintage decorations and design. We only stayed one night but will be perfect for a weekend or a long stay too. Very comfortable, private, clean and convenient location to walk around downtown. It was also easy to communicate with the host, they were very helpful in every step and flexible with check-in/out. Will definitely stay here next time I am in the area."
2020-08-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"Stylish, retro apartment. I think they are in the process of continuing to update the space, but it is already a neat place to stay. All amenities and host even stocked some coffee pods. Cool feature, the ceilings are open (ie the walls don’t reach all the way up), which was no problem for us but could be for couples sharing. Host helped us rig a baby bed up so appreciate that!"
2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Nice place!
2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Ben’s place was amazing. The space is larger than the photos show, it has everything you need for your stay, felt just like home. Great communication, and the location is perfect just a 2 minute walk to the waterfront and park. The place was exceptionally clean and comfortable, can’t wait to visit again!"
2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Place was very cute and much bigger than expected. Check in was easy and Ben responds quickly. Would stay again
2020-07-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"Absolutely LOVED the location of this space! What an incredible waterfront Prescott has! We had no idea that it would be so close to the waterfront, and there are SO many amenities all along the water. WOW! We were really impressed by all the recommendations from Ben, and appreciated all the clear communications. The home was set-up prepared for guests to be comfortable. The decor is so fantastic and fun! Each room has items to take a peek at! Beds were extremely comfortable, place was very clear and cared for. If I had to make any suggestions, it would be possible a fan for each bedroom as the AC unit was felt most in the living room, a bit more tv options, and maybe some curtains at the back for a bit of privacy (but none a deal breaker by any means). Would gladly stay here again and take in even more that Prescott has to offer!"
2020-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was a wonderful get away, we loved the place and the town. Ben was a great host and the place was really clean and very cool. Everything was absolutely amazing and we will definitely be back! Thank you to Ben and Jess."

2020-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The place is extremely clean and much larger than the pictures reveal. Beautiful vide and a close distance to the St Lawrence Seaway boardwalk. Very enjoyable stay and strongly recommended.
2020-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Beautiful, stylish, clean, and interesting space. Original fixtures and finishes, yet decorated throughout in 1950s style. The location is ideal, right downtown, a block from the beautiful waterfront and marina. Prescott surprised us! Great coffee and sandwiches at Katarina's (Ben's suggestion), interesting national historic sites, and layers of local history everywhere you turn. A relaxed, friendly vibe. Ben was a great host--responsive, accommodating, and yet left us to enjoy the apartment in privacy. We'll be back for sure!!"
2020-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Ben's place was very stylish and had great personal touches like a welcome sign with my name on it! My boyfriend and I stayed here for the night to explore Prescott and this was the perfect choice. The Airbnb is in a great area, just a close walk to the water front. Ben was very quick to respond and friendly. The check in was easy and Ben even gave us some tips of where to eat in town! I would definitely stay again. The only negative thing I would mention is that the entrance to the Airbnb isn't the nicest. There is construction going on in the building just next to it and takes away from the initial experience."
2020-06-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"Lovely space! Ben was a great host and quick to respond to any questions. The apartment was clean and super stylish, exactly as pictured. I had an excellent 2 week stay and would definitely recommend this spot."
2020-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I stayed at Ben's place for nearly 2 months and it was completely hassle free. Ben went above and beyond what I could have ever expected of him. I couldn't recommend this place, or Ben as a host, enough."

2019-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Right downtown Prescott so great for access to 401/Brockville/Kemptville areas and décor is kind of early 1900's - I thought it was so cute. And Ben even left milk in the fridge for my morning coffee, and it was a really nice coffee maker too, and Ben had great tips for me for a morning run route and local places to eat. Perfect for what I needed."

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Loved this little cottage. It was located in a very peaceful area and was pretty private. We walked about the area and were warmly welcomed. The kitchen is well equipped which was nice for cooking our meals. We will definitely be booking again in the future and possibly be bringing our boys to enjoy the little beach they have available. Perfectly suitable for a couples getaway or a family with two children.

2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"It is such a beautiful spot and just what we needed! It was so relaxing. Sitting out on the deck getting some sun and watching the boats go by was so peaceful. We loved having the windows open and there are so many the cross-breeze is great. Even the couple moments of not so nice weather was enjoyable seeing the weather head down the river through the windows. And the beach area is great, our pup loved it!"

Dock access to the lake, bright sunny morning breakfasts on the dock, small beach on the property, what’s not to love. Thanks for welcoming us with a bottle of wine - a great touch! Thanks for the great stay!"
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Little piece of paradise to enjoy the beautiful nature. It's magical to sit on the terrace for watching the birds. Our two labradors loved the place, perfect for swimming and paddleboarding. Our host was quick to answer any questions we may have. Everything was perfect.👌🏻"
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,The cottage was so lovely and well done.

2022-06-01,5.0,Group trip,"Derek provided fast, clear, and easy communications before, during, and after our stay at such a uniquely positioned location. There’s really no better feeling than waking up with a view of water and sunrise every day of our stay. The amenities were perfect and fit our group of 4 perfectly. Derek’s father Dale also chartered a fishing trip for the group which made the trip that much more memorable. Would definitely stay again. Thanks Derek!"
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great and beautiful place! It’s well maintained and clean. We visited here for the Victoria Day long weekend. Communication to Derek was really good too and prompt! We had most of what we need for a nice mini vacation :)
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The cottage was super cute, very clean and very cozy. I loved how it was right on the water and had everything I needed. The Byrds were super communicative and very sweet! I loved the little welcome basket and complimentary gift :)"

2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The fall foliage set the perfect tone for our little getaway.
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The view and the proximity of the water are unbeatable!! We relaxed so much... It was raining but you feel so close to the water even tough you are inside :)
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Just had a 3 night stay with our family and it was absolutely stellar!
The cottage itself is cute and was perfect for our 11 month old daughter (since she’s super fascinated with stairs these days) and was a quick walk out to a beautiful morning sunrise and sunset view! Made it feel extra relaxing!!
The fire pit is just across the bridge and we sat around there mostly during the cold fall nights! We brought our own firewood and kindle as well which we just had enough for 3 nights!!!
Propane was left from the previous guest so we didn’t have to use the one we brought which was super nice!! :)
We mostly spent our days outdoors didn’t leave the cottage only for a couple things the one day but the town and stores are super easy to get to and find!
And the entire community along the peninsula were all super nice and everyone would wave when you drove by! Felt like being back at home !!
It was an overall over the top experience for our family and our first AirBnb stay together so it was really nice and to get away just before I have to return to work next month, the perfect way to end my maternity leave ! :) Our home away from home and did not want it to end! :)
Thank you once again to the byrds! For the complimentary bottle of wine and the craft beer tall can which I used to cook our beer can chicken!!! It was absolutely amazing! We will for sure be back! ❤️"
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Great location, with a beautiful dock to sit, tan and watch the boats go by. The property has a huge grassy area beside with a fire pit.
The cottage had everything you would need in the kitchen to cook and prep your meals. (Oil, salt, pepper) the only thing that could use an update would be the BBQ… I think it has seen some better days :(
Over all a great stay and the hosts are quick at responding to any questions!"
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The Byrd’s are amazing host’s! Some girlfriends and I went to their place for a girls weekend & the Byrd’s ensured we had everything we could possibly need & more to make it a great trip; right down to suggestions for local restaurants! The location of the Airbnb is great & accessible, and they were very responsive as well with any questions that we had. We look forward to going back next summer!"
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great spot with a functional, clean, comfortable and well decorated little cottage. The Byrd's are wonderful, very responsive hosts. You are sure to have a great stay!"

Enjoyed our stay once again."

It’s a great location with easy access to to stores/restaurants. We very much enjoyed our little family get away."
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great location, easy access to lake and river, as well as Prescott, Ottawa region. Very clean and fresh interior. Kitchen is big with lots of amenities. Bathroom sink is small but the use of bathroom space has been optimized and works. One large bed great for parents along with bunk bed and pull out couch for kids or extra guests. Beautiful deck and private fire pit area with firewood availablefor purchase on the rental property, very convenient. Easy check-in and binder with house instructions and local recommendations. Hosts are responsive through airbnb and are just down the road should any issues arise. Overall a lovely stay!"
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We absolutely loved our stay at the Byrd’s! It was so serene and beautiful - we couldn’t have asked for more! Beautiful views of the sunrise through the kitchen and beautiful views of the sunset from the private beach. We also loved how wonderfully the place was decorated - there was a peaceful, nautical theme throughout the cottage and we loved it! The location is amazing as you are right next to the water and so close to wonderful hiking locations as well. The people of Johnstown are also extremely kind and lovely. Wonderful stay altogether!"
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Pristine little gem literally on the river/channel. Perfect getaway for solo travellers looking for a peaceful retreat, or for small families who enjoy swimming, fishing or just lounging on a deck. Cottage has a large BBQ and is very well equipped to prepare meals. A/C is in the bedroom, and those who prefer a colder setting will not be disappointed. The snack basket and information on local happenings is a nice touch. Host is responsive, friendly and knowledgeable about the area."
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Just an amazing stay. You’re living right on the St Lawrence, and just steps away from the river is the Byrds’ wonderful family compound, which features a magical and treed private sandy beach that opens up to a quiet and shallow inlet off the river, perfect for kayaking and SUPing as well as reading and napping. (We were there a lot.) And the place itself was so modern, well-attired and clean, with so many thoughtful touches that really made the most of that unique space. A comfortable bed with excellent sheets in an air-conditioned room, plus a full kitchen with outdoor grill, was amazing. No WIFI was a plus, frankly; in the rare moments we did need the internet—say, to get in touch with the Byrds, who responded very quickly and kindly—our data worked great. A fantastic getaway for a family or a couple looking for post-pandemic peace."
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,I had a nice relaxing stay at the Byrds. Absolutely love the deck and the complimentary snack basket.
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Wow - what a gem this place is! it is literally right on the water of the North Channel of the St. Lawrence River. We experienced beautiful sunsets on one side and brilliant sunrises on the other. We were entertained by all the activity on the channel - birds, geese, a Great Blue Heron, and brief nightly visits from a mink! This former tugboat office is now a lovely little cottage right beside OPG's tug boat yard and it was fascinating to watch little Oliver the tugboat and Halton the barge go off to work in the morning. Even with all this activity, the property is very private and quiet. We walked the length of the private road to the tip of the isthmus and met some really nice neighbours and their intersting homes. Met their dogs and chickens, too. Inside the cottage, it's all white and blue and nautical, of course. Every amenity is provided - even a bottle of wine! Comfortable bed and amazing shower. Check in is a breeze and Derek was quick to communicate if needed.
All in all, a great spot for a peaceful break. We would definitely stay here again!"
2021-05-01,5.0,Group trip,"It was such a wonderful experience. Couldn't have been more pleased with the accommodations, friendly service and location.

2021-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a much needed relaxing weekend! The house is right by the water so you get amazing views, especially at sunrise/sunset. The house itself is so cozy.

2021-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Had a great stay at the Byrd's Eye View. The hosts were very accommodating and communicated well with us throughout our stay. The location was unique and we were able to spend a great weekend relaxing by the St. Lawrence River. The place had all the amenities as described plus some board games and a fire pit. I would definitely stay here again.

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Gorgeous property and house! The listing is accurate and in my opinion, the place looks even cuter than the photos. Clean, cozy and plenty of room. The view was lovely, overlooking the river plus there is a private patio that overlooks the water. Was very spacious for just me and could also see a couple or small family being comfortable. Will definitely rebook if/when I’m up in the area again!"
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Cozy, comfortable, and clean. I would definitely stay again and will plan on it. Enjoyed a nice dinner at The Place and came back to a warm, inviting home that had everything one would need. Thank you for opening your home to me. Next time I hope to enjoy the kayaks and water."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,I couldn’t have asked for a better place to stay while I was in the area for work. Location was absolutely beautiful and very peaceful. Wonderful spot to watch sunset on the dock. Owner’s very responsive and directions to location accurate and easy to find. Felt at home and would stay again.
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The rental was very nice and clean, great location from Alexandria bay and Clayton ny where we had a wonderful time very peaceful and private will definitely go back again next year."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This place is absolutely spectacular if you want peace and quiet. You can make use of the river front and enjoy the sunsets.
2023-08-01,5.0,Group trip,"Very comfortable, clean and peaceful...definitely recommend!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This AirBnB was wonderful! What a beautiful property, with a beautiful, clean home. We had never stayed in a place that was ""shared"" with the host before, but it was a great experience and would definitely return! The house's view of the water was beautiful, the whole lower level was ours, and felt private the entire time. While we didn't get a chance to interact with the host as we were mainly out - if we stay again, would love to. Thanks again for a great stay, and would highly recommend staying here if you're in the area!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Alexander's Place is beautifully decorated and as pictured. I had asked prior to booking if it was suitable for 4 yr old twins, and told yes. I would not recommend staying here if you have rambunctious young children. As described in the listing you are sharing their home, but there is no door to separate you from the upstairs which posed a real problem with wild kids. I spent most of my time yelling at my kids to stay downstairs and then feeling embarrassed that someone could hear me yelling at my kids. The other notes to not stay with young kids, There is no area to sit and eat. There is an outside table but it was raining. If you are not staying with young kids you will find this to be a great place to stay. Everything is provided for you and very clean. We did get a chance to go swimming and kayak which was amazing. We know the area very well and would recommend Alexander's place to others staying in the area with out kids."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"What an absolutely peaceful place on the lake! It was a great place to spend our 23rd anniversary! The view is stunning, and so is the sunset! We had a great time kayaking on the river, too. The hosts have thought of every detail to make you feel at home. They even left a sweet note and champagne for our anniversary! Thanks again for the perfect getaway."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful, peaceful location right on the river. Loved the landscaping, lawn chairs and dock. Apartment was clean and clutter free. Extra amenities like shampoos and soaps. Owner is proactive in arrival/entry instructions and checked in after a day or two to ask if anything else was needed. Wifi works great, and tv if you must. My cell phone did not connect to the internet without wifi, so I did not have access to text or maps. (My partner's did). But in that beautiful location, did I really need it?"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"For us (a family of 3 with a 7 year old, a 26' boat, and orginally from a nearby town), it was a great fit! If you know much about this part of the St. Lawrence, you dock overnight at your own risk (waves, wind, etc.). So having the new Morristown launch so close plus use of their dock during the day/calm water was an excellent setup for us. Plenty of water to dock up to a 30 footer on the the southwest side, & plenty of room to drive in & park both truck & trailer.
My wife & I were also pleased with the interior setup. While it is an (open) split entry with the upper level private, the lower level also ""feels"" very private & cozy. Essentially 2 bed rooms, a full bath, & a full living room. No kitchen per se, but a microwave & coffee maker, plus access to a refrig, freezer, & laundry in the adjoining shop/mechanicals room. Once you use the lock box to enter through the common split entry, thereafter you have a private entrance via the rear glass sliding door to the living area."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great visit! The host was extremely responsive and was more than willing to help us with anything that came up.

2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The hosts were very kind and easy to work with. Tom even had pre-emptively turned the heat on for us since it was a bit chilly at night. Cabin was clean and cute and the lake view was great. We had hoped to take advantage of the fire-pit with lake views but were very busy visiting family in Canton. I would stay again.
2022-09-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Friendly hosts. Good communication. Nice view. 2 of the bedrooms are actually lofts open to the main space with no privacy or sound insulation.

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Jenny’s cabin was warm and cozy. The place was clean and well stocked with lots of amenities. There was a full kitchen and large refrigerator. The cabin met our needs quite well. We had come to the area for a long weekend to visit family and see the solar eclipse. Since we had family in the area, we didn’t spend much time at the cabin but it was a comfortable place to come home to at night. Jenny is a great host and very responsive."

2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,We only stayed one night during a snowstorm but it was the perfect place to be. The cabin had everything we needed. It was easy to find with the photos. We didn’t see another soul the whole time we were there but someone did plow the road in the morning.
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,A great getaway . No problems . Would go back for sure .
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"I had a great stay, as always! I look forward to my next trip there. Thank you, Jenny!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,I could not get the lock box to work so I had to leave keys on table which locked door. I couldn’t get back in to close windows which I felt bad about.

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Four stays in the last year and one more to go! Always a great stay!

2023-09-01,3.0,Stayed with a pet,"Host responsive prior to arrival but place is small and needs some updating, decluttering, neighbors were closer than expected and surrounding area had trash and rundown properties."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,very clean with everything needed
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The place was absolutely wonderful. Jenny provided excellent instructions and photos, which first getting there could have been a little tricky without. Getting in was a breeze. The place was spotless and smelled clean. There were plenty of extra towels and linens, along with just about anything extra we could possibly need. The mosquitos were rough (nature of the location) and we came prepared but there were citronella candles and bug spray available. The couch was comfortable and the smart tv was great to watch when it got rainy out.
The porch was perfect to sit and listen to the birds, and watch the deer, squirrels and chipmunks. The only thing I could say is it maybe wasn’t quite as private as I thought but all we had to do was sit in the side yard or point our chairs a different direction to not see the neighbors as much. Even with the neighbors close proximity it was still very quiet and peaceful. We hope to be back in the area again soon & would 100% chose to stay here again!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"It was a very cute little cabin!! Comfortable beds, nice shower. Had all the dishes and cookware we needed. Enjoyed the porch! But wasn’t AS secluded as we thought, it wasn’t any big deal though. We weren’t bothered at all and it was just more in a wooded little neighborhood. Loved it, would come back!"

2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"This is a newly remodeled small remote cabin in the woods down a narrow private road away from any lights. It's VERY quiet and gets very dark at night...perfect. You can see the river through the trees, but I'm not sure if there is access. Jenny was very responsive and addressed any issues, however minor, by the next day. Big Lots is up the street and they only thing that stays open late. There's a huge grocery section inside if you need anything. I'm up this way for work so I don't get out and do much and can't recommend any activities, but if you need to work while traveling, the wifi is great. I would definitely stay again. And make sure to wave to your neighbor!"

Can’t say anything more then my contractor of a fiancé was impressed from the stairs leading up to where he just sat on the couch in the foyer when we got there just taking it in. Being in a downtown area, surrounded by older buildings then to open the door to this gorgeous space. There was nothing he would change, we loved everything about the space. It’s close enough to Upper Canada Village that after our evening of a horse drawn carriage ride, instead of going for dinner we both just wanted to get back to this space and ring in the New Year there! We will be back!"

2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very impressive space! Beautifully decorated and comfortable. Highly recommend staying here for leisure or business. I will definitely return in the future!
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful spacious unit! Nicely appointed with nautical touches. Very clean and well equipped. Ben and Jess were helpful and responsive. Would stay there again.
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Great space! Really well done, comfortable, and convenient. Will stay again when passing through to Montreal!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Perfect. The space is very large and is decorated to give it a real sense of place, relating beautifully to the historic St Lawrence River. Bathroom has a spa feeling. Kitchen is open to the large space and is well equipped. Location is excellent, just across the street from a comfortable Irish Pub and the riverfront walk. The light in the morning is beautiful, streaming into the bedroom (equipped with black out shades but I chose to let the morning light in).
Ben was responsive, friendly and easy to work with."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,What a great space! Feels brand-new and was positively spotless. Huge loft with great lighting and good appliances. Loved the nautical theme and learned a good bit about Great Lakes shipping. Went for a walk on the river and had no less than 3 very pleasant conversations with super-friendly locals.
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Beautifully designed place, right on the main street of a small quiet harbor town. Still plenty to do: Farmer's Market, several resaturants, town beach, walkway on the harbor, all in easy walking distance. A visiting theater group did an amazing, clever rendition of Alice in Wonderland at the waterside ampitheater one block away. A short drive gets you to bigger cities with more to do, but then you can come back to this quiet town and avoid the crowds, noise and hassle. Courteous touches like good coffee, creamer and some sparkling water provided. Little table and chairs on the back landing. Shower is spacious and beautiful, feels like a spa. Would definately stay here or at another of their rentals again!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The best rental made: very original, very well equipped and very clean: go without a second thought!

2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place! Really enjoyed our stay.
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Our stay was perfect! From booking to checkout! Ben and Jessica hosted us well and were available for us. I loved walking along the river with its little marina. The place is picturesque and charming. I recommend it!
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"The apartment impressively combines functionality with thoughtful and beautiful decor. The open-concept living room and kitchen offer ample space and high ceilings, creating a welcoming atmosphere. The kitchen is well-equipped and truly a gem with everything one could possibly need.
Regarding the location, it is truly unbeatable! Being right across the street from the waterfront, the beautiful riverside walkway provides perfect opportunities for leisurely strolls. There's plenty to do in the area!
I highly recommend this Airbnb apartment! Whether you seek a peaceful escape or a convenient base to explore the surrounding area, this place has everything you need for a wonderful stay."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Ben and Jessica have a beautiful top floor apartment. We love the high ceilings, the modern and comfortable furnishings, including the king- size bed and amazing bathroom shower!. Lovely welcoming touches including the chocolates, chalkboard greeting, the coffee cream (VERY much appreciated) and bottle water. The poer roller shades were a comvenient feature too. Be prepared to climb the stairs to get to the suite boy or was worth it! I would definitely stay there again if traveling to Prescott."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Jess and Ben have outdone themselves in decorating and setting up this maritime-themed loft.
So much attention to detail it's truly impressive! This place is for 2 but it is HUGE!
Everything is clean, modern, thought out for an easy stay. Very well equipped and superbly decorated apartment, kitchen and bathroom, it's much better than described!
Finally, we met Ben upon checking out, and we understand where the passion and genuine interest to host comes from! Very friendly and dedicated host, we will surely plan to stay here again when the occasion presents itself.
For any couple or solo traveller looking for a excellent place, super centrally located in a small town, next to the waterfront, 1 hour from Ottawa or 2 hours from Montréal we would recommend staying here without any hesitation!
Merci Ben & Jess!

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,One of the nicest Airbnbs we have enjoyed. Beautifully restored and renovated in a quaint riverside town!
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Ben and Jessica were fantastic and their place even better. We booked the 3rd floor unit and it was beautiful. So clean, tidy and more items there than I’ve ever seen in and air b&b. Shampoo, conditioner, hair dryer, iron board, even a portable fan for the bedroom. The kitchen was well stocked with ice maker fridge, coffee, chocolate, water waiting for you. I love to cook and the kitchen had EVERYTHING you would need, right down to cook oil (which I forgot). The location was near a pub, bank, corner store, trails along the water front and walk the other direction to enjoy the neighbourhood. We even took a drive down hwy 2 and found this cute little restaurant/marina where we had lunch on the waterfront patio and enjoyed local
brewery drinks. I want to keep this gem to myself but there has been so much care put into this place that people need to know. Looking for a little staycation/escape book this place! Couple days or a week it will not disappoint."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"second time there and it's always a great stay, super clean super nice space. would definitely keep back"

I could have stayed here for days on end
I highly recommend this place of heaven for anyone wanting to spend time in the Prescott area
Ben and Jess are the terrific hosts"
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Ben and Jessica’s space was a beautiful home away from home. The photos truly cannot do the space justice! The room is lit very strategically and allows for guests to highlight certain areas/decor and set a very relaxing mood.
The kitchen was fully stocked and allowed for meal prepping and full meals… Ben and Jessica were also kind enough to incorporate a desk into the space during my stay, or made for a perfect work from home space and I was happy to join meetings with the impressive surroundings in my background. The space is conveniently located very close to a local pub, great for getting together with friends, as well as the local walking trail which makes for a great lunch break stroll. Overall, a great space with wonderful hosts who are very responsive. I look forward to booking another stay in this great bnb in future!"
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"It's the little things that make a stay special and stepping into Ben's place was like staying at a good friend's place. A welcoming note, plenty of room, bright and clean place.
You just want to stay there and cosy up and never leave!!"
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Ben is great and very responsive, we needed to check in early and he was great to accommodate us. The place is beautifully decorated and spacious, we enjoyed the stay."
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"This apartment is beautiful. It’s very clean, roomy, and the natural lighting is fabulous. Ben is an excellent host. He responds quickly if there are issues or questions, and works hard to make sure the stay is great. Prescott is a small town, so pretty much everything is within walking distance. A perfect stay."
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Fantastic host! Very responsive and accommodating to alternate check-in and out times. Place was as advertised, quiet, easy to find, absolutely perfect!"
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Cyndi was great to work with. Place was as described, older home but I loved the old craftsmanship. Perfect little spot. The stairs are a little scary if steps bother you. But honestly a great little place."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I have stayed here at least 3 times. I usually stayed in the downstairs apartment, this time I was in the upstairs apartment. While I didn’t care for the stairs, the apartment was comfortable and great for me. Really enjoyed the stay."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,: )
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Cute and cozy spot with all the things needed to make food at home and enjoy time in or work happily from home away from home. This is an old house with old house sounds and smells but if you dont mind a few quirks its a great and affordable option and the host was friendly and helpful.
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"Very attentive host, never wanted for anything. Private entrance and ample off street parking. Nice park across the street and in a very quiet area. Walking distance to the good restaurants along the river. Cyndi made me feel right at home with sparkly clean linen, towels and plenty of extras in case they’re needed. The house is a bit older so it has some quirks but the apartment is well furnished, and anytime I needed anything it was there the very next day, would 100% stay there again in the future!"
2023-05-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"The Studio apt. was exactly as described. The bed was very comfortable, has a nice fireplace for cool nights in New York. We did not use the kitchen because we spent our time with family - we were there for a grandson’s graduation. So can’t comment on if appliances worked etc but the coffee pot did work which was good. We did have to borrow a toaster from our family but know Cyndi said she would purchase one. There are not many outside places to have breakfast so a toaster would be a good addition. Bathroom was clean and she provided towels and wash cloths, a bathmat. All we needed. The stairs into the apt was the only negative and Cyndi did say they are working on them. So all in all a very good stay. Thank you."
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"For a travel nurse the location couldn’t be better, being right across from the hospital!"
2024-05-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"A great place to stay, very quiet and private. The apartment is conveniently located near both Canton and Potsdam."

2023-10-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Affordable short term stay place.
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had an absolutely wonderful stay here! The bed was extremely comfortable, it was very private and quiet, and the hosts were very sweet and accommodating! We absolutely loved our stay, and definitely would stay again if we were in the area again. Close to nearby towns, and right near a cute little convenience store. I would very highly recommend to anyone who is looking for a beautiful and private place in the north country."
2023-09-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"Adequate accommodation - quiet area, and Ben was on hand when we couldn't lock the door. We thought the fridge wasn't good because it was very frosted up so some of our things froze and it was noisy through the night. The bed was not comfortable either. But it was clean."

Very clean, comfortable bed, and great little kitchen to cook a few meals! Ben responded to my question I had right away. Lovely people and place. I will be returning!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Nice quiet place in the country to unwind but close enough to town for everything you need for your stay. Close to the Adirondacks and the St. Lawrence. The hosts were very unobtrusive and respectful of my privacy. A good experience all around.
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Just returning from my second stay at one of Ben's units. This has been my preferred way to stay in town for moving-in and visiting my college kid over area hotels. Ben's property is quiet, serene and easy to find. He is such a responsive host, clearly communicating from check-in to check-out while giving guests privacy during their stay. This great studio style unit has everything you could need for your stay from all kitchen esentials to desks, table and couch space all in a roomy clean space. The internet was a bit spotty my past stay, yet this is the north country and I do not feel this is a reflection of the host just a fact of life in the area. highly suggest this rental when you find yourself traveling along New York's Northern border."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I'm a travel nurse, this place was the perfect place to stay during my first week at the Potsdam hospital. will definitelybe coming back while I'm on contract :)"

2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,I had a great experience here!! It was perfect for just myself. I had no issues at all and the hosts had it set up so I was in need of nothing!! It was very clean and I felt right at home!

2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This was a perfect place to stay while I visited my two children who attend St Lawrence University. It was just an easy 15 minutes from campus and it had everything I needed. Thanks Ben! I would definitely stay here again in the future.
2022-10-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,This place was very clean and had everthing we would need. Bed could use updating.
2022-10-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Reasonably priced and clean. Not luxurious, but plenty comfortable. Good location, with Canton and St. Lawrence University about 15 minutes away. Indian Creek Nature Center is even closer. And not a bad drive to the bridge at Ogdensburg for forays into southern Ontario."
2022-10-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,I enjoyed my stay for the value with the quietness and view of the country
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The place was lovely and comfortable! Thanks to Ben and Marina for providing everything I could need!

2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Clean and quiet. Perfect location near Canton but close to Ogdensburg as well. Recommend for travel RN in the area !
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,A comfortable and quiet place to spend the night in advance of a tour of SUNY Canton. It's a little bit out of town but didn't take us long at all to get to town and campus.
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very relaxing and comfortable! All the amenities you need!
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Very comfortable place w/easy access to Canton and beautiful scenery. Also, at a really affordable price, highly recommended."
2022-08-01,2.0,Stayed one night,"Place was in a great location, check-in was very convenient, and included a parking spot.
The bad would include how the door to enter had two locks on it, however the top lock did not function due to it being uneven relative to the hole it was supposed to fit in. It would hit the wall instead.
Furthermore, the other unit(s) that are attached to the one my girlfriend and I stayed in have doors that lock/unlock on their side, not the one of this airbnb. Meaning that the people in there could unlock the doors and enter if they wanted to.
These two things are security risks, other than that the place was decent. I also don’t understand why the host charges a cleaning fee when they mention in the instructions that they expect us to take out the trash and ensure all dishes are clean."
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,The studio apartment really fit my needs for this trip of moving my daughter into Saint Lawrence University. It is about 6 miles from Canton out in a town called Morley which is beautiful and quiet. The place was incredibly clean and had everything I needed for my short stay. The bed and the pillows and the linens are quite comfortable.
2022-08-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Clean, comfortable studio apartment out in the country. As advertised."
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Clean and comfortable! Great communication, and very convenient check in and out!"
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Place was beautiful and very clean.
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"PROS:
I had a wonderful 2-night stay over the weekend! The suite was much nicer than I had anticipated. I saw from the pictures that there was a Keurig, but hadn’t realized there were already coffee pods available and stopped at a grocery store on my way to the rental to buy some. I really appreciate little conveniences like that. I also hadn’t even realized until I first arrived that there was an oven, but be careful if you decide to cook anything in it, because the smoke detector is right by it and is very sensitive. I set the alarm off twice…the first time the oven was completely empty (and looked like it’s never been used) and I was just opening the oven to put something in and it went off immediately and scared the crap out of me lol, but I assume they are able to control the alarm remotely, because both times it went off, it only rang twice and then the noise stopped. Definitely got my heart racing for a few seconds 😂. Also, the fridge was perfect, but the freezer space/portion is very tiny, so don’t plan on bringing more than maybe 1-2 items that need to be frozen (depending on their size).
From the pictures, I wasn’t expecting too much from the bed, but was so pleasantly surprised when I laid down on it for the first time to test it out and then later slept like a baby each night! It feels like it’s one of those boxed memory foam mattresses.
TV and Wi-Fi worked great! Some other Airbnb’s I’ve stayed at have Netflix and other streaming apps, but make you log into your own account (which I guess I can understand), but no need to worry about that in this rental, Netflix was readily available!
CONS:
I don’t think “cons” is really an appropriate title for this section of the review, because I don’t really have anything negative to say. However, I felt I should make note of some things that weren’t an issue for me, but may be important to other potential renters…
There is an adjacent rental and the two rentals can be accessed by an adjoining door. This would be great for a family or group that wants to rent out both sides and want or need easy access into the other rental. However, because of this door (I’m assuming it’s the door 🤷🏻‍♀️), I could hear adults and children speaking in normal tones on the other side, so if you’re someone that would be irritated by that or are a light sleeper, this rental might not be your best option unless no one’s renting the other side. BUT, the amount of times I heard noises or speaking were minimal and I’m not a light sleeper, so it didn’t bother me at all. But, it did make me conscious of “the other side” hearing MY conversations, though lol.
Another “con, but not con” 😄 is the location of the rental. If you’re planning on spending most of your time in any of the towns that are 20+ mins away and do not have your own transportation, this location may not be the best option for you…just depends on what you’re willing to spend.
I flew into Ogdensburg airport and planned on spending the majority of my time in Ogdensburg, so I ended up spending a good amount on George….aka the ONLY Uber driver in the area 😂. (BTW, George’s phone number is (315) 323-1877, if you need or prefer Uber). I called a cab company just to see how much the same trip would cost and they said $83, which was a significant difference compared to the $27-33 I was paying Uber. With all my trips, I ended up spending almost $150...I probably should’ve looked into renting a car. However, I had previously looked at the price per night for this rental and added it with how much I would spend on Uber a day and, for me, it still made more sense to stay at Ben’s and pay the cost for an Uber, because you are essentially getting your own studio apartment vs. the in-town Airbnb options (in Ogdensburg), which only offer you a private room and cost more than double the price per night.
Paying $115/night to stay in town and only getting a private room, in addition to, having to share the common areas with strangers (especially with Covid still going around) and then still having to pay someone for transportation, didn’t make sense to me.
All-in-all, I would 100% recommend renting this suite. I had a very nice, relaxing stay and definitely plan on renting with them again for any future trips, as well as, suggesting this rental to other friends who may be going to visit the area!"
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great quiet place to stay. Would 100% recommend.
2022-05-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,We stayed at Ben’s for our son’s Clarkson graduation. The place was clean and quiet. We were out and about for most of our visit so didn’t spend much time at the place. Ben was very accommodating and quick to communicate with any questions we had.

I tried to write a review last time we stayed here but I got busy and I must have waited too long since I was no longer able to post a review. Anyhow, I will write one this time. The studio we stayed at is the newer studio. It has some really nice amenities such as an induction cooktop, nice oven, Keurig coffee machine (coffee, non-dairy creamer and sugar is supplied), and I especially like the bathroom barn door at the back of the studio and the large TV. Everything that we needed was supplied. The hosts even gave us fresh eggs from their hens for breakfast. Communication was great, nice quiet place close to Canton.

2019-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Firstly, this is probably one of the best stays I’ve booked in the area and I have book many AirBnBs in the Canton-Potsdam area for work. That being said my review is based off being a traveling health-care professional who works night shift. The space is quiet. Well heated because it is winter time, the kitchen has everything I need to cook my own meals, the bathroom was exceptionally clean and well maintained, and finally the bed was very comfortable. The only negative I can think of was that the drive to work from the AirBnB was further than previous places I’ve book. That is no fault to the owners. But I have to say that the quality of this listing totally makes up for it. It’s something to consider for other healthcare travelers. But definitely not a deal breaker! Thanks Ben for a wonderful stay! I will definitely book once again!"

Ali is a great host!
Kudos to whomever is keeping the place clean because they do an EXCELLENT job!

The guidebook was excellent and very well detailed.
We actually wish we would’ve had more time to stay in the space. It is very tranquil and relaxing. We could not hear the traffic at all.
The kitchen is very well stocked for someone that wants to make a lite dinner or lunch.
The decor was very relaxing and just right, with things like extra pillows and cuddly blankets in the chairs and throw pillows on the couch.
Although we were there in the dead of winter, the view of the St. Lawrence was great. I’m sure it’s beautiful in the Summer.
We have already recommended it to friends who have a wedding coming up this summer!"
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Ali truly exceeded all expectations as a host! I'm genuinely baffled by how attentive and considerate they were throughout my stay. From personalized recommendations to unexpected, thoughtful touches such as hand written note. Highly recommended!"
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My recent stay at Ali's riverside property in Ogdensburg, NY, was an extraordinary experience. This unique accommodation, a beautifully transformed basement, has been skillfully converted into a spacious and aesthetically pleasing open-plan living space. The design cleverly maximizes both comfort and style, making it a standout choice for any traveler.
The cleanliness of the property deserves a special mention. Every area of the space was impeccably maintained, ensuring a comfortable and welcoming environment. It's evident that great care is taken to keep the place in top condition.
While the owner resides upstairs, their presence was unobtrusive. There were occasional, faint sounds from above, which is quite understandable in a shared property setting. This in no way detracted from the overall peacefulness and privacy of my stay."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We absolutely loved staying here. It was peaceful and quiet with a great view of the river. Ali was easy to get ahold of and he was super accommodating. We will definitely come back next summer!

2023-07-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,It was nice.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,It was a wonderful stay. Private location and we were not disturbed. I am from the area originally and it was relaxing to be able to see family yet stay at a place to enjoy ourselves. Scenery is beautiful and the instructions for our stay were easy to understand. Definitely a beautiful studio style arrangement yet had individual privacy as needed. Thank you for everything!
2023-07-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Ali was very responsive via email and access into the rental easy. We were surprised by Ali’s thoughtfulness in gifting a “Happy Birthday” balloon and card, and providing decaf coffee for us. There was coffee, creamer and sugar but no salt and pepper.
Ali’s place is one large spacious room with a small kitchen alcove that has all utensils needed to cook. The bathroom is beautiful but do note, the access to the bathroom is through another room a short distance away. There are three separate steps between the main room and the bathroom, one down and two up which was a surprise to us.
The central air has no control in the rental space and it was colder than we were comfortable with. We didn’t bring sweaters but there were cozy lap blankets to cuddle up in. Sheets and linens are high quality and were amazingly comfortable. We were content sitting by the river watching the large ships go by and reading. Very relaxing stay in a beautiful location."

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The cottage was perfect for us. It was clean and well maintained. It’s right on the St Lawrence River and was peaceful and beautiful.

The most standout part was how clean it is. It really makes a difference when you walk in and can feel how well it’s been taken care of. Thank you Melanie!"

2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Lodging was perfect for my use. Only issue was phone connectivity to US cell service… I had to go elsewhere to get on internet to fetch lockbox code. Download all needed information before you get to the door!
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Would stay there again
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Melanie’s cottage getaway was perfect for me and my friend for the two nights. Was a little hard to find at first since I arrived at night but after getting it down it was perfect. Check in/parking was easy. The view the next morning was peaceful and very beautiful on the river. The cottage itself was very clean, thoughtful amenities and was supplied in the bathroom. The bedrooms were very comfy and we slept well both nights. And foremost the food up in this area was AMAZING I was actually shocked. We tried “The place” first which had good food, Bayside Grill also a very good spot and in the mornings we ate at Philips diner (these 3 spots were a 10 min drive from the cottage). I recommend these for visitors. Melanie was an awesome host and her cottage home was amazing - would not hesitate to stay again."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Home was easy to find, very clean, and we arrived just in time to watch the sunset from the dock!
Beds were comfortable, home was clean, and we wished for another day to enjoy."

2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"What a lovely place to stay! The cottage is extremely clean, beautifully decorated, stocked with everything you need, and has such pretty views of the river.

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Melanie's place was spotless and beautiful, she was very hospitable and we really enjoyed the waterfront and watching the geese and ducks."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Absolutely hands down the most perfect B&B we have stayed at. Melanie is an amazing host and clearly takes such pride in her peace of paradise. You want for nothing, pack your bags and that’s it. The cottage and grounds were immaculate. The beds were like sleeping on a cloud. The enclosed glass front porch is perfect for a afternoon nap, or just to chill. Plenty of space outdoors to sit and watch the river and the boats go by. You have your own sturdy dock I could go on and on. I thank you Melanie for sharing your piece of paradise with us, you are a wonderful host and god willing we cross paths again. Dale and Lisa Smith"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"The cottages Melanie has to offer are clean, comfortable and organized. Melanie is very responsive to any questions I had and made sure my stay was a fantastic experience. I can’t wait to return! The St Lawrence River is a very special place and Melanie’s cottages are a great place to experience it!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,The cottage was great! Very peaceful right on the St. Lawrence River. It felt like home. We stayed 8 nights and no issues or concerns. We were able to swim right off the dock and watch the sunset from the sunroom. We will be returning!!
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Stayed at Melanie’s cottages for approximately 2 months, continued to go back every week! Beautiful location on the water with the best sunsets. Cottages had everything you needed for a week long stay. Inside and outside was very clean. Very quiet location as well. Would highly recommend to anyone staying for business or just leisure on the river. Will definitely be returning myself in the future."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Melanie's place is great! It's a cute little cottage right on the water. This was our second time staying while visiting family in the area. The cottage is very clean, comfortable, and great views right on the St. Lawrence river. Only a short drive to Ogdensburg with many amenities and shopping, and not far from Alex Bay/1000 Islands. We'll be sure to stay again when visiting the area."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The home was very nice, location is private just outside of Ogdensburg along the river. Home was super clean and comfortable and everything well stocked. Beautiful sunsets!"

Thanks Melanie"
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This house was more than I expected. Beautiful views over the river, house was decorated nicely with what looks like newly renovated kitchen and whole house. Thoughtful things like a Keurig filled and ready with lots of coffee/tea to go with it -and even to-go cups! Very comfortable place to stay!"
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This little cottage is great! Right on the St. Lawrence River with a great view. The small cottage is cozy, clean, and comfortable. We had a great stay."
,,,"Make sure you know the exact size of your room, know how to access WIFI without assistance.
Make sure your communication is clear and understood.
The rental space is attractive and welcoming, well planned out for its location. Contact AIRBNB immediately if you have any issue and get assistance in finding another accommodation before leaving."
,,,"Lost my first day to having to clean the cottage when I got there, others food and garbage left for me in the freezer, food cooked on the BBQ left from others before us, making it not usable and was told I was to burn it off to use it, I am not responsible for cleaning up after the previous renters cooked on food. Others greasy prints left on stuff, food crumbs in the cabinets, towels smell moldy, dust on stuff and dried food left on the placemats, windows smudged and dirty, stains all over the couch and had to put a sheet on the couch so I could sit on it without feeling grossed out. Shower sprays water out of the shower before you can get in, the sink is a smurf sink which makes you make a mess with water everywhere. Was not happy how this was handled either. Guess I was just the lucky one."
,,,I wish Cyndi all the best but this location simply wasn’t for us but I’m sure it would be perfect for someone else.
