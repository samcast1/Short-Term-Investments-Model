2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Michele‚Äôs home was BEAUTIFUL and it felt like home right when we walked into the front porch. It smelled amazing when we walked in and my 16 year old son thought everything was great as well! The back porch though‚Ä¶oh my. It was breathtaking! Many mornings and evening spent king coffee and reading. And the bathtub was such a bonus, especially after a day of football for my son. The location was within 5-6 minutes of everything. We came for an ISU football prospect camp and I couldn‚Äôt have asked for a better place to stay. Check in was a breeze. Neighbors were friendly. Ames and the ISU campus was gorgeous. Michele‚Äôs home felt like a home away from home. This will be our go to place when we come back to Ames. Thank you for making us feel welcome! From the welcome note on the table to the hidden gem (I won‚Äôt spoil it) we found on the chalkboard wall we loved our time in our home away from home. Thanks again! We LOVED it!!!"

2024-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Michele was a great host. She asked when I‚Äôd be arriving so she could turn the outside lights in for me. She also alerted me of some severe weather in the area so I could be safe on my drive up. The house was clean and the outdoor spaces were very relaxing. She had everything you may need in the house, I.e. soaps, toothpaste, shampoo, conditioner, cotton pads, etc. There is also a nice walking/bike trail just a block west of the house. It‚Äôs very close to ISU. I highly recommend staying here."

2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Second time we have stayed and Michele is a wonderful host! She thoughtfully left graduation decorations for our use ‚ô•Ô∏è. Love the porch and had coffee each morning watching and listening to the birds. We had a wonderful stay!

2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My stay at this charming two-bedroom home just a block away from Iowa State University was nothing short of wonderful. Nestled along a secluded, wooded lot, the property offers a serene escape while still being incredibly close to all the attractions ISU has to offer. It's rare to find such a perfect blend of tranquility and convenience.
Communication with the host was seamless from start to finish. They provided clear instructions and were always available to answer any questions, making my stay smooth and enjoyable.

The only less-than-perfect thing is that the only standard shower is in the basement. however, there is a bath on the floor with the rooms. this did not impede our stay at all.

2022-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,Michele is always available to contact during our stay. The house is very clean and we feel very safe on our stays. We really enjoy the screened porch to have dinner or just to hang out. I enjoy the quiet neighborhood and that the house is on a dead end street.
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great home and host. Amazingly convenient to ISU and all things Ames.
2022-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Warning: You‚Äôll make the family/friends you‚Äôre visiting jealous if you stay here. Michele‚Äôs house is delightful. We wound up going on many walks along the nearby paths and made the 25 min trek to Reiman Gardens for an afternoon visit. If you‚Äôre not up for a walk but want to enjoy the outdoors, you‚Äôll wind up spending most of your time on the adorable screened in pack porch. I highly recommend Riverside Retreat, but make sure to leave enough days free so we can stay again!"
2022-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,Michele‚Äôs place was so cute and perfect for a weekend in Ames. I hope we can stay here again next year for a football weekend in Ames.
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is a quiet, comfortable and well- located house in Ames. The house is an older property but recently redecorated and has everything you would need for a Airbnb stay. The house has a very nice three season back porch / deck that we enjoyed as a morning oasis.
The location is excellent for access to ISU campus.
Beds and chairs are comfortable. The TV is well equipped with streaming and tv package. There are charging stations throughout the house. The house was spotless on arrival, and generously provisioned with towels, bathroom essentials, bed linens,Keurig pods etc.
It‚Äôs worth knowing that there isn‚Äôt a dishwasher in the kitchen. Also, the stand-up shower is in the basement bathroom. These were not issues for us but might be concerns for some.
Overall, I fully recommend this Airbnb to a couple or small group visiting Ames or ISU."
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place at a great location! The home was immaculate with several special touches. Michelle is a very gracious host who communicated well.

2022-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"What a superb place to stay while in Ames, IA. The house was so very CLEAN, comfortable, cute and so darn cute. We were there only for one night but it was so perfect for our trip to drop off our son for his freshman year at Iowa State!
I would stay here again in a heartbeat!"
2022-08-01,5,Stayed one night,Michele is THE BEST! She is a great communicator and the most thoughtful host.
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful home and every detail is thought of.
2022-08-01,5,Stayed about a week,What a wonderful stay in Ames! Beautifully cared for home with every needed amenity.
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"It is obvious from the start that Michelle enjoys being a host and takes pride in customer service and creating a serene environment for her guests. Her home is meticulously clean and well-appointed with everything a traveler could need while on the road.
Guests are greeted with a welcome bag of treats and a card from Michelle waiting on the kitchen table and a binder in the living room ‚Äì the House Manual - explaining details about the residence, information about the area, and Ames eating establishments.
The house, which is wonderfully decorated to create a feeling of calm and peacefulness, sits in a quiet neighborhood near a dead-end street that leads to a park. The yard is beautifully landscaped with plants and flowers and transitions into a wooded wonderland with a creek running through it. The screened in back porch is a bonus, where you can dine outside, enjoy the garden vista, and listen to the sounds of nature that abound. We walked the neighborhood, the park and all around the Iowa State athletic complex several evenings and felt very safe.
Michelle is very quick to respond and very accommodating. If I am ever in Ames again, I will be staying at Michelle‚Äôs Riverside Retreat again. I could not have picked a more perfect place for our stay in Ames!"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed one night,Beautiful home! Michele is amazing and very understanding. I 100% recommend booking this home.
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This was my first Airbnb stay and it really was a lovely home away from home. We had all we needed to be comfortable with young kids along. The bedroom windows have blackout shades and the bathroom is stocked with necessity and fun bath supplies for the beautiful claw foot tub. It was a bit inconvenient not to have a main floor bathroom for my mom and my 3yr old, but it's a quaint older house and totally worth the extra exercise.
We spent loads of time on the screened back porch playing and eating our meals, and the kids had fun chasing fireflies in the back yard at night.
We loved the extra touches of board games, Keurig coffee, desk space with ample plug ins throughout the house, water bottles in the fridge, and my daughter's favorite place to read a book on the front porch swing!
I wish we could have stayed a whole week and if I'm ever back in Ames, I'd want to stay here."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed over a week,"Comfy, cozy, clean and full of character. We enjoyed every minute of our stay and delighted in Michele‚Äôs beautiful cottage gardens. What a joy!"

2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Perfect AirB&B to relax and unwind. So clean and not a single detail was missed. Loved sitting on the back porch in the morning, sipping coffee and listening to all the birds sing. Michelle was very quick to answer any questions I had.

2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Wow, Riverside Retreat is practically perfect in every way! It‚Äôs stylish, cozy, and clean, with about a million little thoughtful touches.
Centrally located, it‚Äôs a very reasonable walk to Iowa State- just over a mile to the Memorial Union building for our student tour. Adorable Main Street shops within walking distance, too and plenty of Doordash options, if you‚Äôd rather stay in.
The only caution I would make is that neither of the bathrooms nor the bedrooms are on the ground floor, so if stairs are an issue for you, better choose a different place."
2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This home is beautiful and the host has thought of every little detail for comfort. We loved this home so much we have already booked 2 more stays! This home is more than just a place to stay, you feel like a VIP."

2022-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"There's a reason -- many reasons, actually -- why Michele's residence in Ames has never received anything less than a 5.0 from every tenant on every. criteria. It is exactly as advertised, only you can't emphasize enough the elegant details, personal touch, and impeccable communication to go along with a great location (close to campus) on a peaceful residential street. It's so quiet and so nice, I have a hard time imagining a boisterous tailgating affair associated with Iowa State, but for this couple's multi-day retreat (we added a day just to soak up the ambience after a long trip), this can't be beat."
2022-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,This is an amazing place to stay. All the little touches like labeling light switches were so well thought out. The updates to the home are great (e.g. in-floor heating). This place is now on our list of preferred stops.

The location of the house is PERFECT for tailgating at Jack Trice and or/any events at Hilton.
I highly recommend staying at the Riverside Retreat if it is available for your stay in Ames.

Wish I had found this place sooner!"

I will book again in the future."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This was my first time using AirBNB. I had checked into hotels, but for the cost, it was worth being able to hang out as a family all in one space. Jamie was a fantastic host. Lots of little touches like a welcome note, a little gift, fans in all the rooms, and a great setup for our 1 year old. A room with toys and playthings as well as a pack & play for sleeping, toddler kitchen set for eating. Everything was tastefully decorated and well put together. Would definitely stay again. Thanks Jamie!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,We stayed at Jamie‚Äôs place for a couple nights while we moved my daughter into her dorm. Great house with lots of space for my young boys to feel at home. We will definitely plan to return for future visits over the next few years.

We had a couple of questions after we checked in and her response was instantaneous. She went above and beyond by leaving a heartfelt welcome note to our family about our celebrations.
We rented an Air BnB property in Chicago for pre-wedding preparations for our daughter and her bridesmaids. This property is perfect for that purpose also. Great photo backdrops.

My mother in law loved how well-stocked the kitchen was from dishes to cookware to basic seasonings. We were able to host a family dinner not just for those traveling but for family that was local as well.

2024-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We loved this Ames gem! There were lots of little nods to Iowa's and Ames' culture, but they weren't too overwhelming. The space was pristine and farmhouse modern. We are able to cook fairly conveniently in the spacious kitchen, play games at the dining room table, and converse casually throughout the house. We were also very grateful for the different spaces! It allowed a large and loud family to spend time with one another in more intimate spaces-- or escape the noise. Thank you for sharing this space with us!"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This is a beautiful home fully set up for a family. There‚Äôs an amazing TV room and play room with toys. The kitchen is fully stocked to start cooking.

2024-04-01,5,Group trip,"Mark was an amazing host. What especially stood out to my husband was him not asking us to clean up. His instructions clearly state that we already paid a cleaning fee, so we did not have to worry about cleaning anything up in the apartment. We greatly appreciated the layout of the place and could have easily entertained 8 people in the space. The living space and kitchen are open, so there is room for everyone to have a place to sit and converse. One bedroom is upstairs next to a bathroom and the other three bedrooms are downstairs with a bathroom. Both levels have stairs, so keep that in mind if you are less-abled.
Great value for the area, considering the number of bedrooms available and location. CyRide and grocery stores are walkable distances."

2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,It was super easy to get into the apartment. Mark updated us on the updated Wi-Fi. The Airbnb was super close to the Iowa State basketball game. The location was very convenient.
2024-03-01,3,Group trip,"While our stay at the condo had many positive aspects (location, enough space for our group, plenty of parking, etc), we were disappointed to find that cigarette smoke had permeated throughout the condo during our 4-day stay. Despite our efforts to ventilate both floors each time and contacting Mark, the smoke reoccurred multiple times and the smell still persisted / varied in strength during our stay and lingered in some of our possessions. That aside, if smoke does not bother you, the condo would be a nice option."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"Mark is responsive, accommodating, and friendly. My family and I had a comfortable stay that felt like home. Thanks Mark!"

Overall this was a great experience and we would definitely utilize Mark again if ever in the area."

2024-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,We loved staying here. It's cozy and cute and was just perfect for a stay in Ames.

The apartment was clean and the beds were comfortable. Really cute/historical feeling neighborhood.

2024-03-01,5,Stayed about a week,Britta was very helpful and got back with me right away. I loved the location and i was only 8 minutes from my daughter's house. The apartment was very cozy and i love the old homes in the area. She definitely thought of everything when she furnished the apartment. I felt right at home and i will definitely be back. Thank you Britta for a wonderful 8 days.
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We had a great stay! Everything was very cozy and well communicated to us throughout our stay.

2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Absolutely great location! I enjoyed the space and the convenience of the kitchen. Very close to gas stations, walmart, target, and lots of food places. I was grateful for the garage space to park my car especially when it snowed. I would recommend it to anyone who's looking for a great place to stay at. Britta was very quick with responding to my messages. A+++"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,great visit!
2024-02-01,5,Stayed over a week,"Britta, was a great host and very responsive. The space was the perfect size for one person and had everything I needed already there. I would definitely stay here again!"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great location
2024-01-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Britta's place was perfect for my husband and I for 10 days. It's cozy for two people and exactly as described. It's an old house with cute decor and very quiet. Great price for what we needed. Britta was very friendly, communicative, and even checked to see if the heat was OK. Check-in and out was flexible and easy."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Britta was very nice and timely with her responses if I had any questions.
2023-12-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Affordable and good location
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"the perfect to stay!! great, and close to mainstreet ames. really comfortable bed, and a lovely space to decompress!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,A good place to recharge.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place was super quaint and cute! I loved staying here. The only thing was that there was a lot of ladybugs and spiders in the bathroom, but it wasn‚Äôt necessarily dirty. We loved all of the amenities this place had to offer for the price!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed over a week,"Britta's place was a great place for my long stay. The location is convenient to Main Street which has several restaurants. Main Street also hosted art events with numerous vendors, and other events. CyRide bus service is a couple blocks away if you need transportation. On Main Street, The Grove Cafe was great for breakfast and Great Plains Sauce and Dough served good pizza. Aunt Maude's was a popular place with outside seating and Cornbred had great BBQ with hanging chairs where you can watch the trains go by. Britta was very proactive in communicating with me. I would definitely recommend her place."
2023-08-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Great location. Studio on the first floor of an old house in Ames, 7 minutes walk from the historic center and supermarket. The studio is old, going up the stairs lots of dead insects, but the studio itself reasonable clean. Bed is OK, good shower ( pressure and temperature). Owner very responsive. Overall worth the money."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Nice, clean, private place. Enjoyed my stay!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I absolutely loved Britta‚Äôs Airbnb. She did an awesome job decorating the place and providing the necessities for her guests. The location is excellent near downtown. You can walk there which makes it very convenient. She also provides a parking space for you to use. I would definitely recommend this place for other travelers. It‚Äôs small, but perfect for a getaway."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The airbnb is located in downtown Ames, Iowa and has ample parking spaces including street parking, a garage and a parking lot.
As a former resident of Ames who visited Ames to attend a wedding, this Airbnb location was perfectly located next to everything I needed.
The Airbnb is an old house with bedrooms that have been converted to studio apartments; as expected the floors creak when you walk, but overall the home was mostly quiet during my visit. The room is spacious enough and can accomodate two people in it, but the bathroom is small, so if you are a plus size person, this location may not work for you.
The bed was comfortable & the window A/C unit kept the room cool.
The host was very responsive and also offered an early check in option, although I had a late flight so I didn't use it.
Overall, it's a good value for the money paid and I would recommend this location for anyone looking for a place to stay in Ames that is private, safe, affordable and centrally located."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed over a week,"This cozy studio was very nice, stayed there for three weeks with my partner and although upon entering it seemed pretty small, we never felt it to be too small for us. Britta somehow managed to equip it with everything needed! The kitchen corner is quite small and as mentioned by others there isn't really a counter but we managed to cook pretty often nevertheless. The fridge is big and clean, the TV has free Netflix!, and the space is very well furnished, it really makes you feel at home. The only problems we had was figuring out how to make the shower work (but Britta was very responsive and helped us in no time) and that the two beds cannot actually be joined to make a double bed as they have a slight difference in height and separate sheets. But overall great experience!!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Britta's place was great! Nice, quiet neighborhood in a great location."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed about a week,Very welcoming and friendly again.
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,A great tiny place! It was very cozy and pretty much in the center of Ames which made it really easy to visit the different areas. It was also really nice because there was a garage space for us to park our rental car in.
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Was exactly like the photos! Had a great stay, nice amenities, and lots of character in the building."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Such a great value for location, access and quaint furnishings. The pictures for how to enter were so helpful. Comfortable bed, good instructions for the amenities and strong shower pressure. Britta was very attentive and quick to respond! You will love love this location and stay!"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed over a week,"This was a beautiful stay for me. I was in town for a month to get some writing done and it couldn't have been more perfect. My car was tucked into the garage and I walked everywhere!
I'm from Ames originally so I know good Iowan hospitality, but Britta goes above and beyond. She even brought me a desk chair so I'd be more comfortable writing.
Other great things: the soaking tub, the fully stocked kitchen, the quick walk to Main Street, and how perfectly quiet it was here.
Thank you so much, Britta. I'll be back!"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed over a week,Britta was extremely responsive and very helpful the entire visit! The pictures are very representative of the space and the location is great!
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was a great place to stay! Cozy, comfortable, clean, and close to everything! It was quiet, had everything needed, and Brittany was so quick to get back to me when I had a need. She let me check in early too! I will stay here again!"
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great stay:)
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Quaint, little place that was exactly what we needed. Good value for the cost. You do have to climb stairs, so be aware if you have mobility limitations."
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Cozy space in an old home with character. I had everything I needed.
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Exactly what I expected and needed for a quick stay for an interview. It was very clean and had a lovely soaking tub. Would stay here again if I'm passing through.
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The space was very clean and was exactly what we needed for the trip!
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We greatly enjoyed Britta's accommodations and hospitality. Communication was clear and helpful and the room charming. I loved the location--just a very short walk to great coffee shops and one of my favorite independent bookstore. Wonderful value.
2022-11-01,4,Stayed a few nights,It was adequate and very clean.
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I enjoyed my stay in Britta's apartment. It was clean and cozy, and the location was perfect for walking to the historic Main Street area of Ames."
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"10 stars out of 5! Great location. Very comfortable. Quiet for study or sleep. Awesome vibe of quaint boarding house feel with modern tile and decor. Britta's response time is a 20 out of 5. Seriously. In addition, I wanted to stay 2 extra nights. She was booked but went out of her way to find me something else. This is a studio so one person or a loving couple IMO. End result: I won't stay in Ames again without checking this property first or anything managed by Britta. Just an awesome choice."
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Always a pleasure staying here.
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Cozy, charming, rustic space in a convenient and walkable location. Very quiet. Studio apartment has the all the essentials and a few extras to make it feel homey, including some mood lanterns. Shower has great water pressure, though it was tricky to figure out the switch at first. Overall a pleasant and relaxing stay!"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"my stay here was good in every way. Britta's management style is efficient but easy going; checkin and checkout were effortless.
the apartment itself is charming, well set up and in an ideal location. Rates were very reasonable for what the place offered."

2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Communication was great, space was just as advertised. I would recommend to anyone needing accommodations!"
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Britta was great to work with in terms of communication. Her place was just what we needed and at a very affordable price!
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The location is great, the space was clean, the A/C was working, and Britta was very attentive during my stay. If what you‚Äôre looking for is a home base, this is an ideal listing.
However, if you are planning to do serious remote work during your stay, just be aware that the workspace is minimal. The photos are accurate! There is a desk, but it is fairly small, and the only chairs are basic dining room chairs or bar stools. Just be aware!"
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The apartment is the cutest efficiency apartment that I have ever seen. It is in a historic building in a very quite, peaceful neighborhood with covered parking. Britta is a terrific host who thought of everything and then some. It is very clean and well stocked. The apartment is close to everything in Ames. We are looking forward to staying there again when we are back in Ames."
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very cute place
2022-08-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Brita is a responsive host, and check-in/check-out was easy. There is off-street parking behind the house that I felt was very safe. You do have to walk around the house and up the stairs to get to the unit, so you might want to pack light. I rented it just for myself but last minute my daughters‚Äô accommodations fell through and so we were 2 adults who stayed for a week; it was a bit tight, but still fine. There is a second bed that can be set up. The location really couldn‚Äôt be better, in a nice neighborhood that is walking distance to grocery stores, farmers markets, and downtown shops. The only real difficulty was the kitchen. There is no counter space at all, which makes doing much of anything (even preparing a sandwich or washing dishes) difficult. I moved the table near the kitchen and that helped a bit, but it‚Äôs just not great for someone who needs to actually prepare meals."
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This place met my needs for the week after my lease expired on my apartment and I still had a week of class left.
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great location and a cozy spot.

2022-06-01,4,Stayed a few nights,A nice place that was close to all of the attractions. Perfect for what we needed it for! For
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"great place to stay, Britta is great on communication, place is in prime location, close to everywhere."

2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Perfect for a quick trip to Ames! I appreciated how well-outfitted the space and how communicative Britta was. I would definitely stay here again.
2022-05-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Great spot close to downtown.

2022-03-01,5,Stayed over a week,Helpful host and just as advertised. I would definitely stay again!
2022-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great cozy room with bed, kitchen, bathroom. Very close to Ames‚Äô Main Street (within walking distance even in the winter!). I would definitely return if I‚Äôm back in town. Someone else deducted a star rating because they have a Keurig instead of a traditional coffee maker?? Well, I appreciated the Keurig, and there‚Äôre coffee shops within walking distance anyway!"
2022-02-01,4,Stayed a few nights,This is a great location with everything you would need in the Ames area. It is not the best place for people with disabilities because the stairs to the second floor are narrow but the host is wonderful and very accommodating. It was like the pictures provided.
2022-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Clean and quiet! Check in was was easy and Britta was very easy to communicate with!
2022-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Super happy with my stay here. It‚Äôs so close to Main St. that I walked to a restaurant. This unit was perfect for one person. Fully equipped and clean. I only wish it was available for the next dates I‚Äôll be in Ames
2022-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,From the minute I walked in I admired all the cute decor and knew that the owners took pride in decorating the place. Everything that I needed or wanted was there including a variety of coffee and condiments. The pillows and bedding were super soft and it was a quiet neighborhood. The shower had excellent water pressure! I would definitely stay here again.
2022-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,Great place to stay.
2022-01-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"This location was a great choice for me. The only reason I didn‚Äôt give full 5 stars was because there was not access to a real coffee maker. Maybe I am just old school but that‚Äôs important to me. As a host Britta did an excellent job on communication, and I would still recommend you stay at this cute little place!"
2022-01-01,5,Stayed about a week,"The host takes care of everything before arriving so that you will find the place nice and clean. You will find a single bed with a very comfortable mattress and a pillow. There is also a blanket and there are some extras if you want. You will find everything you need in the place such as: refrigerator, stove, kitchen sink, cooking pans, plates, spoons, forks, knives, and microwave oven. There is also a bathroom and towels. You will find a TV with a Netflix subscription right in front of the bed so you can sit and watch whatever you want. Near the place, you will find restaurants and a large grocery that has all that you need. The host is very nice and responsive. She replies immediately to your messages and helps solve any problem you might be facing. I have stayed there for a week and I really felt myself at home."
2024-06-01,5,Group trip,Gina has an excellent air bnb to stay at! If you need to visit Ames I‚Äôd stay here for sure!
2024-06-01,5,Group trip,This was a great place that accommodated our larger group very well!
2024-06-01,5,Group trip,"Gina was the most welcoming and kind host we‚Äôve ever stayed with - and we‚Äôve stayed at tons of Airbnbs. Not only were the bathrooms stocked with extra towels and supplies, the kitchen was absolutely filled with everything from spices and condiments to breakfast for our entire stay (including dairy and no -dairy milk!!) and lots of fresh produce. When we were departing, I messaged to clarify where to put trash and used towels at check out and she said ‚Äúyou don‚Äôt have to do anything at all, you are our guest!‚Äù And, to boot, she reached out just a few hours after our departure offering to meet up to return some items we left. She‚Äôs a ten star host!"
2024-06-01,5,Group trip,"Gina made us feel right at home! She responded very quickly and asked questions about our stay. She provided all needed information about parking. When we arrived, the place was clean with donuts and milk, coffee bar, and many kitchen and bathroom items for our use! The game room was great for the kids! We would definitely recommend this place and having Gina as a host!"
2024-06-01,5,Group trip,Gina was a great host for my group of friends. The outdoor fire pit and the game room were great places to relax. The breakfast snacks were a great gesture and we really appreciated it!

2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Really enjoyed our stay here - the home had everything we could have ever needed, was walkable to things to do/places to eat, and on a quiet residential street. The host (Gina) was incredibly kind and responsive. Would definitely stay again!"
2024-02-01,5,Group trip,great place for those travelling to Ames!
2024-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Great house with all the amenities you could want for our family of five. Lots of snacks and stuff for the kitchen made staying here very easy. Tremendous value in the offseason, and I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs booked heavily when Iowa State is doing things like games and graduations!"
2024-02-01,5,Group trip,Gina was an amazing hostess. The space was perfect for us to come and cook and serve a birthday meal for our don and his friends who are freshman at ISU. We are so grateful for this perfect space that fit our needs!
2024-02-01,5,Group trip,"Very nicely decorated house with plenty of space for our group of 8. Basement has lots for teens to do - pool table, air hockey, and a big TV. The hot tub was a hit. Everything was clean, cute decorations, bedrooms are quiet, 3 bathrooms - just a great place to stay. We will be back when we visit family again."
2024-01-01,5,Group trip,"Exceptional hospitality provided during our stay in Ames, especially considering the challenging circumstances of the winter storm.
The well-equipped accommodations were a true blessing, and we appreciated the extra effort put into ensuring we had everything we needed to stay comfortable. The variety of games available was a delightful surprise and provided us with a fun way to pass the time indoors during the winter storm.
We'll be coming back for sure!"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This is our second stay with Gina in Ames. What an enjoyable experience. The house fits our needs with both the amount of sleeping arrangements and the range of amenities.
As with our last stay we were blown away by Gina's hospitality and thoughtfulness. From the Christmas decorations to the supplies for keeping our toddler safe, it felt like home. These extra details really make a difference.
Looking forward to another stay in the future."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Gina was an extremely helpful, thoughtful host! The house was amazing! It was all stocked with goodies and extra toiletries that were very thoughtful. The game room was absolutely wonderful for the teenagers and children. The beds were extremely comfortable and we slept so well.

Gina made sure that we had an exceptional experience at her place. Some personalized welcoming touches, snacks and some breakfast selections, clean and comfortable rooms and beds. She really thought of everything. I‚Äôm a real estate professional, and I‚Äôve seen a wide variety of homes and stayed in a number of them through Airbnb‚Äòs. This host understands how to deliver comfort, value, and quality. Super responsive when we had questions, and very accommodating when possible! Cannot think of another thing we wanted or needed that she didn‚Äôt have available to us. Thank you thank you thank you! This will most likely be our last weekend stay in Ames for the foreseeable future, but it was definitely our best weekend stay!"

The space was comfortable with everything we needed, and then some. The kitchen and fridge were stocked with all kinds of goodies when we arrived which was way more than we have ever received at any other Airbnb stay. A super thoughtful and welcoming gesture! Gina was a wonderful host and thought of everything before our stay! Super communicative and incredibly friendly! The location is also great, close to everything! We would highly recommend her place to anyone coming to Ames."
2022-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We rented the space for a Cyclone tailgating weekend with friends...it was perfect! The location is close to campus and grocery stores. We had pre-teen kids with us and the game space downstairs was WAY better than a hotel pool. The adults may have had more fun than the kids!
The kitchen was stocked with everything we needed (& more!) and provided a great gathering place for everyone at mealtime. The beds were very cozy and the amenities in the bathroom were a sweet surprise.
We would LOVE to stay at Gina's place again when the weather cooperates a bit more (it was 4 degrees that day!) and we can use the outdoor space. We'll be back :)"

Thank you Gina‚Ä¶.."
2021-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Gina was a lovely host! Not only did she initiate and respond to communications timely, but the set up at the house was more than we could have imagined! We were greeted with an assortment of fruits and snacks, and every condiment you could have wanted. The assortment of coffee, the big screen tv's in the rooms, the games, the space, and the exceptionally comfortable beds! It was all more than we had hoped for and made our stay that more more easy and enjoyable. When I am visiting Ames again, I will definitely check the availability of this home to stay again."

Everything was neat and organized, the house is very spacious, they have an amazing outdoor area (which we didn‚Äôt use because we were there for work and would always arrive late at the house, but still) and the downstairs is a plus if you like board games‚Äîthey have tons! The water pressure in this house is no joke and the shower was great for relaxing after a hard day‚Äôs work. The only cons are the stairs, which are not suitable for dogs or kids (the steps are not wide enough and they‚Äôre very slippery‚Äîmy dog fell from it several times); the kitchen cabinets need a massive upgrade‚Äîthey‚Äôre kind of falling apart; and both TV‚Äôs are not meant to be watched because they‚Äôre slower than turtles in reverse.

2023-12-01,5,Group trip,"Wonderful, kind hosts who communicated clearly and promptly. House has lots of space for gathering and games, having three bathrooms is nice (one on each floor, upstairs one has door to hall and door to main bedroom). As is the case with most houses of this era, sound from the uncarpeted hall is communicated to the bedrooms.
We appreciated the high-quality unscented laundry products used for the linens and available for our use. Loved the fact that there were no ‚Äúair fresheners‚Äù around and not needed because the house was actually clean. There was even a drying rack available for laundry‚Äî a rarity at Airbnbs."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed one night,We had a lovely stay! Perfectly clean home and very spacious with great amenities. Communication was very clear and they were even accommodating for an early check in since our travel had changed. Would absolutely recommend this home!
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great location away from campus but close enough! Kyle was very accommodating and flexible with our schedule. We especially loved using the word burning fireplace!
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The Garden Home was just as described. It was clean and had all basic necessities for our stay. We loved that there was a high chair so we didn‚Äôt have to bring our travel chair for our youngest. Having access to the garage was a plus.
We were a little disappointed that the tv was really slow until it got going and for some reason it wouldn‚Äôt let us log in to our streaming services. Also the check out instructions left in the house and the ones on the listing are slightly different and we were afraid we wouldn‚Äôt do the right things and get charged additional cleaning fees."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Kyle and Sam‚Äôs home was beautiful. Perfect home for the family. The location was GREAT and close to everything. Hope to stay there again!
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We had such a nice place to stay with family for a few days. The home was extremely clean and we really loved the screened in back porch. There were lots of games and toys for young children, and our four-year-old really enjoyed playing with them!
There was an issue with the internet and Kyle was super responsive and helpful - got it resolved right away."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,The house was spacious and exactly as advertised. Having access to the whole house was a major plus. We arrived earlier than expected and were able to check in early. Kyle and Sam had accommodations for our every want/need. We felt right at home.
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Everything as advertised. Great place with lots of space. I needed a good kitchen and this was perfect. Close to many stores. Enjoyed the visit and the home.
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Great place! We will
Be back!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Staying at The Garden Home was a lovely personal and professional experience, as my husband and both worked and enjoyed leisure time in Ames. Kyle and Sam are responsive, friendly, and accurately described the house, yard, and amenities. The neighborhood is exceptionally quite and the screened in deck was well furnished. I highly recommend staying at The Garden Home if you are in the Ames area!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,In town for business for a cpl nights and the property worked out well!
2023-10-01,5,Group trip,This place was as pictured! Each room had its own character and charm. The house felt very homey! We stayed to visit my brothers that go to Iowa State and it was the perfect location. The ping pong table was the highlight of the weekend and the hosts were extremely easy to communicate with. 10/10 recommend and we will be keeping this in our minds for our next visit!
2023-10-01,5,Group trip,Quiet and spacious. Clean and comfortable. Generous kitchen and large screened back porch. Quiet street on the south side of Ames.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Amazing place to stay!
2023-09-01,5,Group trip,We loved it! Stayed here for an iowa state football game reunion. It was so comfortable and easy to get to the stadium!
2023-09-01,5,Group trip,Kyle was very responsive and helpful in trying to track down an item we thought we‚Äôd left behind (which it turned out we didn‚Äôt)
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great place! Nice location, well stocked, and communication was great. It was nice to have the option of another living room area in the basement, as well as the screened-in porch in the back yard. The coffee station and balcony upstairs are a great perk as well. We would definitely stay here again!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I messed up the door code and Kyle responded immediately which is wonderful service. Thank you.
2023-08-01,5,Group trip,Great stay!
2023-08-01,4,Stayed with kids,What a cute place to stay! Had a lot of nice amenities that made our stay more comfortable. The back porch is amazing and a really cool place to hang out. The AC didn‚Äôt seem to be working properly and there is not much air flow to the upstairs where the bedrooms are. It sure was hot! Kyle was apologetic and great to work with. He is a very good host and I would definitely stay here again.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Kyle was very informative and proactive. Super clean, beautiful screened porch, and fun basement. We hope to stay here again as our son is now a student at ISU"
2023-08-01,5,Group trip,Kyle‚Äôs property had everything we needed for a comfortable stay. It was the perfect place for us and afforded us lots of space. Will use it again when we are in the area.
2023-08-01,4,Stayed with kids,"Really nice place and very attentive hosts. Other than an initial problem figuring out the thermostat, the stay was wonderful. Particularly loved all the separate gathering places throughout the house and yard. Our family enjoyed their stay very much. Thanks, Kyle and Sam!"
2023-07-01,5,Group trip,"Great host, responsive and reasonable. Great stay and experience for my first time at an Air BnB"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,Great spot for our family of 8! Extremely well kept and wonderfully accommodating hosts. The screened in deck was our favorite spot during our trip. Would absolutely stay again!
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,It was very cute and decorated nicely. Kyle and Sam were very responsive for any concerns we gave them. The fence could use some mending if smaller pets are allowed to stay there. It may also be beneficial to have some instructions on how to navigate the cooling/heating system for people over the age of 50.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"You know how some places look gorgeously staged in pics but end up feeling uncomfortable and unpleasant to actually BE in? Not Kyle's place; it super cute and genuinely comfortable. Soft couch/loveseat/recliner in the living room, great mattresses, nice outdoor furniture. Nice weather meant we spent tons of time in the huge screened-in porch, including several meals. Kitchen is well-stocked with everything you need to prepare and enjoy a meal, and some condiments and extras in the fridge/pantry made our grocery list a little shorter. The basement was a great ""second space"" for the kids to hang out and enjoy ping-pong, board games, weight room.
The neighborhood is super quiet-- when we slept with the windows open we heard only silence at night and birds in the morning."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,Great place to stay! Loved the screened in porch!
2023-06-01,3,Stayed with kids,"kyle the host was polite and communicated well. the house overall is in need of general maintenance and repairs. if your just passing through this is an okay rental for a family but if your looking for a vacation rental this just won't meet most travelers expectations. the swing set for the kids is also in need of repair and had pcs falling off. I've stayed at over 25 airb&b listing and this is the worst bang for my buck.
Adam H and family"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Kyle & Sam's Airbnb is the perfect place for a family stay. A bathroom in each floor, extra couches, two decks, outdoor play area, easy to use kitchen, convenient floor plan, good lighting - everything one would expect in a comfortable and well appointed home."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,The host was very responsive and proactive about everything that was needed for the stay. Very clear instructions and super easy to operate!
2023-05-01,5,Group trip,My husband and his groomsmen stayed here for our wedding! It was absolutely amazing!! They had so much fun and the host are incredible!!
2023-05-01,5,Group trip,"Great location and super comfortable house to stay at. Very clean, kitchen has everything you need to cook your favorite meals!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The Garden House was a quiet and peaceful alternative to a chain hotel stay. We really enjoyed the location and bird watching out the lovely picture windows. I‚Äôd definitely stay here again should I find myself back in Ames. Kyle and Sam answered all my questions before I could think of them. Check-in and check-out was a breeze.
2023-05-01,5,Group trip,"Great communication, clear expectations. Easy in and out, and a great spot for our stay."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,Great stay for family get together!
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This was a great space for a big family! Enjoyed the bbq, fenced play area, garage, and all the space. It was a great neighborhood and lots of things for the kids. The beds were comfortable and having 3 bathrooms was great and the shower pressure was amazing. I think the only complaints are that the bedrooms are all on one floor which some people like and others don‚Äôt. The stairs to the basement need a little work. And it wasn‚Äôt as well equipped as we needed but they asked for feedback of what we needed so they could take care of it. Overall we would definitely stay here again"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very Clean Home.
2023-04-01,5,Group trip,"Great location, clean, comfortable, perfect spot for a getaway with my high school besties. Close to so much that Ames has to offer. Highly recommend!"
2023-04-01,5,Group trip,Exactly as described. Thanks
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Well needed
Thanks to a great location"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,Great value. We loved hanging out on the porch and letting my son play on the play set.
2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"We had a very pleasant stay in Kyle's place. Perfect for our group of six. Plenty of space and everything was according to our expectations. For a couple in my group, that had never stayed in an AirBnb before, this place exceeded their expectations. I can only recommend Kyle's place."
2023-04-01,5,Group trip,"We had a great stay at Kyle & Sam's place in Ames. The house was very much as described with many helpful amenities. We had several family members arriving from different directions, so we were especially thankful for the large driveway, garage, and ample street parking.
The full bathrooms are both fairly small, so it was a bit tight for 8 people in that respect. The grill was also a bit of a hot mess when we wanted to use it for dinner one night. We tried to leave it cleaner than we found it.
Overall, we felt it was clean and nicely furnished. Kyle & Sam were very responsive and easy to work with. We would definitely consider staying again."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Great location and great host
2023-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,Kyle‚Äôs place was the perfect house for us. Our sons wedding was in Ames and this house fit us perfectly to rest afterwards. We used the kitchen and it was perfect. The bedrooms were awesome.
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Highly recommend Kyle's house for a family vacation. Clean, spacious, and well-maintained with great amenities. Perfect location and beautiful backyard. Host was very accommodating. We had a great time and look forward to returning soon!

2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great host. Great property, and great value."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"Sam & Kyle‚Äôs place was so incredibly cute and inviting!! We only got to stay for one night, but wished we could‚Äôve stayed much longer to enjoy the space. Everything was very thoughtfully arranged and the furnishings and design were beautiful. Both hosts were also extremely prompt and kind when we ran into a slight issue at check out (which was entirely due to an error on our part). We will absolutely be back in the future and thoroughly enjoyed our stay! Thanks so much!"
2023-03-01,5,Group trip,We had a great stay while visiting our daughter at ISU. We‚Äôll definitely stay again!
2023-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,"this place worked out great for our family gathering in terms of location, space, and amenities. we will hope to book again when the weather is nicer so we can take advantage of the back patio and playground equipment."
2023-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,Layout of the house was pretty cool. We are from Texas so we've never seen a basement before. My 15 year old loved it and pretty much lived down there the whole time. House is located close to everything. We had a great time here.
2023-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,We thought the location was great for our family. It was quit and near a few parks. The house was roomy and comfortable and equipped with everything we needed.

2023-01-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Had a wonderful weekend with family at house in Ames. Great location, amenities in house were great from everything we needed in kitchen to comfortable beds, the nice fenced in back yard, Roku TV, and also the fireplace our family utilized and made s'mores. We definitely made some wonderful memories, plus the family photos turned out nice with the fire in background. Highly recommend this house to anyone visiting the Ames area."
2023-01-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Our family was gathering because my father was Hero of the Game for the Iowa State Men's Basketball game. We were happy to find a house that fit us all and had all the amenities we needed (plus more)! Sometimes pictures aren't always truthful, but in this case they were. Beautiful, fun house at a reasonable price. We will gladly use it again for anything we need to do during my daughter's college years. Thank you!
PS, Kyle was very friendly, attentive and helpful!"
2023-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We loved our stay at Kyle's place. The home is beautiful and spacious, and everything was exactly as described. Kyle is a great communicator and provided very clear instructions, making everything easy for us. We stayed here with small children and found it very comfortable with kids. Our toddler has already been asking when she can go back and place there again. We would definitely stay here any time and highly recommend it!"

2023-01-01,5,Stayed one night,Great place.
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great spot in a quiet neighbourhood not far from anything! Clean house with plentiful dishes to use for cooking meals at the house instead of going out!
2022-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"We used this house as a home away from home for our work team. They loved it and said to stay here again, as it was comfy and homey and perfectly comfortable. We will book this house again."
2022-12-01,5,Group trip,My family enjoyed our quick stay while we were in town for ISU graduation. It was so nice have a big space to all hang out rather than cram into a hotel. The house is clean and well kept. Kyle and Sam were also very responsive and helpful. My only regret is we couldn't stay longer. Thank you!
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is a great house for anything you want to do in Ames. My coworkers and I were able to use it for work, it would be good for a game day use, or anything else."
2022-11-01,5,Group trip,"Kyle was a fantastic host and had an amazing home. He did a great job at communicating with us during our stay. The house was veery spacious, clean, in a great location and had several gray activities to enjoy at the house. Thank you for hosting us!"
2022-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We are from the Ames area and back there often. We have always wrestled finding a good deal at a hotel and Ames just doesn't have exactly what we need - NOW we have Kyle and Sam's place - it is a great setup. They have really cleaned up the home nicely, furniture including beds were super comfy. Location is great to get anywhere in Ames or head down to Des Moines easily. Lots of room in this home with a living area on main floor and a very nicely setup family room in the basement. Neighborhood is quiet as well. We'll stay every time we are back if it is available!"
2022-11-01,5,Group trip,This place was exactly as advertised and a great stay for our group of six. Plenty of space to spread out and well stocked on all fronts.
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Comfortable Cozy Great Location

2022-09-01,5,Stayed one night,Kyle's place is great. There were a lot Of games and an air hockey table in the basement that we enjoyed. It's located Within about 5 minutes of the stadium. It's also very close to many great Ames restaurants.. And about 10 minutes from Ames Main Street. Would definitely recommend staying there! I will be saying again next time I'm in town!
