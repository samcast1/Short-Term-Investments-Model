2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The bungalow was great!
It was exactly what we needed for a graduation weekend. The house duplex is in a good area of town. Close to all activities. The host
was responsive and helpful."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great place. Cute and cozy. Even though it’s a duplex there was a lot of privacy.
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Liia's place was just what we needed for a quick overnight trip to Uvalde. Well equipped amenities made it feel like home.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Thank you Liia for making my husband's stay comfortable! He had everything he needed for an enjoyable few weeks in Uvalde.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Liia's place is a charming vintage gem set in a lovely walkable neighborhood with awesome trees. We had everything we needed except a garbage disposal in the kitchen sink & a dishwasher - but that's just part of the old world charm! AC units kept the place very comfortable. Liia is a great host. She answered all our questions and was easy to reach. The house is lovely, everything was clean and we really enjoyed our stay. Deer came to visit the spacious backyard in the evenings, and there were magical fireflies in a nearby park (we live in the arid Southwest and hadn't seen those in ages). Location is convenient to exploring the town. Parks, groceries, restaurants are all nearby."
2024-03-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"We enjoyed our stay, we only had two issues with our stay but considering it’s an older home it’s understandable. The first being a security issue since a couple of windows were unable to be locked. The second being bugs, both dead and alive throughout the house. Other than that we enjoyed our stay, it was in a good location and was near everything. We had no issues with check-in or parking and the host was generous enough to leave a stocked medicine cabinet and complimentary drinks in the fridge. The rental did have lots of space and was decorated well."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,The place meet our needs while in uvalde visiting family for a day. I like that it has a smart TV to watch my shows. And the host has some soft drinks available for us which was very kind and convenient.

Clean"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Just as described. A comfortable, tastefully quirky old house in a residential neighborhood within a 10-minute walk of the downtown square. More thoughtful amenities in the kitchen than I had expected or had seen in other airbnbs. Would definitely choose her vintage bungalow again when back in Uvalde."

2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I’m honestly obsessed with Liia’s place - the vintage details in the home, the sprawling, beautiful trees in the yard, the sweet neighborhood - it was all just perfect. Charming, peaceful, and had me feeling more at home than just about any of the many, MANY Airbnbs I’ve enjoyed. Don’t hesitate, just book it!"

2023-01-01,4.0,Stayed over a week,"This is a nice little place that is part of a duplex in a great area of town. It is decorated really cute with some vintage and Texas style decor. The kitchen is a little small and you could get the job done if you needed to cook, but is pretty minimal so we didn't utilize it too much. There is a nice yard to enjoy. The neighbor was quiet and friendly. It is a nice little gem for Uvalde and I'd happily stay here again. The office in the back of the house was a great spot to work remotely from and was surrounded by windows with lovely lighting. I saw deer several days in the back yard. Liia was great to work with."

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Christopher was absolutely wonderful and flexible with my short notice booking. The house was amazing and even better were the surroundings. It was incredible peaceful and tranquil. The porch was the perfect spot to have a morning cup of coffee and a great glass of wine in the evening. We saw wildlife right from the porch. We felt very safe as well with being able to see the exterior camera feed.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My family and I were looking for a nice getaway to see the April eclipse. We wanted a peaceful and quiet place away from city nice and the crowds that would be coming to Texas. This house was perfect. We love the outdoors & the property surrounding the house had a wide variety of plant species including mountain laurel, prickly pear cactus, several flower species including bluebonnets, cedar & mesquite trees. The house was super clean & has 2 nice sized bedrooms, a very large living room space, a nice kitchen with modern appliances, great storage for lengthy stays if needed, a nice mudroom that houses a washer & dryer if needed & a spacious loft area upstairs. The bathroom was just right with a tile accented tub/shower. I spent a lot of time walking the grounds around the house, and on the large half wrap around porch in the mornings with my coffee listening to the birds. I'll definitely be back for another stay. Highly recommended for a nice quiet getaway with real Texas views."

2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Super cool Airbnb, great location and nice place to stay. Only thing I’d say is that if you’re planning on using the full amount of beds that are listed as bed in the Airbnb you might want to reconsider or plan on getting air mattresses, given that two of the “twin beds” are made from fold out green velvet chairs and they definitely don’t work as a bed unless you have something under each end of them to prop them up to make it flat."

We’d like to visit again when the weather is cooler so we can enjoy the deck. The only reason for a 4 star on the cleanliness was the floor. We don’t wear shoes indoors and we were consistently wiping our feet off. Otherwise, a great stay and the water pressure is AMAZING! Wish I had that pressure at home. Would definitely recommend."

Don't think about it, this is the place to stay and carefree."

Traveled with two associates on business. This was a fabulous place to stay. Very, very clean, comfortable and spacious. Would give 10 stars for the value and Krystyn's hospitality.

The community memorials in town were very heartfelt, our sympathies go out to this community and the families of those involved in the recent tragic event. Wonderful community."

2022-06-01,5.0,Group trip,"Krystyn was a wonderful host! The loft is the cutest gem in Uvalde. Great communication and she even was able to let us in early to decorate for a bachelorette party. If anyone is looking for a place not right in the middle of the frio craziness, I would recommend this property!"
2022-06-01,5.0,Group trip,"Beautiful stay! had everything we needed and not too far from the river. Also, it was close to the stores and was very convenient."
2022-05-01,5.0,Group trip,"I did not get to personally stay there, I booked this on behalf of colleagues who were passing through for work purposes, but they say it was ""nice"" and it was ""very comfortable and looked like the pictures."""
2022-05-01,5.0,Group trip,"I booked four rooms with Krystyn at the Benson Guest House, and also the loft across the street. All four accommodations were spectacular, according to my guests who stayed there. They had all come in from out of town, from Houston, Denver, and San Antonio, and all fell in love. All also said they would want to stay again. The ambiance, the comfy beds, and the peace and quiet were all things they pointed out. Krystyn was also clear in her instructions in terms of checking in and out, and was very friendly in her correspondence. If you have a larger party, try renting the loft. It's spacious, and the privacy/outdoor patio is extremely convenient. The location in charming downtown Uvalde was also a huge bonus. We will be booking/staying here in the near- and long-term future."

2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Great place to stay
2021-10-01,4.0,Group trip,Location was great. I didn’t realize there was stairs to get up to the Airbnb. But it was bright and open. The Airbnb itself was a nice quiet area to stay. There aren’t many options in this area to stay so it was nice to stay at this location. krystyn made directions simple and pretty straight forward. One thing to recommend is the twin chairs that turn into a bed were a little bit tough to get comfy in but maybe if there is family in the area you can just inflate an air mattress and it works just as great!
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Such a beautiful loft. Perfect location, very clean, and beautiful decor. The directions made it easy to access and convenient for any question I had. Overall great experience!"

2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Krystyn’s Loft spaces very clean and inviting.

2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Clean and beautiful! Loved our stay will keep this in my favorites. We felt at home and felt secure slept great all around amazing stay.
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This was such a great space. Location is really good if you are looking for somewhere to stay close to Concan. Without having to stay in a small, old cabin comparable in pricing. It was a straight shot to float the river. We wish we had time to walk around the local boutiques. The master bedroom bed is super firm. Sounded like there was some light construction outside our window. Just a heads up on those two things. In case you like fluffy beds and absolute peace and quiet. Plenty of fast food restaurants, HEB grocery store, Walgreens, etc within 5 minutes or less. Our group consisted of 4 adults and 1 child. Everyone was comfortable. Would stay again!"
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Krystyn’s Airbnb was perfect! Location was amazing, all the best shops and eateries are nearby. Her home was super comfy, we can’t wait to stay again! 👌🏼"
2021-07-01,5.0,Group trip,very clean and perfect
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Loved staying here! It’s very open & has beautiful furniture and decor. However, my favorite part of the entire loft has to be the master bathroom. Huge shower and the kids loved soaking in the bath tub. We will definitely be recommending this loft to family & friends, as well as staying again next time we visit Uvalde."
2021-06-01,5.0,Group trip,Nice place to stay
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,This is an amazing loft and Krystyn does a great job at being very responsive!
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,I chose this location because we were taking a trip to the frio but wanted to still have phone reception and restaurants. It was an easy drive to the river. The loft is beautiful and we really enjoyed our stay!
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Great place to stay.
2021-05-01,5.0,Group trip,Very pleasant people & the house was BEAUTIFUL. Would definitely stay again!
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This has got to be the best place to stay in Uvalde. The rooms here are cute, fairly spacious, and cozy. There’s a TV in every room if you need to relax after a long day on the river, and the AC works great and is completely silent. We originally booked here at the loft, but changed to the Benson Guest House because a displaced family still needed the loft. We didn’t mind, and Krystyn was still more than accommodating and gave us a gift card for some of the local restaurants."
2021-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Lovely place to stay!
2024-06-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"Our host Julie described everything exactly as they were, plus she provides pictures before you reserve. We thank her for allowing us to stay in her rental, as all we needed was a comfortable place to rest and to be ready for the next day. We have stayed there several times, and will continue to do so, as long as she accepts us.
Thank you Julie!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,I've stayed at Julie's quaint casita numerous times and it is both constantly clean and well-maintained. She is very communicative and responsive. Always happy to stay there!

2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I love this cozy casita! Everything you need inside - comfy bed, efficient kitchenette and the coffee maker works great. Plus the sweetest puppy dog greeted me!Will return next time I’m in the area."
2024-03-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Julie’s place is cute, clean, and as described. Opening & closing the gate is challenging for a short person. It would have been helpful to have some sort of body wash or soap in the bathroom.
The tiny house is perfect for one person!
The heater and ceiling fan provide a temperature that is comfortable.
For the price and location, this is an economical way for 1 person to enjoy Uvalde! Thank you, Julie!"
2024-01-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Julie is a great host, especially she will provide you the things you need during your vacation plans in Uvalde Texas.
4.5 out of 5 stars!
Pros:
it has everything you need to cook, sit and relax, go online on your devices, use the bathroom especially has well, it has a heater and air condition for summer in winter, a pool & jacuzzi, & it has a memory foam bed to relax and sleep.
Cons:
The internet Wi-Fi is kind of lacking, especially it's not very strong to reach the bedroom for a long period of time, while you're online on your devices, but I hope Julie in the future can fix these issue, especially to add a Wi-Fi box router to make sure it connects to the bedroom and everywhere else in the backyard.
I wish the toilet and shower will be a little bit more cleaner, especially for the hot water to last a bit much more way longer as well.
& it would be nice to have a smart TV in the room while you're on online streaming shows.
All in all I had a very good time at Julie place! 🙂😉👍"
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place was exactly what we needed for our short stay, very cozy. Their dog and cat were the best part of staying there, so friendly and greeted us every morning and when returning to the house. Would for sure come back!!!"
2024-01-01,4.0,Stayed one night,Thanks for opening up your place for others to enjoy
2023-12-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,"After so many great reviews, I looked forward to staying at the Tiny Casita. Their Golden was a friendly dog and well trained not to jump on people. The first night the dog kept me awake barking. He was left out all night. I emailed Julie the next day and she apologized. The dog was inside the second night and I had a great sound sleep. The third and last night of my stay, the dog was left out again. At 12:45 AM I was awakened from a sound sleep with the barking. At 2:15 AM, again, the barking started. Both times, I had to go to the door and command him to stop. I am an exhausted and very disappointed guest."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Very cozy, just what I needed."

2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"Julie's cottage was an excellent value. The cottage was as described, small and basic. It was clean and well stocked. The bed and linens were comfortable. The quiet mini split air conditioner worked very well and kept us comfortable, even though the temperatures were above 100F. The coffee maker was efficient and easy to use. Julie was very responsive and polite with messages. Julie's friendly Golden Retriever was an added bonus to our stay because were were missing our dogs. We will plan to stay at Julie's cottage on return trips to Uvalde."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,As advertised: Very cozy and comfortable stay. Will revisit Julie’s place next Uvalde trip!!

2023-05-01,3.0,Stayed one night,"It’s a nice place, just a lot of things to go thru to get in house. Very small no tv. Was told we could park in driveway but there was already 3 cars in driveway. I likely won’t stay again. But it’s a nice place"

2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,My stay was delightful. Although I live in Houston Uvalde is my home. Have a ranch outside Uvalde but doing a lot of construction and remodeling on the house right now. I’ll be back during this time and again when the house just gets too full with this large family!😏. I considered stealing Paz and that little rascal kitty. It was perfect for me and all I had to do in Uvalde.

2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"What a wonderful retreat in Uvalde. When we arrived at the casita, the hosts left a heater on in anticipation of our arrival - it was such a welcoming gesture, especially arriving on an unnaturally cool day in Uvalde and after a very long drive. We had a wonderful sleep on the super comfortable bed. However, what stands out the most is the friendliness of the host, Julie. She was super responsive, kind and just an overall great human. It is obvious that this casita is owned by a lovely young family. It is a cozy space, perfect for 1-2 people. It is small, but comfortable and great for a short stay."

2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This is a very cute barebones cottage for me to stay in to break up my drive to West Texas. It felt very safe and quiet as a solo female traveler.

2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I very much enjoyed my stay and would stay here again if I’m ever in Uvalde. The guesthouse is close to town but out in the “country”. The upcycled/recycled decor and build was creatively and purposefully designed. I appreciated Marco’s quick and attentive communication style. He also has other rentals adjacent to this guesthouse and I would say they are worth the stay. If you’re looking for a unique, thoughtful, and safe stay in Uvalde or surrounding area, I recommend booking with Marco."

Much larger in person. Outside yard space huge. Super quiet Beds super comfy. A perfect place to explore Hill Country of Texas from !

2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,love the place i had a a wonderful time staying in this cabin
2023-08-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"Marcos place was pleasant. It looked like in the pictures. We arrived late and looked into a place last minute, his place was available and even though it was late into the night he responded promptly. When we arrived, I needed a assistance and he again replied and offered assistance over the phone. It was a quiet and private area to stay at. I have to add that I was not comfortable with considering renting an Airbnb due to traveling with my 18 month old grandson. Once there it was clear that he would be comfortable as well to play in the cabin with his toys without me worried about him knocking something over, which was of great relief. We will consider staying there again, because of our peaceful experience."

2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Marco’s guesthouse is the perfect getaway. He provides all you need for a comfortable stay and he is excellent at communication and ensuring his guests have all they need. The best part for my wife and I was Marco’s pet policy. As a responsible pet owner with well trained companion animals, Marco trusts his guests to do what is right with charging what I call a distrust fee. He makes clear that damage is our responsibility and will be charged, be he trusts his guests to do what is right. Thank you Marco for everything. We will definitely be back."
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This was my mom first experience with Air B&B and this was great for her. We hope to stay again as we can. Thank you!
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great!

2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Marco’s place is the perfect spot to visit the Concan River or The Rio Frío, just 29 minutes away, Me and my family strongly recommend anyone to stay at Marco’s Airbnb you will truly enjoy it."
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great location! Lovely stay!
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"Stayed 12 days at the guesthouse and loved everything about my stay here!!! Loved the quiet country living.
Super clean. Cool vibe. And Marco and Leigh extremely nice and considerate
The only place I’ll stay at in the area. Until next time."
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Really cool and unique place! It was perfect for our weekend getaway. Loved everything about Marco’s place.
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great place to stay, had all the essentials and was pretty awesome. Hosts are kind and welcoming."
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"When we arrived we were greeted by Marco who was not only very welcoming and hospitable, but also eager to ensure we were comfortable from the get go. We had a great chat. While many we've met thru AirBnB have gotten an attitude that they are doing us a favor by providing lodging, Marco and Leigh were polar opposite. They really made us feel that we were true guests and immediate friends. Read the reviews. Often it's about the facilities. Marco's and Leigh's reviews focus on their kindness. It made the stay a cozy one - like you're visiting old friends - and yet, they give you the privacy your looking for.
At this time, Marco and Leigh have two units available on AirBnB. While we had booked one, Marco invited us to view the other in case we ever come back and 'our' unit was booked. Both are very special and different. Our unit is a man cave but cozy for the girls too. It was well arranged and clean and is equipped with everything you need. It was important for us to have a good Internet connection for Zoom meetings; they went smoothly.
The other unit - I don't want to give too much away - is a newly remodeled comfortable get away. Which ever is available or which every you choose, you will definitely find it relaxing and a home away from home.
Thanks to Marco and Leigh for your kindness and generosity!!
Happy Travels"
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Quiet and clean place, feels like you're deep in the country. Great vibe"
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Marco saved us when we had to go to Batesville from Houston for Uncle’s funeral. Hotel were booked, but miraculously, he had a cancellation, so we got to stay at his place! Fun place to look at-had everything we needed-even a little bottle of hairspray-I left without packing mine and needed some due to wind at gravesite. Never had that sample at any of the airbnbs we’ve stayed in! Just a thoughtful touch. Also, full length mirror on door. When you’re in small towns for weddings or funerals, you’d like to see the entire outfit! Those special touches were more than we’ve seen at the other places we’ve stayed-even one where we stayed for stepson’s wedding didn’t have full length mirror. If anyone ever runs into that, Walmart has cheap ones! Had to get in Fburg, but Marco and Leigh thought of all that! Iron, board and hairdryer also. Thanks for all the special touches, especially on such an emotional weekend. We would always recommend to friends going in that direction!"
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Really interesting place to stay at Hill country.
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Just spent 3 days at the Gonzalez Guesthouse with my 9 yr old and loved it. We booked the trip very short notice (the night before) to tube the Frio River for the first time and explore the surrounding area. The property was easy to find if you follow Marco’s directions once you get off 83. I would simplify them even more to R on Elm, L on Homestead, R on Uvalde Oaks Drive, and the guesthouse is on the L #303. Just look for the big yellow Harley Davidson sign. You can’t miss it. Marco loves his bikes! The owners live right next door to the guesthouse. We were greeted upon arrival by Marco’s lovely wife Leigh and their adorable little dog Cheeky. To call Leigh warm and accommodating would be the understatement of the year. It’s people like Marco and Leigh that give Airbnb a good name. The guesthouse is as cool, funky and eclectic as it looks in the photos. The decor has something for everyone. My kiddo had great fun asking “What’s your favorite decoration/sign?” each day. The beds are very comfortable. We both slept peacefully all three nights. The A/C works great plus there’s a ceiling fan above the beds. The combo kept us cool for our entire stay. The shower works great too. Everything you need is provided but if you could think of anything they’ve missed, they’d get it for you pronto anyway. Marco and Leigh made great recommendations for local dining which I’ll list at the end, and Leigh helped prepare us for tubing the Frio as first-timers. We used Andy’s on the River, who provide a shuttle service to pick you up once you’re done. We tubed both days and it was wonderful - sunscreen is a must and needs to be reapplied often for protection as you’re out there for 3 hours or more. It’s an easy 25 minute drive from the guesthouse to the river. By the time we left we had made friends for life of Marco and Leigh. They are great hosts and their hospitality and easy going south Texas nature is a winning combo. My kiddo got so attached to Leigh and Cheeky that she shed tears for 30 minutes once we hit the road and made me promise we’ll be back. We will 😉
The following restaurants were all suggested by Marco and Leigh and are excellent.
Julio’s Grill for breakfast. Uvalde.
Broadway 830 Artisan Pizza. Uvalde.
Hippie Chicks River Shack for burgers, chicken etc on the river. Concan.
The Frio Float for ice cream, shakes, house made chocolate, & gifts. Concan.
Enjoy!"
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I was early and was not sure which building on the property was the airbnb. But anyway it is the one with the Harley Davidson in front. His directions as written work great. There are 3 buildings on the beautiful property and this one is the one on the right. Coded doorknob. It is a charming and spacious place. Good AC, fridge and stove, giant TV. Nice."
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,A really great and cozy place to stay. Marco & Leigh were wonderful and welcoming hosts with great knowledge of Uvalde and where to get the best meals. We loved our little weekend getaway!
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We’ve stayed in “fancy” AirBB, but you can feel the passion and love that’s been poured into this one; truly one of a kind.
Marco is a great communicator who takes pride in what he does. We’ll definitely look for this place when booking next year 💯❤️"
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The cabin was great, it was perfect for what we needed and served us well! Convenient location, fairly priced and the hosts were very kind to accommodate our third (small) dog. The space was very clean, cozy and safe. The only complaint to be had was that we arrived to a very hot and muggy cabin. (The AC unit was turned off.) After a long morning of traveling, we were really looking forward to relaxing and maybe getting cleaned up to go out for dinner. It took hours for the cabin to cool off and those plans were out the window. Overall, it was a great experience."
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The house was clean, bigger than expected, and well stocked with amenities to make the stay comfortable. Marco was a great host and the house was just perfect. Do yourself a favor and stay here!"
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Cozy, comfortable, and extremely unique stay."
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Quaint and lovely little cabin in a quiet community. Place was clean and decor was very eclectic and interesting. Would stay here again if I'm ever in the area.
2021-05-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,great value. clean.. big room. owner is nice. good privacy. excellent value. hiking and swimming at Garner state park is great
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"A quiet cozy, comfortable, guest house to enjoy the hill country from. The unique, rustic, decor is thoroughly charming. We enjoyed the visits from their cute little chihuahua. We stayed for two nights, loved it, and plan to return soon!"
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Cute place! Very peaceful.
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,I was in town for work and appreciated having a comfortable place to rest with cool decor and everything you might need for your stay.
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Gonzales’s Guesthouse is the type of AirBnB I hate to review because I want it to be available next time I’m in Uvalde, TX. It’s probably one of the best AirBnB experiences I’ve ever had. Leigh was there to greet us and show us the ropes. We are birders and we’re allowed to bird anywhere on their property. The guesthouse was very clean, spacious, and had everything you would need. The room is huge and very comfortable. Had a great nights
sleep in the most comfortable bed. We just stayed one night, but next time we will definitely be staying longer. Don’t hesitate to book this GREAT place."
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Despite the eclectic decor, (and one night of golf ball sized hail!) it was a very peaceful stay. Great hosts and wonderful place to “get away from it all.” Loved the visits from the chihuahua and kitty...and talking with the goats across the street."
2021-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Marco's place is excellent. It was such a charming cabin built from recycled/repurposed materials and decorated with an eclectic flair. We found it spacious, super clean, and had everything we needed. Marco and Leigh were wonderful hosts. They were fun to visit with and yet we felt the place was very private. We are bird enthusiasts and in the yard we saw Pyrruloxia, Cardinals, Cactus Wrens, Vermillion Flycatchers, and a Painted Bunting! We would absolutely stay again."
2021-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Quiet, quirky retreat just outside of downtown Uvalde. Friendly hosts to boot! The cozy cabin made coming home from work a real treat. Was thankful for all the amenities—full sized fridge, pots, pans, utensils, dinnerware, and a stove and oven! A home away from home. Will be back very soon!"
2021-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Loved the location; the dogs loved all the space.
2021-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The space is located near some great state parks (Lost Maples, Gardner) and the Frio river where you can go tubing/swimming. Marco and Leigh are excellent hosts and answered all my questions. The guest house is right next to their house, but I still felt a sense of privacy, and the outdoor furniture was a nice way to relax with a drink and stargaze."
2021-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Leigh and Marco were fantastic hosts, as was their outdoor cat, Ocean. Leigh recommended us a place to eat and an alternate hiking location. The sky was beautiful, full of stars that were easy to admire due to the low lights nearby. Leigh and Marco were quick to respond to messages, as well, even giving us their personal phone numbers."
2021-03-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"Comfortable, cozy and clean. Excellent place to hang a hat and chill."
2021-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Cute cabin. Was cozy and restful.
2021-02-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"Country cabin decked out in Texas road signs, host art, and repurposed materials. If you’re looking for a comfy offbeat place to hang your hat, this is it."
2021-01-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"A unique, rustic one of a kind place with lots of special touches. Very clean and safe. Marco and Leigh were quick to respond and greet us when we arrived. We would stay there again. Probably the only issue they we had particularly was walking our dog. The road was busy and filled with things that interested our dog so we had a hard time getting her to potty. But we worked that out and she (and we) were fine. The place had been cleaned spotlessly and we settled in quickly. Plenty of hot water and heat (we were there in the winter)."
2021-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Marco's guest house was perfect for my last-minute trip to the Hill Country. The place was clean and had everything I needed for a 2-night stay. The decorations are very unique - it was neat seeing so many reclaimed and repurposed items being used in the house. The Wi-Fi was fast and AT&T cell coverage was excellent. Great trip overall!
2020-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Absolutely would stay again. It was our first AirBNB experience & we’re so glad it was this wonderful cabin... we will never forget the kindness and hospitality from the host(s). We loved this place and we’ll always remember it fondly.
If you’re looking for a clean, comfortable, and safe place to stay....this would be it! ;- )
Thank you again for everything!
Dave & Kim"

Only down side was the big Trump flag in the front yard, but this is America and everyone is entitled to their opinion.."
2020-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place was a great unique getaway. Far enough for peace and quiet but not too far from downtown Uvalde. My wife and I enjoyed it immensely and were grateful for the local tips given. We agreed we’d stay again when we try to go to Lost Maples. Also, have to mention we liked the recycled theme and how clean it was."
2020-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"we loved our stay and it was a perfect home base as we explored uvalde, concan, leakey, camp wood. we loved all of the artistry put into the space. we were happy to see a full sized bed when we arrived, and we hope to stay here again if we are back in the area."
2020-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great hospitality and great location made for a wonderful opportunity to explore some of the rivers and other natural treasures in the area. Wish we had more time. We will be back. The place was super clean and just the right size for the two of us. Thanks Marco and Leigh!
2020-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Thank you for letting us stay at your unique cabin. Enjoyed the stay and the rivers near by. Recommend this AIRBNB if you are wanting to explore the areas around.
2020-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We enjoyed our stay at Marco and Leigh’s unique cabin.
Leigh greeted us at check in and was very informative and helped us find a place to tube.
We would highly recommend!"
2020-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great spot in Uvalde. Just a hop skip and a jump to some great river spots near the Frio and Nueces. Highly recommended as a much cheaper alternative to cabins on the riverfronts!
2020-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Our stay was delightful! Such a cute and clean place with lots of personality. Leigh, our host, was warm and welcoming and attentive. The kitchen was well equipped, which was a pleasant surprise, too. The area is quiet, the front porch a lovely spot for morning coffee or evening cocktails."
2020-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Marco was a great host! If you are looking for a one of a kind place with out of this world hosts, look no further! We will be back soon!"
2020-07-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"This guesthouse is unique in its style and decor. I loved all the details and thought that has been put into it. It's quite, very clean and close to town. A little difficult to find if you don't know the neighborhood. Leigh and Marco were very very hospitable and always there in case of questions and concerns. Check-In was a breeze."
2020-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,It was a great place for a little get away!!! Just a few minutes away from town and not to far from Concan to enjoy the Frio & Gardner State Park . I really enjoyed Leigh she gave me a great location for me and my boyfriend to enjoy ourselves. I absolutely love their little home and all cool decorations!!!! Thank you for the memories!!!!! 🖤
2020-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This stay was cute and exactly as the pictures show. Every morning a cardinal visits at the window! It was a very short trip down to the river, will definetely stay again. Marco and Leigh are amazing people."
2020-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had to go to Uvalde to take care of some paperwork at the county court house. We travel full time with our dog (Chief). We almost always stay in Airbnb's when we are staying somewhere for a week or more. With the current situation we decided we would rather be in a private property by ourselves rather than a public hotel. Marco's place with just what we needed and would have worked fine for more than a couple of nights, although that's all we needed this time.

2020-03-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Great place to stay clean and comfortable
2019-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful location and equally beautiful house. Worth the drive from Houston. Comfortable and rustic guesthouse that had everything we needed. Very creative decor by Marco and Leigh. 10mins drive from HEB and approx. 1hour drive to Lost Maples state park.
2019-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place was large, probably more than needed for just myself but I liked it and it was comfortable. Marco was very helpful over the phone with navigational challenges. Would stay there again for sure."
2019-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We deviated from our biking route to stay at Marco's place after seeing the photos on AirBnB. The Gonzalez Guesthouse is exactly as pictured. Bernie says it's eclectic and one of a kind. He loved it. Mary says it was fun seeing the decor and special touches that reflect Marco's creativity and talent in taking something mundane and transforming it into something unique. We're glad we stayed at GG. Bernie and Mary
2019-10-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"This cabin was a lot of fun to stay in. This was our first experience using Air BnB. We flew in to Houston from from Ohio to do some stargazing and needed a place to stay near to a dark sky sanctuary. This was the perfect spot and even did some stargazing in their back yard. We stayed 2 days and enjoyed the rustic and eclectic cabin that has such a history. It was just a few minutes from the Uvalde complete with a Walmart and lots of places to eat and shop in case you forgot something along the way. Driving in from Houston, we wondered about cell service in this rural part of town, but T-Mobile did not disappoint. We surprisingly had strong 4G cell service all along the way from Houston and for miles around, even in the dark sky sanctuary. The host provided several extra touches including a history of the cabin, the use of some directors chairs and anything else we overlooked or needed. Over the top! The host was very welcoming and friendly too and loved their friendly dogs too! We would definitely return and recommend this place for those wanting a different experience."
2019-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This was our first Airbnb experience, and it was great, such a fun and eclectic place. Comfy and cozy rustic guesthouse that had everything we needed for our quick stay, including comfort for our pet. I enjoyed taking in all the decor and repurposed materials; the hosts are very creative!"
2019-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This was our very first time going through Airbnb, and it did not disappoint! The cabin is perfect. It was very clean and filled with rustic charm. It had everything we needed, and more. This was a super last minute, unexpected need and the hosts were very nice and helpful. The beds were comfortable, the bedding was nice, the wi-fi was great, and all of the little nice touches made our quick little stay a delight."
2019-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Fun and eclectic rustic cabin, just 10 minutes from the Uvalde fairgrounds and main square/shopping area- cabin is as listed - very clean, quiet and private with cute little touches and lots of amenities - Marco & Leigh, the hosts, were great at communication and very welcoming! Good launching point for exploring the area, including Garner State Park and the Frio River (about a 30 min drive north). Would return and recommend!"

2019-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had the pleasure of staying at Marco’s place for a week. We had a great time in his fun, unique and comfortable guesthouse. He gave us great suggestions on places to go and eat. We enjoyed the hospitality and will definitely recommend his place to others.
The cabin was in the country but close to many rivers, nice hill country drives and to town. Thanks Marco and Leigh!"
2019-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We only stayed for one night, but they still pulled out all the stops! The guesthouse was quiet and far enough out of the city that you could see tons and tons of stars at night. It was super cute and had all kinds of character and personal touches that looking around felt like a treasure hunt to see what else we could find. The beds were SUPER comfy. I slept like a baby and check in was a breeze. We LOVED our stay and already know we'll be back the next time we head up to Uvalde."
2019-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Marco was a fantastic host! My girlfriend and I spent the night after a day at Garner State Park and wanted to beat the heat. We ended up checking in pretty late, however this wasn't an issue for Marco. He made it a point to provide his personal phone number, guide us to his house, greet us, and show every inch of the guest house. The house was even more amazing than the pictures made it to be, and the story behind it is really special. Marco built the house himself and did an amazing job! Thanks for the hospitality, we look forward to our next stay!"
2019-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Worked great as our base for floating the Frio and exploring hill country!

2019-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Marco is a great host! He was nice enough to stay up late for our arrival and even took the time to speak to us and make sure that we felt comfortable.

2019-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Very unique place that was very creative. Had a great stay
2019-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Marco was the best host I have come across. When I told him that I booked my stay too short he offered me to stay at another property and was very accommodating. The fresh eggs were great! I recommend staying with Marco anytime you are in the area.
2019-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Our stay was a short but enjoyed it. Loved the decor inside and out. We had a little trouble finding the place but it was well worth it. Marco was very kind. Will definitely come back for a longer stay!!!
2019-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My mother and I spent Mother's Day weekend at the Gonzales Gueshouse and we both loved it. The space was authentic, comfortable and clean. The owners are kind and made us feel very welcome. We would stay there again! 5 Stars!"
2019-04-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,I stayed for two month in Marco‘s cabin. It was a good time! Marco created a great and outstanding atmosphere in this cabin.
2019-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This place was great! Definitely a good place to stay if you are in the area--35 minutes from Garner State Park, <10 minutes from downtown Uvalde. We got lost on the way there, and he was so helpful in giving us directions. Very hospitable, the place was very cute, very dog friendly."

2018-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Marco was so hospitable! The decor and place was so comfortable and interesting to look at it! If you want a country-like feel, you’ll definitely get it here. The place is less than a 10 minute drive from Uvalde’s Main Street and near plenty of highways. We had all the basic essentials for a comfortable stay. I will definitely be back, next time I go out that ways!"
2018-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Everything the pictures and owner portray except now includes a full or queen in addition to a twin bed!
2018-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Marco's place is a nice cozy cabin. Great place to get away for some fresh air and explore nature's true beauty.
2018-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Really comfortable and cool guesthouse. If I ever need a place to stay in Uvalde I’ll be back!
2018-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"My friend and I stayed here for one night before driving to Lost Maples park. It was difficult to find the cabin in the dark because the address isn't correct on Google Maps, so try to check in during the day if you can. The guesthouse was adorable and the heat was on when we got there (it was freezing outside!). Comfy beds, small but usable kitchen, and cute furniture and decor. Our car was extremely low on gas, and the owners were kind enough to give us a bit to get on the road in the morning. We'd definitely stay here again."
2018-11-01,4.0,Stayed one night,Enjoyed the stay! Marco was very hospitable.
2018-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Marco’s cabin is soo much fun! He built it with his own hands on recycled material. Perfect for a getaway from the hustle and bustle of the city. Marco can point you to many hidden gems in the area I didn’t know existed. My gf and I had a great time!
2018-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The stay at Marco’s place great. I slept well and everything was just as advertised.
2018-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"My experience at Marco’s was outstanding. My boyfriend and I just wanted to get out of the city for a night and we were looking for a cabin feel. This place was everything we were looking for and more! Well kept and authentic. Marco was extremely accommodating and even saved our asses when we got a flat tire in the middle of nowhere, and then proceeded to cook some dinner on a smoker for us! Just an all around great experience, 100 out of 10 would recommend. (Yes, my math is intentional)"
2018-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"It was a wonderful stay! The house was pretty and the eggs were delicious!
I'm sure we will come back!"
2018-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,One of the most interesting and beautiful Airbnb places I have stayed in. I wish I could had stayed longer!
2018-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,You will love this little cabin with all its special touches. Marco and his wife are very gracious hosts and were so helpful in helping us find what we were looking for.
2018-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Marco and Leigh are great!
it was the perfect spot for our vacation. Clean, cozy and best of all quiet. We also received some very tasty farm fresh eggs.
Marco and Leigh are very infomative and assisted us in choosing local places to visit."
2018-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Marco’s home is the best place anywhere around Uvalde to either get a jump to the rivers or just to sit back and watch the sun go down (we did both). If you’re looking for a peaceful, homey, and stylish cabin to rest in between river trips, this is the place! It had all the comforts we needed, and the way it was styled was so cool that we just enjoyed sitting around inside or lounging on the patio looking out at the goats. It’s close enough to town that you can drive right in to get what you need, but Marco’s place is far enough out that you’ll fit right in with the south Texas countryside. He and his family were a pleasure to meet as well, and anyone would be lucky to have them as hosts and as friends. Until next time amigo!"
2018-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Super!
2018-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Marco & Leigh were fantastic hosts. Their place is charming and was a perfect starting point for our Hill Country adventures. They gave us fresh eggs- a super welcoming touch- and made sure we had everything we needed. Our pups loved having room to roam. Mornings were wonderful with lots of dove calls - felt like being in the middle of nowhere but HEB is just down the road. We loved that the cabin was made from all reclaimed and repurposed materials. We highly recommend staying with them and hope to return again in the fall!
2018-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"really nice space, especially considering it's built from repurposed materials! it is a little outside the city limits, but we really appreciated the quiet, and the farm-fresh eggs. this is a cozy place to stay, especially if you want to get away from the hustle and bustle. marco was very friendly, and very responsive, and made sure we knew what to see and where to do.
very nice place. :)"
2018-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I had a great stay at Marcos Guesthouse! Loved Marco and Leighs hospitality, I felt very welcome all the time and whenever I needed something they would take care of it. The Guesthouse itself offers plenty of space and basically everything you would need, even for an extended stay. I liked the small but well equiped kitchen, the fast wifi and the very creativ (and texan) decoration of the guesthouse."

Bathrooms were super clean and had more than enough towels. One of my favorite rooms is the dedicated office. I had to work some during our trip and the wifi and workspace was really great.

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Absolutely solid property. This is a nice one bed/one bath cottage with a full kitchen and living room. It was clean. All the listed amenities that we needed and tried worked flawlessly. It is very close to the walkable part of downtown Uvalde. It was close to the restaurants in town that we enjoy, the local H-E-B grocery store, and other key functions of day-to-day living. Neighborhood was safe and quiet. This is exactly what my bride and I were looking for in a booking for a couple of days to do some photography in the local area. And it would have been great for a longer stay. We visit Uvalde nearly yearly. I will be heartbroken if this property is not available when we come back next year."

2024-01-01,3.0,Stayed one night,The cottage was very clean and cozy. Lilly is was very responsive. The bed is smaller than expected and might be hard for some Seniors to get in and out of.
2024-01-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"My husband and I spent New Year's Eve at the cottage in Uvalde. Our host, Lilly, was extremely helpful and always responded quickly to any questions we had. We were grateful to be able to bring our ESA dog with us. The cottage was conveniently located close to the historic area and the main street, which had plenty of restaurants and shops. Although the cottage was situated in an alley near older homes, it was a peaceful and pleasant place to stay. However, the bathtub was outdated. There were a couple of minor issues such as a strong Febreze smell and a lack of toiletries in the shower, but overall, we enjoyed our stay."

Hugo and Graciela"
2023-11-01,3.0,Stayed with kids,"We would've felt better if the house was cleaner because the rug needed a deep clean and there was a mouse trap with droppings behind the microwave (which also didn't seem to work when we used it). Once I saw that I didn't feel comfortable letting my toddler run around. Otherwise, the house looked just like the pictures and was fine for the night. Good location to food. Checkout at 10am was kind of early."

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Mike and Jenny's country loft is so peaceful and beautiful, beyond our expectations. As someone preparing for an exam, I couldn't have asked for a better place to concentrate and focus. The country loft itself was beautifully decorated and had everything we needed and more. We had a great time feeding carrots to the horses and getting up close with the goats and longhorn cows. It was exactly what we needed for a relaxing and enjoyable visit. We are excited to come back and bring our kids along. We were fortunate to have Mike and Jenny as our hosts. Not only did they provide a wonderful accommodation, but they also went above and beyond to assist us when we encountered car trouble. Their genuine hospitality and willingness to help made our experience even more memorable. We are truly grateful for their kindness and highly recommend staying at their Airbnb."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"We had a great stay. The loft is well appointed, comfortable, and peaceful. Mike and Jenny are really nice people and go out of their way to ensure a nice stay.

2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I have stayed at several places throughout the world and this is without a doubt the most peaceful environment I’ve been in a long time. I have been working in Texas for sometime and my girlfriend flew from New Jersey to visit me. We stayed here to try to relax and take our minds away from work. I can’t remember the last time I was able to sleep as good as I did here, definitely grateful for being able to spend our time here. We purchased groceries our first day in Uvalde and basically grilled food, there was really no need to eat out. There is a binder in the living room with instructions and places to eat as well as things to do. There’s also board games in the closet and even a massage chair in the bedroom. Overall, this place is amazing if you are looking for relaxation away from the city as well as privacy."

2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Mike and Jenny's country loft was everything it was listed to be and than some. They where fantastic hosts, providing amenities far above what was expected. The location was beautiful and peaceful, with the most amazing sunsets every night. We enjoyed feeding carrots to the horses, seeing goats and long horn cows up close was a unique experience. We saw many wild deer in the mornings and evenings. Our stay was everything we needed in a relaxing and enjoyable visit to the Uvalde area We would highly recommend a stay at this property, and look forward to returning."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"My wife and I have stayed at a few dozen bnbs, but cannot think of one better put together than this one.

There's some horses, long horns, chickens, and goats that you can feed. Along with an incredible host family, who are very friendly. I highly recommend for anyone who's looking to stay in this area, to come out here."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Absolutely my favorite B and B . Beautiful guest house , squeaky clean located In beautiful surroundings. This is a short drive to town and was the perfect place to enjoy peace and quiet. Host went above and beyond to make sure we were comfortable. I can’t wait to return. ❤️"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,I was working in the area and looking for a place to stay that was more peaceful and private than a hotel in town. This place is not far out of town but may as well be way out of town for how peaceful and private it is. The hosts are very nice people who made me feel very welcome. The place is very well set-up with everything I needed to heat up meals I brought from town.
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Mike & Jenny are such wonderful hosts. This is our go-to Air BnB when my family is in town. We always feel right at home. Bonus points for letting us feed the horses!
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I can gladly say Mike and Jenny’s place was outstanding. Definitely felt like I was at home which is what I’m looking for, place was really clean with new appliances. Will go down on my top 3 airbnbs to go and will come back again, thank y’all :)"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This is probably one of my favorite places to stay. Mike and Jenny are amazing hosts. I will continue staying here as long as the dates I need are available.
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"by far the best place we have stayed at!!
Healing and tranquil!
thank you Mike and Jenny for opening your home...."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,I can’t even think where to begin with this. To begin I booked last minute Jenny responded almost immediately and made arrangements to accommodate my stay. Upon arrival Mike met with me in front with a big ol howdy (Texan way of saying welcome). He took the time to make sure that I had a pleasant travel and showed me around their beautiful house. When I say that they have gone above and beyond to make everyone feel comfortable and at home they have covered everything! The pool was wonderful to relax in and enjoy sitting outside and take in the country view and sounds. The bed was very comfortable and there is even a massage chair that helped me relax. Definitely the best host and home for a getaway. They are definitely an Angel sent from GOD. Thank y’all again!
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great & comfortable
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Mike and Jenny's place has been one of the greatest adventures my husband and I have done. The loft is beautiful, clean, quiet, peaceful, and makes you feel at home. We really enjoyed feeding the animals snacks that were provided by the hosts (my favorite part was giving snacks to the cows, they are like big puppies! LOL) I don't think there are any other words I can use to describe the great hospitality Mike and Jenny gave us. My ONLY regret and complain is that our stay wasn't long enough. We are definitely coming back next summer. We can't wait to see y'all again."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We had a wonderful stay all the way around. So enjoyed feeding carrots to horses. I think they were sad to see us leave. The chickens were fun to watch. And it was fun to watch the goats and longhorns being feed. Absolutely gorgeous views from loft. Especially at sunset. Our stay just was not long enough to enjoy a swim in the relaxing blue pool. Maybe next time.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Everything is well thought out, anything you could ever need was already there; from gas or charcoal grill to extra towels and board games. Mike was really nice upon welcoming us. Even though they are next door we felt we got our privacy. I highly recommend this place for a calm and soothing get away. My fiancé (born and raised in a farm) loved the view, and having the animals close by. I can’t say enough positive things about our stay; will definitely be coming back."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"When we first arrived, it looked exactly the way it’s advertised. Upon opening the door it was so much more! This place has everything that you would need during your stay and much more. It’s definitely a five star plus place! Mike and Jenny were the best!
We loved our stay and thank you for sharing this peaceful and beautiful place with us. Until next time."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Confortable and relaxing place to stay
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Under priced for what you get! Before driving in, we received very clear instructions on how to get there. They even have a sign at the end of the driveway that is lit up at night. We were greeted by Mike as we drove up. The best smelling place I’ve been in! Every time I walked in I thought to myself, “This place smells great!” Everything was so clean and organized with new electronics and modern/updated rooms. The massage chair was amazing! The shower was unbelievable! The bed was very comfortable with the softest sheets. This place has everything you need. There were carrots in the fridge to feed the horses. The pool was available. We really liked that it was private, but never felt neglected. The weather was rough one night. As Mike was cleaning up the next day, he made sure to check on us. He always made us feel at home! My best experience with Air-bnb! Highly recommended and I will stay here again when in the area."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My husband and I stayed at The Country Loft hosted by Mike & Jenny for our 1 year anniversary and it was fabulous! There spot was so peaceful in addition to Mike & Jenny being the most incredible hosts. I can’t say there’s much locally that was impressive for restaurants so we just shopped in town at the grocery store and cooked at our Country Loft that had everything we needed. The pool is just right for 2 people, my husband’s knees are really bad but he could manage the stairs just fine; they are solid with a good railing and wide. I love the shower, wish that could have come home with us. The farm animals were rockstars and every detail was thought of. FYI - from this spot you can drive 30 to 45 min in just about any direction and find an awesome swimming hole. This was just what we needed for some R&R and I couldn’t brag on Mike & Jenny’s and their Country Loft enough!!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"I highly recommend this property for many reasons.... it is secluded, safe, very clean, well kept, comfortable, and equipped with high end appliances. Mike and Jenny are very welcoming, and they make the check in/check out process very easy. Mike and Jenny respond to calls promptly, and ensure your stay is pleasant. The farm animals are a huge plus as well..... I look forward to my next stay. You will not be disappointed!!!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Loved our stay. Really nice setting....enjoyed the horses and sitting outside watching the hummingbirds. Jenny was great.....enjoyed meeting her. The unit was spotlessly clean....everything we could possibly have needed, was provided. Looking forward to returning soon."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This is one of the prettiest places I’ve stayed. I had a wonderful time during our stay.
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Amazing place to stay
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Absolutely amazing. We had a great time enjoying hill country!
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The Country Loft - what a find! The experience exceeded our expectations. We found the Country Loft not only beautiful but also very peaceful. The loft was extremely clean and the interior decor was professionally perfect.
The animals - Casper and Sparky (beautiful horses) stole the show. We enjoyed feeding them carrotts. Watching the hummingbirds in the early morning was amazing. Cows, goats, and chickens from the farm were also entertaining. Deer appearances outside kitchen window were magical.
Jenny and Mike live up to their super host status. They were available to give history and answer questions. They supplied extra treats for us. They were very welcoming, friendly and hospitable. We plan to return!"
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Second stay as great as the first. Fabulous place and people. Mike and Jenny are top notch and do everything to make you feel right at home. Comfy and cozy with a dash of ranch. Birdwatcher paradise and if you love animals their farm crew are the friendliest going from their horses to the goats and longhorns. Guarantee you will want to stay longer or come back for another visit. Look forward to our next stay. Julie and chris
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,I would move in if I could. This is by far the best place I have stayed and have already made reservations for my next trips to Uvalde.
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The most adorable airbnb, we’ve stayed to date! Beautiful surroundings, clean-cozy-comfortable, stocked with essentials.. and the most special touch, horse carrots (such a lovely experience).
Mike & Jenny are kind and considerate hosts and we would certainly book with them again. HIGHLY RECOMMEND!"
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,My wife and I have been in multiple Air BnB trips and Mike & Jenny were by far the best hosts we’ve encountered. This was a Valentines Day gift for my wife and they bought flowers and wine for me when I was away on a trip. They made it perfect! They even had food for the animals for us to interact with all weekend! Couldn’t be more perfect! We highly recommend this place if you wanna relax.
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,A wonderful peaceful place! We loved the animals! Very nice hosts! It was beyond our expectations!! Thanks!
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,I love to be able to come back from a crazy day at the rodeo arena to a quiet space and just relax. No traffic driving by. I LOVE this place/
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"Place was immaculately clean, cozy, and convenient with the included amenities. It was easy to find, and everything was as described, actually better. Hosts very flexible with scheduling and were able to accept possible disruptions with my travel dates. The location is fairly secluded and extremely quiet. I can say I've never stayed in such a peaceful location before. It took me a bit to adjust to the racket of being back in my home town after I left. The most important part was being treated so well by the hosts. If I needed anything at the casita, Mike and Jenny were a text or call away. If I could, I'd give them ten stars!"
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Amazing hosts and amazing accommodations.
The space is almost entirely brand new, well built, and has everything you need. Mike is also a great and friendly host. I plan to stay again and recommend the same for anyone looking for an Air BnB in the area!"

2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"Mike and Jenny rock! I can’t recommend their place enough. I stayed there for 14 days and felt completely relaxed and taken care of. The two mini split air conditioners kept me nice and chill while it was 95 degrees outside or I could chill in the pool. The place is maybe 7 min from Uvalde and about 10-15 for anything in Uvalde. The kitchen had everything I needed, the bed was comfortable and the space was very clean."
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Perfect location, calm escape and so clean! Love the animals ! So friendly 🙂
Our favorite people 🙂❤️❤️"
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"lovely property! we arrived a little later than anticipated but the property had motion sensor lights which made unloading our bags so much easier! everything was as pictured, and mike was so friendly when we finally got to meet the next morning. he gave us carrots to feed the horses, the horses had much personality and we’re so terribly friendly once they warmed up to you. we had a perfect view of the stars, my only regret is not having booked for a longer stay"
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,House was beautiful! My husband really enjoyed talking with mike and Jenny. We loved that they let us feed the horses carrots and the goats were so cute! My daughter enjoyed the horses very much! We will definitely be coming back here next time we’re in uvalde!
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"From the minute I walked in their place, all my stressors left. It’s such a peaceful atmosphere and cozy place. I always wake up during the night, but I sleep the whole night through in that comfy bed. Their place has everything you need. I’m gonna take advantage of the pool next visit. Thanks Mike and Jenny for sharing your lovely loft."
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Would definitely come back, it was a relaxing stay! We had everything we needed and more."

2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This place is amazing! Mike and Jenny are incredible hosts- gave us a tour of the space, were extremely friendly, and made us feel right at home. They even let us feed the horses.
Moreover the space is really fantastic. The home is comfortable, well appointed, and very clean. I was excited to stay here based on the pictures, but honestly the house is even better in person. The attention to detail made the aesthetics more pleasing and contributed to the function of the home. From the soft close kitchen cabinets., the fabulous shower, and the comfy bedding, to the ac units and remote controlled fans, this stay exceeded my expectations.
I can’t imagine better places in this area to stay"
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,The stay was really amazing we both had a lot of fun and got a chance to feed the horses before leaving the next day. I really recommend this place to have a country experience
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"First ever review because they are worthy of it. Greatest place, warmest welcome, and perfect get-a-way. Coming back 100%."
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,If you’re in the area. Or even doing something a couple hours away. THIS is the place to stay! Mike and Jenny were AWESOME hosts. Uvalde is a centralized location to lots of places like San Antonio and Fredericksburg. I won’t stay anywhere else. Mike and Jenny have an awesome spot. Fully Stocked. Pool. Horses & Goats. Very nice and comfortable. Feels like home away from home.
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"I wound up at Mike and Jenny's place by accident/good fortune during a difficult week, and it could not have been better luck. It was beautiful, peaceful and having the horses out the back door was a delight. Everything in the cottage was pristine and well-tended and Mike and Jenny were so helpful. Cannot recommend enough for anyone wanting a calming escape in the Uvalde area."
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Mike and Jenny are amazing. The Loft is a must try for a country getaway!
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Stayed here after my hike and it’s so relaxing after a long day for a quiet getaway! Definitely recommend it!
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Mike & Jenny have a wonderful place. The house is located on a beautiful plot of land a few minutes away from downtown Uvalde. The house has all of the necessary appliances one would need for a great meal, along with dual AC which keeps the house very cool, even on the hottest days. The bathroom appears newly remodeled and everything in the home is upscale."
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"The best Airbnb I have stayed in to date. It will be hard to top this one for me. I am coming from a large city, so I started getting concerned because it is in a rural area outside a small town. I got over that rather quickly when I saw how beautiful the scenery is. When I turned into the drive (more like private road to the house) an expanse of hills and green farmland. The home was midway up a hill and Mike greeted me. He and his wife are genuine folks. They made me feel right at home. Mike had me park in the covered parking and gave me a quick tour. The place is a true working farm/ranch. I met their ponies and heard of goats (cuteness overload by the way). The guest house by the pool are the accommodations and top notch, and you have a private patio with access to watch and hang out with the ponies. Most Airbnb’s charge high cleaning fee’s which can double the price per night, and yet I still have to clean them myself after check in. Not to mention they barely want to leave you any clean towels. Both are my biggest complaints of Airbnb. You don’t have to worry about that here. The loft was immaculate and beautifully decorated. By far the cleanest Airbnb I have ever stayed at. The upstairs loft is the bedroom. Very large space with a breathtaking view. Great place to watch the sunset.. What better than to watch ponies during a beautiful sunset. So serene. You also have a pool
right outside your door. If you need an escape from the hectic rat race of life, reconnect with yourself and get some rest than this is the place. Thank you Mike and Jenny for a great experience."
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"A great spot, good views, very cute animals, friendly hosts. The guest house was super spacious and very clean."
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Could not say enough great things about our stay w Jenny and Mike. Such genuine people and gracious hosts. We loved our stay in their country loft. Everything you need cooktop frig all the amenities you need. Walmart 10 min away to pick up groceries. Tv upstairs and bed is super comfy. Oh and after a long day relax in a wonderful massage chair! And animals at your door step. Horses goats and longhorns. Oh and garage parking too. Was one of the best Airbnb stays we have ever had! Thanks Mike and Jenny for everything.
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,I had the best time at Mike & Jenny’s place. They were so accommodating and willing to work with me as a medical student. I had an excellent stay at their place.
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We had an amazing time I loved it. Everything looks exactly like what was advertised definitely recommend for a weekend getaway! We plan on going back soon!

2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We traveled here to check out the area to possibly move and our stay at Mike & Jennys place made the whole trip so enjoyable! It was so peaceful and quite but not far from town when we needed to go out! Would definitely recommend and stay here again 😍

2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This was our second stay the Country Loft. We absolutely love Mike and Jenny’s place! It was so peaceful and relaxing. Mike built a wonderful fire for us and we made s’mores and hot chocolate and gazed at the beautiful stars. We loved feeding the horses and goats! We can’t recommend this stay enough if you are looking for a getaway that lets you be around some lovely animals and even lovelier people (Mike and Jenny).
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Amazing place! Gorgeous house/property. We had the pleasure of meeting both Mike and Jenny and they are both delightful. Getting to feed the animals was an added bonus.
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Jenny and Mike’s place will make you feel right at home. They are such sweet and attentive hosts who put extra effort into making your stay a great one. This stay is one of a kind and a true country experience. Our favorite part was enjoying beautiful sunsets by the pool and feeding the horses. This little home has everything you need and more for a relaxing stay and was perfect for our anniversary getaway. Definitely exceeded our expectations and we hope to be return!
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"We had a wonderful stay at The Country Loft. The hosts Mike and Jenny were friendly and helpful but not intrusive. The house was immaculate and stocked with everything we needed and more. It was great having access to the pool and we enjoyed seeing the horses, cattle, and goats. The owners even provided some carrots for us to give to the friendly horses. We would love to come back next time we are in the area."

2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We had an amazing stay and only wish we had more time to spend enjoying the place! The interior was even more impressive than the photos! Amazing amenities like the electronic fireplace, huge shower, beautiful and modern decor. We were extremely impressed and the hosts are top notch and go above and beyond! Would highly recommend."
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,fantastic place to stay
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Wow! If allowed, that would be my rating for Mike & Jenny's Loft. But since I can't I'm just giving them 5 stars. The loft is easy to get to. The road lead you precisely to your covered garage. The loft is impeccably clean and exceptionally appointed. You will find everything you need to cook in a great stove. We liked the decoration on the south Texas style. Comfy armchairs on the living. Then the swimming pool very near your front door and charcoal and gas grills with tools and charcoal (this is a first) for your use. Then the rear deck for seeing the stars at night or by the one of two fire pits available. Mike and Jenny were very friendly and attentive and we thank them so much for being the perfect hosts. We already want to get back there again and will when we get the chance."

2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Mike and Jenny are the sweetest couple you’ll ever meet. They greeted us upon coming in and Mrs. Jenny gave us a full tour. This airbnb is worth every penny and so much more! The land is beautiful, the house is so beautifully decorated and clean and fully stocked with anything you may need. The pictures actually don’t do it justice. There’s also 3 sweet horses on the property. We’re definitely coming back again. You won’t go wrong booking this Airbnb!"

2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The coach house was very clean, cozy, modern - has everything you need for a comfortable stay. If you want to get away from everyday modern life this place is perfect. Lovely country setting, horses & goats in the paddocks, star-filled nights - idyllic. If you choose this property you will be very happy that you did."
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The best place to stay in the area hands down! We had no issues at all and didn’t even end up using the TV in bedroom as we used our own devices throughout the house. All of our family and friends were jealous of where we got to stay! We will definitely book again!
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Mike and Jenny were incredible hosts. The loft was clean and gorgeous. I think the bedside rugs might have been the softest rugs ever created. We enjoyed feeding the horses, and the baby goats provided unexpected entertainment for us. Mike saved us a world of hassle when I realized I had forgotten the pass to Garner at home. Even at 8:00am he was quick to respond and printed out the ticket without question. We would absolutely stay with Mike and Jenny again in the future!"
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place was absolutely amazing! Extremely peaceful and relaxing, a nice weekend getaway. The loft was super cute and clean. We loved getting to pet and feed the horses and goats. Mike and Jenny are really generous people, we’ll definitely be back."

2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"One of our top favorite airbnb's ever. Our time here was very limited but we were thrilled with the clean, current, high end feel of The Country Loft. These hosts left no stone unturned regarding anything you could want. Such a great place to land between our wildlife/bird guided photography tours at La Lomita. I was hoping to jump into the pool one evening, but we were too tuckered out. However, we enjoyed loving on the horses and goats. Great visit with Mike. If ever in the area again we'll be here, hopefully with more time to relax and enjoy this great guesthouse. Highly recommend!"

2021-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The scenic view will have you forget why you were traveling in the first place. The beautiful horses might not let you pet them but just looking at them is enough. Perfect place to feel cozy in a place that is not your home.
2021-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was the best Airbnb experience we have ever had! The house was perfect and so clean. We enjoyed feeding the horses and goats. It feels like the perfect country experience and is still close enough to a grocery store for great convenience. Mike and Jenny were so hospitable and kind, we felt so welcomed and comfortable. I highly recommend this Airbnb!"
2021-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Mike & Jenny are wonderful hosts. The place is in a rural area, but I never felt unsafe alone. Both Mike & Jenny were always available to help through the app and were super responsive. Being able to feed the horses are definitely a major plus! Loved my stay!"

2021-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Mike & Jenny’s place is absolutely fantastic. We were looking for a nice place for a weekend getaway in the country and we found it! All questions we had were answered quickly and clearly. Upon arrival, we were greeted by Mike. Speaking with him while we fed carrots to the horses was a real pleasure. Mike is a fascinating person and a joy to talk to.
The house was spotless and beautifully designed and built. All of the amenities were top notch. Mike and Jenny’s attention to detail is immediately noticeable.
We stopped by Dziuk’s Meat Market in Castroville (highly recommended) and picked up a few Texas quality ribeye cuts. Mike made sure we had enough mesquite wood for grilling and lit the fire. Nothing like Texas beef cooked over mesquite in the country to make for a good night.
The bathroom was immaculate and exceeded expectations. The shower was spotless and well designed. We spent the rest of the evening in the comfortable classic chairs on the main level playing scrabble and soaking in the Mike and Jenny’s modern-rustic designed home.
The bed was so comfortable we are probably going to replace our mattress at home with the same model! Can’t wait to go back for another enjoyable weekend. Book a stay with confidence. You won’t regret it!"
2021-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Everything about this place is PERFECT! :)

A cozy greeting, sparkling clean space, thoughtful touches of refreshments welcomed us to unwind and recharge. The place was absolutely beautiful, with modern amenities, decor, and comfort. We enjoyed the outside patio lights at night, pool view, and seeing the goats & cattle. Our favorite part was feeding carrots to the horses! We highly recommend staying at Mike & Jenny’s place to enjoy!"
2021-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Lovely country stay. Excellent attention to detail. Would stay again!

Our favorite get away!
So many baby goats to cuddle, horses to feed and as always Jenny and Mike hands down are the kindest people ! Lo loves being with you guys 💕"
2020-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Perfect getaway/staycation spot. It was a great sized space for 2 people and loved having the animals close by. The town doesn’t have many food options during Covid time but luckily there’s a H‑E‑B and full-size kitchen/grill on the property. Wish we could’ve stayed longer!
2020-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We loved our stay at Mike and Jenny's place. It was very clean, nicely decorated and a great setup. They were quick to respond to our questions and made us feel right at home. We would definitely stay here again."

So many thoughtful details--Topo chico, snacks, etc. We also really enjoyed being able to feed the horses and see the goats. Mike & Jenny were very communicative. They gave us our space, but were quick to answer any questions. Would definitely come back again!"
2020-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"There aren't enough stars to properly rate our experience at the Country Loft. Everything was perfect! The location was amazing - we hiked at Lost Maples and it was a quick and beautiful hour drive over there. The house itself was sparkling clean, comfortable, and beautifully appointed. I mean, everything was top notch - from the shower to the bed (super comfy) to the outside spaces and the thoughtful touches (snacks, drinks, and carrots for the horses). Two things stand out even more than the rest - getting to spend time with the horses and goats (there were the most adorable baby goats!) and Mike and Jenny's genuine hospitality. Mike was willing to share some of his extensive knowledge about the area and horses and farming in general, and we learned so much! Jenny is so friendly and funny - had us laughing! We will be back as it was one of our best AirBnB stays ever!!"
2020-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,The Country Loft was such a nice place to stay! So clean and stylish with thoughtful details. Close to town and just minutes from our event.
2020-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Mike & Jenny's place was perfect for our visit to the local parks (Lost Maples, Garner, and Seminole Canyon). It was stylish and clean--perfect for a couple's getaway. Plenty of peace and quiet, but very close to town for shopping and dining. It was so relaxing to sit on the porch watching the sunset and feeding the horses. And we got to see several baby goats while we were there!"
2020-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Mike and Jenny were absolutely great hosts. The space is very clean, cute, and comfortable. We had great conversations with Mike and he is very knowledgeable about the area and gave great recommendations. The horses and goats were fun to pet and watch along with the occasional sightings of deer. We definitely plan on coming back in the future and cannot wait for our next trip out to Uvalde. Highly recommend this as your next hill country getaway!"
2020-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Hands down the BEST airbnb experience!!! Highly recommend and I will be booking again!
2020-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Our 2nd time here and already booked a 3rd before we left. I can’t say enough wonderful things about Mike and Jenny and their hospitality. They go above and beyond. The house has even more personalized touches than just two months ago! It’s a little oasis from life. My daughter had the best time of her life here this weekend. See you guys in December 🥰🥰
2020-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is my second time staying here and it was just as amazing as the first time! Peace and quiet, serene, cozy, accommodating, cute & very homey; awesome farm animals, super clean amenities, crystal clear well kept pool! Awesome antique shops in town Uvalde. I will be a repeat visitor for this place!"
2020-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We love staying at Mike and Jenny's place. It is sparking clean, with thoughtful touches, and the hosts are warm and friendly. We appreciate you sharing your beautiful property with us. It is our favorite air bnb!
You are about an hour from Lost Maples or Garner, practically across the street from Cook's Slough (a nature preserve with a lot of wildlife), or you can feed the horses and goats on property. :) Being nature lovers, we are just as happy having a drink on their patio or walking around on the property.
It's such a nice country getaway with modern home touches."
2020-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Truly a country experience! The house is so clean and cute! Mike and Jenny kept the carrot and corn bin filled so we could feed the horses and goats, loved it! We highly recommend and we look forward to staying there again."

2020-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The loft is so clean and stylish. There are several outdoor areas to sit and enjoy a coffee or a cocktail. There are gas and charcoal grills to use and carrots in the refrigerator for the horses. Watch out the kitchen window, there were deer out there every morning."
2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,This place is heaven. It’s so peaceful and relaxing. The AirBnB is beyond amazing and the fact that Mike built it alll is crazy to me ! Jenny and Mike are so wonderful even after a few texts about ‘animals injured ‘ turns out animals need sleep and relaxation too 😂😂 My daughter had the absolutely best weekend and it felt like she was a kid again after a rough few years! I booked another stay while still there 😊😊
2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"What an amazing place to stay! On top of being wonderful hosts, Mike & Jenny have a lovely space to relax, go to the pool, and hang out with the animals. 10/10 recommend for anyone looking for a sensible retreat or a hub to explore Uvalde."
2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Definitely recommend! Great getaway! Lovely loft.
2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Well gee, where do I start?? This place was incredible. Off the beaten path, super private. Very new and fresh. Spacious. Getting to feed the horses carrots made me SO HAPPY. The bed was super comfy and the shower is huge! The only thing I would change is not having a TV but other than that it was incredible! Can NOT wait to come back!!"
2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Everything is perfect, the view for sunrise/sunset is everything & more, the sweet animals on the property are super precious. Town is close by and if you like cute dainty pictures the Uvalde streets is where to go! Also pack cameras everything is beautiful!"
2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This property is absolutely gorgeous! It's an active ranch and the horses are beautiful and the goats are absolutely adorable. The cabin is pristine clean, very modern and super comfortable and the pool is super clean and very refreshing to be in! I literally booked a second stay for October while I was in the pool! Its very quiet, peaceful & calm. I can't wait for my second stay!! Mike and Jenny really outdid themselves with this wonderful Air Bnb accommodation!"
2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Mike & Jenny's place was amazing, just as described. Mike was there when I arrived and showed me around the place. He was so nice and helpful. The pool was amazing and clean. The horses and goats were so fun to have around. Looking out the window while I washed dishes watching the Axis was so nice. Beautiful view, easy to find. We will be back!"
2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Everything about this Airbnb was great! It’ll be hard to top this one for sure.
2020-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Very clean and SAFE. Almost seemed like we were the first to use it. Comfortable, modern, but with a nice country/ranch flavor. We got to feed the horses and goats. Beautiful watching the sunset in rocking chairs. Also a pool. Hosts are very nice folks. One of the nicest AirBNBs we ever stayed at."
2020-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I am picky, and Mike and Jenny's home exceeded our expectations. This is a gem in southern Texas. The home is so clean with plenty to do, and had so many thoughtful touches. Mike and Jenny are such welcoming hosts. I loved feeding the goats and horses, and my boyfriend and I loved hanging out on our private patio just observing nature. We will be back. 5 out of 5 stars."
2020-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This little loft is too cute & the perfect getaway! We loved the amenities & how friendly the hosts were. We can’t wait to return on our next getaway down south! :)
2020-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Our stay at the country loft was a little slice of heaven. Being around the horses, goats, and deer was such a treat. My favorite part was their pool. The little seats built in made it great for just hanging out and soaking up the sun. And when we inevitably got sunburned the cozy loft was definitely nice to have. Mike gave us a good tip to go visit Chalk Bluff in addition to the Frio and we actually enjoyed it more! Much thanks to Mike and Jenny for providing us a great place to stay and get the most out of our vacation."
2020-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"It was absolutely the perfect getaway out in the country, but still close to town. Very peaceful, and a beautiful place.❤️"
2020-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This place exceeded our expectations 1000%. It's so peaceful and Mike and Jenny made us feel right at home.
This place irradiated so much peace we even enjoyed it more than our visit to the park. Its cozy, clean and beautiful. We look forward to coming back again soon."
2020-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,A home away from home. We had a beautiful relaxing and enjoyable weekend. We look forward to going back as soon as possible.
2020-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This is my favorite place in Uvalde. Mike and Jenny are great and I love coming here. For more of a country experience, this is the place!"
2020-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Mike and Jennys home was lovely and spotless! the horses were so gentle and it was a perfect country experience! They are the nicest people I’ve ever met they were so genuine.
2020-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Mike and Jenny were very welcoming and friendly hosts. The farm stay was amazing and location was just outside of town so getting around was very easy. The loft was very clean and made you feel at home. We had fun swimming in the pool, using the BBQ pit, petting the sweet horses and cute goats. The best part for us was being able to view the stars at night. I definitely recommend staying here if you want to experience a country yet modern getaway."
2020-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great stay at a great place, Mike and Jenny are very respectful and we had an amazing time!"
2020-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Mike and Jenny are great hosts. They do their best to make sure you feel at home, and add a few little touches to give you a country experience. My girlfriend absolutely adored feeding the horses and petting the goats! We’ll definitely be coming back soon!"
2020-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Mike & Jenny were amazing hosts. Their place was spotless and so beautiful. Such a calm and relaxing place to be. Also spending time with their horses was amazing. They are so sweet and gentle. I would recommend this place to anyone wanting a get away! I can’t wait to visit again.
2020-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was the best air bnb my Husband and I have ever stayed at. Mike was so kind and welcoming. The place was beautiful and spotless. I loved the horses, we got to feed them carrots and apples. The turkey was so beautiful and the goats were adorable. This place is about 30 minutes from the frio river so it’s a perfect location if you want to be close enough to the frio but not so close that you have all the traffic and stuff. Main Street is about a 10 minute drive and they have an HEB, Starbucks, ad whataburger, everything a Texas girl needs. I can’t wait to go back again."
2020-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Lovely place and super clean ! Mike & Jenny were amazing . My daughter enjoyed feeding the goats and the horses . Perfect place to get away for a bit . Wish I could've stayed longer.
2020-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We booked this last minute stay and it blew all expectations. The host were very helpful although the app made it difficult for us to communicate they accommodated us with all of the issues the app gave us. The horses are beautiful along with all of the other great personal amenities. The place gives off a modern farm feel peaceful and quaint. Will definitely come back just to enjoy it all over again we didn’t want to leave. 10/10 recommend !!
2020-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"First off, this is a true escape from the city life. Jenny and Mike are incredibly kind and inviting. It almost feels like you are taking over their ranch and they are the guests.
It felt like they did everything in their power to make our stay feel like a home away from home. This is one of those locations where you enjoy running into your hosts because the conversations we had were great.
They have plenty of animals that you can interact with if you’d like.
As far as location, I think it’s just perfect with how far out of town it is (maybe 10 minutes to downtown). Even if you are trying to go to Garner State Park or the Frio, I preferred to stay near Uvalde since there is a little more to do town wise.
We will definitely be coming back when we get the chance.
Thank you Mike and Jenny!"
2020-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Mike and Jenny were absolutely everything you could ask for in a host and more! So attentive and made this place feel like home. Plenty of carrots to feed the horses! They also have goats, some cattle, and a turkey with a lot of character, haha! The home is stunning, felt so cozy, and extremely clean. Mike is extremely friendly and stayed up until 1 AM to help us find this place as we weren’t from the area. If you are questioning if you should book this place...book it. You will not regret it."
2020-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,LOVED everything about this place! The location was perfect: easy to get to and right outside town. The cottage was amazingly clean and stylish. We felt comfortable staying there and would recommend this place without a doubt to anyone considering staying here!

2020-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Mike and Jenny are amazing hosts. The place was exactly as described and super clean. As an added bonus, we got to pet their horses and play some with their goats. Being cold-ish during our stay we were not able to use the pool, but we didn’t expect to and, honestly, it didn’t matter.
The kitchen had all the basics we could need, and even some coffee and bottled water. All in all, we felt like we were home for the weekend.
Thanks!"
2020-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Best Air bnb I have stayed at yet. Great place to get out of the city and relax.

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Austin & Sarah's place was amazing. This was my 2nd time staying at this location and I would absolutely stay there again. Apparently, the clothes dryer went out before my arrival and they were kind enough to offer to pick up my dirty clothes, have them professionally cleaned, and then bring them back to the airbnb. They were super responsive to any communication as well."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,The place was fantastic! A truly special place for us to spend a few days in the area. Loved the decor and peaceful surroundings!

2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This was a very peaceful and enjoyable stay. My team and I were intown for business and preferred not to stay directly in town. This location was perfect and accommodated all of our needs. I definitely would recommend to anyone traveling in the area.

2023-09-01,5.0,Group trip,The accommodations were great and so close to Uvalde too. We have stayed at several other places over the years but this was the best.
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"We really enjoyed our stay. Beautiful surroundings. We loved sitting on the porch at sunset watching the deer, long horned owls etc coming to drink at the water trough at the back of the property.
A/C worked great, was nice to come back to a cool house .
Just a few minutes drive into Uvalde, but feels like a different world when you get to the ranch.
We had a water pump go out during our stay. Austin and Sarah had people out the same evening to get it running. Great helpful hosts."

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Place was perfect. I stayed here on business and it’s really great value. Hotels in Uvalde are expensive due to their high use from border patrol and military. So this house just outside town is great value especially when traveling with multiple people.
Would 100% recommend to anybody."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We loved our stay here! Perfect for a getaway, saw lots of wildlife and spent most of our time on the patio and grill area- perfect for our larger group of 6 w/ kids!"

2023-02-01,5.0,Group trip,"We decided to spend our annual hunting trip (and associated budgets) supporting the folks and businesses of Uvalde - what a fantastic property that served our group perfectly. Close enough to town if we needed something, but far enough away from everything to enjoy the serenity and awesomeness of the great outdoors. All of the positive reviews previously shared are warranted - thank you for having us at War Horse Ranch and hope to return sometime in the future! The ONLY thing we were bummed about was that we never received a visit from the Ranch dog(s), but will look to capture that next time."
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The ranch was very secluded and quiet. Very clean and a great interior with a rustic feel. Easy to stretch out after a long day at work. The weather was great and we sat outside at night and watched the deer and sunset. Awesome place and I’d stay there again if they’d have me.
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,only place I will stay when I go to Uvalde.
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Gorgeous gem in Uvalde!
2023-01-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,"The place is awesome and area was very quiet.
Thats why i rented the house because of location. But there were a few problems, the front lock didn't work to get in so we had to get in the house thru the garage. Every time we left we had to open and close garage door. Second the toilet in main restroom kept running so we would have to take top off and push plunger down so it would fill up. Third we weren't the only tenets in the house, mice invaded the house and the first night we had to throw out our food that we left on the counter. We were watching tv and they would come out and run around the living room. My wife cleaned kitchen and by the morning mouse droppings were all over counter. I know it is country living but there are solutions for this!"
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,I hate to say too many nice things about this property as I may never get it available to rent again. Great house for the Uvalde area and great people to rent from...Alan Jackson

Had plenty of room for the six of us and everything we needed was available. The War Horse Ranch is far enough out of town to make you appreciate the quiet and seclusion it provides but close enough to Uvalde to have access to the local restaurants, grocery stores, and shops. The property exceeded our expectations and we look forward to staying there again in future visits!"

2022-07-01,5.0,Group trip,"This home is absolutely beautiful! It was very clean, comfortable, and exactly what we needed for a weekend getaway to rest. We had plenty of room for the six of us to enjoy resting and having family meals together. This home has nice touches that make it feel like a resort including comfortable beds, beautiful furnishings, and amazing soap and lotion. We had plenty of towels, kitchen supplies, and toiletries for our stay. The house stayed really cool during the day, despite the Texas sun. While visiting, one of our favorite things to do was sit on the front porch watching the wildlife. We saw rabbits, axis deer, whitetail deer, hawks, and birds. The stars at night were amazing. We used stargazer apps to locate constellations, identify planets, and enjoyed the breeze and peace and quiet, all from the front porch. We spent time in Uvalde (about 5 minutes to town) and at Garner State Park (about 40 minutes away) during our trip. Austin & Sarah are great hosts. They were quick to respond to questions and thought out every detail to make our stay incredible. The home is easy to find with the directions they provided. This was an amazing stay. We cannot wait to visit again, and are already planning our next stay!"

The night sky was awesome to add to the mix!"

2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We absolutely loved our stay at the Adobe Lodge! This spot was a perfect getaway- quiet & secluded while also being within a good distance to town to grab things needed for our stay! It was also within good distance to the rivers.

Space! Beds were cozy and everything you may need was provided! The location was quiet, just my family and the stars! We very much needed a refresh/reset before the chaos of school and our stay here delivered! As this was our first time to Uvalde, it was just far enough out of “town” too! We hope to return again soon!"
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We had a very nice visit. We used the house as base for kayaking on the Frio. The house was lovely and Austin and Sarah were great at communicating all through the trip. We really enjoyed watching the deer feed in the evening and watching the stars. We highly recommend!! The house couldn’t have been cleaner and everything was super comfortable.
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Austin & Sarah’s place was spotless. They were also very kind in making adjustments to my reservation. They have clearly laid out any rules or things you need to know about the ranch, so read that carefully. So many cute little touches, you can tell they take a lot of pride in the home. They also had wonderful food recommendations that were perfect for our family. We stayed here and drove 35 minutes to Concan to go to the river and it was a nice easy drive. I would definitely recommend staying here!"
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Let me start with the location. Its really breath taking coming from big city and never having any peace. This is the perfect location to disconect from it all. No noise and just nature at is best. The home was spotless clean. From every room indoors and outdoors. Wal-Mart and Heb down the road. It is so close to everything really. We have never been to Uvalde or the Frio River. This was our first time we spend most of times in Garner park and Chalk Buff Park. We cooked meals and breakfast at the house. Austin and Sarah where amazing in responding to any questions we had. This is definitely and amazing place to stay. Mornings we where greated with deer wich was amazing. If you want to disconect from city this is the place to be. Wish we had more time untill next time.
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Our stay at the Adobe lodge was excellent. Austin and Sarah were very responsive and were great host.
Sitting outside the Adobe lodge and resting was just what we need. Great location and it felt we were transported to a secluded location. A great stay. We’ll be back for sure."
2021-06-01,5.0,Group trip,Beautiful home and property. The house was very clean and the owners are very responsive and attentive. When booking I informed them what the occasions were and they had left us a thoughtful hand written note. The water pressure intermittently leaves something to be desired but otherwise the owner’s pride and care for this property is obviously reflected.
2021-06-01,5.0,Group trip,"I loved it here! It was a breathe of fresh air and then on top of that we had a small disturbance but they were so responsive and handled the job right then and there! Yes, the water pressure wasn’t the best. But booking this house was amazing! I’d refer this to anyone!"
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We had an amazing stay here! Great to disconnect and spend quality time with the family. House was beautiful in & out! Short driver to stores & restaurants. Beautiful Rivers just 45 min drive! Would definitely recommend to stay here!
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This was a super… super fun get away stay with my girlfriends!!! Hosts are awesome and very responsive! House was clean… and my OCD self was impressed! What a fun place!!!! A/C was kicking! Water pressure not so great but we were warned.
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Loved everything
2021-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This place was truly amazing! The property is beautiful, lots of wildlife, and the outdoor setup (grill and fireplace)..... just WOW! The inside was so cozy and unique; it had everything we needed.
The place was sparkling clean, like CLEAN! All the linens - pillows, towels, everything down to the mattress smelled fresh.
The property was so big! Since we have a lifted truck and off road tires, we decided to drive through the trails and saw so much wild life. They have little watering holes everywhere, we saw a Bobcat, deer, ground birds and I think a turkey or some kind of large ground bird, and tons of bunnies.
Host communications were quick and accurate.
We absolutely loved this property and are looking forward to returning in the near future."
2021-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We loved War Horse Lodge. The house was surrounded by nature with the added touch of wildflowers. The setting was so peaceful with no other houses in sight. The house was beautifully decorated. The bed was very comfortable. We hiked in Garner State Park (45 minutes away) and Lost Maple Nature Reserve (1-hour drive). Thanks for sharing your space with us
2021-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Austin & Sarah went above and beyond before we even arrived to the home in Uvalde! Great communicators!

2021-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place. Flexible host. We loved it and would go back at the drop of the hat. The host communicated clearly and everything was ready to go when we arrived. Easy to find and loved the private gate access.
2021-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"What a special place. Artistically decorated with a to-die-for view right out the front door. Beds were so comfortable, linens were lovely too. We enjoyed walking around exploring and even made a fire under the stars on our last evening! Highly recommend!!"
2021-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,If you want to unplug and really appreciate the world around you this is your spot! Hosts are so responsive and helpful. The kind that will definitely put you at ease if you have never used Airbnb and are nervous about staying at some “strangers house”. Austin and Sarah felt like old friends before we even pulled into town. Kids loved the deer on the front lawn before sunrise and the short trek to town made runs feel like no big deal. Will definitely be back!
2021-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Great place! Enjoyed the space and outdoor kiva. River access was a plus too. We did have intermittent water pressure issues that are mentioned in the listing, but it was manageable as the issue would usually resolve itself after a short period of time."
2021-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"The home is very clean, comfortable, and quiet. My family was thrilled to relax from our busy schedules with so many amenities just down the road from the state parks we were visiting. Both of my teenage boys woke up before sunrise to enjoy breakfast outside in the calm and watch the deer. Perfect stay ."
2021-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful home on beautiful land. Definitely enjoyed our stay.
2021-02-01,5.0,Group trip,Awesome property to get away and unwind. Austin and Sarah are great hosts and quick to communicate.

I look forward to staying at the War Horse Ranch again soon!"
2021-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful space! We loved staying here and getting cozy by the fire. The property is great to walk on and perfect distance down to the river to explore. We absolutely loved our time here and can’t wait to come back! Easy driving distance from Austin and felt like we were way out in west Texas without the 8hr drive! The style of the house is a perfect blend of stylish modern and rustic vibes without being too rustic. Water pressure is a bit low but that’s expected for being on a well. Such a great recharge space. Excited to see it in all seasons.
2020-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,This is a great spot for families with young children or even a few couples to get away and spend time on a beautiful ranch. The home was pristine - super clean - and comfortable. The hosts are very communicative and friendly. We would definitely return!
2020-12-01,5.0,Group trip,This place is amazing! The hosts are quick to respond and very thoughtful with the design of their home. This is a perfect getaway for any group but the family stargazing is unmatched! Would definitely recommend.

2020-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Enjoyed my Thanksgiving beautiful ranch

2020-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This place is very quiet and peaceful and it's far from heavily trafficked roads. I saw deer and great sunrises every morning. I highly recommend this place if you're looking for a quiet place to relax.
2020-10-01,5.0,Group trip,Best space to relax and reconnect with nature. Close enough to town if you need it. Styled impeccably and superclean!
2020-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Our family had the most amazing time at the Adobe Lodge! The house and the scenery were just what we needed to recharge. The house house and the surroundings were beautiful and I felt like we were truly able to disconnect. The house was also spotless! We all loved the private river access and it was fun to teach our 5 year-old twins how to fish for the first time. Austin and Sarah were great hosts and there were lots of little extra touches, we really liked listening to the playlist they sent us on our way out to Uvalde. We will for sure be back!"
2020-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Seeing nature’s beauty and the wildlife from the front porch was stunning. It’s always so refreshing to walk into a home that’s sparkling clean. The lodge gave us the secluded feel, but the drive into town was only about 10 minutes. After our 6.5 hour drive to Uvalde, I used Wal-Mart pickup and brought our groceries to the lodge. Make sure to pickup some fresh tortillas, salsa, and chips at H‑E‑B though ;) It’s impossible for my family to travel without a washer and dryer, which was one of the many reasons we chose War Horse Lodge. The washer and dryer were extremely efficient and clean! One of my favorite things about War Horse Lodge was the organic homemade soap provided. Sarah and Austin were very responsive to any questions or concerns we had. I would definitely add Garner State Park as a must see in the area, it was a stunning experience to fish, swim, hike and explore. I would recommend War Horse Lodge to everyone looking to stay in or around Uvalde."
2020-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We were looking for a place to decompress and relax, someplace quiet and secluded but close to town. This was a great home to get just that! The house is absolutely beautiful and was very clean! We enjoyed the variety of wild life (especially the bunnies). We even saw a porcupine! Each morning we enjoyed hikes and playing family games outside. Our hosts gave us great suggestions for eating out, which we enjoyed thoroughly. Hot afternoons were spent indoors playing board games, working puzzles and watching shows on a giant tv. We grilled out at night, but we didn't get to use the kiva (a bit too warm still). Austin & Sarah were wonderful hosts and we were blessed to stay in their amazing home!"
2020-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This is a great place to recharge and enjoy the peace of nature.
2020-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Austin & Sarah’s place was best get away that my family and I had the pleasure of booking with Airbnb. The peacefulness and tranquility of the ranch is the best kind of rest that travelers can ask for. Everything about this place is picture perfect for a peaceful get away. Centrally located from Concan and Uvalde. Everything is as described. Do yourself a favor and book this gem now!
2020-09-01,5.0,Group trip,The home is absolutely beautiful! We really enjoyed getting to fish at the river. Great hospitality and communication. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay and plan to come back next year!
2020-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,House was fantastic as well as the hosts. Highly recommend.
2020-09-01,5.0,Group trip,"This place is so peaceful and quiet, and we got some of the best nights of sleep we've had in a long while! Speaking of nights, I highly recommend for guests who visit to step outside at night with all the exterior lights of the house turned off. It will be dark and you'll be able to see so many stars that can't be seen in the big cities. Seeing so many shooting stars at night was a the highlight of the weekend our city kids. And being 10 minutes from town (with restaurants and grocery stores) made this a wonderful location for a relaxing getaway. We'll definitely return."
2020-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This home is very beautiful, clean, spacious, and was everything I wanted it to be for my family’s getaway. The ranch is Far off into the country where you’re surrounded by amazing wildlife and acres of land but only 10 mins from local stores and restaurants. We really enjoyed hanging out in the patio alongside the kiva and stargazing at night. Hosts were very friendly, responded quickly and were helpful and ready to assist in anything we needed. Definitely recommending this home and looking forward to visiting again!"
2020-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,10/10 would stay again! Austin and Sarah are great!
2020-08-01,5.0,Group trip,"We LOVED our stay at the Adobe Lodge. Austin & Sarah were AMAZING I can’t believe they’re not superhosts! The home was very clean, the beds were super comfy and the location was great! My group especially enjoyed using the kiva & grill for outdoor cooking. The private river access was a neat spot. We loved seeing all the wildlife as well. We will definitely be back!"
2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Home is beautiful! Sarah and Austin were great host.
2020-08-01,5.0,Group trip,This beautiful home is so comfortable and spacious. Loved the natural design all throughout the house. The pictures online don’t do it justice. Everything we needed was provided. The surrounding area is so peaceful and tranquil. We got to see deer feeding nearby in the morning and evening. The river area was beautiful. If you want to get away and relax this is the place to stay.
2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"What a beautiful place! Pictures don’t do it justice! The house was immaculately clean. We felt pampered with fluffy towels, crisp linens and almost spa-like scents in the air. It is obvious that Sarah and Austin have put great thought and care into making guests feel welcome and taken care of! It is a beautiful location bordered by the river where there is a pristine (private) spring fed water hole to relax, swim or even fish. The kiva is a beautiful space as well! We drank coffee and watched the sun come up every morning. In the evening we watched the deer, rabbits, birds and other wildlife while enjoying the breeze! I can’t wait to visit again when the weather is cooler so we can build a fire! It was perfect! Only 10 minutes from town and 30 minutes from Concan (if you like crowds) and yet we felt totally secluded and shielded from the outside world!
Thank you Sarah and Austin! Hope to see you again soon!"
2020-07-01,2.0,Group trip,"The house is cute and clean however there is no dryer, little too nonexistent water pressure also the owners creep up on you whenever they feel the need they have a shed in the back that they just pull up into which is about 100 feet from the main house which is very creepy being that they don’t give you the privacy promised in their waver."
2020-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Awesome place to stay. Very beautiful home.
2020-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Austin and Sarah are wonderful hosts who put a lot of thought and care into Adobe Lodge. The pictures and description do not do this place justice. Situated just outside of Uvalde on a delightfully rural ranch, Adobe Lodge offers the best of both worlds: modern convenience and natural, west Texas beauty. Clean and comfortable, gorgeously appointed, with sprawling natural landscapes and abundant wildlife, Adobe Lodge exceeded our expectations. It's close enough to town to pick up groceries and only half an hour away from Garner State Park. Enjoy a lovely sunrise while drinking a cup of coffee in the quaint courtyard garden in the morning while rabbits scamper in the yard and birds sing, then end the day with a tall glass of cold, sweet tea while the moon comes up and resident deer graze yards away from the front porch. Adobe Lodge is spectacular and we cannot wait to go back!"
2020-06-01,5.0,Group trip,What an adorable boho place!!! Loved the vibe/decor. Open spaces make you feel like you a thousand miles away from civilization but you are only 10 mins from town! The space was super clean and was perfect for our weekend getaway to garner! This is a true gem!! We will definitely be back!
2020-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Beautiful Adobe Home with everything you need!
2020-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Beautiful place to hang out and enjoy the country. Place made me feel right at home. Place was super clean and AC is perfect!
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Cute home. Just what we needed for the events we attended, centrally located. Definitely will stay there again. 🤗"
2024-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very cozy stay and in a great location(close to restaurants. Very peaceful stay.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Dear Kaytlyn, your accommodation is in a nice location with its own parking lot and garden. The only negative review here on Airbnb is the roosters, but the first one didn't crow for us until 11 am. I found it cute rather than annoying. You put a lot of effort into the table setting and have a very well equipped bathroom (and also a kitchen, but we only used the fridge for water and coke). In Uvalde we got everything we needed at the H-E-B nearby."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,K's Cozy stay really was cozy.
2024-03-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,Great cozy place

2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"The house was located by a lot of restaurants and gas stations / grocery stores.
It was very cozy and lots of utensils.
Nicely decorated with coffee station.
The renter responded immediately and friendly."
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great little house! Met our needs perfectly. Would definitely stay again and would highly recommend to others.
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The place is really cute. We were expecting a one bedroom and not a studio with a pull out couch though. The studio had really cute decor and if you have small children there are some games and books to keep children occupied. Loved the coffee bar and the ""Tourist book"". The one and only reason I didn't leave a 5 star rating is that the place is surrounded by Roosters that start crowing at 3 am and we stayed on the weekend and the neighbors blasted music that started at 10pm and ended at 4am and ran their motors super loud. I understand this is out of the hosts hands. Even with that being said, I would stay here again in the future."
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"Kaytlyn’s place was cozy and comfortable.
She left treats for us which was very thoughtful. Had everything we needed,"
2024-01-01,2.0,Stayed one night,Hard time getting host to respond. No instructions on how to get in the house. TV wouldn’t work just not a place I would recommend..
2024-01-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"Great small place to stay while in town. I did like the small things they had at this Airbnb: qtips, snacks, hair straightener and milk chocolate K-cups (so my kid could have something hot). The place mostly stayed warmed and cozy in the cold weather."
2024-01-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"A nice place to stay overnight, had a similar experience as another review with the neighbors rooster and dogs barking waking us up early in the morning. Place was clean and the snacks were nice, the bed was comfortable. I would recommend still bringing your own soaps as the body soap listed was not stocked by housekeeping before our stay."
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great cozy cottage like studio home. Perfect location and space for our stay.
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Went back home to visit family for 1 day and the place was comparable in price to a hotel but way more comfortable. Would definitely stay again.
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Awesome little house, exactly what I needed."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,I’d stay again. Perfect home to get away from the busyness of San Antonio. Quiet and remote enough to relax but close enough for good food.
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Kaytlyn was very responsive. We had an issue with the shower knob and it was handled immediately.
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Kaytlyn’s place was definitely cozy! Had everything we needed. Nice touches of providing snacks and bath necessities in case something was forgotten.
Really close to Main St where you can find all the stores and restaurants the town offers.
Sunrise Restaurant is a must if you are looking for good food! Doesn’t look much on the outside, but great service and food! Reasonable prices to boot!"
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Nice house with great value.
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Very comfortable, very pleasant place to stay. When I had questions on site, Kaytlyn was extremely responsive. A small warning: There are roosters across the street. So if you plan to sleep past sunrise (as I did), this may not be the place for you! ;-) Otherwise, highly recommended."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Beautiful home, felt very comfortable!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,perfect place to stay!

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Absolutely impressed! Lilly’s place is safe and pristine! It is extremely clean and well stocked and maintained. When you walk in you can smell and feel how clean it is. Each room had extra amenities from the utensils to the kitchen to the extra towels in the bathroom. There are also extra blankets, robes, and light fixtures. I appreciate this bc I prefer dim lighting. The outside space is relaxing and spacious. This is the most comfortable, clean, and impressive place I have stayed at. I felt as though I was staying at a luxurious bungalow. I had a restful sleep which is rare when I travel. I was impressed with the extra privacy; curtains for the back door and the front translucent windows. This place is decorated with warm and welcoming decor. Every guest comfort and need is reflected in the decor, ambience, and amenity. My only regret is I didn’t stay longer! I’ll book here in the summer for sure!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Sunny Days was absolutely wonderful. Lilly was very responsive to our question even before we booked the stay.
The decor was lovely and the cottage was very cozy. The coffee bar was such a nice treat and the ice maker was full. Amenities were first class and bed/mattress was very comfortable. We visited family so we didn’t use the kitchen but I saw it was well stocked. It was a great experience! I hope to visit again. Thank you Lilly for sharing your cottage."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Nice place. Nice memories.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Lilly should offer a hospitality masterclass. The decor was fun. It was spotless. Everything worked. No chores. Lots of hot water (you’d be surprised how uncommon that can be). She thought of pretty much everything. Amazing stay.
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Second time staying here and this is our favorite go too! We were welcomed with a sweet Easter basket in spirit of the holiday! This place is charming, peaceful and thoughtfully done!"

2024-03-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Good location, great bathroom space. Super comfy bed. Very clean, nice and comfy.
Make sure to look closely for the amenities you are going to need, the place might not have those things.
The place is located behind a business, so be on the lookout for that when getting there.
Downside: when you open the main door people from the parking lot in front are able to see straight to the inside, all the way to the bed. That was a little off.
Other than that, it was really good."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,I absolutely LOVE this little casita - I have stayed before so I knew what to expect - perfection 👌 ⭐️

Jennifer called to make sure I had everything I needed and made herself available just in case. Will definitely book again."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Our overnight stay was great. Small space but very comfortable. Had everything you needed or wanted. This place put the “ita” in Casita. But like I said was very comfortable and a great value. Jennifer had lots of extra touches not commonly found. Wife loved the bath products. Would definitely recommend Casita Modesta.

The accommodations were very clean and comfortable. The location in downtown Uvalde was extremely convenient to restaurants and shopping."

When we first checked in, we noticed a stain on the comforter. Jennifer was extremely fast and responsive and changed the whole bedding with a brand new set. She was super quick in response and was a wonderful host. 10/10 would definitely stay again! The place was so cute and next door is a fun bar that opens late ($4 and $5 cocktails specials!)"

2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Location , location , LOCATION!! I loved being at a walking distance from many shops ,and restaurants. I will say, at night during the weekends you can hear some vehicles making extra noise ,but it personally wasn’t a bother for me.

2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Wow. This place was amazing. Very close to the town square (You can see it from the window), but hidden away so you have your privacy. Inside and out, this tiny home was beautiful! The linens were clean and comfortable. The shower was amazing. I loved the towels they had so much I ordered a set of my own before I left. The snacks and coffee were great, also the selection of bathroom toiletries if you forgot something was spot on. The space is small but everything is curated perfectly. Wish I had more time to enjoy this space, but next time I'm in Uvalde this will definitely be the place I stay at. I can easily say Jennifer truly cares that you have a great stay, and we did!"

The room smelt amazing! The linens and Queen bed were comfortable. Towels were high quality. AC was super quiet and blew super cold. Beautiful shower! WiFi, TV, Microwave, Coffee Maker, fridge, and sink. We loved the decor! They did a really good job with this place and it can't be beat. There is great parking right in front of the Casita and if you are pulling a trailer or extra vehicle there is a public parking lot right behind the site. The host was super friendly and very responsive, giving us local restaurant recommendations and making sure we were as comfortable as possible. Host gave us complimentary snacks, drinks, and a nice personal note. Check in and check out was also super easy. We will stay here next time we are in the area. I would recommend you choose this place over any local hotel."
,,,"We didn’t get to stay at this place as it was somehow double-booked. It was quite disappointing as we made a 4+ hr drive to get there and found out someone else was already staying there. Marco did however give us the option of staying in another one of his properties, which was in the back but it was a lot smaller (not a full kitchen/oven, much smaller refrigerator, water seeped in when it rained that night), than what we had originally booked. The least he could do was to reimburse after the experience we had, but we haven’t heard anything yet."
