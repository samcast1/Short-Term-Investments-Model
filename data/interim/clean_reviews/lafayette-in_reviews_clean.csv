Cathryn was responsive in a timely manner and extremely cooperative. Cannot complain of anything whatsoever!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This home was so nice! Very clean, homey, & had the cutest decor! Will definitely be going back."
2024-06-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"Everything was pretty good during our stay! It was pretty well cleaned and layout was nice, easy to find, and instructions were clear on getting in. Very cute place!! The only thing bothersome was odd stains on the mattresses (I check the mattresses *everywhere* I go for bedbugs etc) and there were also ants and other bugs, primarily in the bathroom, however it seems to be an older home so that just comes with the territory! Our stay wasn’t long as we were just passing through, but it is close to a lot of places to eat and a comfortable place. Overall Cathryn was very proactive in reaching out, communicated well, and her place was nice! Thanks for a great stay!"
2024-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This property was nothing short of amazing!!! Cathryn furnishes the entire home with Myers products (body wash, shampoo and conditioner, laundry soap, cleaning supplies and so much more!!! The home is beautiful on both the outside and inside! I like how Cathryn had dolls, books, games, coffee, sausage biscuits and PLENTY of large bath towels. The home was tucked back in a quite neighborhood that was quite and safe for my kids. I feel this house was perfect for my family of 6!! We had plenty of room and space. While in Indiana I attended my graduation at purdue, this property was the perfect distance from the college. My teens walked to a beautiful park and were able to fish. They caught a bunch of bass and blue gill. Indiana had a large selection of restaurants and attractions to keep us busy.
I highly recommend this property if looking to stay in the area. If anything was needed or had a q on recommendations, Cathyrine was a message away!! Let me add she is kind!! Enjoy Indiana ♡"

The book library was outstanding - great idea! I picked a couple random books and also got some reading In during my stay!"

The listing is exactly as pictured with tons of space and a beautiful kitchen. Wish we could’ve stayed longer!
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful home. Clean, neat, and quiet. The host is very responsive and kind. Had a late flight, and the host allowed a late checkout, early check-in, as well if I needed. Very close to Purdue, which was the reason why we were there!

2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"This was by far the best Airbnb I've ever stayed at. Cathryn was a phenomenal host and took care of even the smallest details. My husband and I just moved across the country and this was the stopping point to rest overnight before hitting the road for a second day. We had our 3 pets in tow and knew we couldn't swing a hotel with our dog. Cathryn had everything we needed so we didn't have to unpack the vehicles to find our stuff - toothbrush/toothpaste, makeup remover, etc. The beds and linens were so comfortable. We truly could not have found a better place to rest for a few hours during one of the most stressful times of our lives!"

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Cathryn is an amazing host! We had everything we needed for our stay, plus she had a lot of personal touches in the house that made us feel, cozy and well worth the great price that she offers for this property. Plus, the yard is huge for the area in town, and was very quiet and private."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Absolute beautiful place! We appreciated the responsiveness and simplicity that was provided by the host.

2023-10-01,5.0,Group trip,This was the best airbnb we have ever stayed in! Super nice neighborhood on a cul-de-sac that was easy to find. Cathryn was accomodating and kind.

She went out of her way to make our stay a wonderful one. Highly recommend this place!!
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Couldn’t have stayed at a nicer place! Everything was perfect, we will for sure be back. Caitlyn was excellent too."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Cathryn was super responsive and gave us a flexible check in! The space was clean and tidy with a nice touch of Fall decor. Prices were inflated compared to other times of the year but understandable since it was a Purdue home game. We will be back!
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This was the perfect home for our stay. Can’t say enough positive things-
2023-09-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Had a great stay - comfortable place! Very nice decor.
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"The place was awesome. Getting this much space, with the finishes, for this price is a great value! It was located near restaurants and grocery stores, which was very convenient. Yet, it was very secluded, making it very peaceful. If I ever have a long trip again, I’ll make sure to make a pit stop here!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"I want to keep this place as my little secret hideaway! Catherine was a suburb host, and her house is so beautiful and relaxing. It is very clean and modern. Catherine answered any question I had and suggested great restaurants. My son was having some issues adjusting to college and just needed his grandma and mom to visit. We had the best time and was exactly what he/we needed. I can't say enough about this house...other than I will hate for others to find out about it and take up her available dates!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Cathryn was a gracious host. She let us check in early upon request which was really helpful.
We stayed here for 5nights. The place felt very calm and peaceful with all white decor and linen. Our stay was super comfortable.
She made sure we had everything we needed. We couldn't find a toaster in the kitchen, so just checked with her to ask were it was. She left a new toaster still in the box on the porch within an hour. Which was really impressive.
We had an issue with dry...but she made sure it got fixed during our stay. She was ready to offer laundry services for free till time the drier didn't work, but we thought of waiting for it to get fixed instead.
The back side patio is a beautiful place to sit and watch birds in morning and hangout with family in evening. But we couldn't do any of this as it was too hot during our stay. Maybe next time we visit.
We would definitely recommend and visit this place again."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We enjoyed our stay. Very comfortable.
Will be back. Thank you"

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This is a bright and cheerful, well appointed 2 bedroom home, that oozes serenity and charm. The neutral decor is stylish and soothing , with pristine bathrooms and linens. This is an ideal home for a gathering with its open plan living area, well appointed kitchen and appliances and separate laundry. There are plenty of games and books available for guests to use. The outdoor surroundings are calm and very private and well furnished on both front and back patios. The location is central, being 3-4 miles to downtown Lafayette and the Purdue campus.
Our stay was comfortable and pleasant, well worth the value. Cathryn is a friendly and efficient hostess. We can highly recommend this cottage in Lafayette, Indiana."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Wow! What a beautiful place to stay! Jessica’s place is located in a wonderful, well-kept, peaceful neighborhood. The house was perfect for our group! Jessica responded quickly when I texted, and was very gracious. Definitely will come back!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The Highland Park Cottage had everything we needed and more, was so clean and cozy, and was in the perfect little neighborhood.

2024-06-01,5.0,Group trip,"Came to town for my son’s graduation at Purdue University. This place is a home away from home in a very nice safe and friendly neighborhood.
One of the best Air Bnbs we’ve stayed at. She is an awesome host. Highly recommend and would definitely stay here again. Also took only 5 mins to get to the Purdue baseball field. Close to everything. Beds were comfy. We all slept great."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great AirBnb in a nice neighborhood in Lafayette. House was well stocked with all the basics, was clean, and was well cared for. The bedroom downstairs had a king bed - the two bedrooms upstairs were small, with queen beds (and then a nice bathroom with tub between them). Owners were very responsive. We would definitely recommend if you are in town to visit Purdue."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We loved this place the minute we walked into it! Updated historical home with an amazing kitchen; large downstairs bathroom with huge walk-in shower; comfy beds; beautiful and original wooden floors; very nicely updated. What a treasure to find! Wonderful touches from the snacks in the kitchen to the extra towels bundled in the bathrooms. We were in town for a family gathering, and this allowed two families to stay in full comfort. Off street parking was nice, but the quiet neighborhood hardly had any traffic. Easy access from main streets and yet quiet setting in historical neighborhood."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place!
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This home was exactly what we needed to accommodate all of our needs while we were away for a conference.
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"We love refurbished 1930s houses in the older, well maintained neighborhoods of Lafayette and this home is a perfect example of one. The house is bright and fresh and has all the things you need for an extended stay- a beautiful kitchen with new appliances, 1.5 bathrooms and a perfect sized laundry center. The house was clean and comfortable, nicely decorated and the location was perfect for driving to downtown as well as walking to the local park. Connor was timely in his responses and attentive to our requests. We would definitely stay in this home again."

2024-03-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,The beds were so comfy and the kitchen was beautiful only thing I didn’t like was the floors were dirty so my kids ended up with their clothes being dirty from being on the floor and the dining room table was really wobbly.

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Jason had a roof issue with first Air BNB booking. He could of just put us in that Air BNB or just cancelled our reservation. Instead He moved our reservation across the street to a just remodeled place to make it hassle free for us, while they put a whole new roof on the place across the street. Stuff happens. It is how the host deals with it that matters. The sign of a great host is how they deal with problems should they arise.
Thanks, Jason"
2024-06-01,5.0,Group trip,"Jason was extremely accommodating. I had a few unexpected changes and he was there to make sure I was able to stay an extra night and have a late check out due to delayed flight.
The home is very spacious and has everything you need for a large family.

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,A peaceful place to stay. I would stay again. Thanks!
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Claire was a great host. I was up very early the day I flew in and crashed early. There was tremendous effort put into being quiet while I was sleeping. They didn’t have to do that and went the extra mile to be quiet so I could get a good sleep.That was very kind😌
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Absolutely the same as in the photo. Choose it, you won't be sad. Claire and her boyfriend are very good people. Home room, air bnb, wonderfully quiet, comfortable. Clean, decent house. Decent street, location. If we have to come again, it will be our first choice. Thanks a lot."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Easy to find and use street parking in this quiet street. Responsive host and answered every time I texted. She was home but I couldn't even hear her during the whole stay. Overall excellent host and nice private space to stay.

2024-05-01,3.0,Stayed with kids,"I booked this place based on previous reviews and from the description listed - it sounded like a great place to stay. I am not a high maintenance individual but I expect basic cleanliness and function. The water ran brown at first. Had to run all facets for a good 15 minutes before the water would run clean. There was a towel that looked to have had old blood stains on it. The exhaust fan was caked with dust. The shower was leaking into the basement. The paint was peeling on the bathroom ceiling and on the bedroom door. Every door handle was loose. The bathroom door doesn’t close all the way. There is a smoke smell from the duplex neighbor smoking and sharing walls. The vents had dust, dirt and previous crumbs of food from past stays. I contacted the owner and made him aware. We canceled our stay and left early. I hope he takes my concerns and fixes the problems for future visitors. I will say, check in was easy enough and previous to staying, Burt communicated just fine."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Comfortable quiet place in eastern Lafayette. Appreciated the personal touches like the welcome sign, some small toiletries in case you forgot something, and some welcome amenities that made us feel welcome.

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My husband and I are seniors. We brought folding camping chairs and enjoyed sitting on the front porch. The furniture is comfortable but sits low and without arms makes it a bit difficult to get out of. My husband really enjoyed the bite sized candy in Burt has in the kitchen. Cooking was easy. I made dinner and breakfast (over easy eggs). He has everything you need and the pans didn’t stick. Beds are very firm but we were comfortable. I would stay here again and recommend it.

Very easy instructions for getting inside! You could have literally eaten off the floor! We did not use the kitchen for meals as we didn’t arrive until late at night but it was well equipped had we needed to. Fridge and stove were unbelievably clean. Bathroom has the basics and more just in case you forgot something! Living room furniture was very comfy although at first glance we didn’t think they would be! Main tv had many options and there were also TVs in bedrooms! Beds were super comfy! Air worked very well! Shower was hot! Unit is newly remolded! It was very easy to find and in a nice neighborhood but yet also close enough to many places to eat! Very clear instructions given in the guest book! We definitely give this place not just 5 stars, but 10! We have stayed in many Air B and B’s and this place BLEW US AWAY!!!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"10/10 for Burt. Very clean stay. I almost felt bad using the bathrooms because I didn’t want to sully it with my presence. Burt put a lot of effort into having little touches of comfort and home, I forgot my tooth brush, Burt took care of me. It was unseasonably hot and the unit was initially warmer than was comfortable, Burt took care of me.
Bed was soft and sheets were clean.
Area is a safe residential neighborhood with tree covered side walks for a decompressing afternoon stroll. However, the neighbor wouldn’t let me pet his dog so fuck that guy. I’m sure if I had asked Burt would have brought over and emotional support puppy.
Very enjoyable stay, I would comfortable with my elderly mom staying there because I know Burt would take care of her."

2021-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I actually live in Lafayette, but I needed a quiet place to work on a complex creative writing project ... somewhere I could be away from the interruptions and distractions of home but somewhere still comfortable, quiet, and safe. This cute little (but certainly spacious enough) home was the perfect place. Though I went home each night to sleep (to be with my pets and my elderly mother), I'm sure I would have been comfortable if I had chosen to stay overnight. The house is exactly as it appears in the photos. It's very clean, has spacious rooms, and is in a lovely historic neighborhood. I felt completely safe coming and going early in the morning and late in the evening. I didn't encounter any problems. The communication I had with Nicole was pleasant, and she always responded right away. There are good instructions in the home where you need them (just things like how to work the thermostat, etc. -- nothing difficult, but it's nice to have clear instructions anyway). The kitchen is well stocked with dishes, pans, appliances, and some basics like flour, sugar, oil, and spices. The sunroom is a nice addition, and there's also a nice area between the house and the garage where I sat outside to eat lunch and enjoy the springtime weather. Lots of lovely flowers around the perimeter of the property as well. If you're thinking of booking this place, don't hesitate. It's everything it appears to be and more."

2018-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Already had great reviews some were expecting a wonderful place but on arrival and during our stay it was even better than expected!
2018-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This is truly the summit of Airbnb comfort and quality, in a setting full of charm and character. Our best experience ever! We could have stayed for many more days enjoying the peace, the surroundings, the atmosphere. Very highly recommended."
2018-07-01,4.0,Stayed one night,Great clean home
2018-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"To us, this is the Ideal House. Nicole has achieved the perfect balance. Pristine, with gleaming honey-colored wooden floors... yet comfortably homey. A beautifully equipped kitchen... & fridge immaculate & empty. Listening to music on the Bose radio & looking out the kitchen window at the brick house with flower garden & birdbath next door, I noticed a path between the houses, followed it & found a fawn looking up at me. A neighborhood of looping, quiet, tree-lined streets. We much enjoyed the sunporch, & also the shady front porch. Weather was in the 90s, but the house was perfectly cool. An oasis. An easy walk to downtown, or a few minutes drive from Purdue or anywhere else around Lafayette. Nicole was super-responsive. Every aspect of this house is A+++."
2018-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This home is in a world apart, but close to everything that you would go to Lafayette for. The living space was light and airy, and the home is very well equipped. I'll look for this place on any future trips to Lafayette."
2018-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"So well and thoughtfully stocked that one almost feels like it's one's own home. Very clean, beautiful spaces throughout, including a great sunroom and front porch. Located in a quiet and lovely neighborhood. Highly recommended!"
2018-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The house is very spacious, clean, easy to find. And Nicole basically has everything prepared already, especially the cookware:) And she is always easy to reach out when we need help. Highly recommend!"
2018-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Nicole’s house is amazing. Everything we need can be found easily. Clean and quite. Only five minutes drive to Purdue. Our family had two wonderful day!
2018-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Extremely clean and comfortable. The neighborhood is beautiful, quiet, and safe. Highly recommend :)"
2018-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Nicole and Doug’s place is in a historic area close to downtown and not too far from Purdue . We gave them short notice and they were very accommodating. I was totally stoked when we pulled up and saw the adorable glassed in sitting area out back with a view of a gorgeous wooded lot alongside a historic walking bridge . The house is whistle clean with upscale touches like Ralph Lauren sheets , beautiful soaps , Keurig coffee, and Bose speakers that sound amazing . Almost every Neighbor is out walking a dog or “porch sitting “. Doug was kind enough to bring me his dogs Greta and Frieda for the day and we joined in the fun with amazing walks throughout the vintage homes . LOVED it !"
2018-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,It was awesome. House is pretty and hosts are very friendly. We arrived late about 1 hour. The host still waited for us and showed us around the house. 5 star!
2018-04-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"We stayed one week, and loved our stay! Everything is clean and well organized, and Nicole and Doug were very welcoming and easy to deal with. It's a great neighorhood, and we hope to stay there again some time. Thanks Nicole and Doug!"
2018-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"The place looked exactly like the photos. The home was clean and the beds were comfortable. Internet speed and connectivity was good. Limited cable options, but you can easily stream videos if you have Netflix. The kitchen was stocked appropriately with plates, dishes, etc. The bathroom is beautiful and the shower/water has good pressure and temperature. Nicole was very friendly and offered to be available if we had any needs. We didn’t use the sunroom much since it was colder outside, but I imagine it is a great place to relax when it is a bit warmer outside. Overall, a beautiful home!"
2018-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Everything was great!
2018-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"A quiet and historic neighborhood, and a beautiful, spacious house. It was icy when we arrived and Nicole had shoveled and put down salt in the driveway. The house had all the amenities we wanted and had a really cozy back room that we loved spending our evenings in. The beds were super comfy and the shower was great -- two very important features when you're away from home!"
2018-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Nicole was a great host! She responded quickly to my messages and her house was in perfect condition! Would definitely recommend staying here!
2018-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Nicole and Doug were great hosts! They were very responsive and provided lots of great information on the area. The house was adorable (we loved spending time in the screened in patio) and is located in a charming neighborhood. Highly recommend and will definitely look to stay here the next time I am in Lafayette.
2018-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Nicole's house was very stylish and sparkling clean! It had a lot of kitchen supplies for us to use during our stay as well as drinks (such as coffee, tea, soda, water, etc) and other condiments to go with any meal we might have wanted to make. It was definitely worth the price, and we will be staying in her home if it's available next time we visit!"
2018-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Nicole is a fantastic host. Thanks to a nice winter storm, our arrival was delayed, but Nicole had clear and easy checkin instructions for us. And a shoveled driveway to boot (thoughtful touch)! The house itself was beautiful with lovely pine floors and an immaculate bathroom. We walked into a warm home with cookies, a nice tip about a local cafe, and an eclectic mix of coffee table books. Great touches that really enhanced an already comfy experience. Not sure when we’ll be in Lafayette next, but will hope that this place is available again then!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great lodging and very reasonable price! The house was clean and very comfortable. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay. Thank you!
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"I recently stayed at the Downtown Abbey and had an exceptional experience! This stylish home, located in the heart of Lafayette, IN, provided the perfect blend of modern amenities and urban charm. The host, Dennis, was incredibly accommodating, ensuring a seamless check-in process and an amazing location.
Being downtown meant we were within walking distance of numerous restaurants, cafes, and shops. The vibrant nightlife and cultural attractions, including theaters and art galleries, were just steps away, making it easy to immerse ourselves in the local scene.
The convenience of having on-site parking was a huge plus, and the Wi-Fi was fast and reliable, which was essential for both work and leisure. Dennis provided thoughtful touches like complimentary snacks and beverages.
Overall, our stay at the Downtown Abbey was fantastic. The combination of a great location, stylish and comfortable accommodations, and excellent host hospitality made for a memorable visit. Highly recommend!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We were looking for a place to stay within walking distance of downtown Lafayette, to take full advantage of great restaurants and the farmers' market. Downtown Abbey was just this! It is about a 6 minute walk from downtown, located in a quiet historic neighborhood with some amazing architecture, and the space itself was outfitted with everything we needed. The hosts have really put a lot of thought into creating a space for a diversity of travelers. The kitchen especially was well stocked and organized. The hosts were VERY responsive through the messaging option. We would definitely stay in this home again!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Meticulously kept home. Great location near downtown Lafayette and less than a $5 Uber ride from Purdue campus and downtown West Lafayette. Parking was convenient. Great place to stay. We will be back!
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay. Quiet neighborhood. Parking in back was a bonus. Spacious bedrooms with comfortable beds. Stairs are indeed steep but our grandmas managed them ok with the help of the railing. Large, clean kitchen with 2 types of coffee machines and snacks. While there was not a living room, we were able to use the indoor/outdoor table and chairs to sit outside and enjoy the peaceful, beautiful garden in the morning and late afternoon."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We loved the house, and really appreciated the cleanness and the charm. It is an old house beautifully renovated. You get the feeling but not the rust. Soon after arrival it felt like home.
The rooms are big and the beds are comfortable. Everything was clean, the appliances are working well.
It is carefully furnished, with just the perfect amount of matching furniture to make the atmosphere perfect. We enjoyed the strange shapes that comes from the floor plan, all the small details and ideas. The bathroom was just enough high for us. The kitchen is downstairs and the bathroom is upstairs, but it is ok.
The trees around the house are beautiful and it has a nice garden too, almost feels like living in a park. The neighborhood felt safe and we wished had more time to walk and explore.
We got very clear instructions, there are even tags on the cupboards. Check in and out was easy and fast. We got fast and nice answers.
If we can, we definitely will come back! Thank you!"
2024-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"It is a lovingly furnished house where every corner was well used. For me with a height of 1.65 m, everything was relaxed - taller people probably have to duck in front of the bathroom sink. The residential area is quiet and quiet I walk about 30 minutes from here to Purdue University every morning. There are also free connector buses from downtown, then you're a little faster. If you come with a roller suitcase, it should be a bit more robust (I preferred to lift my old roller suitcase a bit), because the street or sidewalk to the house is bumpy in places. Of course, this is not Dennis' fault - it's just a tip for future guests.
If someone comes with children, they will surely love the muggy spaces. However, children should be old and responsible enough not to spill liquids on the wood.
The communication was great, and the price was great too!"
2024-04-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"The house is nicely kept and was clean. I was surprised there was no living room area(but to be fair it is the last line in the listing that I missed) but I do feel it should be highlighted better, there is no tv, and just a cafe table and chairs in the kitchen for dining, it's otherwise just kitchen and bedrooms. Other item that was a bit unfortunate is that the windows were not operational for opening, and it got very hot and humid during our visit, we did not see a thermostat to turn on central air, and also no ceiling fans, or stand alone fans.. it got very stuffy in the house and was hard to sleep. Also, the parking in back is off an alleyway that was extremely narrow and the branches scraped down both sides of my vehicle.
It's a nice place to stay if you will be spending all your time out and about."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place is very close to the downtown area and a short drive from the University of Purdue. Despite the proximity to the downtown, the area is very quiet and private. The check-in in process was straight forward with clear instructions. In fact there is also a private, little parking area for the Airbnb guests. The home is a cute and quaint space. I enjoyed the kitchen space as there were pots and pans for cooking, seasonings, and available breakfast snacks. The space is clean overall, although I did notice some of the pillow throws had mild stains on them. Be careful if you are taller since there are low-rise ceilings and overhangs in corner spaces. It would be helpful to have rugs along the stairs since I found myself almost slipping couple of times."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Great place for spend few days, over all if you come with family, very easy parking and very close to main amenities and restaurants in town."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This is a great spot to stay when visiting a Purdue student or just exploring Lafayette! A cozy space with the perfect weekend amenities and the vintage charm of an older home while remaining immaculately clean!
2024-04-01,4.0,Stayed about a week,"The place is comfortable and Dennis was very responsive. As a woman staying alone I didn’t always feel 100% safe. Some of the neighboring houses, including the one next door, were a bit iffy."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Very quiet neighborhood. Close to Purdue University. Crystal clear instructions.
2024-03-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,it's a single house converted into two BNB's so there are a few locked doors (like the basement) that make you feel like you're being watched.. but overall a nice home base.
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great deal. Dennis was super communicative and flexible with our late check in. Would stay here again.
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Our stay was very pleasant. Great location near Purdue University/downtown. Place was well kept and spotless with nice amenities. Interactions with Dennis and Theresa were very pleasant. We lost a set of keys and they had the cleaning crew thoroughly look through the house. It was nice of them to do so!
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Lovely place
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Been staying here for years. It’s close, convenient and provides a good value.
We will be back next year I’m sure."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I booked this location several months in advance to attend the final game of the Purdue University Men's Basketball season. At the time I booked there were not many options offered yet for this date (likely too early?) so I really appreciated Dennis's listing and the ability to confirm my plans.
I appreciated the photos and thorough description of the unit (especially about low head space over the bathroom sink since my two traveling companions are over 6 ft tall). During our stay, I appreciated the accurate directions, ease of entry and exit, snacks waiting for us, walkability to evening restaurant options, cleanliness of the entire unit, comfort of bedding, etc.
I did have a challenge with noise coming from the other half of the unit very late at night, and very much appreciated Dennis's concern and prompt reply as soon as he saw my message. One thing to take note of was that there is no TV - this was not a concern for us but might be for others.
I would book there again! :)"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was a nice, quiet place to stay. All very clean and proper. Thanks!"

2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Perfect place to stay for a Purdue visit. Two miles from campus, easy parking. Clean, comfortable, and the most stocked Airbnb I’ve stayed in (the kitchen drawers were labeled!) Two comfortable bedrooms, nice hot shower, super cute remodeled older home. Would definitely return."
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Dennis was very communicative upon check in and check out - perfect stay for our quick visit to Purdue!
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Great place to stay, would definitely stay there again!"

2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Had stayed here several times and always know what to expect. The place feels so comfortable so easy to settle in and relax.
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Elderly folks might avoid this home due to the steep staircase.
Otherwise the place was excellent. I slept well, felt safe, the parking situation is good, and I had an overall positive experience. Will be back if I find myself in Lafayette again."
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We loved staying in this fun, quaint, quirky house! My 6'2"" partner had to crouch in a few spots which was very amusing but added to the charm! Lovely place!"
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,I was amazed on how spacious this location was but it matched the description. I was very thankful for the prompt response from Dennis & the reassurance I needed to make my stay at ease. Thank you for this.
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Clean with nice spacious rooms. WiFi worked great. Check in was easy and well described with pictures. Can’t speak much on the neighborhood because it was freezing temps outside and it was dark when I came and went but it seemed very safe and nice. Coworkers from the area told me it was a safe area. Thanks Dennis!!
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very nice accommodations as always
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Everything was amazing, we haven’t been to more stock air bnb, the board games were a nice touch. The room temperature was good, easily controllable and the bathroom was cozy and clean, you just want to go take a shower. The kitchen as I said was fully stocked and furnished, ready for cooking."
2024-01-01,5.0,Group trip,This AirBnB is exactly what we needed. Good location close to Purdue's campus and easy to communicate with the owner for logistics. I've stayed at this AirBnB before and sought it out again for this visit to Purdue from a previous good experience.
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"great host, watch out for angled walls!"
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Nice, quiet little place.
Perfect for a swim meet weekend at Purdue. Had all the basics we needed. Thanks."

2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great stay. Would come back for sure.
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Dennis’s place is always what it says. Third time we have booked this unit and fourth time we booked with Dennis - you can never go wrong! Wonderful people who provide a great experience each and ever time.
2023-11-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"Great location and good directions for getting there and inside. We didn’t spend much time at the house but it was a peaceful location. The house had everything we needed and some really cute aspects like the hobbit reading nook. There wasn’t an actual living room, but we didn’t need it. Kitchen was very nice although we didn’t use it."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great stay!!
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Dennis' place was great! Super clean, comfortable and quiet - so it was very relaxing. Dennis was very responsive and helpful. There is lots of space, and everything you need is provided. Thank you for a great stay!"

2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Simple and straightforward with a touch of charm.
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Dennis’ place was a great place to stay. Convenient to everything. Easy to get to. Perfect directions on accessing the unit with pictures. The house was very clean. It is an old, historic restored house with lots of charm. We will definitely try to stay here again. He was so helpful to us in a time of need to be with our Purdue student after a surgery that couldn’t stay in the dorm for 2 weeks. Top notch!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place for money
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Great, clean, place. Make sure you go around back to get inside. I got in late and tried the front door where the address took me and it didn't work. Thankfully they responded quickly even though it was nearly midnight. Also felt like it was in a nice, safe, area."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful home very close to Purdue and downtown Lafayette. Fully stocked kitchen and has all amenities needed for short or long stay, individual or group stay. Comfy beds and good internet (for those planning remote work from here). The outside look / photo views do not do justice to the inside. I was very surprised (pleasantly) at the interiors. Being a DIY guy myself, can see and feel the attention to detail the host has given to make this house so well done. Three Cheers to Dennis and co-hosts!!! One (hopefully) helpful note for people with mobility issues : All bedrooms are upstairs; so people with mobility issues may find the stairs difficult to navigate."
2023-10-01,4.0,Group trip,Great place to relax- nice renovation and very good Wi-if. Beds where comfortable and clean! Bathroom has low ceiling and no real room to get together. It was a relaxing place to stay!
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Thank you Dennis for your hospitality. it was a great weekend, and the Buckeyes put a whoopin’ on Purdue…..GO BUCKS!!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,A great little historic home! Everything was clean and ready. I loved the architecture and victorian feel of the building itself too! It was super nice having a full kitchen and washer-dryer combo as well. Highly recommend if you are going to Lafayette!

2023-09-01,5.0,Group trip,Great amenities and location!
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Pictures don't do justice for this property. You have to be there to experience it. The owners have taken great effort in restoring this home that it felt like going back in time. The large old gas stove, the Large Porcelain Sink, the narrow dark stairs, the decors and its alleyway access to the rear.. all add to its uniqueness.
This is a great getaway place and something worth enjoying for individuals and family with lil kids who would love the layout. yes, there is stairs and all Bedrooms and bath is upstairs. Only Kitchen, Dining and Laundry on the main floor. Stayed here for a few days and it was worth every penny. Beats staying in hotel and such. Experience the beautiful Lafayette downtown.
This is the second location from this host I was staying at. I would confidently rent any others properties from this host including new ones that are coming up across the street."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Had a brilliant stay!
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Very cozy, quaint home. I was pleasantly surprised by the interior architecture, perfect lighting and furnishings. Everything was very clean, comfortable and the area felt safe. The restroom had everything that one needs for a nice hot shower. I think the restroom was my favorite room of all the rooms. I recommend this place if you’re gonna be in town. The host Dennis was easy to get a hold of and he was very helpful. I am looking forward to returning for another visit when the time comes."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is my second stay in this unit. It is a great Airbnb. It feels very safe and comfortable. Dennis is a super host and very friendly! I will come back again, definitely."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Wonderful stay - amazing hosts! Great place to stay ❤️
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We love old houses with character! They've done a great job updating with a beautiful bathroom and great sleeping space. The kitchen is large and has eating space with a dining table for 4. We also had family games there 🙂
The alley to park in isn't super easy to find, but the pictures they've provided make it so easy to know you're in the right place!"
2023-08-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,A good option
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Wonderful stay close to the heart of Lafayette

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Aside from being a really cool and delightful place, it is definitely worth scanning the QR code in the kitchen to see how much work by how many people went into turning the home into what it is. Congratulations to the whole crew!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Nice accommodations and convenient location
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,The house has lots of space and is super clean. Situated in a quiet residential neighborhood. We loved our space and the hosts' thoughtful preparations for their guests. Very convenient for a visit to Purdue University.
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Our stay at Downtown Abbey was just lovely. It was very quiet and very clean. The location was perfect for us. My son lives in West Lafayette so getting to them was easy. Also I enjoyed so much just walking around the neighborhood; there are so many beautiful old homes. Some are in bad shape, but I still appreciate their history. I walked from our little home to downtown and all the way over to West Lafayette. I would gladly stay here again. Next time perhaps my sister will stay in the front part of the house then we could just open the adjoining doors and visit with each other. Having a little sitting area in our unit would be welcomed, but we made due with sitting in the kitchen. The upstairs front bedroom would make a nice sitting area, but we didn't use it that way since we were respectful of not having food upstairs. Thank you for offering your sweet cottage on airbnb!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,it was great
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"Wonderful experience, the house is cozy and well equipped, Dennis is a very kind and proactive host."

2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Stayed here while was umpiring baseball at Purdue. Made me feel right at home. The only thing missing was a living room area but I personally didnt need that. Loved the old stove and the history of the house. Also loved the ability to park in the back of the house. Very clean and the bed was comfortable. Would stay there again if I go back.
2023-04-01,4.0,Stayed one night,Good value. Served as a nice stop while making an overnight stay for business in the Lafayette area.

2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Perfect location , accessible to Lafayette AND Purdue university, where we were visiting. Although there wasn’t a t.v., we enjoy board games and Yahtzee happened to be in the closet. Bonus!! We chose to play upstairs because it is very cozy and inviting. The kitchen was clean and a good spot to eat on the go. I loved the charm of the home, cubbies, little doors and special touches you only find in older homes. We had a terrific experience in a peaceful neighborhood. Thank you."

2023-03-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Lovely place… charming, clean, well equipped. Large rooms. The only drawback was that my husband and I are Sr. Citizens and we found the stairway difficult. It was steep and had turns. We were ask not to wear shoes inside and I have balance issues and found stairs hard to negotiate. The location was great … we were taking our granddaughter to Purdue (we are alumni) for orientation …easy to get back and fourth from campus.
We feel the stairs were our problem we just need to be more cautious at our age."
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,A downtown gem. A historic home that has been upgraded very thoughtfully. Very convenient with everything exactly as described. Stairs were very manageable.
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This is a lovely, large space in a quiet neighborhood. I found it ideal in terms of visiting the nearby campus -- not very far, but not too close! I hope to return again."

2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I love the downton abbey … it’s a great, unique stay! Pretty close to campus ! Very clean !"
2022-09-01,5.0,Group trip,"This is a solid stay for the Lafayette area! Within walking distance to restaurants. This is not at all a complaint, but just a little warning depending on the purpose of your trip! The kitchen is the only area on the first floor, and it is quite spacious. The bedrooms are all upstairs which is something to not for those with mobility concerns. There are no common areas outside of the kitchen (I.e, a living room), but there was plenty of space to spread out in the kitchen and the bedroom floors. Overall I would recommend, but I wanted to make others aware of this just in case you need a more distinct living room space to hang out!!
The owner labeled everything in the kitchen and had snacks and coffee!"
2022-09-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Great location and clean place. Has everything you need. Wished there had been a television but maybe next time. It was an easy stay.

2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Fantastic place to stay during my business trip to Lafayette!
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Solid place to stay. Good location, not ideal if spending a lot of time in the house. As most of the rooms arent large."
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"Highly recommended! We enjoyed our stay. The house is as advertised. Dennis was very responsive, thanks Dennis!"
2022-07-01,4.0,Stayed about a week,Very lovely and quiet stay. Clean and kept up property. Mr. Dennis was quick to reply with answers to questions we had. I would recommend this place to anyone needing a place to stay.

2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Second stay here. Great space. Clean, well managed home with plenty of charm and good amenities. Fun neighborhood. Will be back."
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The house is great. The bedrooms are spacious and the house was very clean. Check in was easy as well. My only caution would be that if you are tall (above 6'3"" or so), you might need to watch your head on the stairs and in the bathroom.
We would definitely stay here again."
2022-06-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Love this house! Be sure to learn about its history and remodeling. Perfect place for 2, but be aware that it does not include any public area (den or dining) except for a 2’ table on a wall in the kitchen. Be sure to park in the back for very easy access to your half of the house."
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,A wonderful place to stay--I stay here quite often-- close to downtown and easy walk.

2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Excellent Air bnb, super clean, very expertly labeled kitchen. The instructions to enter were very easy to follow. The GPS will take you to the front, but the back lot has a different way to get in, but there was so much street parking we didn't bother to figure it out. Very responsive host who is very nice as well! If you are visiting and want to go to out I highly recommend ""The Tap"" across the bridge in West Lafayette. It has a wonderfully long beer selection as the name implies and the food was very good as well. A good place to go watch any sports while you are staying here!"
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"100% recommended, it is a private and very equipped place, it also has 3 beds, totally amazing"
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"1st time Air B-N-B..
I loved this place when we was looking to book a place ..
So we took a chance.
And when we arrived we was amazed, the feel and set up was incredible..
Kitchen and washer/ dryer downstairs..
Rooms and bathroom upstairs..
Everything was fresh and clean..
I will rebook this when we come up to visit my child who is attending Purdue..
Thank you Dennis.."
2022-05-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,good house
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,It was a lovely and charming house with comfortable beds. A great find!
2022-05-01,5.0,Group trip,This was our third day at Downtown Abbey and it was as g ood as always. Very comfortable place and Dennis is easy to communicate with. Would definitely recommend staying here.
2022-05-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,This was a quiet and convenient location for family gathering nearby--walking distance both to downtown and where family members live. Nice big kitchen which we appreciated for breakfast and the occasional lunch. Cute and cozy under the eaves.
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Charming, clean and neat place! Highly recommend."
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,You guys been awesome and place is great.. thanks again for your hospitality
2022-05-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"The house and location were safe, it wasn’t the closest walk to downtown so we drove but we were totally fine with that, you could definitely walk if you wanted to though. The area recommendations were spot on, we checked out the ax throwing place and had a really fun time!"
2022-04-01,3.0,Group trip,"Comfortable place with nice hosts. The location was not ideal and a little unsafe for our liking, but it was a 6 minute ride to West Lafayette."
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,clean. quiet. nice stay.
2022-04-01,4.0,Stayed about a week,"The parking was great for family to come and go. The kitchen was big and clean with snacks, tea and coffee. There is one bathroom up there steep stairs. There is no couch or tv or dining table, just a small cafe table in the kitchen. You have to take your shoes off and be quiet after 9pm."
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,second stay...always pleasant. Great location for visiting my son at Purdue.
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"The room is very clean, the kitchen is very practical, the only regret is that the shower head cannot be adjusted, I hope to improve it, I will stay again if I have the opportunity."
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Very neat older home! For those who are over 6', the bathroom sink will require you to tilt or duck a bit. Also, the bathroom is only upstairs where the bedrooms are for those who may have mobility issues."
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This is a cool old house that's been nicely refurbished. Just a couple minutes from downtown. The only warning I have is that you'll need to climb some fairly narrow stairs to get to the bedrooms, so if you have problems with that you might take heed."
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,I thoroughly enjoyed my stay! The apartment is lovely. Dennis put a lot of care into restoring an historic home in a cool neighborhood. The house is just a short walk from all that Downtown has to offer. I look forward to returning!
2022-03-01,4.0,Stayed one night,Well maintained. Easy access.
2022-03-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Dennis is Amazing and very accomodating! After i arrived I quickly realized the area wasnt the safest. But if you are a true crime fan, you are about 3 houses down from the famous Marcia Heald home of Murder!! So that was awesome!! Overall I would stay again but make sure you read all amenities the no TV sucked."
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,I stayed here when visiting my daughter at Purdue. The place is charming and very comfortable and deep value for money. Dennis is a wonderful host.
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Nice stay! I had trouble finding the alleyway because it’s a little bit hidden, but check-in instructions are very clear. Clean and the host was very kind."
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Very nice and clean place. Good location.

2022-02-01,4.0,Group trip,Host was professional and accommodation was exactly as expected. would stay again!
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"As described, easy walk to downtown Lafayette."
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a wonderful stay. Cold outside during our visit but house was cozy. Great, well-sized and equipped kitchen with a small round table that seats four. There was an additional small round folding table in the laundry room with two more chairs so we could squeeze in five for a dinner. QR code reader on your phone is needed to get instructions on how to use the stove and history of the house. No sitting space downstairs but two very roomy bedrooms with fun reading nooks upstairs and beds for five people. Two single beds in one room and a double and single bed in the other. As other reviews have said, bathroom upstairs has a low ceiling over the sink. I am 6-3 and was just careful. I was very impressed with how quickly Dennis responded to my question early on a Sunday morning when none of the outlets worked in the kitchen. He got back to me in minutes on how to reset the ground-fault switch over the kitchen table. The neighborhood has a large range of interesting architecture so make sure to leave time to wander around. The house is an easy walk to downtown. We will definitely stay here again."
2022-02-01,4.0,Stayed about a week,Dennis was a very responsive host and it was a great experience staying at the house!
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,Very smooth no issues

2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"Very cute house. Private entrance and driveway at the back of the house. Kitchen was very well equipped. The house is walking distance to downtown Lafayette and a short drive to the Purdue campus.
As other guests have mentioned, there is no common living space, just a kitchen and 2 bedrooms. So may not be great for larger families."
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great location for the Purdue game!
2021-11-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Very clean, great and prompt communication from host, and a very honest listing — but a very quirky and fairly uncomfortable layout. This is all clear in the description listing, but just be prepared. You’ve got no place to hang out but the kitchen, and you will likely be ducking your head in the bathroom. Steep and tight staircase. If you’re coming to sleep in the bedrooms after spending your days out, certainly a clean and safe place to rest."
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This is a great place for a girls weekend! The host was very responsive to our questions. Very comfortable and relaxing. I also like the fact it was close to the town for restaurants
2021-11-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"This is an upstairs sleepingarea and bathroom with a kitchen downstairs. There's no living area, but room in the kitchen to sit and a very cool vintage gas stove, and vintage kitchen sink. The bedrooms are spacious and the bathroom roomy. Nicely remodeled....close to restaurants."
2021-11-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Described as a family accommodation but in November is very cold, has no lounge TV for family gathering. Kitchen and bathroom are particularly cold and shower water varies from cool to colder than that. The bannister rail is too short and so care would be advisable for young kids and older guests. Quite clean though quite a lot of hair shavings were left in the bathroom sink on the vertical surface closest to the guest. Best to arrive in daylight if parking at the rear, close to the entrance. It is hard to identify the property from the back in the dark. Due to low temperatures inside in cold weather, warmer weather stays would more agreeable."
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Charming! Quiet and cozy, the kitchen was incredible"
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Great, warm, inviting space super close to downtown."
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Needed somewhere to stay after arriving in town late and it was absolutely perfect! beautiful architecture and design
2021-11-01,4.0,Group trip,"Nice, clean space. Ideal for friends gathering on Purdue game day. Comfortable sleeping. No gathering space to hang out though other than kitchen. No living room/sitting room, but was ok b/c we didn’t spend any time other than sleeping and getting ready in mornings."
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"It was very clean and close to campus! Dennis was prompt with responding and gave us wonderful restaurant suggestions!
Check in/out was vey easy. It was a nice place to stay."

2021-09-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"Great location, great space, very clean. As stated in the description, no common seating space or television. Only minor issue for me was the low ceiling height in the bathroom - I am 6'1 and could not stand up straight without hitting my head."
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Had an awesome stay here! Loved the history and character of the house. Hosts were flexible and very communicative
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We had a very good stay. The place was very clean. It is a two-floor unit, so guests need to be able to use stairs to access the bathroom and bedrooms. It does not have a living room, but the bedrooms are very large. Each bedroom has their own A/C and space heater, so you can chose your own comfort level. The neighborhood is quiet. We rented the space to attend a Purdue game, and it worked perfectly for our needs. We would stay here again."
2021-09-01,4.0,Stayed one night,Great stay and had everything we needed.
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Super cute place to stay - the place is much more spacious than in the pictures. Hosts were friendly and responsive. Parking was easy.

2024-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was my second time in this special space and I have another stay booked for August. I feel right at home, love being close to Main Street & Purdue and just love the style and feel of the space. It’s perfect for me. Victoria is so responsive and helpful and I am happy to have found this home away from home."
2024-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Vicky's place is my favorite Airbnb in Lafayette. Staying at her place feels like winning a lottery, because it's always full-booked! I love every piece of the house and I'm just so happy to be back."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place!
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,An adorable little space for a quick trip to visit family. Host was very friendly and the space was cozy and very cute!
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I love the small town charm of Lafayette, and this place is the perfect place to experience it! Clean, quiet and super comfortable! Entering the property gives all the garden feels, and there is very nice outdoor seating. The upstairs bedroom and generous second seating area (or extra bed space if you need it) feels like a treehouse with its view of the town. I just love staying here!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Victoria’s carriage house was perfect for visiting Purdue and Lafayette. 2 min walk to restaurants and coffee shops. Victoria was extremely responsive and gave great food recommendations. Will definitely return!!
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We had a wonderful stay in this cute cottage! It was clean and thoughtfully stocked with the essentials. The only issue was limited street parking one of the days we were there. Victoria was friendly and available!
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"The carriage house is artistically decorated. Attractive, charming and comfortable.
We stayed there for 3 weeks, and would have appreciated more emphasis on recycling."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great place, convenient location, as advertised!"

2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was our 3rd stay at Vicky’s adorable Air BnB. We love how easy it is to get into town for restaurants and just walking around. It was also nice to have the church right there — we heard the church bells and were able to pop right over for mass.
We will be back!"

2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful recently renovated carriage house centrally located to downtown and steps from restaurants, coffee shops, etc. Really great space, comfortable and nicely furnished. Easy parking and keyless access was a breeze."
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"I booked for a month for work, a month I won't forget .
Victoria's stay and service have far exceeded my expectations.
Since my arrival I felt at home, not only for its warm and cozy atmosphere (I love the small living room on the top floor, I have spent very pleasant times in that comfortable armchair) but also for the attention and predisposition both of Victoria and her daughter Jenny, which made that first month of adaptation so hard for a new arrival from Spain.
The location is unbeatable within walking distance of downtown in a quiet and charming neighborhood.
I would have extended my stay if it had been possible and of course I will repeat!
I can only thank Victoria and her family for their hospitality and generosity."
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a wonderful stay! A homey experience and Victoria was really responsive. It's in a nice neighborhood, walkable to restaurants and a short drive to Purdue."

2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was an absolutely stunning place to stay.

If you’re looking for a little getaway as I was, I highly recommend this place it is worth every penny!!"
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Victoria’s place was clean and matches exactly like the picture shows. She was patient to answer any questions we had!
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"So glad we stayed here for my son’s graduation from Purdue University.
Home was clean, spacious and the host thought of everything we might need - including an umbrella which came in handy. Highly recommend Victoria’s little “home away from home”.
Thanks Vicky!"
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"What a warm, cute, cozy, and safe place! Artsy decor, plenty of space, and I love the extra living room space upstairs. I was so comfortable and actually spent a lot of quiet time watching movies and writing. Downtown is just a few minutes away up the main street you'll be staying on. Plenty of great eating places up there (recommend Potbelly). Fun to see the college kids moving around doing their thing.

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Vicky was an excellent host - warm, thoughtful, and communicative! The carriage house is beautifully decorated. I loved that the upstairs bedroom loft had a second sitting area and a space where I could set up my “office” since I needed to work during our stay. Main St. is just around the corner and offers many restaurants and shops. One nice bonus is that the short one-block stretch of 12th St. doesn’t have parking restrictions, so you can easily park right in front. We would have stayed another week if available!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Very friendly, responsive and clear instructions, great accommodations. Loved the stay and definitely worth it!!"

Since we had our bearings from our previous stay, as soon as we dropped off our bags, I was able to walk downtown and pick up a few things at the market. We also were able to walk to dinner in the evening. We enjoyed the extra space the home provided over a hotel room."

2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Such a unique place! Two story former carriage house, bigger than what the pictures show, on a quiet street, even though in a downtown setting.

2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Super clean and warming place like your home in the world. Victoria is so helpful and warm welcoming host for us. Wonderful.

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I knew that I would likely love this place based on the photos and descriptions alone but it’s truly even better in person! It’s very cute, quiet, and very clean. The location is what stands out the most for this spot - it’s so close to Main St where you can walk to so many different shops. We’ll definitely be staying here again!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place is so charming and cozy! It was supremely clean and located close to Purdue. The decor is eclectic and boho, just plain inviting. The unit is spacious. Perfect getaway spot! Very quaint restaurants and shops nearby (walking distance). It had all the amenities! I easily worked remotely. I wish I had more time to spend here!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"After a 5 day drive cross country, arrived in Lafayette to move my daughter into an apartment as she will be grad student at Purdue. Since it was unfurnished til ubox arrived, we needed a place to stay for 2 nights. This lovely property provided us a very comfortable space to drop and recuperate. It was conveniently located for our needs and had all the accoutrements to make our stay easy and comfortable. I would stay here again."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very nice place.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Such a cute place! Loved it and will be back again!
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Fun functional furniture. Very cozy. Fun games and books to take advantage of. Lots of walkable fun chic restaurants to taste. Also interesting attractions like the Cat Lounge and many artistic romps also within walking distance. FYI if you have mobility concerns there are uneven steps into home as well as steep stairs in home. Im almost 60 n had no issues. But thought let ya all know. When in area would stay with Victoria again. Definitely a five star host n stay.
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Excellent historical Airbnb. Victoria's place is part of a historical building AND it's right in downtown Lafayette. Great host; great place; great location.
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great place a nice block or three walk from excellent restaurants. I like it for a business address, but it'd make an awesome couples' retreat."

2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is the second time I’ve been able to stay at Victoria’s place while visiting family here. I reserved it again because it is a lovely, welcoming, calm and comfortable place, as well as being very walkable to downtown restaurants and shops. Victoria is a very kind host who has designed a very pleasing, updated place to stay in a historic building. It was just as nice as the first time! Thank you for having me!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very quaint and comfortable. Clean and inviting. One of the better Airbnbs we have stayed in. Would return 100%.
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,I’m a repeat client. Victoria makes everything easy and welcoming. From the instructions at check in to the coffee/tea station for breakfast. All cotton sheets and towels. The location is wonderful whether you’re headed to campus or looking for an evening downtown. Looking forward to my next visit.
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,I so loved waking up to the sound of birds chirping at Vicky’s charming “Pied-à-terre”. It was my cozy home for 6 weeks as I transitioned from the Pacific Northwest back to my hometown. I don’t believe I have ever known anyone as lovely and kind as my host. She made me feel like family and I look forward to being her neighbor.
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I was here for a short conference at Purdue, and Vicky’s carriage house worked perfectly. Surprisingly peaceful for something so walkable to the burgeoning restaurants in Lafayette. Coming “home” after a day of conferencing felt like unwinding in your own home. I didn’t feel like I was disturbing anyone coming back at night, as entry is easy just steps through the quaint gate from the street, where parking was easy. I especially appreciated the French Press and grinder with a supply of whole beans (Ethiopian, I’m guessing?). A very comfortable stay!"
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very cute place to stay close to old Lafayette.
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay and amazing coffee

2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Victoria is a great host. The place seems to have been recently updated and is very nice.

2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful quaint carriage house in old downtown just a block from trendy restaurants and handy for driving about the area to sites of interest. The French Press works wonderfully! Great parking on the quiet street near the door. I'll need to bring my bride back for a visit!
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The coziest place! The personal touches were so nice after a long day of travel. Bedroom is upstairs with bathroom downstairs. The stairs added so much character to the Carriage House! We will return :-)
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Vicky was a great host. She got back to me very quickly when I needed something but gave me all the privacy I wanted. I love being able to walk downtown. The place was clean and charming! I loved my stay.
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We were so pleased with our stay. What a fun and comfortable accommodations for the weekend. Great location for dining and other events. Victoria is on top of her game with prompt and timely communications. We look forward to our stay again when we are in the area!
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Lovely place & good value for money. Appreciated the hospitable touches (coffee, chocolate bar, waters in fridge, etc.). Weather was quite cold during my stay, but the electric baseboard heaters worked great (just walk around each room to find them all & turn them on!). Nice big TV; my daughter & son-in-law came over for a ""movie night"" :). WiFi was fast & stable. I enjoyed the separate sitting area upstairs as the windows & views make it pleasant up there during the day. As mentioned in previous reviews, be aware that the bathroom is downstairs & the bed is upstairs, in case navigating stairs during the night may be in issue for anyone in your party."
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Vicky’s carriage is a great home away from home. Love love this space and Vicky too, and will stay again in the future!"
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Victoria's place is absolutely lovely. It's so comfy and cozy. Everything was clean and the furnishings are well taken care of.
One thing to be aware of is that there are steps up and steps down going into the house, as well as steep-ish stairs up to the bedroom. This was fine for me and my husband, though could be a challenge for some folks
We definitely plan to come back on our next stay in Lafayette!"
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Loved how quite the location was and how close to campus the house was. Super cute and romantic. Great for a couples stay.
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"An absolute must for people looking for a convenient location to enjoy downtown Lafayette - close to bars, restaurants, and shops, but also quiet neighborhood!"
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I am a repeat customer -- Vicky is a most gracious host, and Pied-a-terre is a most lovely quaint getaway in close proximity to old town Lafayette & Purdue. Love the location, love the easy access to shops & restaurants, but mostly love the comfortable atmosphere of the airbnb. I will most definitely be back!"
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Perfect in all ways. Already rebooked for next Purdue visit.
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We had a great time here. Would recommend.
2022-10-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great digs in a very good location. a nice duplex carriage house, and I really appreciated the coffee beans, grinder, and french press while I had to be on a morning work call. Thank you, Victoria!"
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Victoria’s place is great! We stayed two nights and were very comfortable with all the amenities we needed. Great location and quiet.
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Easy, central location with lots of charm!"

2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Nice, stand-alone, AirBnb unit within close walking proximity to all of downtown Lafayette"
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We loved Vicky’s home for our first trip to Purdue to visit our son. My husband is “Marriott loyal” so it is odd to stay somewhere other than a Marriott for us. He has been doing a lot of traveling and we thought something more “homey” would be better for a change. Vicky’s home was lovely, clean, and perfect for our first trip to Purdue.
The only thing to mention (and that may be obvious from pictures) is that the bed is in a loft. If you need to use the bathroom at night, it can be an issue.
The other item — the shower is tiny. My husband is a big guy, so we joked “he had to put the shower on”. Again, not an issue, just something we laughed about.
Thank-you again Vicky for the lovely stay and the extra touches. We can’t wait to come back!!"
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place. Great location. Very comfortable. Walking distance to great bars and restaurants.
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Staying at Victoria’s pied-à-terre, it was beyond what we had expected. The whole place was clean, but more than that, it was unique in its decoration and beyond perfect. We stayed here for two nights and didn’t want to leave just because of her place.
Thank you, Mrs. Vicky for opening your home to us and we will be definitely staying here again! I’d give it 10 stars if I could!!!"
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This was my second time staying here. I came for a two-night solo getaway. The location is perfectly walkable to downtown Lafayette. I look forward to staying again in the future.
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Place had everything we needed. Space was cozy and bed was very comfortable. Quiet neighborhood, plenty of parking, and easy walking distance to restaurants. Host was super responsive. Just a few notes to assist others in planning. Bathroom is lovely, but shower is a slightly smaller corner shower. And stairs going up are fine, but I had to be careful the first time going up and down to make sure I kept my balance. Might just be me, and I quickly got used to both with no problems. We enjoyed our stay and you can see Vicky's thoughtful preparations everywhere."
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We stayed here Purdue move in weekend. Great location for both proximity to the University as well as Great dining choices in very close walking distance.
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great location, very clean and nice place to stay. Highly recommend."
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"an incredible stay! love the artist, lux, boho feel of the decor. would love to stay again."
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"This is a stay you do not want to pass up! Vicky's thought and care for her guests is evident from minute one. She has created a warm and cozy space with care, and included numerous wonderful, original art pieces. Plus, the Carriage House is a beautiful, secluded little hideaway right in the heart of historic downtown Lafayette, making for beautiful evening walks and nights on the town! I would recommend this stay to anyone thinking about coming to explore Lafayette."
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Sparkling clean, super comfortable, fluffy towels, great bedding and showers. Lovely bright kitchen, great coffee, nice little yard. Wonderful sweet hostess. Excellent location! Would 10/10 stay here again. Thank you!"
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,A perfect place to unwind and relax after busy days. Everything was clean and comfortable.
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,very cute place loved it!!
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"FABULOUS!!! The spot is lovely, close to everything, with available parking and restaurants nearby. Vicky is the PERFECT host!! All kinds of helpful advance information, immediately responsive to ANY concern, written instructions everywhere to orient to the place and neighborhood - and thoughtful touches throughout (chocolate, coffee, seltzer & water). The online handbook was SO great - more good information."
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"Apt is older, vintage, Bohemian style. very cozy. There are lots of great restaurants a block away. Vicky is a great host!"

2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Let me start by thanking the host for not price gouging during graduation weekend. Most hotels and Airbnbs were doing that. What a perfect little place to stay while visiting your Boiler! Plenty of room to accommodate us including my daughter who at the last minute decided she wanted to stay with us. So much more comfortable than a traditional hotel. The location was also perfect. I don't plan to be back because my last kid just just graduated, but highly recommend to anyone looking to stay near Purdue."
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This is a wonderful place to stay. Victoria makes you feel right at home and the amenities are great. The location is terrific for access to Purdue and downtown Lafayette.
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This may be my absolutely favorite Airbnb I’ve stayed in. There were lovely updates like a modern kitchen and a gorgeous bathroom, but overall the space felt homey and comfortable. I had to cut my two-night trip down to one unexpectedly and when I was packing my things the morning I left I kept wishing I had many more days to spend there. The upstairs lounge area was my favorite space. I told my friends I was making this my go-to Airbnb for the alumni board meetings I attend twice a year, but unfortunately many others must feel like I do because the upcoming dates I need are already booked!"
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I have stayed at this location twice now, and I can't wait to come back again! I love the decorations, how the space feels, the location.... everything. And Vicky is great. She's there if you need her but the space feels like your own. It's a gem!"
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This was a great space for our stay. We really enjoyed the cozy feel!
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Amazing private carriage house in a great neighborhood. Walkable to everything downtown. Great vibe and plenty of books and boardgames to play if you find yourself with some down time. Highly recommended.
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Lovely home with great host!
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Absolutely a 5-star stay and two thumbs up from my daughter as well! :)
The decor, conveniences, comfort, location and happy energy were all enjoyed - including the Indigo Girls poster hanging over the coffee/tea bar. I saw them at a music festival in Asheville, NC about 20 years ago and still have their cassette tape from my Purdue days in the late 80s. One of many small details that was appreciated!
Thank you again for providing your wonderful ""home away from home"" place to us.
Eduardo & Sophia"
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"I had the good fortune to stay in the carriage house for several months and really, really enjoyed the space, the decor, the location close to Main Street and shops, and the amazing cozy uniqueness of the space. Victoria is a wonderful host and tried to help out in any way she could. I look forward to staying there again!"
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This place is fantastic. A real jewel in the neighborhood. Great location walkable to all of the Main Street hot spots. Victoria has designed and decorated this place to be a comfortable getaway with style and new finishes.
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay and convenient location. Had absolutely everything I needed
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Easily my favorite stay so far. The space is just adorable, and unbelievably well appointed. I was able to work remotely one day with no issues whatsoever, and I was so cozy that I didn't want to leave. Victoria is an incredibly thoughtful host - she even turned on the heat before I arrived because she thought it was chilly. This will be our first choice next time we visit Lafayette!"
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,great spot close to restaurants in Laffeyette
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I quite enjoyed the comfort, cleanness and the quaintness of the Carriage House! Vicki was very accommodating of my needs, and she is a lovely host. I anticipate staying at either of her properties in the future when I am in need of an Airbnb at Purdue! I will be I recommending her to others who visit Purdue!
You can’t go wrong…this place a is gem!"
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Just a few blocks away from several cute shops and several restaurants. The pics and description of this location is spot-on. Will definitely consider booking here again when I need a room in Lafayette/West Lafayette, since it’s just a few minute drive from Purdue University."
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Vicky was communicative, clean, accommodating, and couldn't have a better location! Would definitely recommend taking advantage of this terrific find."
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Outstanding place. A real gem. And ideal location. We got so lucky finding this!
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very comfortable and a great location!
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place is adorable! The location can’t be beat, and it feels like a home away from home."
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Vicky’s condo was just what I needed to get away for the weekend. It’s very cozy and warm and has everything you need to relax. She makes sure you have WiFi, coffee, extra towels, and the shower is amazing with cute little old school taxi tiles.
She made sure to put my down alternative covers for my allergies and the place was spotlessly clean. Great price and she communicated with me for several months during the changes with COVID as my plans changed a few times with guests as well as questions on restrictions. She set out ice trays in the freezer and there is a remote for the AC unit. There are plenty of reading spaces everywhere and lots of lights. The tv remote and everything is set out in areas that are immediately accessible.
I gave an honest 5 stars as there really isn’t anything I can negatively say about the space. I will say for ADA access there is a big drop down step upon entering the place for the front door so if you are checking in late at night be mindful as I missed the step going in with my medical boot on. Ubers drivers in the area have a really hard time finding the address with the one way streets but Vicky lights the house up really well. It’s worth it!
We will be back!"
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The place was very clean and comfortable. I love the location. Just a couple blocks from 2 breweries and some nice restaurants. I would definitely come back
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This converted carriage house is such a great space for one or two people looking to get away! We spent a lovely weekend in Lafayette at Vicky’s place while visiting for a wedding. The apartment is within walking distance of several great restaurants with outdoor seating, and a collection of unique shops and boutiques. The space has a great layout, stylishly decorated, with lots of comfortable touches like extra pillows and blankets, and a spacious loft for sleeping and relaxing. Will definitely revisit if we visit Lafayette again!"
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Vicky welcomed us with a lovely artistic note to this fun colorful space. So many lovely touches including fresh coffee beans and grinder with beautiful ceramic mugs. The space was just as pictured and we could walk out the door onto the Main Street of Lafayette.
Lovely space and so close to everything. Would highly recommend."
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Fantastic little spot! We will definitely book here again!

2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Thank you Victoria for hosting us, very nice location and pretty much felt like we were at our home. Victoria has very good taste and it can be seen in all the items present in the property. It will be our go to place for all our future visits to Lafayette, IN."
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful little cottage and convenient to historic Layfayette and Purdue.
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This was the perfect place for us to stop in for a few days while waiting to move into our apartment in town. This place had all the little amenities you’d have at home which made this such a welcoming space for us. Thank you so much to Victoria who clearly has spent a good amount of timing making sure this space was best in class!

2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Victoria's place is a treasure! My husband and I stayed there a week while our son was in a summer program at Purdue. It reminded me of fun AirBnB's we stayed at in Europe -- lovely touches and a creative space. The reading area was my favorite -- comfy chairs to stretch out and fall into a novel. My husband was telecommuting much of it, and truly appreciated the excellent air conditioning and wi-fi. The yard area and brick front was lovely. And oh the convenience to town! And we had a great time visiting the restaurants and diners and cute shops. I like to run, and there was a great park and bridge for those mornings. It was a true value."
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Vicky's place is cute and comfortable. We had everything we needed. On-street parking was easy. We tend to cook most of our food, and the kitchen was sufficient. We would definitely stay here again."

2020-12-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"This place was incredible! I had the pleasure of living here for 3 months while I was working. It was my home away from home. The house is in the beautifully historic downtown area of Lafayette. You’re within a 3 minute walk to a long strand of great shops and restaurants. The house has a full kitchen, full bathroom, huge loft, spacious living room, smart TV’s, extremely fast WiFi, brand new everything/fully renovated. On a personal note, Vicki is a great host. She made sure I had everything I needed while still respecting my privacy. She’s also incredibly gracious and paid close attention to detail in every way. From the full coffee bar (French press, grinder, coffee maker, candies, local-complementary products, etc.), to the stocked spices, dishes, silverware, pots, pans, fresh linens, sparkling clean amenities, down comforter, plenty of pillows, etc. I could go on and on about this place, but I can honestly say that this was worth every penny and I wouldn’t change a thing."

Burt was very a nice host! We needed batteries for the thermostat, and he showed up with/in 5 minutes!

We had a personalize “Welcome” sign greeting us when we walked through the door and the little touches of home, like snacks and chocolates waiting for us were much appreciated.

2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Excellent….a very large space. Great location and the communication was perfect.
2024-02-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"The great location and simple cute decor overcame some of the things I experienced that were not 4-5 star level. The challenges started with the host sending me the wrong address/info, leading to my not having a parking spot and attempting to get into a unit where others were staying (very awkward as it was occupied!). Adorable place once we got to the right spot, though was disappointed to find no tea or sugar, which are usually standard (only Splenda for the Folgers coffee). It felt set up for a single overnight versus a longer stay, or maybe for one person, as there were only three mugs and minimal silverware, so we had to wash things by hand if we wanted an afternoon cup of tea or one the next morning… or we could run the dishwasher nearly empty (2 dishwasher pods available). I soaked and washed dirty dishes I pulled from the shelves (yuck). Loud heating system and bathroom fans, and a dimmer would be nice. Host was responsive and plans to address issues, so I still recommend!"

The unit is right on the Main St but the neighbors and the area were really quiet. We were there on a Thursday-Saturday stay and no issues with noise. The one bathroom is inside the entrance of the only bedroom. It was not an issue for my son and me. The fold down couch is also in the same bedroom as the bed.

This place is a great location if you have business at Purdue. The bathroom was stocked with all the things you could easily forget, very nice touch.
Main Street is where you want to be for a great bakery, Scones and Doilies, and an amazing restaurant, La Scala, and an independent bookstore."

Better than the pictures."
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Burt's place was exactly like the pictures and as described. Very cool vibe and comfortable bed. I really appreciated the personal touches he added like the welcome sign and snacks as well. Location can't be beat either. Walkable neighborhood with so many incredible bars and restaurants within walking distance. Burt was very communicative and helpful as well.
The only challenge I had was with the stairwell and front door area of the building being VERY poorly lit, but that is outside of Burt's control. I checked in after dark, and then when I left the building in the evening and came back, I just had to use my cell phone flashlight.
Would absolutely stay again though!"

Great recommendations for local cuisine. We loved people watching while getting ready and loved playing with the cats across the street at the Cat Cafe on the way home. I am a stickler for cleanliness and this place was immaculate. Very well appointed furnishings and decorations. My husband and I both agree we want to go back in time and have live in this as our bachelor/bachelorette pad. Will definitely visit again!
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We loved Burt's place in the heart of Lafayette. It's everything you could want. Excellent location, close to great restaurants.

2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"When entering the building it appears to be a typical apartment. But once you open the door, it’s a big “Wow”. The way everything has been remodeled with its unique look inside is real cool. The view out the street is fantastic. It is close to several dinning restaurants. Best part of all Burt replies with out hesitation. Good costumer service. Looking forward booking in the future."
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Clean, centrally located and well stocked. A great value!!"
2022-10-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Positives: The condo is very cool; The bed is super comfortable; The host left little treats like chips and candies.
Negatives: The outside steps from the assigned parking spot were decrepit... and the motion detection light goes out after like three seconds, making the trip up the 3 short flights very challenging in the dark; the toilet wasn't properly cleaned; the unusually long time gap between check out and check in (4pm and 10am) doesn't jive with AIRBNB or hotel norms. Should be 3pm and noon."
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The check-in process was easy and quick and I really appreciated how quickly the host got me into the space. I made the reservation on/after 3:30 pm and was in the space by 6:30 pm. Burt's condo is in a great location and I loved the way it was furnished. I was so much more comfortable than what I would have been in a hotel. This was my first ever Airbnb rental and I would definitely do it again. I'd recommend you consider staying here if you're looking for a place in Lafayette or West Lafayette, Indiana."

2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place is well located at 8 minutes drive from Purdue and was very comfortable.

2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"My husband and I enjoyed our recent quick little getaway to downtown Lafayette. This spacious and clean condo provided a great central location--easy to get to with dinner pickup only a few minutes' walk away. Burt was communicative and available via message to answer any questions and he sent helpful photos before check-in, showing the off-street parking spot and sharing easy check-in instructions. A detailed welcome folder conveyed all the info we might need while using the space. Plenty of towels, nice appliances/tv, and lots of dining and cute shopping options within walking distance. Would recommend for a couple's or solo getaway."
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"If I could give this place more than 5 stars, I would. The host, Burt, was extrenely kind and respectful throughout all communications with him
Checking process was very simple, and the place was very clean for us to stay there. Beds and sofas are extremely comfortable, and it has great amenities like wifi, a good kitchen, and on top of that an amazing view of some stores in downtown Lafayette.

I would definitely recommend this place to anyone interested in visiting Lafayette."

2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Wonderful condo & host! Very easy communicate with, very easy to check in & condo is fun, clean & well located. Great place cook & eat dinner or go out, because restaurants are very accessible. There are stairs the condo, FYI."
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The apartment was very spacious and comfortable. The bed was comfortable (I am picky, too). The kitchen was well-equipped and we used the desk and kitchen table for working on our laptops. Burt's wife must be an interior decorator - colors were coordinated and there were lots of little extra items. We enjoyed looking out at the street through the locust trees. The air conditioning system was excellent and easily cooled the apartment on very, very hot days. The washer and dryer worked well and were simple to operate. we would stay again at Burts if we are in the area. Note that there are quite a few stairs up to this apartment (it seems like 1 and a half stories up), so if you have mobility issues, this is not the apartment for you."
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Great stay! Awesome place with great style and great location for downtown fun. Easy walk to campus too, if you’re willing to trek a little. Super easy check-in and check-out and convenient parking too! Def recommend! :)"
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The host is very responsive and the property is quite nice. It was an excellent option for Lafayette and West Lafayette. The mattress was a little on the soft side for my personal preference, but it is well within normal expectations relative to hotels. (I often find hotel mattresses too soft as well.) I certainly hope to be able to stay at this property my next visit to the area."
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Burt’s place is great. Super conveniently located. Tons of cool places to walk to. He also came to our rescue at the last minute when our previously booked accommodations turned out to be a nightmare! Super communication and accuracy. Great host and great place.

2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Really cool fun experience. Super clean and very cozy. There were a lot of extras left for guest to enjoy on the coffee bar. It was great to sit and watch out the big windows and a plus that there are automatic blinds to keep out the light for sleeping. Would definitely stay there again. It’s across from a cat cafe but unfortunately it was closed. There is also a great coffee shop right below in the same building. The bed was comfortable and had nice crisp clean linens.

Couldn’t recommend it more!"
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Such a neat place in downtown Lafayette! The convenience is great - located right on top of a coffee shop and within walking distance to so many restaurants/attractions.
The place was very clean and Burt’s customer service was excellent! It was such an easy check in. This place was SO COOL. The amenities were great. You can tell that Burt really values the consumer experience and has thought of everything!
I recommend staying here 100/10 times. I had an amazing experience, I wish I could have stayed longer!"
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Everything about our stay was above and beyond. The space is beautiful, the accommodations comfortable, and the location unbeatable. Burt was communicative and helpful from booking to check-out, and he made sure that every detail was covered, from snacks to extra toiletries. We came to explore Lafayette, and you won't find a better-located stay for that—we were in walking distance of restaurants and breweries, shops and museums, the Purdue campus, even a farmer's market on the weekend. We barely even needed our car, though free parking with the unit was appreciated! Highly recommend this unit!"
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Exceeds all expectations

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Pictures are accurate. It's a comfortable space and was very clean. It's in a great location to walk around downtown or explore the area. The shower area does has a low ceiling, so anyone 6'+ will struggle there. Sound travels clearly through the walls in the loft during the day but the main floor is quieter. The host is very responsive.
The only big con was parking next to the dumpster. I had a couple of sketchy moments there, because of a situation unrelated to my stay, though no issues at all around the alley entrance to the apartment. I would recommend this place and certainly this host."
2024-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place is in a very convenient location! Additionally, the host responds to questions very quickly.

Located in the heart of old town, we were within walking distance of restaurants and shops. We were provided with little extras that were a welcoming touch. The bed was super comfortable and the sheets and towels were soft. We would stay there again, should we find ourselves in Lafayette again! Thank you, Burt! Kindly, Tutti and Mark."

2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"As someone that has never been in Lafayette, Indiana trying to find an airbnb to go tour Purdue I looked through airbnbs and found Burts. He had everything I needed listed and made sure to not leave any details out. He always responds as soon as he can and makes sure you don't get lost whether it be the passcode or trying to find a place to park the car you brought or are renting. I loved the airbnb and I can't wait to come again! Thank you so much Burt!!"

Clear instructions, every step. The location for us was perfect, a 30 minute walk to the Purdue Campus! Close to many restaurants, evening spots, coffee shops and a cat cafe.
Even though this was downtown, it was a very quiet location.
We definitely felt as if we got more than what we paid for! Thank you for the perfect location!"

,,,"Be very weary of renting from this host. I spent all day traveling, reserved this property and the host never contacted me with check in code details. I made multiple attempts including messages through the app and phone calls to try to reach this host. AirBNB customer support couldn’t even get ahold of the host. Needless to say after more than 2 hours of trying to resolve the issue with this host I was forced to find somewhere else to stay for the night."
