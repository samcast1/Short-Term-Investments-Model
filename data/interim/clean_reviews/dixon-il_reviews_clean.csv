2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Had a great stay. Elizabeth was very responsive with any questions we had. It was the quiet weekend getaway that we needed.
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Great place to stay! Beautiful home located right next to the river that makes you feel at peace with the nature.
2024-06-01,5.0,Group trip,We had a great weekend on the Rock River. Enjoyed the sights of the local state parks while celebrating our NIU graduate.
2024-04-01,4.0,Group trip,loved the location. Chock full of everything you might need for cooking. Bathrooms clean and nicely done. Rear deck and fire pit nice.
2024-04-01,4.0,Group trip,"The river house was nice, and had a lot of great items in the kitchen for cooking and living room for entertaining. The grill didn’t work, but we enjoyed the large fire pit and they had a lot of wood to burn and cookware to put meat in to roast over the fire so we were able to make meals over the fire which was nice. Bring a lighter though because starting the fire was an interesting achievement for us day one, but day two we were able to keep it going from the night before. The water pressure wasn’t that great, but the bathrooms were fully stocked, and clean. The kids had a great time listening to records, and playing their guitar. We all enjoyed river view, their canoe is gorgeous, and while we didn’t catch any fish, it was a charming, cozy stay in a nice river home. Our children had a blast!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful riverside house. Comfortable and convenient. En plein coeur de la nature.
2024-03-01,5.0,Group trip,This was a great place to stay with a lovely river running in the backyard. Elizabeth was always responsive and so friendly!
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Elizabeth’s place was great. We were in town to visit my grandmother for the weekend. We had a 5 year old and an 8 year old with us who loved all the toys.
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Elizabeth was very responsive and flexible with check in and checking out. I got all the information that I needed before and during our stay at her home. This Airbnb is perfect for kids as they have many toys in the house and in the garage.
2024-02-01,5.0,Group trip,"This was my first experience renting an Airbnb, and I couldn't be more impressed! Elizabeth was an exceptional host. She contacted me before the trip and gave me detailed information to make our check in easy and helpful information to help us make the most out of our stay.
The house was in pristine condition and had ALL the amenities you would need. Truly all you need to bring is food, the rest is already there to enjoy! You can tell that Elizabeth has spent a lot of care and time into making sure her guests enjoy their stay. She was very friendly and easy to communicate with.
The location is right on the Rock River and close to surrounding towns. You don't need to leave, but if you do, there are many things close in the area to enjoy.
I would absolutely book with her again!"

2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Perfect location surrounded by nature.
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Elizabeth’s place was very nice, well kept and located not too far from downtown Oregon. It had everything we needed and beds were very comfortable for all six of us. The kids loved that there were toys & books. We will stay there again; especially in warm weather when we can enjoy the outdoors. Elizabeth was very quick to respond and a great host!"
2023-12-01,5.0,Group trip,"We had an amazing stay at this Riverfront Retreat in Oregon, Illinois! The spacious and cozy interior, updated kitchen, and delightful river views made our time truly special. The deck with a BBQ and the backyard fire pit added to the charm. The location is perfect, just minutes away from hiking spots and the river access is a bonus. The recent renovations and thoughtful amenities, like the pack-and-play, made it family-friendly. Whether you’re looking to fish, hike, or simply unwind, this retreat has it all. Highly recommend!"
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I really enjoyed the stay, felt a lot more at home than most places I stay for work."
2023-12-01,5.0,Group trip,"We loved this home. It was very comfortable and perfectly met our needs. The home is pristine, well kept, with a very organized kitchen. It is as nice as the photos. The host was very responsive and helpful. 5 star experience all around."
2023-12-01,5.0,Group trip,"6 of us went here for a girls weekend, it was perfect! The house was very clean & had everything you would need, if you chose to do any cooking, we did not we checked out the restaurants instead. There is a Great Mexican restaurant I highly recommend. Cute little shops to check out as well.
Elizabeth was very responsive to any ? we had. Definitely will be staying here again"
2023-12-01,5.0,Group trip,"We loved everything about this property. The home was very clean, tidy and had everything we needed. Elizabeth was very responsive and great to work with. We would definitely stay again!"
2023-11-01,5.0,Group trip,"We love the house on the river. We had a great time, the house was just it was described and the surrounding is just beautiful. We will be back."
2023-11-01,5.0,Group trip,Excellent stay close to castle rock with great view of river!
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We really enjoyed our stay. Lovely spot on rock river with easy access to local state parks.
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We enjoyed the beautiful sunrise and sunset over the tops of the trees each day. A bald eagle showed up around 4pm almost every evening to rest for while in full view across the river. A bird lovers spot with all forest on the other side of the river. My husband and I enjoyed cooking in the open kitchen. So nice to cook in a kitchen that is set up by someone that cooks. We especially liked the beautiful wood cutting boards. We both slept great each night. So private and peaceful. We reluctantly left to go hiking each day. We look forward to staying here again in the future.
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This place was just what we needed. A countryside getaway in the fall at a beautiful property, furnished with all the comforts, with lovely indoors and outdoors. The place had everything for our family with senior parents to a 1 year old infant.
Elizabeth was proactive, kind and easy to communicate with, even in the middle of a major life event. She shared local recommendations and pointed us to various resources at home for our kid. We cooked, had a campfire, hiked at nearby trails, took walks around the property, and cozied up next to the fireplace with a book and hot chocolate.
Will definitely be going back for the summer!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,It was a very peaceful place to stay. They were very quick to respond to any questions we had. I would highly recommend this place to anyone looking for a nice peaceful getaway.
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Loved the house! It was absolutely gorgeous, wish we didn't try and pack so much into the weekend so we could have enjoyed the actual house a little more, but it definitely worked for our needs!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"One of my favorite airbnbs so far! I was looking for a waterfront place, and this country home by the river was perfect. My friend and I would take our chairs and sit and read or talk down by the river...so peaceful watching the river and the fish jump. The house itself is decorated with a quiet palette, and the way the kitchen is stocked with spices and pots and pans (even vanilla!) and the bathroom has extra toothpaste in a drawer, feels very thoughtful and welcoming. My bed was very comfortable as well. The only possible drawback, which doesn't deter me from coming back, is that there is some periodic road noise from Illinois 2, but you don't hear it in the house."
2023-09-01,5.0,Group trip,"Elizabeth was a very gracious host for a post-engagement weekend getaway. It can sleep 8, but was a very comfortable place for 4. The kitchen was a joy to cook and socialize in, and the outdoor space was well kept."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a wonderful time at Elizabeth's home. The home was clean, comfortable beds, everything you need as far as cooking items and toiletries. Beautiful view of the river and great fishing on the bank right outside the house. Area is very private and peaceful, we would definitely like to come back someday. We had a little issue with the garage door and the DVD player and Elizabeth was quick to respond. Oregon itself was very nice also. Plenty of hiking, antique shopping and we did kayaking on the river....Thanks again Elizabeth for a memorable time!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We went with another couple for a quiet and relaxing weekend. Elizabeth’s place was just what we needed. The rippling of the river behind her home created a very relaxing atmosphere. Elizabeth was so accommodating and kept in contact with us before arriving to be sure our weekend met our needs and expectations. The home was clean,well maintained, and stocked with the essentials! Great experience."
2023-09-01,5.0,Group trip,"The place is truly Paradise! Thanks to the owners for a wonderful vacation! The house is wonderful. Everything is thought out to the smallest detail. Very comfortable! The views from the house to the river, especially at dawn, were simply mesmerizing! The yard is well maintained and spacious. We really enjoyed spending time around the fire pit. Quiet and cozy place. We'll come again!!!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We had a great stay.
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"If I could give this place 6 or 7 stars, I would. With Airbnb filled to the rafters with perfectly acceptable but soulless accommodation, this is throw back to the platform's early days.
Elizabeth's house backs on to the Rock River, and it's off the main road so it's wonderfully secluded. Outside the main things we heard were cicadas and the river. It's so relaxing.
Inside, the house has been tastefully renovated and feels lived in. The kitchen is stocked with almost every item imaginable, the cookware is top grade, and there are plenty of condiments and spices to make tasty meals. (Side hint: get some local corn, it's crazy sweet and delicious.)
The couch, and beds are all very comfortable. And although we only spent a few nights here, we felt fully refreshed.
There's plenty to do at house too with canoes, a zip line, fishing gear, plenty of kids' toys, and board games.
Internet is available, but it's slow, which was great for our needs, but not if you want to work remotely."
2023-08-01,4.0,Group trip,"There were a lot of things in the garage to use while staying here. We did go out and buy some bag-o bags because it looked like some mice got into them. We also brought some fishing gear because there were poles, but nothing to use to fish with. All-in-all it was a fabulous experience."
2023-08-01,5.0,Group trip,"The house is very cozy and intimate and private, with a nice view, we enjoyed the backyard and spent most of our time outside. The beds were super comfy and clean, along with plenty of washed towels available in both restrooms, the living room area was also very cozy and comfortable. Elizabeth was also a great host, she was very responsive and made sure check in went well as well as check out. The River house also had everything you might need for your stay. We enjoyed our stay and would book again:)"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Weenjoyed the peace and serenity. The house was perfect for us and our children.
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We booked Elizabeth's home for a getaway and it was wonderful. It is quite charming. Her thoughtful touches made the space very homey.
Elizabeth was always responsive and made sure we had a nice stay. We would not hesitate to book again."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We wanted a country getaway for our family (kids aged 2, 4, and 7), and we could not have asked for a better time. The house is stocked with joys for kids: games, toys, a mini kitchen and chalk board, and even a vintage school desk filled with art supplies. The kids' room had everything you would need if you had smaller children: baby monitors, a pack & play, portable high chair, etc. Outside there is a mowed pathway along the river (no swimming due to the current) and the garage had lots of treasures for kids and adults alike: a canoe, fishing poles, a ""bags"" set, and other outdoor games. There is even a mini zip line my kids spent hours on, dragging one another back / forth. With four bedrooms, everyone slept comfortably and peacefully. There is a motion detector light in the hallway for middle-of-the-night needs. We visited during the Ogle County Fair, so between carnival rides, cotton candy, running/zipping around the River House, my 7 year old said it was the best day of her life!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My wife needed some time to reconnect with nature in a beautiful setting and a slower pace of life for a few days. This place absolutely delivered.
THE SETTING: the drive to the home through small towns, state parks and rolling hills is a retreat in and of itself.
THE PROPERTY: After you drive down a narrow paved drive, you come to a gravel road path which immediately reminds you that life is now slower and simpler and to pump the brakes and look around. The old home looks like a miniature farm house mansion-of-old. The pictures on the Airbnb site are nice, but pale in comparison to the actual charm we felt pulling up. Out back it's just you, trees & the Rock River.
THE HOUSE: Nice modern finishes coupled with vintage touches. The kitchen has everything you may need, most brand new, including a Brita in the fridge with filtered H2O, a stocked Keurig, appliances, etc. FYI there is no recycling on site. Upstairs there are four perfectly quant bedrooms with new bathrooms. We'll be back"
2024-06-01,5.0,Group trip,"Outstanding stay. Very clean and comfortable. Relaxation in a multitude of ways. Sit on multiple decks with a breeze, fishing, hot tub, sauna, fire pit, boating. Loved it and plan to be back."
2024-06-01,5.0,Group trip,"The location was perfect for a weekend getaway, and Mike was super responsive."
2024-04-01,5.0,Group trip,"This island home was perfectly secluded with 360-degree water views, private gate access. Mike, the host, was very responsive! Ideal for families, with plenty of games and child-friendly furnishings. Every detail caters to comfort and convenience—offering a large communal area with multiple hangout areas both in and outside. Luxurious mattresses with extra linens and towels. Fully equipped kitchen with a complimentary espresso machine. Only a 9-minute drive to restaurants and a 10-minute drive to a golf course.
This island home is not just a place to stay—it’s a destination in itself, promising an unforgettable experience that combines the serenity of an island retreat with the comforts of a luxury home. It’s a must-book for anyone looking to unwind and indulge in the beauty of nature with all the comforts of modern living!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Group trip,Was an amazing stay for friends or family. Private and away from ppl if you want a little get away. Beautiful and so many activities.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Perfect.
2024-03-01,5.0,Group trip,"Great place for relaxing away from the city, 100% privacy, everything in this house exceeds our expectations, Mike was a great host, responsive time less than one minute.
Will come back soon!"
2024-03-01,5.0,Group trip,Mike was a great host! His place is beautiful and really is a great place to gather. Good amenities and private.
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Highly recommend; although a family emergency stopped us short of fully experiencing this unique home it is truly spectacular.
Highly recommend"
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Nice spot to hangout for a few days. We had a large group with several kids and everyone had a good time.
2023-11-01,3.0,Group trip,"First, I'll give you the good- The place is a lovely house, and the location is beautiful. The site is truly an island and is very private.
However, I will tell you that my issue with this place was the mice problem. Every room had evidence of mice droppings—even Some of the drawers in the kitchen. Twice in broad daylight, we saw a mouse running from one end of the room to the other. I understand that the house is by a river and the the first night, I told my kids, ""It's because we are by a river."" But then, I noticed how it was a bigger problem: bad. There are plenty of ways to combat this problem; there is no reason for this. It is very unhealthy for anyone staying there."
2023-10-01,5.0,Group trip,We had a large group and had plenty of space to be together. Home was clean and organized. Would recommend for others to use for a get away.
2023-10-01,5.0,Group trip,Awesome location and views! So relaxing and a great place for a good time with friends.
2023-08-01,5.0,Group trip,"An absolutely beautiful property. Unfortunately 100 degree weather hindered using the sauna or hot tub. The listing said that the house was stocked and ready to go. Toilet paper, coffee pods, pots/pans, games, high chair. Everything we would need was there. It could be a little buggy out when grilling, but completely understandable given its proximity to the Rock River. Great experience! We’ll definitely do it again. Maybe winter?"
2023-08-01,4.0,Group trip,It truly is your own island! House has great amenities. Responsive host! But wish it was a little more organized and carefully kept for the price.
2023-07-01,5.0,Group trip,"A nice house with many places to entertain inside and out. Plenty of beds, linens, pillows, an air mattress.
One bedroom with 3 beds has a small window A/C and there's larger window unit in the living room. It was over 100F outside when we arrived so it took a little time to cool. The bar and pool table rooms in the basement stayed cool though without A/C. I would bring fans for the other bedrooms if it's going to be over 90F but we were outside 90% of our time thanks to the kayaks, hot tub, fire pit, sauna, paddle boat, grill, smoker, fishing, etc.
Bring your own tupperware, Ziploc bags, and paper towels but otherwise the kitchen is well-stocked.
For kayaking, plan to walk back from the nearby boat launch if you leave the cove because if it's rained recently, you won't be able to paddle against the current to come back.
An overall great weekend with 8 of us, each in our own bed, which is hard to find!"
2023-07-01,4.0,Group trip,"We had a great time at the private island, which truly is private. Lots to do at the house, and Dixon is a short drive away. Mike was an excellent host. The house was very clean, and he was responsive when I had questions. I do wish the house had Wi-Fi, and the faucet water is a little gross. Regardless, I highly recommend staying here."
2023-07-01,5.0,Group trip,Easy check in process. Enjoyed the stay with friends on a peaceful island!
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Unique beautiful spot on the rock river in northern IL. Plenty of space to spread out for the whole family. Linens and pillows were very comfortable. Hot tub and sauna with views of the river were amazing. River is really low from the lack of rain but kids still had plenty of fish to keep them busy. Large umbrellas on front and back decks were nice addition for warm sunny days. Assume being on the river with a shallow well and low water level may have caused the sulfur smell in the water faucets. Other then that wonderful memorable experience!
2023-07-01,5.0,Group trip,Great cozy place! Lots of space indoor and outdoors! I highly recommend for a family vacation.
2023-07-01,5.0,Group trip,"This cabin style home is in a beautiful surrounding! The home is large and can easily accommodate a large group. The kitchen was lacking on utensils for a large group- but, we made do. Mike was extremely responsive to questions and did his best to make everything comfortable for us. It truly was a peaceful property and great house!"
2023-06-01,4.0,Group trip,Beautiful property

2023-06-01,5.0,Group trip,This is a really cool property for a group of friends or family. The house is very spacious and being on an island offers great views and privacy. Would highly recommend to anyone looking to get away from the city!
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This is such a gorgeous place to stay! We had plenty of comfortable space for our big family, and there was lots to do indoors and outdoors"
2023-05-01,5.0,Group trip,Perfect experience for a private get away trip
2023-05-01,5.0,Group trip,"Perfect place for a guys weekend! Beautiful yard and space with tons of seating options outside and inside. We loved all the amenities Mike had available (sauna, hot tub, kayaks, grills, towles, extra blankets, etc.). I would definitely come back"
2023-05-01,5.0,Group trip,"Had a great time, super nice home with much to do!"
2023-04-01,5.0,Group trip,Mike was an excellent host! And his retreat is amazing! We may have to plan another girls retreat again next year! It was perfect for a gathering. We especially enjoyed the steam room.
2023-04-01,5.0,Group trip,"Great place to stay, ill suggest it for more people."
2023-04-01,5.0,Group trip,Mike's private island was the perfect weekend getaway. It's located approximately 1.5 hrs from Chicago and offered awesome amenities for a guy's weekend. I'd highly recommend it for anyone looking for a fun and/or peaceful escape with a group of loved ones.
2023-03-01,5.0,Group trip,Great place to spend time with friends and family.
2023-02-01,5.0,Group trip,Great place for a weekend getaway. Sauna and hot tub were the best perks for our crew.

2022-12-01,5.0,Group trip,Awesome place and great getaway!
2022-12-01,5.0,Group trip,"Great place to stay, Mike was a quality host!"
2022-11-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"The Private Island House is a great opportunity to unwind on beautiful grounds with many amenities. It was very clean and the new furniture was pristine, as well as cozy. There isn't, however, a second living room with three more sleeping places. I recommend confirming with the owner about any changes to the property before you arrive, in case that has been updated. Our group was hoping to use the extra sleeping spaces so we wouldn't have to double-up, but those sleeping spaces didn't exist. Additionally, the hot tub was not in safe condition (brown water) upon arrival so I suggest you confirm with the owner that the issue has been resolved before booking your stay. Lastly, I recommend you bring your own towels as we did not have enough to accommodate our group."
2024-06-01,5.0,Group trip,We throughly enjoyed our stay. Everyone left happy and we’re hoping to book again next summer.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This was our second time staying at this property.
We will definitely be back!!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Group trip,This house was perfect for our girls weekend! Plenty of room for our large group and everyone had their own space to sleep. Would definitely stay here again!
2024-04-01,5.0,Group trip,This was my second time at this location and this time it was with a group of girls and it was just as wonderful! We enjoyed being away from the hustle and bustle and just relaxing and talking with friends. Lots of wildlife and peaceful surroundings. Great space for playing games and sharing meals and just being together. Beds are comfortable and had all we needed in the kitchen. Loved the deck and didn't get to use the firepit but it looked awesome! We will definitely be back! Thanks Heather for a beautiful place!
2024-04-01,5.0,Group trip,Heather was very nice and responsive the entire time of my stay. Never had any issues from check in to check out. The house was clean and spacious to host a gathering.
2024-03-01,5.0,Group trip,"This stay was incredible. There was so much space and the house was exactly what we needed. It is amazing for a larger group. The driving instructions Heather gave were very helpful and needed. The only difficulty was lack of towels, but everything else was sheer perfection."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Beautiful and peaceful place to stay. It was a little tricky to find, but with the directions given by the host it got you right there. Host was responsive and helpful."
2024-02-01,5.0,Group trip,"When I first stumbled upon this AirBnB, it seemed almost too good to be true. I thought there must be a catch! Lol, But everything was as perfect as it seemed online. Heather is the most thoughtful, gracious host. She included all the information we may need from restaurant recommendations to surrounding places and things to do. It is the perfect getaway to disconnect from the world for a few days and enjoy family. Honestly I can't say enough about this place, there is more than enough room for a group of up to 16 people. The lounging areas outside & sitting in nature made it even better. Just 2 hours outside of Chicago. A quick & nice getaway for me to relax and enjoy my Birthday with family and the weather was nice considering it's February. Me and my family plan to return soon! If you came across this Airbnb and you are considering booking GO FOR IT! you won't be disappointed."
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We loved this cabin because there was so much room for our large and growing family to sprawl out and run around in. Lots of new family memories made here!
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Cozy, roomy, spacious, multigenerational. Our second year was just as great as our first visit. Heather is very accommodating and responsive."
2024-01-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,Heather’s place was great for a large group. Beautiful surroundings with lots of space.
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"My family of 11 (inc 4 teenage grandkids who love space away from the adults) used Heather’s cabin for our Christmas get-together. The house is so beautiful on its own but Heather even went a step further by putting out some Christmas decorations and a 14’ foot Christmas tree in front of the two story windows. Gorgeous. Lots of beds, 4 full bathrooms, big kitchen, big sectional with large tv in the living room, and a huge family room/game room downstairs for the teens. We live in 3 directions - all 3 hrs from the house - so such a treat to all be together in one house for 3 days. All in all - pretty perfect for my family. As we were leaving, my grandkids asked when we were coming back. I said soon."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Beautiful location to go to when you want to escape the city! No wifi— but if your goal is to enjoy nature and your family’s company, this is the place to go to!"
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This home was a welcome retreat for our family! We had 12 adults and 7 kids under 10 and there was plenty of room for us all. Lots of open space for us all to hang out together and spaces for us to get away as well. They even had a 12 ft Christmas tree there to help us celebrate!
Heather was a great host and she provided answers to questions ahead of time for us to be able to pack what we needed and even checked on us the first morning to be sure we were comfortable!
One thing if you have a larger group…be sure to bring some extra towels!
We will definitely be returning in warmer weather so we can enjoy the outdoor areas more!!
Thanks Heather for helping our family make lots of memories together!!"

2023-10-01,5.0,Group trip,"I booked this home for a wedding and it was great! We had a large group so we needed a big home to stay in and this one provided exactly what we were looking for.

The surrounding is so calm and quiet and full of nature. Heather is very responsive. Overall we all are super satisfied and wish to come again.
2023-08-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"Very spacious and beautiful secluded spot. We felt very at home with space to spread out. The layout was awesome and everyone had a nice clean bed and the bathrooms were very nice.
Lots of open stairs with No way to secure a baby gate- so a little stressful with little ones, but we made it work.
We really enjoyed our weekend and would recommend to anyone trying to get away."

2023-06-01,5.0,Group trip,This was a great weekend and just a perfect place for our college families to get together. Our kids were able to meet for the first time and all the adults were able to jump right back in to college days like we never left. The house gave each family privacy with their own rooms but had the perfect size living spaces for everyone to hang out together as well. I hope we choose to use this place in the future for our yearly college get together s. The host was amazing. Timely and very helpful. Just a beautiful place and very private which made it even more peaceful. I would recommend this listing to anyone looking for a quiet weekend. 10/10 just awesome and thank you Heather for being an amazing host.
2023-06-01,5.0,Group trip,my daughter's wedding was occurring locally - this was the perfect place for the bride's family to camp out during the festivities

2023-06-01,3.0,Stayed with kids,"Would be a very nice place if it was cleaner & better maintained… air intake vent was caked with dirt; interior of fridge/freezer was disgusting. Found a mangled empty beer can in the ice dispenser. Took me an hour to clean the entire fridge before we could put our food in it. Mouse turds in some kitchen cabinets & drawers. Remote for TV was missing. Never did find it, but we found plenty of other nasty stuff under sofa cushions & beds. Faucets in master bath were very loose & the deck is deteriorating. Heather was understanding & apologetic and gave us a partial refund of the cleaning fee."
2023-05-01,5.0,Group trip,Love it! So nice house! Totally worth it!
2023-05-01,5.0,Group trip,"What a great place to stay! Very convenient to Dixon and Oregon. We were in the area for our son's wedding. We were able to have my sisters and their families, and our mom and dad stay under the same roof. With all those people you could still find a quiet spot if you chose. It is difficult ult to find because GPS wants to take you through a neighborhood that the property backs up to , but there is no access that way. Heather was very clear in her check-in instructions to point this out and give you instructions how to get there. We only had trouble with those arriving after dark.
Heather is very responsive, flexible, and pleasant. We will definitely stay again when we are back in the area."
2023-05-01,5.0,Group trip,"This place stood out amongst the rest. It was spacious, seclusive and well equipped. Most Airbnbs don’t have enough, towels, linen, cookware or any food seasonings but this place had it all. My family, friends and I had the time of our life. We laughed, cried and laughed some more. Made tons of memories and look forward to more. Heather truly was super responsive, thank you for being such an OUTSTANDING host. Don’t hesitate book this place NOW!!!"

2023-04-01,5.0,Group trip,Great place .. Heather is very nice and responsive
2023-03-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"We stayed for a long weekend and came away very happy with our stay. The house had a great relaxing feel and had plenty of room to spread out for our large group. The beds were comfy and noise did not carry from the main living areas to the bedrooms. The kids loved the arcade game in the basement and the big kitchen was a great gathering spot.
A few things that needed attention. The fireplaces did not work, there were quite a few lightbulbs out throughout the house, one of the sinks was leaking, and one of the bathroom doors wouldn’t fully close. All minor inconveniences that didn’t make a big impact on the overall trip but should be fixed.
We had a great time overall."
2023-03-01,5.0,Group trip,"The accommodations were perfect for our group. It's a lovely house for a large group, and the basement area is perfect for family activities."

2023-02-01,5.0,Group trip,Thanks Heather.
2023-02-01,4.0,Group trip,"Loved the location and the home. There were a lot of requirements for checking out and cleaning - asking us to sweep, do a load of laundry, strip the beds, wipe the counters, which we felt were a bit excessive. Otherwise the stay was lovely! Also of note, the downstairs is extremely cold (like ten degrees more than the upstairs). But we didn’t spend a lot of time down there so didn’t really matter."
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"My family and I loved loved loved your home Heather. The 2 new electric fireplaces worked great. It came in very handy since it’s the only source of heat on the lower level. It took the chill out of the air. The kitchen had plenty of bowls, dishes, towels, silverware, pots, and even spices. The beds were comfortable too.
Your yard is huge and we spent most of the day in the backyard. We hope to come back again next year."
2023-01-01,5.0,Group trip,"Great house .Recommended! Beautiful territory, everything is clean. We had a great time."
2023-01-01,5.0,Group trip,"My friends and I loved our stay at the cabin. We spent most of our time in the kitchen and living room area and there was plenty of space for our group of 7. We ventured into Dixon and Oregon for brunch and a little shopping and it was great. Especially loved Cork and Tap for drinks. Heather was very responsive to questions and the place is as described.
One little thing to note, none of the fireplaces are operating right now as they are waiting for an inspector to come and it didn't sound like they knew when that would be possible. We were a little bummed that we didn't know that until 2 days before our stay but it wouldn't have changed our decision to book.
We would definitely visit again, especially when the weather is warmer so we can take advantage of the large deck and nearby trails."

2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Beautiful home and land to enjoy with your family for a long weekend. Slept 15 of us comfortably (12 adults). Plenty to do inside and out, very accommodating!!
Recommended for families with children young and old as there is a basement full of games and a safe gas fire place to keep them warm.

Heather was an excellent communicator and replied almost instantly when we had a question or issue which was not often. I highly recommend this place"
2022-09-01,5.0,Group trip,"Heather’s Airbnb was an absolute dream venue to use for our intimate wedding. Heather was an amazing communicator and went out of her way to meet as at the property twice before the wedding.
We turned the backyard into the wedding of our dreams. The home was so spacious and we were able to have about 10 of our friends and family members stay with us all weekend. We used the loft as the bridal suite and the lower level was used as the groomsmen room. Which was so perfect because they were able to use the arcade games, darts and foosball.
The house was secluded and so well stocked and all our guests were very impressed!
Thank you for allowing us to use your property 💕"

2022-07-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"Loved the large backyard for family games, including a treasure hunt.

The online listing was accurate and gave us a good idea of what the property was all about before we arrived. Heather's communication throughout the process was excellent and that was important to us. The property is beautiful and located in a quiet, rural area which was ideal for us. The home was actually larger than we anticipated which was great and the backyard was a lot of fun for our kids to play in."

Well stocked kitchen. The property is beautiful. Lots of deck space. Large yard and big fire pit area that we used every night. Lots of parking for all our guests who came from Minnesota, Indiana, Illinois and Wisconsin. Board games, darts, and arcade style game kept us all busy the one day it rained.

My husband grew up one block away on Fellows St
We loved walking around the neighborhood and reminiscing his childhood memories.
While walking Jim stopped and talked to lifelong friends that still live there.
Grandma’s House was the perfect location for family and friends to come visit while we were there.
It’s very open and spacious with several sitting areas to accommodate all our visitors.
Judith had the refrigerator and cabinets stocked with anything and everything we could possibly need.
Every kitchen appliance you can imagine.

2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Just Amazing! I can't say enough good about our stay.
Judi was an amazing host. She went above and beyond all of our expectations! She bent over backwards, on a holiday, for us. She did more than we even asked for.
""Grandma's house"" was a very accurate. I couldn't believe the decor... many of the decorations were the exact same ones my grandma had! Even those that weren't exactly the same were definitely her style. It was like a trip down memory lane.. just like my grandma's house, only much bigger and with WiFi, BluRay, and Smart TVs! Tons of books, and games, and movies for the kids, too! Plenty of room for our extended family and a big Thanksgiving dinner! Fully stocked, had almost everything you could possibly need already available, even food staples for us to use.
Also, very clean, comfortable, and good value for the amount of space! Would definitely stay there if we need a place in Dixon again!"

Big furnace registers, lots of light, and Judith left me bottled water and fresh fruit. The neighborhood is homey and sort of old school in a very charming way.

Our kids enjoyed playing with the toys and also enjoyed the candies in bowls around the house. We quickly came to realize if we needed something, it was probably there somewhere – the house is well stocked. The kitchen had all the appliances and accessories you'd need, and there was plenty of bedding provided. The host made us feel very welcome and had a great response time to texts. One of our favorite parts of the house had to be the screened in front porch – one day in particular it was raining and we ate a late lunch on the porch (which has tons of chairs and tables). It was such a great memory from our visit."

Everything was clean. We were most impressed that the owner provided fresh fruit, bagels, bottled water, milk, coffee, etc. upon our arrival. It was such a nice treat to have everything we needed when we woke up from arriving late Friday night. Our kids especially enjoyed ""Alexa"" to play music & learn cool trivia. There were several air mattresses available & pull out couches for additional sleeping accommodations. We would most certainly rent here again when visiting our extended family in Dixon. It beats multiple hotel rooms for sure!"
2017-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Judith's home is incredibly comfortable, spacious, and lovely. The decor is charming, without being overwhelming. She was well prepared for our family, and had an ample selection of fruit, coffee, cocoa, and bagels. Although the street is busy, there was no road noise in the house. The kids had fun with ""Alexa"", and all of the smart TVs, WiFi, etc were nice to have available. There is only one shower/bath, but there surprisingly wasn't a hot water issue! So for larger groups, be prepared to make up a bath schedule. The closets are huge, and we were able to fit a crib or pack n play in each one! The house is conveniently close to a couple of parks, shopping and restaurants. Judith is sweet and amazing to work with! We all said we would rent her place again!"

It was a very comfortable and well equipped home. We enjoyed the outside fireplace. If we had time, it would have been fun to use the outside pizza oven.
Thank you to our hosts!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Group trip,"Great location, clean, welcoming, and most of all, very peaceful.
Definitely recommend it!!"
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We really enjoyed staying in this place to get away from it all. Such peaceful and beautiful surroundings. It was so nice that each of the 3 bedrooms had a separate bathroom right next to it for privacy for our family and the grandparents too. It was so nice to have a kitchen connected to the living room and dining room so we could all spend time together. The rooms and lofts provided some space and privacy too,"
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Wonderful.
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This is such an amazing home! We had everything we needed at our fingertips and Dina and her husband James were right across the street should we have needed anything. The home is so spacious, yet felt just like home. It's nestled in the woods, so even though there are neighbors around it is very secluded. There are hiking trails right off the backyard, and two parks and more hiking trails just down the road! The pictures do not do it justice! Thank you for such a wonderful stay! We will definitely be back!"
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Amazing place to stay. Clean, quiet, and just what I needed on a work trip."
2022-09-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,Huge cabin with room for lots of people! The kitchen was well equipped. Extra blankets in all the rooms and other little extra touches throughout. There were some small hiccups but the host was very attentive to our needs and friendly. Could use a sweep for cobwebs but it is spider season so don’t count it against them. Cute rural area. Would definitely recommend for a family trip.
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great spot!
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Another great visit in Franklin Grove!
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"The house is beautiful and located in a wonderful area, rich in trails and untouched prairie. Best place to relax!"
2022-07-01,5.0,Group trip,Place was great. Came with so many little extras you might forget to bring yourself. Will definitely be dropping by again

2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Lovely cozy cabin in a great location! Loved it
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"GREAT location, way better than expected. It is within walking distance of a fishing lake, a paved trail, and several trails. Dina and Jim were so accommodating. They provided us with wood and the supplies to cook on the fire all weekend. There was a turtle laying a nest of eggs in the front yard when we left, so cool. There were 4 separate sleeping areas."
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,A roomy relaxing getaway
2021-12-01,5.0,Group trip,This was our second visit to Dina’s cabin. The cabin isn’t fancy but wonderful if you are looking for a cute place in the country to relax and unwind. Dina and her husband are wonderful hosts and very accommodating. Highly recommend.
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This cabin is roomy and offers a lot of value for it's cost. Dina our host did a fabulous job in communicating and having the cabin ready for our stay. This was our second stay and will continue to stay there when in the area.
Thanks,
RD"
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Nice rustic place for family bonding. This was our 4th time going. Leave your devices at home (no Wi-Fi) and enjoy your friends and family.
2021-10-01,5.0,Group trip,"Great town, great house, great amenities! We've been back to the house several times and will keep coming back!"
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Nice space for the kids to run around.
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place and lovely area to explore.
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We had a delightful time staying in this home. The loft is fun, the back yard is great and the fireplace outside a really nice setting for evening s’mores! There is no WiFi (it is noted in the listing as such) and our cell service was spotty in the area, so be prepared. But the delightful flora and fauna (and occasional horse-and-rider nearby over the fence) help you relax into the natural setting."
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This place is great, lot's of space, very comfortable, and has everything you would need."
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,If you want to get into nature and unwind this is the place. The cabin is beautiful and remote. The beds are comfortable. The kitchen has everything you need. Build a fire and relax. Right beside a very nice nature preserve with wonderful hiking trails. The whole area is brimming with the kind of charm you only get in rural areas. Perfect.
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Very well equipped and comfortable space, if you spend any time indoors! The surrounding natural area is wonderful- the fisherman stayed happy on the creek, the hikers on the trails. The Grist Mill had so much interesting information! The only downside on the house is the number of steps up onto the main floor. A person with mobility problems would find it challenging. If that’s not an issue, this is a place you will enjoy."
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Great place for our family
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Home was very clean and everything I expected and more. I wouldn’t mind renting again in the future.

2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,phenomenal place to stay. Nature all around and Dina & Jim are great hosts. want to go back.
2021-07-01,5.0,Group trip,"My sister and I and our teenage children had a wonderful time at Franklin Creek Cabin. The cabin was lovely, just what we were looking for to disconnect for a few days. We went trail running right near the cabin and on a long hike through Franklin Creek Nature Reserve right across the street. We also enjoyed s'mores that Dina provided which was so sweet! The cabin was very clean and had everything we needed for a comfortable stay. Thank you!"
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,This was our sixth stay at the Franklin Grove cabin and it never disappoints. The addition of the outdoor fireplace makes the place even more special.
2021-06-01,5.0,Group trip,"Second time back to this wonderful home! Love the proximity to nature and the amenities. My kids love making homemade pizza in the brick oven outside.
We'll be back soon!"
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The house had plenty of room to spread out and is in a beautiful natural setting. The kitchen is well stocked and you can hike tithe historic grist mill. My husband and I stayed here for a horse yoga retreat at Soul Farm in Amboy and it was a short drive to the event. This house would also have plenty of room for a multigenerational family get away.
2021-06-01,5.0,Group trip,"Thank you
We had a great time"
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Great cabin, plenty of room to spread out. The outdoor fireplace was great."
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"My son and I were looking for a place to go to get away from the city and it was great. There are trails at the back of the property that take you straight into the forest. The space itself is ample, clean and well stocked. I definitely recommend this wonderful stay."
2021-05-01,5.0,Group trip,Great hospitality! Thank you for hosting us for our stay.
2021-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay with Dina and James and loved the Franklin Creek area! The space was clean and open, plenty of room for a family of five. We loved the fire pit/pizza oven and used it every evening. Our soul purpose was the get away and enjoy the outdoors and we did just that. Franklin Creek had some great trails right out your back door and we did try fishing but had no luck catching anything. We also enjoyed a trip to the Bison and the Mill which was extremely informative and amazing technology for its time! James and Dina are a great team providing information about the area and anything you might need! We also ate twice at the Lincolnway Cafe for breakfast, right up the street, which was delicious!
We would absolutely stay again! Thanks again for a great trip!"
2021-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"The trail is really nice, make sure to bring your hiking shoes."
2021-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This house was a lovely and comfortable place to stay not too far outside of the Chicagoland. The surrounding area is very serene and tree-filled and there is lots of space inside and some nice extras like a fire pit/oven and indoor garage area. The hosts were great, clearing all the ice & snow so we could get around safely and surprising us with some cute flowers, balloons and candy in celebration of Valentines' Day. We had a very relaxing time and would like to come back in warmer weather!"
2020-12-01,5.0,Group trip,"Surrounded by trails and tranquility. We went for a winter getaway, and left wondering what summers would be like. Thanks for the firewood!"
2020-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This is a cute rustic cottage. The space is comfortable and outdoor patio with fireplace is great. Dina provided plenty of firewood which was really nice. The three levels with three full baths really gives everyone their space. We got a little snow while there and Dina’s husband came over and shoveled patios and got sleds out for the kids. Very quick communication! Hope we get to come back.
2020-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The host went above and beyond to accommodate us we had a great time look forward to staying there again
2020-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Stayed here with my family for an extended weekend and it was great. Great backyard area with a grill & fire pit, and close to 2 parks for kids. Plenty of indoor space for groups. Thoughtful touches throughout and stocked kitchen. Definitely recommend for group getaways!!"
2020-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Great cabin, lots of space and everything we could need for a weekend in nature. The kids had a great time running in the large yard and through the woods across the street. The fire out back was perfect for cool autumn nights."
2020-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,My friends and I loved this home. Everything was clean and we had all the comforts we needed. The property is lovely. We enjoyed being close to hiking trails and being surrounded by nature. We especially enjoyed the fabulous backyard fireplace. I hope to return soon!
2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"If you want to get into nature and away from everything else this is a great space. Plenty of room inside, but also great outside. Watched loads of birds in the morning from the porch and bats in the evening, walked to close by trails and the creek for hiking, fishing, and exploring. It was just what I was looking for and my kids liked it’s too (all teenagers)."
2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Great place to get away. Hiking trails within walking distance and a pond to take the kids fishing. Short drive to see buffalo and 20 minutes to canoeing on the rock river. We enjoyed our stay.
2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Second stay at this great place in Franklin Grove! Making plans for next year!
2020-07-01,5.0,Group trip,"Wow! So happy we decided to finally try Airb&b - Dina's home was our first rental. My family is very outdoorsy and we thought being out surrounded by a nature preserve and bison sounded heavenly! It truly was.
The home is spacious and Dina's touches are fantastic. The kitchen is well stocked and even has spices and coffee. Charcoal and lighter fluid were provided for the grill. Firewood was provided for the firepit and brick pizza oven. The space is bright, clean and welcoming.
We are planning to be back soon!"
2020-07-01,5.0,Group trip,"Dina’s place was amazing. Perfect place to get away from the city noise especially during the holiday weekend. Place was very spacious and stocked with everything we needed from cooking utensils, pots and pans. Fire wood for the fire pit/oven. Towels and toilet paper. Husband was very nice and welcoming and gave us a little back ground on the hiking grounds. Would definitely stay here again!"
2020-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place is awesome. A very beautiful location with great hiking trails within walking distance including a pond a creek with swimming spots. The yard and outdoor fireplace was excellent and the host provided all the wood we could need. They even had charcoal for the grill, so nice. We had four people in our group but the house would have been comfortable for more guests. Highly recommended! Under two hour drive from Chicago, we’ll definitely be back."
2020-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We stayed for two nights here. It's a nice cabin with skylight, lot's of room for a group of people if needed. The outdoor fireplace/sitting area was really nice. Dina was flexible and it was clear the place was well taken care of. Although it is only a 10-15 minute drive from Dixon, it had an air of peace and serenity in the middle of the woods."
2020-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,The home was very clean and spacious. It was a great place to relax and enjoy nature. We hope to return soon!
2020-06-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Good place to get away and spend quality time with friends and family.

2020-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,great host thanks
2019-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We’ve stayed at the Franklin Grove cabin at least seven times now. It’s convenient to all local destinations and yet secluded and quiet. We enjoy each stay.
2019-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We enjoyed the privacy and outdoor fireplace!
2019-09-01,5.0,Group trip,"I highly recommend Dina's cabin. The six of us stayed there and thought it was the perfect space for us. The kitchen was well-equipped, the living room comfy for us to hang out, the bedrooms and bathrooms are spacious. Everything was very clean, which I always appreciate. The location was perfect for what we had planned that weekend. Too bad it rained all weekend so we didn't get to enjoy the beautiful deck and outdoor fireplace in the back -- hope to do that when we return in the future!"
2019-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Peace and quiet, comfort and convenience. Nearby playgrounds for young kids and great walking trails. We would definitely visit again."
2019-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The cabin was great! It is right on the park, surrounded by trees. It was clean and very spacious. It is a perfect get away for a family."

The kitchen was stocked with everything you need to cook and the outdoor fireplace was the cherry on top! Also it is a 2 minute walk to our favorite park, Franklin creek. Our son enjoyed the trails and the buffalo at the grasslands. It was more than we expected."
2019-06-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,Thanks for a great stay!
2019-06-01,4.0,Group trip,"A private house with lots of finishing touches. Books, games, equipped kitchen, porch and patio, fire space. Great space to relax."
2019-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This is really a unique retreat. State Park next door offers quiet hikes and runs. Fish in the pond down the street jump right onto your hook. If you run, spectacular runs through forests and farms with little to no traffic. An easy 8 mile loop. And if you're from Chicago, enjoy the hills. Dina's outdoor fireplace and bread oven are the center of fun evenings. We'll be back!"
2018-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This place was incredible. The cabin has all the benefits of being at a remote location and yet it’s only 10 minutes from town. Has easy access to trails for hiking and a beautiful outdoor fireplace for relaxing at night. Highly recommend checking it out and will definitely be back in the Spring.
2018-10-01,5.0,Group trip,"this cabin was a wonderful get away, the outside fire place was much enjoyed. the space is very well layed out. we heard owls off in the distance each night, saw several wild turkeys and a fox."
2018-09-01,5.0,Group trip,Very clean and comfortable place with well-stocked kitchen set in a lovely area of Illinois. This was perfect for three couples looking for a getaway together to relax and catch-up! Hosts were very accommodating.
2018-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Wonderful house and location! A great place to spend time with friends and family. Lots of room inside and out. The host was very helpful in answering our questions and the house was clean, ready to go and better than described! We definitely recommend staying here."
2018-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,great airbnb! so roomy and the back deck and fireplace is awesome.
2018-08-01,5.0,Group trip,"This place is beyond better than my expectations. We had a great time. The house is huge and the kitchen is fully loaded. They're so nice that they've already prepared two bags of charcoal and plenty of hickory woods for us to grill and have a fire on the pit.
Will definitely recommend for anybody who's looking for nature and a cabin.
Thank you again."
2018-08-01,5.0,Group trip,"Dina was a perfect host and very responsive to any of our needs prior to arriving. The cabin was spacious and comfortable and the property was beautiful. We loved staying in such a quiet, peaceful place."

2017-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The cabin was amazing, such a cool space! I loved how all of the sleeping spaces were spread out throughout the house, it's the perfect set up.
I'm so glad we thought to check air bnb for a place on our wedding weekend. Everything worked out perfectly, and we wouldn't have been able to pull off our wedding at Franklin Creek State Natural Area if we hadn't found this space!
Thank you for a great stay!!"
2017-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is such a wonderful place to stay. It's quiet, clean, and family friendly. We have stayed here twice in order to visit family that live nearby."
2016-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Dina was wonderful about keeping in touch and made sure everything was all set for us when we arrived. The property is fantastic far beyond what the pictures would suggest, and we found the pathways through the nearby woods to be positively idyllic. I can't recommend Dina's cabin enough."
2016-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We had a great weekend!
2016-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This cabin is spacious and clean. Like other reviewers mentioned, it was bigger than photos have captured. It was nice to ""unplug"" for a weekend- no internet or TV, just the great outdoors! Walking distance down the street is a beautiful park, and a 5 minute drive will take you to the bison. The town of Oregon is also worth a peek. They provided bug spray which was appreciated as the mosquitoes are rampant, but it was tolerable. We enjoyed the fire pit and star gazing at night. Bring your own essentials, some games, hiking gear, leave the pets at home, and enjoy yourself in farm country IL!"
2016-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a great time at Dina and Jim's cabin. We wanted to go spend time in nature with our teenage kids, and the place was ideal! Great hiking right behind the house, and a wonderful, big park with trails that would span for over 5 miles right across the street. It was hot hot hot! but the creek right by the trails provided great relief.
The house was big, with room for everybody, and very comfortable. And the best part is that they allowed us to bring our beagle with us! (he is very well behaved and low maintenance, so it worked just fine), which meant we all could enjoy the woods!
We are thinking of coming back in the fall, when it's not so hot. It is so pretty out there!"
2016-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Everything was great and accomidating. I would definitely recommend to anyone with a big group of people.
2016-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Dina was an excellent host. We had no issues with the property and Dina was always available to answer what few questions that we had. For us, the location was perfect and we really enjoyed a very relaxing week in the country.

The cabin is located very near to several state parks and recreational areas and is a great place to share with friends or extended family."
2016-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,I feel at home. Nice quite area.
2015-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Absolutely wonderful place, it was exactly what we were looking for. It is in a great secluded location out in the open air. The place was spacious, well maintain and had a wonderful touch of amenities provided. Dina is a pleasure to rent from and very prompt to reply to messages. Overall had a great experience and absolutely no complaints!"
2015-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a wonderful time. This property is nicer than described. It is very private. It is close to a lot of outdoor activities and beautiful scenery. Inside, it was clean, comfortable, and had everything we needed. Dina was super friendly and responsive and really made us feel welcome. Great experience overall."
2015-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Dina and James,
Thanks for your hospitality and sharing your beautiful house. With 10 miles of horse trails behind, 6 miles of hiking in front, gas grill for suculent pork loin and beer battered bratworsts, I and my city-dwelling, nature-loving friends would return in a heart beat. Fresh air and fresher eggs (thanks Dina!) was the catalyst i needed for a much deserved recharge, Monday morning here I come! The hand made soaps in the bathroom was an especially nice touch. It was a shame though to find such poor produce in the heart of a vast farmland (Airbnb'rs lucky enough to book with Dina and James in the future make sure to stop at Wholefoods before hand)."
2014-09-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Met or exceeded all expectations. Rooms were more spacious than pictured. Very kind host.
2024-01-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was a very charming home! We loved the front sitting area and the comfortable accommodations. Tim and Hunter were very responsive and made sure the house was ready for guests. Our only obstacle was the 6+ inches of snow that Mother Nature dropped on the area prior to our arrival - parking and walkability became quite tough (info on plow schedules, safe spots to park, etc would have eased our worries). Overall, the house has everything you need for a relaxing stay and is easily accessible to the goings-on Dixon had to offer -- we would definitely stay again!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great stay! Clean and comfy home. Hunter and Tim are great communicators and made the stay easy. Perfect location along the river and a short walk into town. Would love to stay there again next time we’re in town!
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The hosts were most friendly and helpful. The stay was most enjoyable.
2023-08-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,The typical quirks of an older home...but the location is lovely.

2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Hunter and Tim were easy to communicate with and on top of everything. The place was clean and comfy. The location was great. Loved walking by the river and to the local coffee shop. Would definitely stay there again!
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I loved being able to walk to the riverfront and around the historic neighborhood. The location is fantastic. My hosts were helpful and friendly. My space consisted of the entire second floor of a lovely old building. If you love ca 1915 subway tile, a retro kitchen, warm wood floors, glass door knobs, sitting in the dining room watching the mighty rock river roll by, and a big cozy bed, this place is for you.!"
2022-09-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"We found this location well suited for why we were visiting Dixon. We did enjoy the morning walks along the Rock River and accessibility to 1st Street. The facilities were simple, but we didn't need much since we were pretty active while we were in town. We just needed a place to bed down each night."
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great location, walking path along the river or to a local coffee shop and other stores. Appreciated a comfortable bed after a long and fun day! It was very quiet and private."
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"You get the entire upstairs! Gorgeous hardwood floors, loads of windows and natural light, and the hosts left fresh cut tulips and daffodils in two separate places! The massive king sized bed is very comfortable. This was a wonderful stay in a wonderful town filled with lovely people. What a hidden gem!"
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,great stay at a quite house in a safe neighborhood
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Had a great stay. The windows offered so much natural lighting and the views during the snowfall were beautiful!!

2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Perfect location, cute place, and an excellent host. Would definitely stay again!"
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,What a find! Was looking for a weekend getaway and Dixon was the place. Views of the river welcomed our morning. The yoga room is such a bonus! Quiet and wooded - contemplate the day while hummingbirds gather outside your window. Accommodating hosts made room for guest motorcycle in garage - bikers welcome! Gorgeous wood floors and big table for puzzles and projects. Superb communication and warmth from hosts. We will definitely recommend and return!
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Everything was great! Hunter was there when we arrived and showed us around the space, which we appreciated. Was a nice peaceful place to stay."
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"An older house with about everything you need for a stay. The place was clean, fresh smelling. Just away from the river and some parks."
2021-07-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"We were the first guests at this Airbnb. The bed was very comfortable and both towels and bedding were of good quality. The kitchen and bathroom were functional. There is a great sunporch for viewing the treetops and watching/listening to the birds. Wifi was excellent. Hunter was quick to answer our inquiries and wanted us to be comfortable. The location is in a lovely neighborhood near the river, and a quick walk to downtown. This is a very large unit, furnished minimally with an additional open space set up for Yoga, and a t.v room with a couch. It is a very quiet spot."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,If you want a quiet peaceful spot to relax in the country then LHOTP is a great pick to getaway!
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"What a perfect place to stay with our dogs. Beautiful surroundings, and our dogs ( who are usually nervous travelers) felt right at home! We absolutely loved the house and will be back again!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,This was our second stay at LHOTP and we have already booked a third stay. Earl and Patricia are extremely helpful and accommodating. The place is comfortable and has an awesome set-up with the two bedrooms and the living space. The Buffalo Reserve is a nice extra!
2024-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Absolutely stunning place! We came for a weekend wedding and will be back just for us! Nestled snug next to Dixon, IL. Perfect atmosphere for peace and quiet. We also enjoyed our time downtown Dixon. Highly recommend the stay and can’t wait to go back!!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,LHOTP was awesome super accommodating and the BISON daughter went crazy every time she saw one we have family in the area so we will be back highly recommended!!!
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Very quite.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We had a wonderful getaway from Chicago. Everything above & beyond standards, Expected. We're Definitely Going To Return Soon. 😇"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"This was our second stay, and we love the whole package! The surroundings are serene with a majestic view of Nachusa Grasslands and the resident bison...great area for nature hikes and exploration.
Inside is large and open with high ceilings, a lovely and well appointed kitchen, and 2 super comfortable bedrooms. Earl and Patricia provide everything you need...all essentials and many extras. We travel often and have stayed at many Airbnbs, we both agree that LHOTP is our overall favorite.
And thanks so much for being so pet friendly with the quality crates and the fenced in, easy access
kennel area! Looking forward to our next visit!
Kevin & Annie"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Very nice and beautiful place. Earl and Patricia are very kind. If I have a chance to visit there, I will visit again."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Host was great at communicating and let us know when bison my be close by for viewing!

2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Thank you for a lovely, if all too short, stay - I did manage to see some bison this morning!"
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Always wonderful to see the wildlife out the back windows (deer, bison, birds, etc.)."
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Fantastic stay! Earl is always thinking of his guests and offering his help!
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"LHOTP completely met our needs. We traveled with a dog to the area for Christmas to see family and friends. The house is a great space with many conveniences and a homey feel. The oven went out at 9:30PM on 12/23. Earl and his son were installing a new oven on 12/24 less than 1 hour after the appliance store opened! The bison are awesome, too!"
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"exactly as advertised. it's a bit of a drive outside of Dixon, but very quiet out in the country. the Bison were present out back when we arrived. the only downfall was that it was raining out and so we didn'twalk out to the fence line.
perfect family getaway weekend. thanks Earl & Patricia for the great accommodation. we would love to come back sometime in the future."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Thanks.
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"would stay again when back in town, nice place"
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Got to see the bison several times both by going to Stone Barn Rd. where they hung out in the afternoon and at Earl's place in the morning. Visitor center of Nachusa Grasslands is very good at describing that Nature Conservancy space. Earl's place is very comfy and we had local relatives come by and enjoy it as well.
2023-11-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Love seeing the Bison behind the property. This time we walked to the Nachusa Grasslands visitors area and walked the prairie paths. We will do this again.
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is a great home base if you are interested in exploring the nearby communities of Franklin, Grove, Dixon, Oregon, and the other beautiful towns in the area.
The house was spacious and generously stocked with bathroom and pantry items. The beds were also very comfortable, which was a plus!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Came to town for my dad’s surprise 80th birthday. We saw the bison as we were driving down the road and as soon as we walked into the air bnb they were grazing in the prairie behind the house. The views were spectacular. Glad we saw the bison Friday as bday party kept us away most of Saturday and then Sunday we spent most of it with my family as well. Spacious home and kitchen was well stocked with pretty much everything you need.
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,We had a great stay! The place was very spacious and had all the things you would need. Earl and Patricia were very responsive and kind. Would definitely stay again!
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Earl and Pat’s place is a little slice of heaven on the prairie. It is very peaceful during the day and at night. If you are looking for a get away where nobody can bother you and just to get away from everyday life relax and unwind with your doggies, this is your place! Not only that, if you have any questions Earl and Pat are quick to respond within minutes. This is my second visit and I plan on making a third. It is a great place for the dogs as well (plenty of room to run, dog crates, a little run outside, etc)"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Wonderful host! Also caring! Clean home!
2023-09-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,We enjoyed the view so much! We appreciated the games and snacks left out for the kids.
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,This was a great place to stay for us and the dogs! Very quiet and clean. Well stocked. The hosts checked in regularly. We did get to see the bison on our last day.
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Earl and Pat are amazing hosts with a wonderful property. Great spot if you have a dog. Short drive from Chicago, gorgeous landscaping, close to many pristine trails, and a backyard view of the bison sanctuary that is worth every penny. We look forward to the next time we'll be able to visit! (this was our second stay!)"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"This place is spectacular! The host is so detail-oriented and labeled each closet and drawer for guests convenience. Everything is provided here, including tons of DVDs, books, small games such as chess, and first aid supplies. You name it. The owner is extremely caring, loving, friendly and kind. He introduced the local area to me and sent me pics of the bisons, which I really appreciate. My mom and I totally enjoyed our stay and would love to visit here again.
If I could give 10 stars I would. I’ve been to many getaways on Airbnb, this is definitely one of the most impressive places I’ve been."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We booked LHOTP because we were in the area to attend a family wedding. We were delightfully surprised at how perfect this home turned out to be.
Super comfortable atmosphere.
Great quiet A/C on a hot weekend.
First class kitchen with all amenities.
Very quiet neighborhood with the pristine Nachusa grasslands in clear view.
Amazing bedroom comfort.
Lovely bathroom with great shower and water pressure.
Extraordinarily pet friendly.
We truly felt right at home and will return for a longer stay.
Thanks to Earl, Patricia and family for providing such clean, high- quality lodging at a great price.
Bravo!!
Kevin & Annie"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,What a great stay! Thank you Earl for always being responsive and helpful. Also really nice hiking trails nearby.
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"This place was phenomenal! We saw a herd of buffalo from the living room windows right when we arrived, and loved having access to a fire pit and clear skies for star-gazing. The house was fully stocked with kitchen and bathroom supplies, as well as kennels and treats for our dogs. We also enjoyed hiking nearby at Franklin Creek. Would love to come back again!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We really enjoyed our stay, even though it was a short one. The house had everything one would need, and then some. We appreciated the pantry and fridge items, and it was roomy and quite comfortable. Also spotless and clean. We also appreciated the flexible check in checkout times. Overall it was great!
My only suggestion, and this is not meant to be criticism, would be to tidy up the landscaping around the house. It would just make it look a bit classier."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Awesome Property
Comfy home
Room for dogs to roam and play
When we come back in two years would love to stay here again"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We loved our stay at Earl's place! This cottage was so peaceful, and the view was phenomenal. The air was incredibly fresh, and we enjoyed viewing different rare songbirds while walking around on the property. We really liked the firepit and enjoyed sipping coffee while sitting outside. If you need a break somewhere peaceful, definitely check this one out. The nearby town Franklin Park has lots to do including a really good Italian restaurant and view of a river. Loved our stay and hope to come back!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We loved Earl & Pat’s place! The pictures really don’t do it justice - such a comfortable and welcoming space with the most beautiful views!!!! We came here as a respite from city life and were not disappointed. Earl & Pat were very helpful and responsive, and the space was pristine! We definitely will be back!"
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Loved the stay!!!! Want to make sure to stay longer next time!! Great peaceful get away out in the country but not too far from town. Let the dogs roam if you have them! Awesome little place thank you!
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Earl & Pat were fantastic to work with! Their hospitality is second to none. They were very accommodating.
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,great spacious place on peaceful land.
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,We spent Easter weekend here and fell in love with this home. And it wasn’t the home as much as it was the location. I have two big dogs (Doberman and German Shepard) and they had so much room to run and enjoy the outdoors! My husband and I just grabbed lawn chairs and went and sat out in the middle of the field and watched all the wild life! We adored this place.
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Perfect for DOGS!
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"It was a great place to stay! Thank you, and I will be back"
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Wonderful place for the family for Christmas! Thank you so much for your flexibility during the storm! will be back again
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Simple Airbnb but gorgeous location, adjacent to a bison preserve. Thoughtful touches for dog owners like an outdoor kennel and crates inside the home. Kind hosts."
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We loved staying at LHOPT! It was perfect for us and my in laws to enjoy a day in the Nachusa area.
We walked in in the afternoon, and the buffalo were strolling right past the back window across the fence. :)
There were ample blankets and the baseboard heaters warmed up the space nicely on a chilly winter day.
We will definitely be back!"
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We love the open space inside and the view of the Bison outside. The hosts are very accommodating and make sure to have many supplies in the kitchen. We have stayed here several times and will be doing so again.
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Another cozy stay at LHOTP, this time in autumn to enjoy the beautiful prairie colors. Earl and Patricia are the perfect and most thoughtful hosts. Will no doubt be back soon to enjoy this winter!"
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Awesome location and an adorable home. The peace and quiet was outstanding. Earl is an amazing host!
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful, clean and perfect little get away home."
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"What Wonderful stay, we enjoyed all that Nachusa had to offer and the clean and lovely LHOTP was perfect for our needs. Great place to stay!"
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Little House On the Prairie is my all time favorite place to stay. The location is the perfect private getaway. Watching the sunset from the patio is heavenly. The house is so clean and comfortable. I have stayed at LHOTP three times now and I plan on many more. It's a safe and relaxing place for anyone who appreciates nature and privacy.
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Another amazing stay at LHOTP! Everything was so clean and cozy. A wonderful place to unwind after a long day of travel. I'll be returning in less than a week!
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We had such a wonderful stay at LHOTP!! Earl and Patricia were incredibly friendly and flexible and made the whole process super simple. The property is truly beautiful, and the bison watching was an unforgettable experience. We definitely hope to be back!"
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"What a lovely and well -appointed prairie house! When we arrived the bison were roaming right near the fence and delicious BBQ ordered from Earl’s son next door was delivered shortly thereafter. We enjoyed the beautiful views and rolling hills with our dogs all weekend, and will definitely be back soon! Thank you to Earl and Patricia for thinking of everything and being such gracious hosts"
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Lots of space inside and outside to relax and be with nature and the bison. We love this place!
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"LHOP is a lovely little house, and Patricia and Earl were great hosts. The house was clean, had beautiful furnishings, and had a stunning view of a prairie preserve. We loved our quiet getaway here and would definitely stay again."
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Quiet place
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,LHOTP is the perfect place to relax and rejuvenate. The adorable house is so well equipped with anything and everything you need. Clean and cozy. The view from the patio will send you back in time when you could see for miles and hear only the sounds of nature. My dog was in heaven with tons of space and places to sniff and explore. I plan on revisiting many times. LHOTP is a definite keeper.
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This our our first mini road trip with our 2 pups. This trip was a bday surprise for our 11 yr old pup! They dogs loved running and exploring! All I wanted was a place that had lots of space for the dogs to roam freely, run, and sniff. This place was amazing! There were 2 homes near us, but we didn't see or hear any of the neighbors! Always careful when it gets dark (especially with pets and children), we do believe to have seen a wolf."
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"My girlfriend and I had an amazing long weekend here. We saw at least 40 bison pass by in the backyard which was a highlight of the trip.
Apart from the fantastic scenery, the house was well-organized and had everything you might think you need to pack. Seasonings, appliances, coffee, etc. It was a very hot weekend and we were concerned about staying cool, but the ac system they had was more than enough to keep us completely cool while we were in the house.
We also noticed some past reviews about spotty wifi, but they must’ve made an upgrade because the wifi was perfectly fast and we had no issues. Same with the Roku tv.
This place is special and at a very reasonable price. I highly recommend you stay here given the chance."
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,This was a perfect place for us to stay that was close to family for us to visit while in town. The house was spacious and the view out the back window is beautiful! Went for a run down the road and it was so peaceful and quiet. Very pleased with our stay!
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was our second stay at LHOTP, and we are already looking forward to when we can return. The little house itself is spacious, clean, and comfy. The surrounding area has plenty of preserved nature to explore, and Earl is very friendly and responsive to messages as well. Thanks for another great stay!"
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"This was a lovely place to stay, the host thought of everything. The view was fabulous and the home extremely comfortable and warming. We had a great time staying at this property while traveling across the Midwest."
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,A perfect place to spend a weekend away from home!
2022-05-01,4.0,Stayed over a week,It's a quite little place in a great location. A few things could use updating but not a deal breaker. Love seeing the buffalo hanging out from the backyard.
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Great location! Clean, cozy, and well stocked with anything you may have forgotten. Communication was clear and always received quick responses back. Would stay here again."
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"If you are looking for a relaxing place and to see wild bison, don't hesitate! The host Earl was super helpful before our stay as we had a special need and he was gracious enough to help accomodate it. We were looking for a place to stay while having renovation done at our own home. We felt very comfortable and were able to relax. I've already recommended LHTP to several friends who live in IL."
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was our second stay at LHOTP. Due to a death in the family, we needed to make an unplanned trip to the area. Earl communicated with us quickly and was able to accommodate us at extremely short notice. The house was clean and well stocked. Close enough to town for us to make trips in. He even had a talk with the bison and we found about 3 dozen right outside on our second morning there. We will definitely go back."
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We use this place to scrapbook with a few friends. The open kitchen/dining/living room make it possible for us to set up several 6 ft tables to work on our projects. Earl, the host, is very accommodating and prompt with replies. The place is clean and in great shape. Each time we have been there we see wildlife out the window. We will continue to stay here in the future."
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Wonderful stay. Peaceful and pleasant.
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,The stay was perfect and restful for our family as a stopping point after overseas travel and before continuing our journey. The hosts were accommodating with our specific needs and quick to communicate with us throughout the process. Everything was very comfortable and clean. Everything we needed was available. It really was a comfortable and relaxing stay.
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This place has a special charm of being right next to a buffalo herd. That was a huge draw for us, and the buffalo didn’t disappoint! The accommodations were spacious. The kitchen is large and could easily be used for large family meals. The bedrooms have nice beds. We enjoyed watching a movie from Earl’s large collection. We were there on a frigid night and the heater made the place toasty warm inside. We recommend this stay."
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Easy check in. House was clean and toasty warm. Hubs was excited to see the keurig with some of his favorite coffees. Our only disappointment was that we didn’t get to see the bison on our short, 1 night stay. It’s obviously in the country but we didn’t take into account that the roads might be snow packed, there was a couple of slick spots but nothing that wasn’t manageable. We will definitely be booking again when we go back to visit family."
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We loved staying at Little House on the Praire! It was gorgeous, and just the getaway we needed. We'll definitely be back!"
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great stay! We had a great time. The space was clean, and welcoming. The Bison were out back when we got there, and again the next morning. Perfect weekend retreat."
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great place, great host, I’ve stayed here multiple times and will do so again!"
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We had a great weekend. We came as a group of friends to craft for the weekend. The bison were out back when we arrived. It was fun watching for them all weekend. The kitchen was well stocked and the facility was very clean. I would recommend that you bring binoculars because the bison are not always close to the fence.
2021-10-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"LHOTP is exactly as advertised. Bring a teacher living in Chicago, we were looking for a peaceful family getaway for a few days and Earl’s place certainly delivered! It is easy to feel as though you are in the middle of nowhere, yet it is quick and easy to reach in under a couple of hours from Chicago. The bison were even right by the backyard fence to greet us, along with a beautiful sunset, on the day we arrived. We loved how quiet it was and how many stars you could see at night. We enjoyed playing board games and going for hikes in the many local state parks. We were so sad to leave! LHOTP has just about everything you could possibly need to be self sufficient and Earl & Patricia were always on hand and quick to respond to any questions, or provide suggestions for places to visit. We will definitely be back!"
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Earl's place is very clean and comfortable and I would definitely stay here again.
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Nice place and the hosts were very responsive.
2021-09-01,5.0,Group trip,Wonderful place! The hosts were so kind and helpful! Perfect location and such a cute house!
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Fantastic value, great for visiting the Dixon/Rock Falls area."
2021-09-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"It was a nice stay, quiet location, starry night & exactly what we were looking for."
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"What a lovely, lovely home away from home. It ranks among the best Airbnbs we have ever been to. The home is immaculate, extremely comfortable and absolutely delightful. The attention to detail with the quilts, artwork, furniture even the cups were exceptional. And the hosts are kind, attentive and thoughtful. We will be back."
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We enjoyed every aspect of our stay. Every inch of the inside was immaculate and spacious. The scenery was outstanding and so relaxing. We will look here first the next time we come back to the area. We would highly recommend this space to our friends. Thank you so much!
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Such a unique location! The bison were fascinating! Sitting outside at night in the inky blackness was a city-dwellers treat. Homey, comfy, just what we had hoped for❤️"
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Little house on the prairie is very accurately named, it is peaceful, serene and very pretty. Earl and Patricia are wonderful hosts. The house was clean, tastefully decorated and well stocked. If ever in the area again we would stay there and would recommend it to others as well. The John Deere Museum was fascinating and the Blacksmith demo was amazing. There is a lot of history in the area, Oregon, Byron, Dixon, Sterling..... Karen and Amanda"
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We had a lovely stay! Beautiful location and clean place. We had an issue with the lock at checkin and they were super responsive to our call and message. Very helpful hosts and nice place.
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Nice little house for a great price! Very dog friendly property - lots of space in front and back for dogs to roam around, and the hosts kindly provide some dog friendly amenities inside, including three different sized crates! We loved our stay and highly recommend staying here. :)"
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Little House on the Prairie is amazing. Earl was very accommodating, and he responded within a few minutes (literally a few minutes, less than five) to any questions we had.
We saw the bison herd several times over the weekend. They never came near the fence at LHOTP, but we saw them at the visitor center and while driving around. We did see deer and a coyote and other wildlife from the back patio.
We were delighted to see how well-stocked LHOTP is. We have been to many vacation properties in our travels, but we certainly over-packed for this one.
Some of the things we always take on vacations but could have left at home:
• A good variety of spices. In fact, there is a cabinet pretty much devoted to spices. We brought a couple of our favorites that LHOTP didn't have, but we could have saved the space and not packed our own at all.
• Ice
• Ketchup, mustard, mayo, Cholula, butter, a brand new unopened block of Monterey Jack cheese, Sriracha, and many other things. The frig door shelves were full of all kinds of goodies.
• Coffee, tea, bottled water, creamers
• Sugar
• Hand soap for the kitchen and bathroom
• Bug sprays
I could go on.
The only negative thing I have to say is the internet is a little iffy. But is that really a negative thing when you're trying to get away for a peaceful weekend? It just helped us realize that there were better things to do than to be checking emails.
All in all, LHOTP is a great get-away spot. We definitely will be going back!"
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Clean and spacious, a great place to stay after a long road trip."
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a great 4 day stay at the cottage. We attended a dog dock diving event nearby and stayed at the cottage.(We did very well! It was worth driving across the country)
It was everything that was described in the listing. When you first pull up to the property you would never know how cute the inside is or how vast the backyard and bison reserve behind the house was.
The cottage is an open floor concept and is very spacious. The kitchen area has tons of stuff to use and every cabinet and door is labelled. No confusions finding anything.
The Bison never came near the backyard while we were there, but we went to the Bison welcome center three times. The welcome center is down the road and we got to see the herd everytime we went. We also got to view other wildlife while we were there. The sunsets and sunrises were breath taking!"
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We enjoyed our stay. The house is full of thoughtful touches especially if you plan on eating in. I was a little surprised to see that there are two other houses right next door. I had imagined that it was a little more isolated and away from other houses. We saw a few of the neighbors and waved and that was our only interaction. It was a very quiet spot which is exactly what we wanted. We only saw the bison once down the road near the visitor center. Plan on downloading things to watch before you arrive as the wifi is weak. A nice place with very responsive, helpful hosts."
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"So peaceful and perfect for a restful getaway. The view of the grasslands from the back porch is glorious. We loved watching the birds while we drank our morning coffee. And the view of the sunset is spectacular.
Pictures really can't capture how big the space is!"
2021-06-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Far more space then would have expected from the pictures, great little house, very comfy, would definitely come back again!"
2021-06-01,5.0,Group trip,"Very cozy home in the center of Nachusa grasslands with amazing views. Beautiful land, accommodating hosts."
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Great chance to get away from the city for a weekend. House was perfect!
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Clean, spacious, overall great place to stay!"
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,It was very relaxing with great amenities and beautiful location. I would recommend it highly.
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We loved this house. It was a peaceful getaway weekend for me and my fiancée. We got to see a couple herds of bison walk by the field behind this house. It was comfortable, clean, and Earl was very responsive. We will definitely be back to this charming little house!"
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The host was very good at responding to my questions and communicating before, during, and after our trip. The property is great with lots of fun outdoorsy things to do in the area."
2021-04-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"Nice views and a good country retreat. Dated, but nice place with a great view of the bison. I might be spoiled...but central air is something I learned I must have. Great communication from the owners! Nice open floor plan."
2021-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is an incredible stay and probably one of our favorites now. It has wide open spaces for our apartment dog to gallop and run. The home is a lot bigger than it looks in pictures and it was SO clean. The wifi wasn’t very strong, probably enough to get messages out but that wasn’t hugely important for us on our unplugged weekend. They have plenty of movies and board games and almost everything you need to have a unwinding time there. And they even have a grill (with propane) that we used to bbq every night. We even got lucky and saw the peaceful bison each day.
I can’t say enough that you should definitely check this place out! We will definitely be back."
2021-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Earl’s place was the perfect spot for our family this weekend. Communication was great! Very clean and accommodating! We hope to be back soon! Thanks again!
2021-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Wonderful weekend getaway! We loved how close it was from Chicago, but how it was a total escape from city life. The place is clean and spacious and the pantry and fridge were very well stocked with essentials. We also got lucky and saw bison several times, which was incredible!"
2021-02-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"Great place for a friends weekend. Plenty of room and well appointed kitchen. We didn’t see any bison, but we enjoyed the view out back and chilling out on a sunny winter afternoon."
2021-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Cozy house with GREAT hosts! Earl and Pat were attentive an handled everything in a timely manner. my fiance, my children, my dog, and I, all stayed comfortably in this home. Visitor's center is close and bison are easy to see! Great place to stay"
2021-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Our stay at LHOTP was wonderful! Earl & Patricia were very responsive and helped meet all our needs. The house is spacious and there is a lot of outdoor space. We appreciated the wood burning fire, which really added to the ambiance. Also, the handmade quilts were beautiful! We would recommend to anyone looking for a quiet weekend away."
2021-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We were very happy with our stay! So many nice touches and extras. We brought our dog with us and he loved it too. Place was as dog-friendly as human-friendly. We've never brought our dog to an Abnb before and wondered if allowing dogs would impact the home's cleanliness, etc. Wow - super-clean... cleaner than some stays we've had where pets aren't allowed (no pet smells or anything like that). We stayed in and cooked most of our meals and found everything we needed and more. Seriously - this is Airbnb done right. We loved the view of the rolling hills and bison in the backyard - so neat to see the bison roaming in the snow. Stand outside at night and listen to what silence really is, such a peaceful place. Brighter stars than I've seen in a long time. Thanks so much for having us.
PS - If you love BBQ you won't have to go far for that either!"
2021-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This place was great! We saw a lot of bison and the house was very nice.
2020-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This was not our first stay and I’m sure it will not be our last. We were a little nervous due to COVID. As soon as we opened the door we could tell how important it was to Earl to make sure it was cleaned and sanitized. Earl is always so helpful and available to your needs. It is the perfect little place to stay!
2020-12-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"Great place to stay if you are looking for a quiet, rural experience. Earl is a thoughtful and responsive host."

2020-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The hosts were very attentive and quick to reply with any questions going above and beyond when we had wifi issues or wanted to find a farmers market. Beautiful property and peaceful stay when wanting to get out of the city.
2020-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Earl's place was a lovely, comfortable little get away on the prairie. Great value! It was perfect for dogs, as there were so many helpful amenities and supplies. I highly recommend this stay to others."
2020-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The place is very clean and quite cozy. While the house is not particularly large, it was plenty comfortable for our family of four plus our dog. We enjoyed our stay and were fortunate enough to see the bison herd up-close from the backyard. Earl provided great communication and hospitality. The only improvable aspects (to nitpick) would be that the wifi is rather slow and that none of the clocks in the home seem to be working. Otherwise, the place was great and provided us a nice getaway."
2020-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Great visit and very private location. Loved getting up in the morning and seeing the bison in the Nachusa grasslands preserve.
2020-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Everything was great
2020-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"LHOP goes totally above expectations! If you are looking for the perfect place to relax, get in touch with nature and de-stress this is your place! Once you enter you will wish you had booked more nights! Enchanting! Earl and Pat go above and beyond."
2020-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great spot - very cozy and spacious - lots of privacy! The property is gorgeous and the sunset was stunning. Awesome trip to recharge for the day with my dog!
2020-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The house has a great view of the bison range and the open floor plan makes it very spacious- we were lucky enough to see the bison herd twice!

2020-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"If you’re looking for a clean comfortable country stay, this place is great! My dogo has so much fun running around on the property. With a winter stay, the wood burning stove was wonderful! The Nachusa Grasslands at your back door. I’ll definitely be back!"
2020-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Home was spacious, clean and comfortable. Loved the well appointed kitchen. We started the day cooking breakfast with the eggs and English muffins and coffee provided. Watching the bison out the window while eating was a treat. Earl gave us a list of restaurants for the rest of our meals. The bed was comfortable."
2019-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I stayed at Earl's house and it was an amazing experience, he went above and beyond to make us feel welcome. I'm planning on coming back next year."
2019-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was our first experience with an Airbnb and we were slightly hesitant. Earl kept in touch with us and made it clear we could contact him with any issues, in which there were not. We had our dog with us and he is usually very uncomfortable and nervous staying anywhere but home. Fred settled right in and was very comfortable staying at LHOP. We knew right away this was going to be a great stay."
2019-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great place to stay! The house has everything you'll need and more, like fridge and pantry stocked with anything you may need during your stay."

2019-02-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"Amazing views, GREAT hospitality. Earl is the best! My parents stayed there after a tragedy took their home and they had to relocate to the Midwest. Earl and his Prairie Home gave them a peaceful place to land and while they settled in and waited for their new home to close. We will always treasure the time they spent on the Prairie. ❤️❤️❤️"
2018-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Earl is a great host and The house itself is very comfortable

2018-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Dec 21-24, 2018
Great gathering place for Christmas with our out of state kids! Kitchen was fully stocked allowing us to bake cookies and spend some quality time together. House was really relaxing and comfortable with the nice backyard view of the grasslands. Didn’t see any of the bison, so we will need to make another trip sometime soon. Thanks! Mike and Tracy Rockwell"
2018-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Second trip to the LHOP in as many months and it did not disappoint!! Abundance of nature between the buffalo and deer, and total peace and quiet. Just what is needed to recharge and de-stress. A real gem and will be back, thanks Earl!!!"
2018-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful place, spacious, stocked with anything you may need in the kitchen, even some basic food. plenty of amenities. Easy to forget that there is no WiFi or TV, and weak cell service. Great hostwho responds quickly, and very accommodating. I will definitely consider going back there.
Thanks Earl!"
2018-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Inviting & cozy spot to stay! Earl & Pat always responded quickly and were very accommodating to hosting two toddlers & dogs too! We felt right at home immediately. Would definitely recommend staying at the LHOTP!
2018-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This place is a great place to relax, unwind and take in the natural landscape.
The host, Earl, is so accommodating. We really appreciated the communication and the amenities at the house. Comfy beds and pillows, a well stocked kitchen with utensils and plates, glasses, games in the hutch and a nice open floor plan made for a great girls weekend. This is a convenient location for us to meet our friends from Chicago for a girls’ weekend. We will be back!"
2018-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Earl is a very kind and accommodating host. The house has a nice layout and conveniently located near areas for outdoor activities. I look forward to staying there again soon.
2018-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My stay at the Lil House on the Prairie, besides being surrounded by beautiful natural prairie and an occasional bison, exceeded my expectations and allowed me to recharge my batteries. Being a bow hunter I was able to hunt a nearby state forest and the Franklin Creek area. Earl has a found a unique way to make this B&B a quiet, restful home away from home. Can't wait to return!!"
2018-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Quiet, simple, little white house in the country. Absolutely beautiful setting next to a huge nature preserve prairie (with buffalo!) I stayed one night with my two small dogs and the owners were super accommodating. Well stocked pantry and fridge. Easy to find even though on country roads for a bit. No wifi or TV but phone and texting works. Super clean, really comfortable beds. Can see tons of stars in the night sky and hear buffalo snorting and lowing."
2018-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Had a wonderful stay at LHOTP!!! The view out the back window of the Nachusa Grasslands was perfect!!! The bison herd was on the other side of the road, but a few of the big boys hung around. I was treated to a wrestling match between a couple of the young males!! You could hear the clacking of their horns and some of their snorts!!! That same evening as the sun was just going down, a couple of deer moved into view. One little doe stuck around for a snack & then bedded down for a bit underneath a small pine tree. I sat & watched her for nearly 30 minutes....so quiet, so peaceful & a lovely place. Will definitely be back!!!"
2018-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Exceeded our expectations. It was the perfect getaway for a quiet, private weekend away. The bison preserve is magnificent. We will definitely be back."
2018-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Earl's place is perfect. We were looking for a low key place in the country to enjoy long bike rides and walks in the woods. We found that, along with daily communing with the bison herd. We woke up Saturday morning, looked out the window and a small herd of bison were having their breakfast just on the other side of the fence - magical.
The house is much bigger than I thought it was going to be. The beds and couches are very comfy. The kitchen is huge and very well stocked - pretty much everything you would need - including a waffle iron and maple syrup!
There is so much to do in the area, lots of hiking and biking opportunities.
We had a fabulous weekend and hope to be back."

2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The place was just as it was described. I found it cozy, snug and spic 'n span. I felt right at home. When I come back to Rock Falls next year I will book well in advance. It was freezing cold outside, with snow on one day. And the heating unit worked great. I was toasty in no time. I accidentally locked myself out, by mishandling the door's key pad. I called Keith. He answered immediately--and remotely reset the lock. I got inside in no time. I was very impressed."

Keith AirBNB was 4-5 away from the venue and a lot cheaper than the hotel that was just 1 to 2 streets over and was able to feel like home there. Very clean, very spacious and wish we could of stayed longer. Keith was very nice and respectful. Responded back very quickly. What more can you as for ?"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This apartment appears newly renovated, beautifully decorated, and spotless! I was very impressed the second I walked in the door.

Great location. Host was very helpful and super responsive. Would definitely stay again!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,I was surprised by the quiet I enjoyed even though it was on a busy street near the train tracks. I used to enjoy the sound of the trains when I lived a little further away in Sterling but heard them only once here! Everything was clean and comfortable. I’m sure Carol would offer recommendations if asked but I knew where I wanted to go and what I wanted to do. I don’t think the pictures do justice to the charm of the place. I recommend.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"I highly recommend staying here, Carol was attentive, helpful & always accommodating. Thank you Carol."
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Perfect spot for a stay in Sterling, I loved it. Quiet and comfortable with everything you need."

The beds were comfortable, and the upstairs loft was perfect for a young children to stay in. Everything was clean, and the external surroundings were peaceful and quiet. James was there too. Welcome us and to provide last minute and helpful details. I would highly recommend staying here again."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Perfect getaway! The cabin was delightful—well laid out and comfortable. James could not have been more accommodating with answering our requests and providing what we needed at the last minute. The area is such a hidden gem. Plenty to do, see, and enjoy! We met wonderful people, especially the volunteers who take such good care of the woods and grist mill. We did our own cooking but next time we will definitely try all the restaurant recommendations we were given. It was a PERFECT weekend!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We loved staying at the cabin. It was incredibly peaceful. We were able to walk to the trails on the nature preserve. James provided recommendations and had maps of the nature preserve. The kitchen looked small in pictures, but was the perfect size for cooking. Kitchen also was fully stocked. The beds were really comfortable. It was nice having two decks to sit on."

2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,A very unique place. I would recommend this place to anyone staying in the area.
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This place is just as described. It’s simple, but clean, comfortable, and just what we needed for our impromptu weekend away from the city. Our group was 2 adults with a toddler. The place was plenty of space, comfortable and easy to maneuver with a 3 year old.
The WiFi router wasn’t there and microwave seemed broken and someone was there within an hour to address both issues (with a mask on!). The grill was awesome for steak night, and the kitchen was well outfitted with cook and eating ware - and fantastic spices.
One of the best perks was before we even arrived. Ample recommendations for food (which we didn’t use/need) and what to see and do. It was great! We enjoyed: Husar Memorial walk (down the road), Castle Rock overlook (saw bald eagles!), Nachusa grasslands (saw bison!) and did the Stone Barn Savanna walk twice.
I’d recommend this place to anyone - especially with older kids who would have a blast bunking in the upstairs loft. Look forward to staying again when we come back in the spring!"
2021-11-01,5.0,Group trip,I booked this cabin for me and four of my friends. It was plenty space for all of us. We were close to all the activities we wanted to do. Very comfortable.
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This cottage was so cozy and comfortable! Perfect for 2 couples on a fall getaway. The kitchen is pretty well-stocked and the rooms are comfortable with plenty of space. The locationis excellent- wooded trails all around that won't take you too far from home, plus the grist mill is pretty cool. Would definitely recommend for an escape from the city!"
2021-10-01,5.0,Group trip,Very cute and well equipped place. Very close to trails and lots of outdoor exploring possible

2024-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Erins was very comfortable. We only had 2 nights so we honestly did not get to experience the whole ambiance that her place deserved. We did not use the upstairs but it was very nice. Plenty of room. Just a real homey feel. Would I stay again? Absolutely!!
2024-04-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,"Quiet getaway in a sweet little town! Erin's home had all the comforts of home 🏡

We got much more house than we expected for such a reasonable cost. Even our baby loved the furniture lol. Dixon also has the best diners and soft serve ever, it was such a nice break from chain restaurants in SC. We’d love to stay again!"

2024-02-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,This is definitely an older house. It could use a little bit of updating and maintenance but it was otherwise fairly clean and the location is nice.

The beds were comfortable and snuggly. It was a wonderful getaway. The surrounding neighborhood is safe and quiet. We'd recommend this home wholeheartedly. We hope to return sometime in the future!"

2023-11-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place is a cool little off the path type house...big yard..lots of space in house..plenty stocked with the basic accommodations like cooking utensils and eat ware...cool outside patio but lights need updated to be able to see out by the fire pit... Other than that this is a cool spot.. plenty of room.. Great price..
Easy flexible check in...easy check out...
will check this place out in summer months when I'm in town .."
2023-11-01,5.0,Group trip,It was a cute rustic stay in a very old cottage and things were clean and comfortable inside. There are a couple of concrete steps on the approach to the house and 9 steps up to the door which I don't recall on the listing. Erin was very quick to respond to my messages and seemed interested in my thoughts on her property. The sun porch needed a window repair and the entry door could use paint but overall it served our needs.
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"This was my first Airbnb experience,my Host Erin was very friendly and professional. Much better pricing, location, Amenities, etc. that the usual stay in Motel."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Nice clean house, we all enjoyed our stay including our cats."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The house is an oldie but goodie. I slept well and appreciate the quiet plus the low light pollution of this village. When I am back in the area, this will be my go-to lodging."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"What a hidden little gem! We enjoyed relaxing on the patio taking in the beautiful surroundings and history around us. It was very peaceful. The dog also LOVED having room to run. The location was excellent, close to golf, hiking, parks and scenic views. We also enjoyed the charm of towns nearby. People are friendly and food is good. We hope to come back soon!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Erin was so responsive to anything I asked about! Loved her home!
2023-09-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,"I had a lovely stay at Erin's house. The house is located on a large and beautiful piece of property in the quaint village of Grand Detour. The area is very quiet and has an almost magical feel to it. I loved taking walks through the neighborhood with my dog and admiring the beautiful historic homes and lush gardens. The house was charming and simple, but provided what I needed for a peaceful getaway from the city. I enjoyed sitting outside and having coffee on the patio in the mornings while listening to the sounds of nature. I also appreciated the selection VHS movies to watch on the tv which provided a fun retro vibe. The neighbors were all very friendly, and everyone smiles and waves when they see you. If you're looking for a quiet and peaceful getaway, where you feel like you've taken a trip back to a simpler time, Erin's place is the perfect spot!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Quaint home in a quiet area , outdoor seating and fire pit a big plus."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"This was a great place for us to stay, close to family and the dog event we attended. Erin was very helpful and the house was just what we needed."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"The location was perfect! The town of Grand Detour is quiet, but just close enough to town that you aren't far from anything!
The house is charming and has a great amount of space. The outdoor space was beautiful, and the fire pit a great addition!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,It was a little more rustic than we expected.
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay! Inside was nice and clean. Master bedroom and bathroom are very nice!
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Our stay was perfect for Memorial Day weekend! The house is in a quiet neighborhood with a beautiful yard for the dog. We enjoyed exploring downtown Dixon but mostly hung outside. There was bug spray, fire wood, and lots of little things we didn’t think to bring which was a huge help! We will definitely stay again!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Great place! My kids loved the yard! Could use some updating and deep cleaning but you can’t beat the price.
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Beautiful setting and home. Enjoyed my stay, immensely. Grand Detour is a hidden gem."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This was a perfect place for a peaceful get away! It is like the pictures and description and easy to check in! The place is old and it would not be good for someone who can't manage stairs. But the peeling paint keeps the price affordable and it's very comfortable place to stay! I hope to return! THANK YOU!
2023-03-01,4.0,Stayed over a week,It was cool
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Gosh, where to start? I booked Erin’s place for a quiet getaway. It was everything I’d hoped for and more. Dixon is my hometown so I know the area well, but Erin had put together some local restaurants and attractions, which was so nice. Thanks so much for hosting me. I’ll be back again!"
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Erin is a rock star! 🤩 She helped every step of the way with my questions while also accommodating my circumstances. A+ job!
The house itself is adorable. Cozy. Clean. Neat. Comfortable beds. We felt right at home. The property and surrounding area is just beautiful. Grand DeTour is a wonderful place to stay and this house is the place to do it!"
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"This stay was booked for a physician who was staying for local temporary coverage at the local hospital. He was very complimentary of the property, stay and host. He even noted the nice touch that 2 bottles of wine were provided for him. I will definitely book this property again when looking for local accommodations for medical staff members traveling to the area. Thank you for the amazing stay!"
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"I really loved staying at Erin’s place for a bit of a restful recharging weekend with my puppy and boyfriend! This farmhouse is exactly what it seems like, and worked great for us. Dixon us a great little town."
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Everything you need to feel comfortable and at home. A little rough around the edges, but the price was right! Hosts were great."
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Beautiful property and darling grandma-core farmhouse. My two teens and I had a quiet, relaxing time getting away for three nights. We enjoyed the easily-to-utilize outdoor fire pit, cooked several meals, and everything was spotless, comfortable and fully-stocked."
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Host has accuratly described property, based on size it could easliy host 6 people comfortably. I liked the ""era"" furniture and the home felt like a early 1900 farm house! BUT the owner has added in the modern items you need like a strong internet."
2022-11-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,Quiet and comfortable . Everything was there we needed . Forgot how nice it is to not watch TV !! The concrete was needing fixed before the steps area . Easy to trip .! Air fresheners would have been nice . Smelled old .The area around the house was great for fall pictures .
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,This cute property was perfect for our family of four! We enjoyed the little village and the location very much. It was central to a lot of good hiking and fun historic places to explore. It’s a perfect home base for exploring the area. We enjoyed the full kitchen and ate in every night. We would definitely stay again!
2022-09-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is a very old house... as such there is an old house smell which to me was unappealing. The odor faded as I got used to it. Also, the exterior of the house, as you can see in the photos, has not been maintained. That said ... the inside is spacious and clean. I would not call the furnishings comfortable. There is no dresser in the downstairs bedroom or end tables, for example.Nothing that can't be worked around. All was adequate and useful to me for the purpose of my visit and a fair exchange for the rental fee.
The setting is lovely ... the neighborhood charming ... the location convenient to Rock River adventures. The host left a welcome book with restaurant suggestions. I visited two and the food was delicious.
Erin was responsive to me prior to the visit and sent me information so that I could pre-plan some of my day trips."
2022-09-01,4.0,Group trip,"Everything was great about the place including the owners. Only 1 thing was off. My buddies and I were golfing about 30 minutes away from the house and somehow the owners knew the toilet was running. To me that was a little weird that they knew exactly what was going on in the house while we were gone. But other than that, everything was great"
2022-09-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Quaint house, Erin and Jeffrey insured any questions or suggestions were quickly answered."
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We had a great time and the place was perfect for our family. The beds were all very comfortable and the neighborhood was safe and beautiful. We went on several walks on our multi day stay. The home was set up well for our needs.
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"This adorable little house is just perfect. Grand Detour is a small community that makes you feel like you stepped back in time and someplace magical. My dogs and I just loved walking the neighbourhood looking at all the cute houses. It is also right between Dixon and Oregon so everything you need is not too far away. There are also wonderful parks close by - Castle Rock, Lowden, Lowell + more.
The only downside was the mosquitoes. Next time I'm going to pack some heavy duty bug spray! I am already looking forward to coming back next summer. Thank you again so much to Erin & Jeff for hosting me."
2022-08-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,"The home and the village of Grand Detour are charming, quiet and relaxing. There was more than adequate space for the pets. The house was extremely quaint and served our purpose well."
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We didnt spend much time at the property but it worked great for our needs.
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,A summer Oasis for sure and another great stay! Even the deluge of rain could not dampen the beauty or enjoyment.
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Beautiful and relaxing place to get away, see stars, and enjoy nature. Book this place! You won't regret it."
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I continue to thoroughly enjoy my stays at the Oasis! You will be well cared for with these amazing Hosts. At my last stay on a scorchingly hot day after a very long work shift, I dreaded how warm it would be inside and how long it might take to cool down. How relieved and refreshed I was to find one of my thoughtful Hosts had kindly turned on the AC. Ahhhh, a welcoming homecoming in many ways!"
2022-06-01,3.0,Group trip,The town is lovely and the place is nicely decorated. Very pleasant. We had a couple of mechanical problems that we have reported to the owner. If these are taken care of it would be a five star place.
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,This is such a beautiful and charming stay with most gracious Hosts. Both you and your canine friend will be at home here with the lovely spacious yard and welcoming home.
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"My family of 5 stayed here for a month. The box elder bugs were really bad from the moment we arrived. The hosts did what they can and were very responsive, but the outside of the house needs some major TLC. Until the windows are sealed, all the repellent in the world won’t keep the bugs from getting inside.
Aside from the bugs, the house is bright and welcoming, and clean otherwise. There was plenty of space for the 5 of us and had everything we needed for a long stay. The neighborhood is absolutely charming and there is a lot of space in the yard to play. It’s a short drive to Dixon. My husband works from home and had no issues with the internet. The hosts are helpful and did everything they can to make sure we enjoyed our stay. Even with the bugs (they are a spring time bug), I do recommend staying here. Grand Detour is such a peaceful area and the property is beautiful."
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,A lovely and charming stay complete with gracious Host and quiet oasis. The spacious yard makes the pup and I happy plus the many birds are a pleasure to watch or listen to. The weather kept us from enjoying the patio and fire pit but it looks so inviting. Can't wait to work on my horseshoe game.
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Wonderful place!
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Great professional experiences. Beautiful location
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very cozy
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great location! This is a lovely place to unwind. Super clean.
2021-10-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"The location of this charming older home is perfect for peace, quiet, and a bit of history. Grand Detour has several historic houses and the number of large trees and the river just blocks away add to the ambience. The home's property is large and just blocks away from the John Deere museum. We loved walking the streets during our fall visit.
The downstairs bed was very comfortable and there were plenty of towels and blankets. The Wi-Fi worked very well during our stay and we didn't miss having cable T.V. since there was plenty to do during our visit.
Hubby and I live in a 150-year old home so we're used to the quirks of an older home. Erin's place has gorgeous wood floors downstairs with large windows throughout. The home could use a bit of maintenance. The exterior needs to be painted and the concrete at the bottom of the back steps is eroded and could prove to be dangerous for older folks or small children.
There are several parks in the area for hiking and exploring. Dixon is just a 5-minute drive and has the best coffee at Coffee Crush. Somkit, the Thai restaurant, was also very good and served the best sangria I've ever had. Hazel's in Oregon is also great for coffee and sandwiches. We also enjoyed dinner at the White Pines Lodge and had a seat right next to the fireplace.
I would stay here again. I'm a writer and this quiet retreat is perfect for a writer's retreat."
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"We had the most amazing summer here! We loved it so much that we were actually sad to leave. Erin and Jeff were the best hosts, and we will definitely be back to stay again in the future! They were so accommodating, communicative, and helpful. We will seriously miss having Jeff as our neighbor!
The house is cozy and charming, the property and trees are so beautiful, and the neighborhood is friendly and peaceful. Tons of state parks and beautiful grasslands to go see nearby. Grand Detour stole our hearts for sure! Thank you for an amazing summer, Jeff & Erin. Can’t wait to visit again!"
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We were looking for a place to stay for a hiking weekend that included a visit to the Nachusa bison herd. This house was perfect: in the tiny town of Grand Detour, surrounded by a lovely, large yard (though not as large as the photos make it seem), and dog-friendly! This is clearly Grandma's old house--furnished with antiques, quilts and lace, and an ancient television. The kitchen is equipped for simple cooking (I spied a bread machine in the cupboard, so byo flour and yeast and you can have easy fresh-baked bread), and there's a Weber bbq outside, along with a fire pit and a horseshoes game area. Beds are comfy, wi-fi was OK. We brought a Roku stick and managed to find a USB port on the tv, so we could watch a movie. The hiking was lovely, especially at the Lowden-Miller state forest across the river. This is a great place to stay when you want to hike or bike or kayak...but you don't want to camp!"
2021-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Erins place was the perfect getaway for me and my kids! We really enjoyed the space with its beautiful views, quiet neighborhood and easy access to multiple trails along the river. I would recommend it!"
2021-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We had a great stay! The beds were very comfortable and we loved using the fire pit!

2021-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Really cute airbnb in a perfectly remote, but not too remote, location! Cute house and very clean."
2021-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a great time! Due to COVID, my partner and I primarily stayed in the house aside from walks around the neighborhood. The river was beautiful during the winter, and the house made for a pleasant stay. Check in and out was easy. We brought a Chromecast, so the lack of cable wasn't an issue. There's a lot of cozy places to curl up and read here!"
2020-12-01,4.0,Stayed over a week,"This home is a cozy, quiet place. Erin and Jeff were very good hosts. We will stay there again!"
2020-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,The place is just wonderful and Erin was super helpful through our stay. The house is just a few blocks from the river and had a large garden. Great for little kids.
2020-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"I could say a lot of great things about our stay, but my wife has said only 1 was necessary. The ♥ BATHTUB ♥ . That's all! Now, my turn: quiet and peaceful place. The outside patio and grill was great! Plenty of room inside, both upstairs and down. Washer and dryer worked well. Heat and AC worked great too. Beds were comfortable and Kitchen was stocked decently. If I had to complain about anything, none of it really affected the stay. We didn't have a toaster. Bagel bummer, but the oven toasted fine. Internet was a little slow, but everything seems slow WHEN your home is gigabit fiber. The Japanese beetles were having their way with the ceilings and near windows, but EVERYWHERE around us showed no shortage of them either. And Ill take the beetles over skeeters any day! Lastly, It would have been nice to have a dresser in the downstairs bedroom, especially on an extended stay. Otherwise, all was good. Will return again!"
2020-10-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Good dog friendly place to stay that's near some nice parks. The only downside is there are some invasive Asian lady beetles, and wifi and cell reception is hit or miss, so be sure to download directions in case you lose signal"
2020-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Place was perfect place to just unwind. Cell reception and wifi are iffy but the fire pit, state parks and friendly town is what you are there for. Enjoy."
2020-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great little house in an absolutely charming town, so wonderful to walk the neighborhood and play in the yard. We had a relaxing weekend checking out multiple state parks and the grasslands; our kids had a wonderful time, going to online school Friday morning and then playing in Franklin Creek in the afternoon."
2020-09-01,5.0,Group trip,Good option in the Dixon area. Charming house with plenty of space.
2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We really enjoyed our stay here! Great setup for 2 couples since there are separate bathrooms attached to the bedrooms. A wonderful spot for a quiet getaway in a beautiful area. Erin was a great host and was very responsive.

2020-07-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"This is a beautiful, comfortable home in a relaxing setting. You will love this place. Everything you need is here, Dixon is just a short drive away, and the streets of Grand Detour are great for walking. Great hosts who do a lot to make your stay the best."
2020-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"A very clean space that comfortably sleeps many. Close to Castle Rock State Park, but hidden away in the quiet and beautiful village of Grand Detour. Our stay was quiet and peaceful."
2020-06-01,5.0,Group trip,"Erin’s place was so well placed. The yard was beautiful and all the little snacks, mosquito spray, and other thoughtful touches really helped. The house is very old and full of character so along with that there were definitely some things in need of repair but overall a completely lovely stay."
2020-06-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"A comfortable, well laid-out house in a beautiful setting."
2020-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a lovely stay and appreciated all the hospitality touches for guests, including tiki torch fluid to fend off the mosquitoes"
2020-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,The yard and views in this country house is picturesque and beyond beautiful. Our family loved it.
2020-05-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"Amazing location! Feels like a peaceful historic village with beautiful old homes, but only 10 minutes to town. Erin and Jeff were so responsive and helpful. Erin took the time to checked our carriers cell signal before we arrived.
For those looking for things to do, you are walking distance to the John Deere museum and the Rock River. In addition, there is a beautiful old church in the neighborhood that would be an awesome setting for a wedding.
Thanks again for such a wonderful experience.
Todd and Deb"
2020-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We loved staying here! It was simply beautiful and we couldn't have been happier with it.
2020-02-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Nice place in the country. Very clean and great big yard!
2020-02-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Clean, quiet, and spacious!"
2020-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Pastoral, perfect and peaceful—a great way to disconnect and be in the moment. The holidays were magical (here/there) and I can only imagine what it’s like in the spring and summer. I will definitely be back."
2019-11-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"The home is simple and charming. We had everything we needed to make Thanksgiving dinner. The first floor bed is very comfortable. (We did not use the 2nd floor bedroom.) There’s lot of space to move around and have several activities going on at one time. There are stains on the carpets and farmhouse bugs but overall, the house was clean. The locks on the doors need to be updated and outdoor lighting is needed but with those additions, we would stay again.
The village is rich with history. It is filled with the cutest homes I’ve ever seen. A visit to the John Deere Historic site is a must! Grand Detour is a hidden gem!"
2019-11-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,My family of 4 had a great time staying at Erin's house. Much more spaciousthan crowding in a hotel room. Erin had bottled water and snacks laid out for us...nice touch.
2019-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"If you are looking for a cozy comfortable quiet getaway this cottage is the very definition Of relaxation. Although we utilize only one bedroom to sleep the upstairs had a meditation room that I thought was a very nice touch to Add onto the peacefulness you feel by staying in this home. The house has tons of character, and the owners are readily availableAnd prompt to answer questions. Thoughtful little touches all around the home for a nice little surprises as well. We found that by the end of the weekend the home had everything that we needed. I will definitely find myself passing through here again."
2019-11-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Quaint farmhouse in the country. Plain but pleasant and clean, it worked well for a working retreat. The Internet was a little less than ideal for us but we made it work. Yoga room was lovely with great light during the early afternoon. Nice hosts who provided sparking water, snacks, and coffee for us to enjoy."
2019-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Lots of great things to say here. Big property, feels like you have privacy. The amenities are pretty great, my favorite is how well the house maintained a comfortable temperature. The host went above and beyond to provide a picture of their backyard fire spot before booking. Also very informative instructional/recommendation sheets. Highly recommended!"
2019-10-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Erin's house isn't perfect, but it is perfectly charming. If you are looking for a quiet getaway in a town that time forgot, Erin's place is it. We were looking for a place with good hiking and biking close to Chicago. We found that and more in Grand Detour.
My husband and I loved Erin's little farmhouse. First of all, Erin was very responsive to our needs. She and her neighbor Jeff are great hosts. There is a huge yard for the dogs to run in. The bed is very comfy, kitchen well stocked, and bathroom very clean. Nighttime in Grand Detour is silent - we slept like babies.
The town of Grand Detour was a huge surprise. It is tucked in a bend of the Rock River - you only had to walk a couple of blocks in either direction and you would be at the river's banks. It is home to John Deere's original house which is open to the public free of charge. It is also full of well preserved mid-19th-century homes which made for nice scenery on our evening strolls.
Nearby are the Nachusa Grasslands which is home to a wild buffalo herd - bring binoculars! There are numerous state parks for hiking, and the rolling country roads are perfect for long bike rides.
Erin's little farmhouse in Grand Detour was the perfect base for our explorations."
2019-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Quirky old house in Grand Detour. 10 minutes from shops and restaurants in Dixon. Lovely, quiet place to stay."
2019-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We absolutely LOVED this place! It's a great get away spot for city dwellers. The house is spacious and clean with rooms to spread out and relax. I recommend the yoga room highly. We built camp fires, grilled, walked by the river (a block away), and almost fell asleep in the Jacuzzi bathtub. This is wonderful place to kick your feet up, turn off the phone, and reconnect with nature and the star filled sky. Thank you to Erin for being such a great hostess. We had everything we needed and more!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Always a pleasure . Private and cozy. Words cant explain . Awesome host . Thanks again jose
2024-06-01,5.0,Group trip,Great place. So much space!
2024-06-01,5.0,Group trip,This place is incredibly secluded and has endless amounts of activities. The property is massive and was perfect for my friends and I. Jose was responsive and friendly!
2024-05-01,5.0,Group trip,This was our second stay!! We all had a wonderful time celebrating my husband’s 60th birthday!! Hopefully the next time the weather will cooperate so we are able to take advantage of all the outdoor amenities available!!
2024-04-01,5.0,Group trip,"This place was awesome!! We have a very big family and for the first time ever we all got to sit together for dinner. You don’t find a space that can accommodate 25 people all too often. Jose was really easy to book with! Super nice guy!
Even though 2/3 days were rainy, everyone had a great time, from our 80 year old auntie to our 2 year old nephew - we all had something fun to do. Definitely considering visiting again."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We had a beautiful experience with my family. We had a great time!!! I recommend it 100%. You won't regret it
2024-04-01,5.0,Group trip,"We were in town for our parents memorial. They both passed away just a month earlier. We were really happy we could all be together in one place. It was big enough to visit with everyone and felt cozy at the same time. We really appreciated the well equipped kitchen and spacious area.
There was plenty to do with outgoing portable and games . The weather wasn’t good enough to enjoy the outdoors very much but would have been a lot of fun. Especially the large walk around deck, fire pit , and kids toys. A few things need to be picked up outside butmitmwas early in the season so I’m guessing that will get done. Appreciated the extra time for check out so we could enjoy a little more time together before ever headed to the airport. Thank you Jose for the hospitality and wonderful accommodations. We left some puzzles for future guests. They were my moms and we know she would like to have them used there."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Great place for great weekend getaway with the family!

Upon arrival we were surprisingly pleased that the cabin and surrounding area was even more beautiful than online pictures. The whole house was immaculate, kitchen big and contained everything we needed. We had food catering and with the commercial stove and oven we were able to heat food. The long wooden table with 26 chairs was perfect for our gathering. Children also had a good time playing outside, on the jumping trampoline and by the fire pit. The beds were comfortable. Jose was a great host always texting and ready to help. He was responsive to all my questions. We all had a wonderful experience and I would highly recommend this cabin to others."

2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We loved staying here! Our family of 14 came out to celebrate my Dad’s 80th birthday. Jose even helped us with early checkin to set up for the birthday. Inside was very clean and spacious. Even though it was beautiful weather, our family kept lingering inside because there was so much to do. The pool table, ping pong, and air hockey were big hits. The amazing table had room for working a puzzle on one end, games in the middle, and still room for all of us to sit and eat. I was afraid with all those activities in one room the sound would be loud but we had no issues. Bedrooms were quiet as well. We also enjoyed the canoes, volleyball and fire pit outside. Very quiet and peaceful! Blessing to have family all together!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This place was wonderful and perfect for a few families to meet up together and spend some quality time all in the same place while still having privacy. Jose was a wonderful host and very helpful and responsive. We had a situation that required some extra attention and Jose was very understanding.
While some reviewers said they wouldn't swim in the river, we canoed/kayaked across the river (very close by) to a more sandy area and the kids had a blast swimming.
Would definitely come here again!"

2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This was a great place for a larger group of people to be together but not be completely on top of each other.
We came for a long weekend with my family (15 total ppl) and were very impressed with the size of the property. If you like to get your steps great for that, there are grass paths that go back throughout the woods that the kids liked to explore on. The boat landing is~3-5 minute walk and the current wasn't difficult to paddle against. We were prepared for a lot of bugs and to be honest mosquitoes weren't an issue when we went, gnats were more noticeable. There is a lot of kindling for fires and the fire pit is nice right on the water, need your own wood.
Each family had their own bedroom and though the main room is right off of all the BRs, the sound was not an issue as I thought it might.
I 100% plan to come back.
Things I wish I'd known: No TV main room (each BR has one); there are pilot flames that constantly run on the range (dont set anything on), BYO TP/paper towel"
2023-06-01,5.0,Group trip,All of us had so much fun we had the best time we played lots of volleyball! We went for a walk when the sun was setting! It was so peaceful we all loved it so much it was 100% worth it! There were enough room for everyone to sleep and be comfortable!!

2023-05-01,5.0,Group trip,"This cabin is amazing. It’s located in a beautiful, private woodsy area at the end of a long drive on the river. There are beautiful views from all sides of the house. Best of all, the enormous common area has a comfy sitting area, huge family dining table, big kitchen, pool table, ping pong table, air hockey, foosball and pac man all in the same space so that the guests naturally gravitate to the same area which is really fun. There is plenty to do outside too - volley ball, a fire pit, a grill, wrap around deck and kayaks. Also, while secluded, the property is located close to downtown Dixon and convenience stores and pharmacies. The owner, Jose, is easy to contact and responsive. The check in process is super easy.

The huge space allowed us to invite family over after the service to share memories and reconnect. The living area was huge and the fireplace was amazing!! The kids, young and old, enjoyed playing ping pong, pool, air hockey and PacMan. Our second night we were able to use the fire pit and the kids made s’mores. We hope to book this house again next summer under happier circumstances. Thank you Jose for your fantastic communication throughout our stay!! ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️"
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Truly an amazing place! We went with a group of friends and kids. You literally have all you need - bedrooms/bathrooms are comfortable, massive space inside if weather wouldn’t be great, plenty of indoor and outdoor games/activities you can just use, ready to go grill; fireplaces, kayaks, etc. We went as fall is getting started and the outdoor space is so beautiful and relaxing. You are on a 10 min drive from supermarket but once on the property, feel like you are in the middle of nowhere - it’s great! (And if we would already know next years school schedule, would book immediately again)"

2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Upon arrival we were even more surprised, the pictures are beautiful but in person WOW ! Warm, cozy, inviting with a rustic charm and all the amenities you could ask for, lots of space and comfort for all 16 of 3 generations. Our first airbnb experience and not our last, Jose was always available and checked on us daily. We are definitely putting this on a annual gathering. The location was perfect 1 1/2 hour away for all . We were on our own island and secluded with a beautiful view of the river yet anything we needed was 10 minutes or less away . We made lifetime memories. It was refreshing to have 4 teenagers without a phone in their hands and playing pool, ping pong, foosbal and the games provided, with their grandparents, aunts and uncles especially cherades., priceless . Thank you Jose there is not one thing that would require improvements, our compliments on the little touches. Thank you !!!!!"

2022-01-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,Great place for a family weekend!
2022-01-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,Worked out wonderfully for our family. Host was very responsive as needed. All the games and outside activities kept our family busy even though it was winter. Very well kept and clean. Loved the big porch and xlarge family table.
2022-01-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,The place was great and spacious. Our family had lots of fun. If you plan to travel with children be aware that there are steep stairs and no gate for the children. Also if you travel here in the winter be prepared to spend several hundreds of dollars in firewood. We kept the fire running nonstop during the day to get it up to about 72. The heating system cannot keep up with the cold Chicago nights. There is no heating upstairs so you have to keep the doors open for the heat to travel and even doing that it was pretty cold upstairs. Other than that the place was great and we had a great time.
2021-12-01,5.0,Group trip,"Clean, spacious, and so many activities for all. 10/10!"

I would highly recommend this property for a large group gathering that enjoys adventure and games!

We were visiting Dixon for a funeral, and even though it was a very sad time for our family, this place offered so much entertainment that we forgot we were even sad. It was so spacious, and the large 26 top dining table was perfect for us to host family from surrounding areas, and spend priceless quality time with each other. Anyone that came to visit was so impressed with the cabin decor and unique wood work. Jose, was quick to respond whenever I messaged him with any questions. We look forward to staying here again, when we visit next time for my grandma’s 90th birthday. I highly recommend this stunning cabin, if you are looking for gorgeous views, entertainment for the kids, enough space for everyone, and an enjoyable vacation to remember for a lifetime!"

2021-10-01,4.0,Group trip,"Amazing location, gorgeous view, very spacious house with tons of entertainment for kids and adults. We personally did enjoyed staying here. Just a few things to improve and will be close to perfect. Bathroom in the first floor needs better water pressure, it would be nice if all fridges were working, all rooms had air conditioning as it gets warm at night. I can us coming back to this place."

2021-09-01,5.0,Group trip,"This lake cabin just outside of Dixon, IL is the perfect retreat for a large group, providing ample space and privacy on a gorgeous setting along the Rock River. The house is clean and well-appointed and comes with games and water craft. Ideal for a family vacation. Jose, our host, was extremely responsive and helpful. Great communicator. The 12 acres of flat grounds offer privacy and ease. The river is just a few steps away from its fabulous wrap-around deck. I would stay here again. Highly recommended. Note: Dixon has 8 brand new pickleball courts at Meadows Park. Enjoy."

2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This place is truly a home away from home! I was sad to leave it behind when it was time to check-out because it was that peaceful and beautiful.
I wish my trip was a lot longer so that I could stay there. The host, Josh, is super cool and friendly. He’s very helpful and communicative so that made everything such a smooth process!
I cannot wait to visit again. This place is highly Recommended by Me and don’t hesitate to book or you’ll miss out.
There are so much good to be said about the cabin but I rather let you go see and enjoy it. It is a safe community.
P.S: Buy some snacks and maybe grocery for when you get hungry at night. It’s a cabin, like come on now 😁😅."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Good spot. Wish I could've stayed when it was warmer
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Great little cottage. Host was very responsive and would stay here again
2023-10-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,Beautiful peaceful place. Would highly recommend. Our only issue was checkout morning something happened and half the house was with out power and no water. I did notify the host with a voicemail requesting help. I did not receive a reply. We hurried and packed to leave and find bathroom amenities elsewhere. Power did come back on as we were leaving but a response from host was never received.
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"If you want a quiet, peaceful and serene getaway. Come here! It was perfect for us and absolutely adorable. We loved the space and the layout was nice! Beds are extremely comfortable and lots of room in the bedrooms it self. The price was great for what you get. The host was great at communicating and helped us with whatever we needed. We felt like the cozy cabin was our home away from home. I bet in the summer this place is even more fun and we hope to book it every time we come back to town to visit. If you are needing a quiet, clean and comfortable place to stay, this is it!"

2023-08-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Had a wonderful weekend with my wife at this cabin. Only thing I was a little put off by was a surveillance camera on the back of the shed pointing at the fire pit area. I felt a little violated by that. Everything else was great!
