The loft is nicely decorated with everything you could possibly need during your stay. The coffee and special treats were very much appreciated.

Vickie was gracious enough to allow for us to check-in two hours early to get ready for the 4pm event and the place was pristine, beds cozy, good shower pressure, nice linens, and in a cool part of Glens Falls! We didn’t get much time to explore the area but we’d love to visit again sometime. Would highly recommend to any guest!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We really enjoyed our stay at The Loft. It's on a quiet street, opposite where the Farmer's Market is held at the weekend. Fairly nondescript from the outside, but the inside is delightful—clean, well appointed, more spacious than the photos would suggest. Everything stocked well. Kitchen was well equipped. And we loved how close the place is to everything downtown: we could just walk everywhere. Very happy with our experience! Tom/Andy"

2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,We stayed at Vickie’s place just for a night as we were passing through on the way home from a long road trip. Glens Falls is a great town. We enjoyed the convenience of being so close to town that we could walk to dinner when we arrived and breakfast before hitting the road again the next day. We were traveling with young kids and grandma and the space was great for all ages.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"Such a clean and comfortable space to call home for the night. So close and convenient to attractions, especially the awesome farmers market on Saturday morning!!

Her communication was quick!
We will be back soon.... Thanks again Vickie."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We were so lucky this place was available. It is just perfect: central to everything, clean and quiet. It has the charm of an old home with updated furnishings. The fact that there is a sign at the entrance asking us to remove our shoes before going upstairs made it feel that much cleaner and cozy. We will be back, for sure!"
2023-07-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"It was the perfect spot for our needs close to downtown and was easy to get to .

2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Loft was perfect size for my trip and conveniently located right in the heart of downtown, walking distance from all the restaurants and shops.

2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a great stay (girls get-away). We walked to restaurants, farmers market, and and art show. We attended a concert at SPAC and the drive was easy.

2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My daughters and I were met with a welcoming and inviting environment. The little things that Vickie paid attention to, such as leaving snacks on the counter (a variety that included treats for all ages), and easy listening music I felt were the extra touches that are very often overlooked. If I had an inquiry, Vickie responded within minutes, and was always able to accommodate.
If ever looking to spend time anywhere near the Lake George area, I’m confident in saying, you won’t find a better place.
Incidentally, I’ve never written a review.
Sincerely, Pat, Payton, and Naomi"

First, it's in a great location - you can walk to a variety of shops, restaurants, bars etc. The space is wonderful and worked great for us. We appreciated the snacks and coffee supplied, washer and dryer and we always appreciate an air bnb stocked with pots and pans and also essential cooking silverware which most forget. This would be a great longer stay"
2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My boyfriend and I stayed here for our recent trip to Lake George. The apartment was located conveniently near the center of Glen Falls, so everywhere we went we only had to do 1 or 2 turns to get to a main highway. Furthermore, there is a very convenient route down Bay St. about 1 mile to the Warren County Bikeway that takes you 8 miles straight to Lake George. This trail is uphill both ways so be sure to tune up your bike beforehand. We ate at the Wishing Well (15 min), the Dancing Ewe Farm with Chef Jody Somers (30 min), and Farmacy (5 min walk) so the location of the apartment was very convenient. Vickie was very responsive and gave us recommendations for food and things to do in the area. The apartment was very clean and the kitchen was stocked with essential dishes and there were plenty of linens. For things to do, I’d recommend Adirondack Extreme Adventure Ropes Course (30 min), Fort William Henry (15 min), Adirondack Axe (10 min), Glen Falls Drive in (10 min), Body Relief Spa (10 min), Prospect Mountain (15 min), and Lake George Outlets (15 min). I would not recommend Goony Golf if your kids are over 5 years old, basically the same thing over and over. Be sure to ask locals for recommendations, that’s where we found the best food and things to do on our vacation. This apartment was the perfect basecamp and the laundry comes in very handy for a longer stay or if you are being active."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The apartment is clean, beautifully appointed, and well stocked. It’s located within walking distance from the park, library, and all the great restaurants, cafes, and shops in downtown Glens Falls.

I would highly recommend this stay and will keep it on my short list when I return to the area."

I liked that the owners thought about everything..
I have stayed at air b and b 's before and I had to buy garbage bags, soap, laundry soap etc! We did not have to use everything they had at the house.. but it was nice to know it was there...
When packing up to for a wedding... you don t think of all the small things you need for everyday use!
I feel the owners cared about there guests and made a great effort to have every day stuff for daily use! Including throw blanks!
That was hugh for me!
We were very happy!

Not to mention the recommendations for local attractions. Throughout the house, we could feel the love and care from the owner and the house was more than ready for our stay.
We explored Glenn falls, lake George and Queensbury. Our family's favorite range from the great escape park (despite it was on a really hot day), the boat tour on lake George, or the prospect mountain. Wish we had more time for what the area has to offer.

It's located in a quiet neighborhood with parking in the back. I was initially nervous about being located on a seemly major street. But it presented absolutely no issues, we were able to sit on the porch in the cool morning and enjoy reading or quiet reflection. The check in and out instructions and information was so easy and straight forward with all questions answered upfront. The home is cute and clean and well organized. Everything was set up for us perfectly. Would really recommend a hassle free stay with Karen."

It is welcoming and comfortable.
There are 3 bedrooms and 2 bathrooms upstairs, all nice. Unlike many homes, however, there is not bedroom with an en-suite bathroom. This was not an issue for us, but if that is important to you, take note.

2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"This was an excellent place to stay. Lots of plusses and only 1 minus.
Peter is an excellent host. His place is spotless and well laid out. It looks brand new and smelled clean and well cared for. The linens were soft and clean. The kitchen was spotless. The bathroom was super clean. The living room was comfortable and well laid out.
The only thing that was a small downside is that it is a bit loud at night and due to the street on both sides of the apartment, so our sleep wasn't very sound. But this isn't at all the fault of Peter. He even went out of his way to provide a container filled with new earplugs in the bedroom. Everything within his control is top notch.
I can't recommend Peter or his place more highly. The accommodations are clean & comfortable, and the price is very fair."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"As usual Peter’s place did not disappoint. Great location, extremely clean and a terrific price!"

2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"There was many positives. Peter meets you during check in clearly explains all the rules and what you need to do. He had great recommendations for the area.
The only problem was its right on a busy road. theres some noise at night from traffic, but its not awful doesn’t ruin the stay.
The apartment was beautiful, and very clean. Overall the stay was great."

The only less pleasant aspect is that the place is a little noisy at night because it is located on a busy street. It didn't stop us from sleeping well.
Thanks to Peter for the quality of this place. This is definitely one of the best I've rented on AIRBNB.

2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"Very large, warm and well-equipped accommodation!
There was nothing missing to cook and feel at home.
Peter took the trouble to show us inside out and how the devices work We felt welcomed
Only downside as the other reviews mentioned, the room lets through the noise of the busy street intersection but with earplugs we slept very well!!"
2023-07-01,4,Stayed one night,"Pete's place is very conveniently located if you want to visit Lake George or Saratoga. It's super clean and comfortable (the full-size bed's a bit small, but we're small people!), the kitchen had plenty of amenities, and the towels were exceptionally plush. Also, it is a noisy intersection (this was mentioned in quite a few reviews, so I was prepared with earplugs)! The main drawback was the late check-in and early checkout (we realize that time is needed to keep the place as clean as it is, but we've stayed in many clean places that had the usual 3pm/11am check in and out. He did actually offer us a much earlier check-in that day, so we got there early, but, as a few other reviewers mentioned, it would have been much more convenient for everyone if we received the keypad code in advance because there was a glitch in meeting the host and there was a lot of waiting around. Pete is a friendly guy and he gave detailed instructions about navigating the space. Generally a pleasant stay."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Absolutely perfect!!!
2023-07-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Very clean and updated
Everything was great except some noise from the traffic"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"Comfortable place with easy accessible parking. Peter was very responsive, which made my arrival simple."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"Good place to stay in.
Really clean and cozy"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,This was a great spot for a quick weekend in Glens Falls. So much better than a hotel for our family of 4! Would definitely recommend staying here.
2023-07-01,4,Stayed with kids,Great and very nice place. Check in was a bit inconvenient because we needed to provide an exact time to be there for Pete to meet us. But it is understandable for him to be there because access to the unit would be confusing without his help. Overall a great stay and would 100% stay again
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We loved our stay with Peter
We highly recommend it
Excellent host
Thank you so much"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,Very nice apartment. Clean and well equipped.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful place. Exactly as described. Great location.
Only noisy street corner thing but it didn't bother us. Recommended. Recommended."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"The apartment was so comfortable and clean, and had everything we needed, plus. It’s very well furnished with a comfy bed. Parking is convenient and off street. It was exactly as pictured. Peter was helpful and on time at checkin. I would stay again and recommend it highly."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"Pete’s place was great! He met with us at and check-in, showed us how to get in, and explained everything that we needed to know about the apartment for our stay. He also provided us with local recommendations and was very nice and friendly! The apartment was very clean, the furniture was comfortable, and the kitchen and bathroom were well stocked with anything you would need. Next time we are in the area we would definitely stay at Pete’s again!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"The place was very nice, clean and had every amenity. Check in was flexible and we felt very welcomed! I definitely recommend this place for anyone looking to visit the area."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"appreciated that Peter met us at the house and walked us through all instructions, thanks!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,The stay was great. Wonderful apartment
2023-07-01,4,Stayed one night,"The gem was just that! Very cute and cozy area. Well kept and stocked up. We were less than 5 minutes from the main strip where we had tons of things to do. The bedroom is very close to the road where there was heavy traffic due to the holiday weekend. I would recommend earplugs if you are a sensitive sleeper. Other than that, things were great! Thanks for having us!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We have stayed four or more times. Excellent as usual. Does not disappoint.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"We’re very impressed with Pete’s home-away-from home place in Glens Fall. This is the ideal place to stay at when you are visiting for a weekend trip or a short staycation. Pete is, by far, one of the friendliest and informative hosts here on Airbnb. His listing is accurately described and a lot of cares are put into the amenities at his cozy place. I highly recommend this listing."
2023-06-01,4,Stayed one night,place is as pictured. Well stocked with what you may need for a stay. Lovely neighborhood with plenty to do in the area. Would book again if coming back to that area.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This is the second time I stayed at Pete’s. It’s convenient and really nice.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"We stayed at Pete’s place one night on our way to Vermont and we had a great stay. Very spacious with full kitchen, living room and washer dryer. We came in late and Pete was there to show us in. We had everything we needed. We will be back."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,Loved my stay here great host great room if i ever come back to glens falls i would for sure stay here again!
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"The apartment is clean, modern and comfortable. Totally renovated. Pete met me to give me the rundown of the place. I have stayed in a rental next door several times so I knew the location quite well prior to arrival. That said, first time guests should be aware that this unit is located at a super busy intersection and the traffic noise never stops. I am forgiving of the noise at this location since I already knew about it from prior visits. But a certain type of guest might have a problem with the noise. Even at 2 or 3 AM there are cars and trucks going by and you will hear every one of them. This is not reflective of the host or the apartment itself, which are both excellent, it’s just a heads up that this is not a bucolic retreat… it’s a safe, clean, but very busy city neighborhood. If you want to walk to all the restaurants, shops, breweries, etc, in Glens Falls, this place offers a perfect location for doing so as long as you can deal with the traffic noise."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Peter met us to show us how to navigate the locks and walk us through the space. It is on top of a barber shop and masseuse (though of course those businesses may change over time)
Pros:
- Very clean
- Had everything we needed - linens, laundry detergent, dishes/glasses, and the fridge even had ketchup, mustard, and hot sauce
- In town on a major artery of the city, so easy to get places
- off-street parking
- water pressure was very good, the water got hot and stayed hot
- sunny bedroom
Surprisingly not a con:
- the stairs up to the apartment - I was a little concerned about them when booking. The steps are a little narrow and steep, and I'm not in terrific shape. BUT it ended up not being a problem at all. The handrail is sturdy, and the carpeting had good grip. By the second time I went up I didn't even think about it.
Cons:
- the flip side of being easy to get to? Street noise. Fine for us, but light sleepers: caveat emptor"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,My friends and I had an amazing stay :)

2021-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"A really nice, clean, comfortable feel. The towels and linens were fantastic. Is on a Main Street, so there is a little road noise."
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Peter's place was perfect. Size was definitely ample for a couple. It was absolutely immaculate. Although we didn't utilize the kitchen really, it had everything needed to make your stay very easy. Towels, shampoo, soap, detergent, washer/dryer, spices, utensil, even ice packs in freezer. They really thought of everything. The location was great for us as we were up in town for the balloon festival. It is also easy access to downtown where we found some great restaurants. Only downsides we found is that the bed was a little small (but made for better cuddling) and apartment was on a busy corner, so there was some outside traffic noise, that did settle down. But I would not take away points for either. Great find and would definitely come back. oh and I forgot to mention it the check in process was a breeze. Pete was so nice, we had keypad entry. Everything was so streamline! Thank you for a great weekend 😊
Barry and Gina"

Peter was kind, helpful and incredibly thorough in showing us around the suite and providing with necessary information needed to use features of the suite.
Conveniently located in Glens falls, close to lots of great restaurants and shops. Also, close to more commercials restaurants if you prefer.

Cottage was adorable, clean and well stocked. I’d recommend staying here. The garden/backyard was a little disappointing but probably due to the time of year. Location was great for the activities we came for. Well worth the price."
2023-09-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"There wasn't a house manual wish this would have been included. There are all different ages that rent, and it would have been nice to have a manual. Wish the host was more available or have another contact that would have been available for emergencies."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Natalie's mini house was so cute and packed with so many unexpected amenities you don't get at other Airbnbs like snacks, drinks and bathroom essentials like shampoo, soaps and toothpaste. The location was perfect for the Adirondack Balloon Festival and walking distance to Crandall Park. We even had our own private driveway with a sweet greeting from her super friendly cat which we just loved. We definitely would love to stay again."

2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very homey feeling as I had her cats greet me by my door- felt right at home. Quiet neighborhood - I had a lot in common with my host as we both liked to garden as she was busy weeding I noted how smart she was using gardening gloves which is something I forget as I discussed some unwanted insect bites like spiders who hide as you reach in weedy stuff or the fact that we are lovers of old Volvo cars- mine are from the 90’s and hers is from the 60’s. Very helpful in giving directions for take out food- my cottage was very clean-a very enjoyable stay
2023-09-01,4,Stayed a few nights,We had trouble getting in as the lock was low on batteries but they replaced them and it worked. Overall good stay.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Natalie’s place is adorable! Small and quaint and has everything you need for a comfortable stay. Lots of great restaurants near by and a supermarket and liquor store very close by too. This was our second time staying at Natalie’s place and we hope to be back next year!
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Natalie was a great host! She was quick to respond & was super helpful and accommodating. The Airbnb was even better than we imagined. Everything was set up so nicely and I loved the home decorations. She even had games, snacks, water, bathroom items, and basic things we needed, ready for us to use. She made us feel at home and her place was just what we needed! Would stay here again. I highly recommend !!!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Our favorite place to stay in Glens Falls. This was our third time staying at Natalie's cottage. It is clean, quiet and comfortable. There was enough room to set up a pack-and-play for our baby."

2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Fantastic stay in an adorable cottage! Could not recommend enough!
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Where do I begin? The cottage was beautiful and cozy, with so many little surprises and thoughtful gestures on behalf of the host, Natalie. We moseyed around for about 15 minutes admiring the decorations. Bathroom was well stocked and very clean. Kitchen was sparkly clean and the host supplied everything needed to cook a meal, with the exception of the food itself. Netflix & Cable available on the TV. I generally don't like sleeping anywhere but home, but the air conditioning and the comfy bed made for a good night's rest. The yard was well manicured and brought about a warm welcoming ambiance. I regret to say we didn't find time to enjoy the firepit at night, although, the host did provide firewood and there was a nice array of seating around the firepit (oh and a hammock too). As for the host herself, she was sweet and kind beyond words. Very easy to communicate with, and showed respect for our privacy, all while being very attentive and accommodating. We will be back for sure!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!!!! This place was nothing short of fantastic, it was clean, had everything you needed to feel right at home and Natalie even did the little things like have snacks and coffee ready for you when you arrive.

Natalie is a wonderful host and quickly helped when a small issue arose. I would recommend staying in her darling cottage."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We were very comfortable in this quiet neighborhood close drive to anything that is needed and just a short 15 minute drive to Lake George. Natalie made sure to greet us and check on our comfort level with her pets. The cottage was super clean with lots of little mindful extras like snacks, water and games. There's a great chill spot with seating and a fire pit, we did not use while there due to the weather but we did sit out and enjoy all the great garden ambiance. Would definitely stay here again!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The cottage was just what we had hoped for. Great size for the two of us and a 5 minute walk to our grandson (and of course his mom and dad.).

2022-08-01,3,Stayed a few nights,The place was beautiful but only good for one person as there is no bedroom just a daybed in the cottage. Some instructions prior about the electric stove & other things would have been nice. The host was nice but not a fast responder.
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Amazing stay! The place is completely private and both the kitchen and bathroom were fully stocked, and other touches such as the guest account on the TV streaming services definitely did not go unnoticed. Nice outdoor space as well. I was only here for two nights, but this would be a great place for a long-term stay. Definitely a deal for the price too!"

The place had everything needed for our short stay. Decorated beautifully. Cheerful. Happy. I’ll rebook when back in the area.
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Ms. Natalie was absolutely wonderful to work with and her communication is excellent!! 🥰 I had such a delightful stay; so much so that i extended my two day stay into nearly a week! I probably would have stayed longer if it wasn't booked. Its not too small, but not too large. I love the private entrance and dedicated parking space. It looks newly renovated and all of the appliances look new as well. I wasn't able to enjoy her garden, but maybe next time around. I am happy to only stay at her cottage when i come into town. The cottage is also in a very safe area. I didn't get back in until 12 midnight a couple of nights, very quiet and nice neighborhood. I'm from the area, and i highly recommend. Thanks, again Ms. Natalie!"

Love the room upstairs and absolutely loved the fact that there were TV's in the different areas.
I would definitely stay here again!"
2023-10-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Stayed in Glens Falls as a base to go to a few hikes about 30 minutes to and hour farther north. Also took a couple days to go to Saratoga Springs and Albany. The hikes were amazing and it was easy getting back and forth. The house was easy to settle into. The days going south to the cities were a bit disappointing. Food was very expensive and often not really worth the price or the drive (30 minutes to an hour). Many of the places we’d planned to go to were closed by the time we were done hiking or just weren’t open. Most stores were closed on Mondays for some reason. Other than that, it’s a very pretty area and I’d have honestly preferred exploring the surrounding smaller towns if it was solely up to me. The house was very nice and a great deal. Jacob was also very helpful and quick to respond to my messages. My only note is that the hot water ran out quick, so if you have more than two people, take that into consideration."
2023-10-01,2,Stayed one night,Shower was dirty and had water splashes as if somebody just showered before we came. Stained sheets and my father and I have bites on our body.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Great place to stay while we waited for the CO to move into our home! Loved the gas stove top, viking vent, and drop in tub. The bed was really high off the ground but it was fairly manageable and very comfortable."
2023-09-01,4,Stayed one night,"Great space, Nice location..."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"What a great place to the stay right at the heart of Glens Falls! Great communication from hosts, parking was a breeze, it was spacious and private with a number of sleeping options. A delightful painting of highland cows really made the space cozy, and me happy. Definitely recommend!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Jacob was amazing in his response to an issue we had, wonderful host."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed about a week,This property was beautiful. The Jacob was very responsive and informative. Will definitely return if available.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"The place was really clean, excellent location, private feeling with a touch of modern rustic."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Super cute & clean! Excellent host communication! Responds right away. Waze brings you to the wrong parking lot address- but Jacob is super proactive & sends pictures to help you find the parking lot with ease. Loved the location - walking distance to restaurants! Comfy bed, excellent linens! A++!
Will certainly book again when I’m in this area!"

2023-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We booked a last minute stay at this location and it was exactly what we needed for a spontaneous weekend. The area is walkable, owner is responsive and courteous, and we enjoyed the space itself.
There were a few dings and loose cabinets from a previous tenant that the owner was upfront about and was all minor enough that you hardly noticed it.
Overall, a great place to stay if you want to explore the lake George and Glen falls area. Convenient drives anywhere in the area and everything you could need within a 5 minute walk or drive."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Such a gem in Glens Falls! Jacobs place is absolutely gorgeous inside and has everything you could need! Walkable to great restaurants as well as an awesome park right around the corner! Definitely recommend staying here when in Glens Falls!!
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Jacob’s air bnb is a gem. It’s beautiful inside, the pictures didn’t do it justice. Great location surrounded by lots of great attractions. Jacob is a great host and very communicative. Would love to stay again!"

2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Pictures don’t do this place justice when it comes to space! So much space, lovely open dining room/kitchen/living room. The bed was very comfortable. So many great restaurants, bars and shops around literally on the other side of the building. Will definitely book again when visiting town."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"A very beautiful apartment. It was absolutely gorgeous and extremely spacious. I loved having my morning coffee on the deck and being able to entertain while family visited. It was a bit hard finding the right light switches to things, especially when checking in after dark but otherwise was an absolutely relaxing and wonderful stay.
Jacob also opened up the booking for me as I was booking last minute and missed the deadline which was very much appreciated.
I’d definitely stay again next time I’m in town visiting family."
2023-05-01,4,Stayed a few nights,The apartment was so well maintained near to many restaurants and shops in a lively neighborhood. Great place to stay. Highly recommend!
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This apartment was absolutely lovely. We had such a great time exploring the surrounding area and the location was great for our Six Flags and Lake George area adventuring. The place was spotless when we arrived, and certainly bigger than what I expected from the photos! There was no AC so we kept the fans running and opened windows when it was cooler in the evening. Overall, we had an incredible stay! We’ll be back!!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,Very clean and 100% nicer in person the pictures don’t really capture how spacious it is
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very responsive host. Handled small WiFi issues quickly and efficiently. Would recommend staying here as it is a walkable area to many shops and restaurants.

2023-03-01,5,Stayed one night,Really nice place and walkable to all restaurants and bars
2023-03-01,4,Stayed one night,"the apartment is really nice. It s not Jacob's fault, it was awfully noisy, we havent been able to sleeping until 1 am as there was some construction work with constant beeping with multiple trucks driving back and loud noise from moving dirt or rocks just down the flat. We were deceived as we stopped there just to sleep. but the flat is really great, the location is great right in the center of the town and the area seems nice."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Great downtown location, easy parking, loved the space and pet friendly. Would stay again."

thank you!"
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Very comfortable space.
I was slightly hesitant booking this as a single woman, traveling alone, when I looked at the pictures of the outside—but the parking area is very well lit, and there are plenty of people around, and I felt very safe."
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Stayed here with my boyfriend and it was perfect. The price was great and surpassed our expectations. It was super cute and basically felt like home. We only had one little hiccup with heating but we messaged Jacob and he very quickly responded which was great. Both him and his wife were super sweet and quick to help out and respond to any concerns. We loved that it was close by to everything especially the supermarket (about 5 minutes away) just in case we wanted to cook anything. Would’ve liked if they had at least some seasoning and things for families or couples that prefer to stay in and cook meals but still give this place 5 stars because it was still amazing regardless. Definitely recommend staying here. It’s perfect for families and couples.

Absolutely top notch in every way."

This was so much better than staying in any hotel. My daughter had somewhere to sleep on the nights she was here as well. It was great. John is a very accommodating host and so nice. On my first night here, it snowed and I had to go to work… he helped me clean the snow off my car, without hesitation. He is very kind. I would recommend this suite/studio to anyone coming into town. It’s got a cute, retro vibe with the essentials you need. And it’s a great location!"

You cam be sure he changes the door code for each guest, which made me feel safe"

There were thoughtful little extras. Water in fridge. Snacks. Brochures with tourist info and more.
Couldn’t ask for more for the extremely reasonable price.

2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Absolutely perfect! The beds were very comfortable. The sofa was great for sitting and reading. There was plenty of light in the room. It’s right in the downtown area so I could walk wherever I wanted to go. I felt very much at home for my three day stay. John has lots of information in the room including a map of Glen Falls which I referred to often. It was also very clean and cozy. I highly recommend this space especially for the price!

2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Highly recommend John’s place.
2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,John is a great host and I have been staying here for four years now . He keeps it extra clean and has thought of everything you will need for a comfortable stay . The location is close enough to everything but still in a quiet neighborhood . I reluctantly say this place is a gem as I don't it to get to popular . If you stay here you will want to come back again !
2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I recommend John’s place. It is clean and convenient, and John was very responsive. I lived for a long time in Glens Falls and this is an ideal location for walking downtown- lots of restaurants, and breweries. It is also only a 4 block walk to the “Shirt Factory” - an old warehouse that on Thursdays has lots of food trucks and music. On his corner of the block is a Rite Aid and a gas station market, so 1- 2 minute walk to grab any items you may need - Rite Aid also has some food. Glens Falls is very safe in general, and no issues with John’s place. It’s well lit and on a street people like to take an evening stroll on. Bed, shower, air conditioning all great."
2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"A lovely stay! This property is exactly as pictured. My sister and I stayed here for a weekend and it's just enough space for two people to crash while visiting the area. We ended up having to be in the house longer than expected because it rained all weekend, but luckily, there were some great board games available to keep us entertained. John also gave us lots of great suggestions for the area and was very communicative. We wanted to see some waterfalls and he recommended a few beautiful ones! Good thing about the rain - the waterfalls were gorgeous! The area is very cute and pretty quiet even though it's in a city of sorts. We were walking distance to the center of Glens Falls where there were lots of cute restaurants and shops."
2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,John’s place has everything that I would need and the instructions are so clear. And John is so friendly and responsive to messages. I’d love to stay there again if I come back.
2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The accommodations are exactly as described. Great value. Communication with John was quick and easy. He was very helpful with the one question that I had.

2021-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Location is the best part of this Airbnb. So close to Glens Falls, can easily walk to anywhere. Very easy, peaceful and safe stay. This humble abode is certainly not stylish, though I can’t say I have any complaints, it was a good stay."
2021-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Second time staying at John's. Had a great time and everything worked out well. Was in the area doing some snowmobiling and snowboarding. Liked the private entrance and private bathroom. Quiet neighborhood.

2020-10-01,5,Stayed over a week,Awesome spot. Great location and an even better host.
2020-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great spot for a quick stay and those who would be fine with a twin bed or a futon. While I did not get to meet John, it was really nice that John had a number of thing at the ready, especially for takeout food - microwave, plates, even the ketchup my order forgot to give me! The offer of juice boxes and breakfast bars were also a nice touch after getting in a bit late from the drive and getting a quick snack. John's place is more of your homey, lived-in type of spot, so don't expect things to be brand spanking new. It offers a bit of his character and a clear love of the Glens Falls area. Loved that he left a few tourism items highlighting some local happenings -- especially recent items such as a drive-in theater nearby that would be honestly not be easy to research without knowing a local, and with all that has changed/altered due to COVID."
2020-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Always a great stay.

2020-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,John’s place was a wonderful pick for our weekend trip! John was really polite and easy to communicate with and keeps the room sparkling clean. This Airbnb is in a great location as it makes it easy to access anything you could possibly want to in the area whether it be Lake George or Glens Falls itself. John left a book with great info for restaurants and resources nearby. If you’re looking for a clean and cozy place to stay for your mountain town trip I highly recommend John’s place.
2020-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great experience! John's place is adorable. It's close to the business center of Glen Falls, where we ate in several very good restaurants. John was super communicative and I felt very comfortable before I arrived that I knew where to go, how to get inside, etc. The room is very cozy, with great local decor, and there's lots of nice touches, like tea and coffee fixings, and even juice boxes in the frig. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay and totally recommend John's place if you're ever in the area."
2020-08-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Had a great stay at John's place. Private entrance, private bathroom, A/C, WiFi. Nice place.

I would highly recommend the cute spot.
2020-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"John is a wonderful host. His place is perfect for the professional traveler looking for a bit longer spot to lay your head and make a home for a business trip or healthcare worker. It would also be great for the vacationers looking for a great spot downtown Glens Falls, very close to everywhere you want to be and less than 1 mile from the local hospital. Great digs and he makes you feel at home."
2020-03-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Perfect for 1 or 2 people, John's studio apt is clean, well-organized & very convenient. It was my 2nd stay there & will likely be my go-to Glens Falls crash pad in the future!"

2020-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"Not sure if you'll find an airbnb with better value for the price. This was the perfect place for me to crash after my long drive, and it had everything I needed: freezer, fridge, comfy bed, private entrance & bathroom. There was even a little fan that I used for white noise to fall asleep! John was very informative and helpful. I'd stay here again in a heartbeat."
2020-01-01,5,Stayed about a week,"This place is very cozy and warm in the winter cold (it got to -5 degrees while I was there), and well-laid out. Sure it's compact, and the mini-kitchen is really a walk-in closet w/ a fridge, microwave & coffee maker. But the setup works great if you leave in the morning to do your thing & come back at night to sleep (what I did). There are even 2 beds! John provided coffee, half-&'half, & breakfast snacks, which was a very thoughtful touch. Good WiFi signal & nice hot shower!"
2019-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"A traveler can expect a cozy room at a reasonable price. One of the questions I was required to answer was if Joh’s Place was what I expected. My answer was that it is about what I expected. I need to clarify what that statement means to mean as it is meant to be complimentary. This was not my first stay at John’s place when I am in the area. I expected it to be the same as my last visit: conveniently located, economical, with John being a great host. So thanks again John and I’m sure I will see you again."
2019-12-01,5,Stayed one night,A+++

2019-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"What a wonderful place to stay. John is extremely responsive and gave advanced directive for check in which was greatly appreciated. I didn’t have to guess. Everything was set and ready to go from before I even arrived. Nice and comfy, very much like staying at a friends house in their spare room. I would definitely like to stay again seeing as I travel to the area often.
P.S. I forgot my winter vest and John made sure to contact me and was even willing to send it back home. Thanks buddy. See ya soon"

The only thing is that since I am 5'10"" bed was a bit short for me, but it was not a big deal since I am sleeping in a fetal position. Will definitely stay here again when visiting!"

It is obvious that he puts time, effort, and thought into making each of his guests feel welcome and comfortable. His communication is clear, accurate, and timely. Furthermore, John knows his neighborhood and the surrounding area very well. He makes excellent recommendations. Glens Falls is a fantastic city with interesting history and lots of personality. There are plenty of things to see, places to go, and unique eateries to try. It is also conveniently located a relatively short distance from so many of the other major points of interest in the region. Glens Falls is pedestrian friendly, and there are a number of local attractions within walking distance of John's rental, including Cooper's Cave, Poopie's, and the downtown. The room itself is clean, cozy, and quiet. It feels safe and private. Checking in is easy, parking is a breeze, and the WiFi is solid. This is an outstanding value.

2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,It is a small cozy place ideal for just two people. The location is centrally located with all kind of shops and facilities as soon as you get down.

We are so happy we stayed in Glens Falls, a picturesque town with great restaurants and a fabulous art museum. Touristy Lake George is only 20 minutes away. We paid a great price and enjoyed being able to walk to all downtown Glens Falls has to offer. Parking is offsite in a garage, but is close if you don't mind a 5 minute walk. Make sure you follow Casey's instructions and park on the FIRST LEVEL of the garage with the YELLOW 41 painted ON THE FLOOR. In addition, make sure you can walk up the 2.5 flights of steps and get into a tall shower/tub combo in the bath. Thank you, Casey, for your open line of communication and the emergency coffee.

Thank you Casey for a great start of another year 2023."
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Amazing stay—perfectly priced and in a cute town that makes a great getaway. Cozy enough for a night in but located right in the middle of things for easy nights out.
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great location with a good parking option. I parked in the municipal lot on the same block most nights as my work kept me away during the 3 hour parking during the day. That made parking very close. I always had the parking garage to fall back on and the walk was short once I figured out which way to walk. Glens Falls is not necessarily a grid layout. While it seemed like a lot of rules before arriving, they were very easy to follow and understandable once you arrived. The kitchen was pretty good and I found everything I needed to prepare light meals. Casey's communication was great and she even offered to suggest some places to eat. Thanks Casey."
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I booked Casey's airbnb to visit family within the area. Her apartment is in the center of downtown Glense Falls.

Really a gorgeous building and gorgeous room in one of our favorite little towns to visit.

2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Casey was an amazing host! I’ve used Airbnb for a while now and Casey stands out as a host for how helpful and attentive she was to making our stay as nice as possible. The loft is just a short walk from a bunch of restaurants and shops. There are multiple places to park the closest of which is also just a minuet walk away.

2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What a beautiful, comfortable room! Right in town, you can expect a little street noise; however, the room was so solidly built (being in an old brick building) that it did not disturb my sleep. Casey made up the sofa bed since I wasn't interested in climbing the stairs to the loft. The sofa bed was very comfy. The air conditioning was superb which was especially helpful in the 90+ degree heat we were experiencing.
There are delicious restaurants within easy walking distance including a gluten-free, vegan restaurant right across the street. The food was delicious! There is a parking lot a few feet away from the building, and Casey had a tag I could put in my car to park there. Be forewarned that parking is at a premium with so many restaurants nearby, but I didn't have any trouble and was able to park either in the lot or on the street very close to the building.
Because the room is on the third floor there are 3 levels of steps to walk up.
The room was spotless! I highly recommend Casey's airbnb!!"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Casey was very communicative and accommodating. The pull out couch bed was perfect. The space was exactly what I needed..

The beds were comfortable and the temperature in the room was just right.
Parking was not deep enough to park my car Ford Expedition, but it was easy to find and check-in was comfortable. The hosts were friendly and answered any questions quickly. So I did not have any trouble. The supermarket was very conveniently located nearby. There was also a coffee roaster nearby.
I would definitely stay there again! Thank you!!"

2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is a great place to stay for two or more people. It is right near downtown and it's so cute. The owners live downstairs, so it is better for people who will be quiet after 11 PM. It is clean and affordable. We extended our stay easily. Host was *immediately* responsive with one door code issue. Would definitely return."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Our stay was very comfortable…great beds…perfect getaway to relax with a quiet street. It was great to get away from the hubbub of the Warrensburg garage sales…we did not lack anything…easy in and out….Thank You!
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Trevor has revamped an old building into a very useable and comfortable space. You need to be able to climb one flight of stairs but once inside it’s all in one level. Nice reception room, lounge with TV to the right (you need to login to apps using your own account), one bedroom immediately on left and one the other side of the corridor leading to the kitchen, bathroom and back office room. No washer dryer but that was ok for the 3 nights we stayed. Plenty of pots and pans, spices and cook books. Trevor left coffee, tea, hot chocolate and creamer, filtered water and a bottle of local sparkling water for our use. The bathroom had plenty of shampoos and other products to choose from. The bed was comfy and clean. It was a great space to come home to and chill. Would stay again."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Trevor's place was very nice. Comfortable, clean and spacious. We really enjoyed our stay. Walkable to food and entertainment in a nice neighborhood. We would definitely go back again. Close drive to Lake George which is nice."

2023-08-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Trevor and Mia were very responsive to all my emails. Mia came out and greeted us when we got there, and was very nice to deal with. The apartment was clean, everything worked fine and the shower had good water pressure, which is always important to us. Took me a while to figure out the Roku TV, but I never used it before so no big deal."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The place was nice, well-located, and easy to stay at. Glens Falls is a great place to be; walkable and great restaurants. The apartment was as described and simple. I would certainly stay again! Thank you!!"

No worries"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We didn't have a reason to contact Trevor because everything was exactly as described.

I wouldn't hesitate to stay again."

2023-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,Clean and comfortable
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My wife and I stayed two nights to ski at Gore. Trevor & Mia’s place was so much better than my usual 2.5 star hotel stays in the area, at a comparable cost. They were welcoming via AirBnB from the minute I reserved. On check-in day, texts to them were immediately answered. I never stayed at an AirBnB with such a rich selection of shower products, and the water temperature and volume far exceeded expectations. We relaxed by ordering dinner in and watched a movie on their great entertainment system using their thoughtful “Guest” Netflix account. We especially appreciated the teas and beverages we were invited to consume. So future skiers are aware, it’s 45 minutes to Gore, but West Mountain is practically right there. Cheers!"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Ease of checkin and lication to hospital! Excellent quick communication with homeowner made last minute plans one less worry.
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Very nice, private 2 bedroom second floor apartment. The kitchen and bathroom were fully stocked with all the amenities to make you feel at home. Beds were comfy too. Close to downtown area and hockey arena. Would stay here again."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Very comfortable, bright, quiet and spacious unit! We really enjoyed the proximity to downtown and enjoyed walking the dog to 'Spot' coffee shop (which allows dogs to come in). The kitchen is well equipped and the homes in the area are a feast to the eyes if you enjoy older architecture. NOTE: the Davidson Brewery also allows dogs to dine in, and have a dog menu as well!"
2023-03-01,4,Stayed one night,"We enjoyed our stay at Trevor’s house and would recommend it to others. It is a great location, walking distance to bars and restaurants. It is an older home and cozy. Beds were very comfortable. Definitely a great value for your money. I would rate this as 5 stars but we had a couple of issues that Trevor was very responsive with. There were some issues with the previous tenants and how they left the house and timing. I wouldn’t let this stop me from booking again. Trevor was a great host and responsive to all our needs. He went above and beyond our expectations to help resolve the issues. Thank you Trevor."

Thanks again for another great stay!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Best value in Glens Falls if what you need is just a clean, simple room to crash in for a night or two. Safe, walkable neighborhood very close to downtown restaurants and such. Host is right on the mark with communication and the rooms are exactly as represented in the ad. Have stayed here many times when visiting Glens Falls for mountain biking and will continue to do so."

2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Unbeatable price for a clean, basic room near downtown Glens Falls. I visit the area regularly for mountain biking, usually solo, and this hosts rooms always work well for me. They are not fancy by any means, but always clean and well appointed. Perfect for a solo traveler, as the ad says. Usually I eat my dinner out because there are plenty of good restaurants in GF, but this time I brought back some food for dinner and made use of the kitchen area, which is a bonus. Check in is always a breeze via the lockbox. Walkable location to any of the restaurants and such downtown or over by the shirt factory, so you’re in good shape here whatever you choose to do for meals."

There's always coffee and other breakfast amenities, the rooms are very clean, and the beds are very comfortable. Definitely a future guest!"

2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My partner and I had a wonderful stay at Jenine's place! From the ease of check in to the amenities- parking lot behind the house, clean and comfortable living room, kitchen with basic kitchen tools and pans, dishes, cups, glasses and silverware (including baking sheet, brownie pan and pizza pan), eat in countertop plus dining table, full set up coffee/tea stations both in the kitchen and upstairs where our room was, and extra bathrooms in the shared rooms. Our room had it's own bathroom and she supplies towels and sealed soaps like a hotel would. We had complete privacy and met other guests, who were respectful and friendly, in passing. We had ease to come and go and had no issues with the lock system. We met Jenine's mother on the way out and she was lovely. Will absolutely stay there again! Our go-to when in the Glens Falls/ Saratoga/ Lake George area <3"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"The room was great, clean, with bathroom, fridge, AC, tv. The bed is a little smaller than queen size. Neighbors were quiet. You have to stay quiet, otherwise your neighbors will hear you."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,Great place....easy to access. Close to SPAC. The room was clean and neat. We would certainly stay there again. Thanks for everything.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Third time staying in room 4. We like the en suite bathroom, location & price. This time we had our infant with us. The room is big enough to fit a pack-and-play next to the bed."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Absolutely fantastic. What’s to complain about. Perfect location, great parking, CLEAN AF room and house. We just loved it so much. That shower though…dreams are made of that shower."

2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great house and Jenine replied promptly to messages.

In the room, the clock on the wall and the clock on the microwave… were both correct!
Even the minor details receive attention.
Thank you for a pleasurable stay."

2023-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great to have the private bathroom that comes with Room 4. Jenine is a responsive host, and open to questions etc. It is a convenient, shared house with other Airbnb guests. 2nd time I've stayed here. New, high quality linens. Room 4 has an extra firm mattress with zero squish. Lots of Kuerigs!"
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I had a wonderful stay at Jenine's! A lovely home that exceeded expectations. Ideally located to explore the many museums and outdoor activities that Glen Falls and its surrounding areas have to offer.

I look forward to visiting again soon!"

2023-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"Have stayed at this listing several times and it continues to be an attractive option for me. I visit the Glens Falls area frequently for mountain biking, usually alone, so this host’s traveler’s rooms suit me just fine. Not fancy but homey… clean rooms, always ready on time, convenient to walk downtown for dinner or other activities. The host always emails instructions the morning of your stay with entry codes and such. At well under $100 this is an ideal option for a solo traveler who needs a clean, respectable place to crash in GF but does not require the full tourist experience."
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We loved our stay here. The room is gorgeous and the kitchen downstairs is fully stocked with spices and pots and pans if you want to do any cooking.
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Wonderful stay as always. My “go to” place to stay in Glens Falls to visit family. The hosts are always very accommodating & great communicators, even during the busy holiday season. The room was very comfortable & the location is fantastic. It has a homey feel & was nicely decorated for the holidays. They also accommodated my son last minute, when the weather turned bad! The hosts even left a gift for us under the Christmas tree. Nice touch! Great place & wonderful hosts. Will definitely be back!"

2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Always a great stay
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This room was much better than we anticipated! The house is very clean and more hotel-like than your average air bnb room in a shared house booking. The bed was comfortable and we really liked having a bathroom in the room rather than sharing one. We were in town to visit a friend and I’m already familiar with the area- it’s definitely walking distance to downtown. Janine was easy to communicate with and was transparent about updates happening to the house (repaving driveway, and roofers working on the house) neither of which was too inconvenient. Very comfortable and great location- highly recommend!"

2022-08-01,5,Stayed one night,Have stayed with this host 3 times now and will certainly stay again on future trips to Glens Falls. Nothing fancy but definitely clean and convenient… ideal for a solo traveler who just needs a place to crash for a night or two.

The house is very nice and modern, as well as the spaces are very comfortable and fraternal
I would only pay attention to only one bathroom, every house with 3 bedrooms, so it can make it difficult to get ready. In addition to the fact that it is on the first floor and the bedrooms on the second."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,Joe was proactive in reaching out to us to make sure we felt at home and had a smooth check-in. I would recommend this place 100%

The house looks very new with brand new appliances, furniture, and window blinds. The beds were very comfortable. The backyard is adorable and we wished we were staying longer so we could have had more time to enjoy it. The house is a quick five minute drive to downtown Glens Falls where we loved trying out all the restaurants. We couldn’t have asked for a better place to spend 5 months. The best part of staying here was Joe. Anytime we had an issue he was super quick to respond and would get the problem fixed right away. You could tell he really cared about us enjoying our time here. If we ever find ourselves back in the area it is definitely a place we would stay again."
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Really enjoyed our stay here.I got this place to have a nice thanksgiving reunion with some family and it accommodated me and my grandmother very well.

The beds and pillows were so comfortable, we all slept peacefully. We watched movies on the large sofa, cooked steaks in the full kitchen, and roasted marshmallows in the backyard fire-pit while drinking rum-tinged hot cocoa.

2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Ashley left a list of recommendations for all meals, along with some menus. Her place was easy to find and to get into, and we had everything required for a great stay. She was very friendly, and it was an overall great find."
2023-08-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"The only thing I can say was a bit bothersome was that at a little earlier than 8:00 in the morning on Sunday, the lawn maintenance guy showed up and ran a weed eater and lawn mower. We felt the lawn was a bit long as we first pulled in on Thursday afternoon and it made the place seem vacant.
Only other small thing (no pun intended) is that the bed is very small. If it stated in the amenities that it was only a full size bed, I must have missed it. Was just a little small for two people when one is over 6’2” tall. Haha. Lots of stairs to get up into it but overall a quaint little apartment. Very nice front balcony that we utilized quite often during our stay. Very affordable, fantastic location and pleasant experience! If it’s available again next year, for the same price, we’ll surely be looking for it. 😊"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"So close to the bike path and easy to get to Lake George by bike or car. It was worth having a quieter space to return to after being a tourist in the area, would happily return to Ashley’s unit again If I’m back in the area in the future!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I was working in the area for a few days and just wanted a quiet place where I could make my own meals. The apartment was perfect - on a quiet side street, scrupulously clean, silky sheets, thick towels."

It was very homey and cozy, and was easy to fit right in. The shower was a one person, standup shower and it was a little small, but it was perfectly fine. The kitchen was well stocked. We had an absolutely lovely week!"

2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Kate’s place was as described and in a great, quiet location. It is in an older looking neighborhood and the house itself is older as well. There was one bedroom with a full size bed, and the other bed was in kind of a “loft” space, rather than a bedroom - so if you need two separate, private bedrooms than this may not be the best fit. The space had everything that we needed for a quiet weekend!
Just a heads up, if you are a larger person the shower is quite small!"

There were other guests, but I wasn't much aware of them until I ran into a few while I eating breakfast in the morning. I highly recommend Jenine's place."

It was a long, hot and rough day for me as I was on the road all day and there was nothing like the feeling of coming in to a relaxing, cool, clean home. Space felt/looked/smelled really clean and refreshing. Loved all the little custom touches and details to the home and welcoming set-up for the guests. Room is very comfortable, cozy, and private. I would return again if ever in the area. Highly recommend!"
