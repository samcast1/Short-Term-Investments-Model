2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"As usual our stay at Sarah’s cottage was wonderful. Getting checked in is seamless and the cottage was as usual clean and very well set up with comfortable furnishings and amenities. The weather was perfect for eating outside in her beautiful garden. We had a busy activity schedule every day of our stay, so I’d say our only regret is not having enough time to just relax at the cottage during the days there."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place! Highly recommend.

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We had an amazing time and got to celebrate my wife's birthday. Nights there were very peaceful and we enjoyed our time. We are appreciate Sarah for letting us stay in the cottage
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Sarah‘s cottage was a perfect spot for my wife and I to use as home base for a 4 day trip to the area. We visited San Francisco via the ferry, and Armstrong Redwood Nature Preserve and Point Reyes Park via car. All were an easy commute and fun day trips. Sarah was very communicative throughout our stay, and had some great suggestions on restaurants in the area. Truly enjoyed our stay!"
2024-04-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Sarah’s place is very quaint and nice! She was very proactive and thorough in her instructions. She saves you a spot to park right in front of the place, we felt safe at Sarah’s. Only thing I noticed was the second night on our way in from the day we opened the door to the cottage and it smelt like propane gas from the stove even though it was off like it could be leaking? We opened the windows which helped and were fine after that! The shower is also super small so if you’re tall it may be difficult. Overall the place was very nice and beds were extremely comfortable! Would stay again if in the area! Definitely great place for the price, walking distance to the ferry! Also highly recommend the cafe around the corner, Moschetti Cafe."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Would definitely stay with Sarah again!
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The beds are so incredibly comfortable with tons of pillows. The gardens are beautiful that surround the place, you can tell the owner takes great pride in her home and making everything perfect for her guests too. Delish coffee, creamer, sour dough bread (entire loaf), butter, and jam for snacking or breakfast. The bathoom is stocked with full amenities (even if you forgot something, she may have it). Sarah is just the absolute sweetest hoast and so friendly. Highly recommend!!"
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Sarah’s cottage and garden was a wonderful stay. Everything was placed thoughtfully and there were lots of towels available. The mattress was high quality along with the rest of the decor & furniture throughout. Lots of amazing local restaurants & cafes just 8 minutes walk away. Highly recommend.

2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Sarah's garden cottage was perfect for our relaxing Christmas stay. It is roomy, beautifully decorated, very comfortable, well furnished and set in a lovely, private garden. It is located in a quiet neighborhood of nicely restored victorian cottages that has easy access to area attractions and plenty of good restaurants.
Sarah is a wonderful host, very friendly and helpful. She anticipated our needs and went out of her way to make sure everything was perfect for us.

2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"The place was exactly as described and a perfect base for my family's exploration of the area. A work delay caused us to arrive later than initially hoped, and Sarah was accommodating, leaving clear check-in instructions and making sure we could still get settled after our trip."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Sarah is a wonderful host! We can't say enough about her hospitality - cleanliness, great communication, amenities. The unit is private and secluded in a wonderful garden. We absolutely would stay here again!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"Sarah’s cottage was a lovely space for our longer stay! We felt right at home in the lush garden and it was conveniently located between several hubs and sights in the area (Napa Valley, Berkeley, SF, Point Reyes, Muir Woods). Sarah was a very welcoming and accommodating host, with lots of helpful tips about the neighborhood & region. Thank you for the hospitality!"

2023-07-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,"Sarah was lovely to talk to, responsive, and very thorough with explaining how to get to and enter her guest house. It is a quaint ""cottage"" feel space with a rustic vibe and beautiful photography . The bed is very comfy, and the bedding really nice, of good quality, and cozy. I didnt sleep well because of a couple aspects that worried me throughout the night...
1) There is an older gas stove in the place that I believe is leaking gas. It was very strong, and I had to leave all the windows and door open to help bring in fresh air.
2) There are no screens on any of the windows or the door... so I slept with one eye open for fear a critter, or ""something"" may creep in and join us. 😳
The bathroom is very tiny, which I dont mind. However, the shower is suitable for someone no taller than 5'2"". Clean and stocked, none the less.
My only other complaint were the non-stick pots and pans provided for cooking with. They're very old, unusable, and toxic. Time for new ones! 😉"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Sarah was easy to communicate with and the cottage was perfect four our short time visiting Napa. Thank you!
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We were in town to visit a friend who had been ill. Between times visiting with her, we were in a lovely garden and room, feeling restful and serene. The room was large and cleverly divided, beds were so comfortable, kitchen easy to use, and everything we needed was available. Hope to come back!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay. Host was very helpful and gave clear instructions on how to get to air bnb.
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We always love our stay with Sarah, the cottage is always well-supplied with some breakfast food, coffee, half and half, butter, tea, jams, etc. The bedding, linens and towels are of excellent comfort and quality and we all slept wonderfully:-)! We’ll be back!"
2023-05-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Sarah's cottage was cozy, clean, and comfortable.
It was the first time we used an open studio style place and we enjoyed the feeling of openness and home, surrounded by the green plants, flowers, and trees of the garden.
Sarah was friendly and accommodating and we'll look forward to spending more time at her cottage in the future."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"This little cottage was perfect for our needs. It was beautifully decorated, quiet, and felt very safe. The garden surrounding the cottage made it feel like a secret hideaway."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful place to stay within walking distance of downtown Vallejo and 30mins from Napa! Sarah was very friendly, responsive, and accommodating!

2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Sarah's cottage was adorable and even more than the pictures show. She was incredibly sweet and friendly. She thought of all the things we might need and had thoughtful touches to the cottage. The beds were so comfy, and the cottage was spacious. The kitchen worked great. She stopped by to make sure we felt comfortable and had ideas of fun things to do no matter the weather. She was beyond knowledgable about the area and it's history, and seemed to really enjoy having airbnb guests. Thank you Sarah!"
2023-03-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Sarah is very knowledgeable about local history.
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Sarah’s place was such a quiet and peaceful cottage. It’s not very far from Berkeley and Napa so we visited both of those cities. Sarah is so thoughtful. She left us clear directions to her place and she also left some food for our breakfast. Next time we are around Napa, we are going to stay at Sarah’s place again!"

2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"had an amazing time staying at Sarah’s Cottage
If you want to get away from the city and be a little isolated but close to everything this is the place for you.. Sarah’s garden definitely brought you somewhere else. It was peaceful and just what I was looking for. The town itself isn’t exciting but the freeway is so close you can get to the next towns over. The cottage was very clean and felt like home. 10/10 recommend."
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"If you should ever be so unfortunate to need Kaiser rehab, Sarah's place is a refuge in a storm and Sarah couldn't be more kind. The place is cozy and had everything I needed to make my breakfast and get to the hospital every day. There was a problem with ants invading but that's a seasonal thing and Sarah was very responsive about the issue."
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Stepping into Sarah's garden is a luscious step into a ""secret garden."" Although it's readily accessible to the major highways, her cottage is nicely tucked away so there's no traffic noise. The kitchen set-up is well-stocked for cooking/baking/coffee. One thing to be aware of is that the bathroom and shower ceilings are quite low. We enjoyed the two nights we stayed at the cottage and would definitely check if it's available when visiting the Vallejo area again."
2022-11-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Sarah, a great host gave us the perfect guidance on the nearby places to visit. A very nicely located place to reach multiple locations. An excellent value for the money
Could do with some additional cooking utensils, peelers, etc. but sufficient for some simple cooking.
Houses in the region were built with limited spaces inside unlike the spacious houses of the south. It takes a little used to the lack of space, especially in the restroom"
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Hidden in a beautiful garden, this cute little cottage is a quite get away after the hustle and bustle of activities in and around San Francisco. Sarah is a great host with lots of great ideas and suggestions. We’ll be back, for sure."

2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"A stay in Sarah's cottage is like staying with a friend. She offers a warm, hospitable private space that is a bit of heaven in the middle of an urban neighborhood. It is just a few blocks from great restaurants and interesting things to do. Sarah is a local historian and can fill you in on things to know, do and see. The space is simply perfect. Quaint, cozy, private and more than adequate."

2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The cottage was a wonderful spot for our party to use as a home base/ restful retreat. Sarah was a lovely host with helpful recommendations and great communication. The garden is incredible and we were able to enjoy fresh lemon water in the mornings courtesy of her backyard tree. She even was kind enough to bring me ice and some frozen peas for my sprained ankle! We would certainly go back next time we are in town.
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Sarah’s garden cottage is a wonderful place to relax and get a peaceful retreat! Location is excellent as it is about 30 minutes from everywhere - San Francisco area, Napa, and the rest of Wine Country. Love the garden too!"

2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"As we’ve come to expect, everything was wonderful at the cottage! This is our 4th stay with Sarah and it is our favorite getaway spot for the two of us. Lovely linens are provided generously, nice appointed kitchen and bathroom and living area. Sarah leaves a nice assortment of tea, coffee, condiments, bottled water and also bubbly water this trip:-). There was a load of sourdough bread and a cube of butter waiting for us as well. Phoebe came to visit almost every morning so we got our daily dose of sweet puppy love to enhance our days there! Sarah’s gardens and her cottage offer a perfect refuge and we look forward to staying with her in the future!"
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Sarah is very nice and welcoming 😁
Vallejo is 30 mins from Vine county. 40 to San Fran or you can ferry to San Fran.
We did a redwoods hike 1hr 20mins away . It was a great location to hit up the mountains and the city. Beautiful garden 🪴"

The bed was extremely comfortable and I slept very good.
The bathroom is a little tight but manageable.
The garden outside is pleasant and having coffee outside in the garden is a peaceful way to start the day.
The space is well equipped with the essentials and utensils, plates, and cleaning supplies were easy to locate.
The host left a few treats which were highly appreciated since I had several long workdays and could not stop at the store."
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Thee Best Place to stay in Vallejo! Beautifully curated and well stocked. This place has everything. An airbnb triumph.

2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Enjoyed our stay in Sarah’s guest cottage. Was clean, comfortable and easily accessible. Great location"
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The studio style cottage is so cute! It looks exactly like the pictures and comes equipped with most of the basic necessities you will need during your stay. It is nestled away in the back of her property which has ample space and tons of beautiful greenery surrounding it. The place is quiet and peaceful, in a very quiet neighborhood. She has water fountains running in the backyard which create a soothing sound to fall asleep to. The only bad thing is the shower if not built for tall folks so if you're tall you might have a hard time. Overall, loved the place and would definitely stay here again. So much to do in the neighboring cities!"
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We throughly enjoyed ourselves here. We would recommend this little cottage to all who visit the area. It had all that we needed and then some.

2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Best AirBNB stay ever. Sarah was an amazing host. She is a real member of the Vallejo / SF Bay Community and she took time to help me explore her community in depth. There is so much more to Vallejo than what I thought. Thank you Sarah!
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great little studio in a beautiful backyard garden. The pictures were all very accurate and Sarah was very kind and provided bread, English muffins, and suggestions for around the area. The appliances aren’t the most modern, but they did their job and we had a great few nights of cooking. My only small complaint is that the bathroom is quite tiny. I am 5’10” and needed to squat in the shower to not hit my head sometimes. Other than that, a lovely place with a lovely host! She isn’t the most responsive on Airbnb but replies almost instantly if you text her :)"
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a nice stay at Sarah’s. She was really nice and accommodating. The place is great! It’s a good size, has everything needed for cooking, wifi worked great and it was cozy. The outside was very pretty and it was private.

We found the people in the area to be very friendly."
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Such a fun little gem. Sarah was very welcoming and had a wealth of knowledge about the little town. She pointed me in the direction of their monthly art fair which was a blast. Great night sleep and such a comfortable bed.

2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Sarah’s cottage was so lovely and cozy! I only wish I had more time to enjoy the beautiful garden as well as the cottage itself. I stayed here for a 3-day-long work event in Napa and it was a close distance for great value. The provisions (bread, tasty butter, and good coffee) provided by Sarah were also much appreciated and a lifesaver when I checked in early (for which the flexibility was also much appreciated). It was the perfect space and just what I needed for my trip."
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Sarah was a very kind person and attentive to our family. We had a great stay in her cozy cottage and beautiful backyard.

2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The Garden Cottage is wonderful, and Sarah is a thoughtful and welcoming host. The beds and linens were luxurious, and the kitchen has everything one would need—coffee, tea, condiments, utensils, dishes—and more. Perhaps most delightful is Sarah’s artistic sense of color and design, within both the cottage and the surrounding garden. Also, the “old Vallejo” neighborhood in which they’re located is filled with charming houses and is within walking distance of many restaurants and the ferry to San Francisco. This is truly a “find” in the Bay Area! I’m looking forward to returning."
2021-05-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Sarah is a great host and we had a relaxing stay in the cottage at the backyard of her house. One thing your should know is the bathroom in the cottage is almost openly built to the room and there is no fan in it. Depending on who you are staying with, it could be awkward with the bathroom."
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Fantastic! This little cottage was so cute and the perfect little stay for a trip to Napa! Sarah and Phoebe were too kind to us!
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"A really lovely garden studio, nicely decorated with lots of space for 3 of us. Thoughtful touches such as food items, few games for kids, magazines/books. Small bathroom, my husband who is 6”1 struggled to fit in shower, however it does the job. A good base for exploring other areas (close to San Fran ferry and Napa) but wouldn’t recommend Vallejo itself. Sarah was very friendly and welcoming, but also gave us privacy."
2021-04-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"This place is a hidden gem - as is the host.
I can honestly say anyone having the opportunity to stay here will be delighted.

2020-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Sarah is a thoughtful and great host. Her place has everything you need during the stay. Especially in this pandemic. Every drawer is a surprise. Super convenient! The view is great. I love her garden a lot. I would definitely recommend.
2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"Sarah and her cottage are delightful! I just recently moved to CA and needed a place to stay while my rental was getting ready. This was a comfortable and peaceful place for close to 2 weeks. I loved the gardens (very English cottage-like), how quiet the area is, visits from the house dog, Phoebe, the comfortable bed, and fast internet. Sarah is the best airbnb hostess! She provided several food staples for me (bread, cream, butter, fruit, jam, etc), brought me lemons from her lemon tree, and continually checked on me to see how I was doing, especially when we had a heatwave (the fan and portable AC in the unit made it perfectly comfortable). The location is close to a lot, including wine country and the ferry to San Fransisco. There is a great restaurant a few blocks away and a farmer's market on Saturdays that was excellent!
Highly recommend!
You will have a wonderful time staying here!"

2019-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"“Comfy 2” is a unique space because it is like sleeping in a treehouse. Somehow, the rooflines and trees intersect to offer wind, breezes and light that is enchanting. Along with these wonderful hosts, family and canine companions, the coffee, creamer and refrigerator were thoughtful touches. I will be back."

2018-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Come to this home, as it is lovely. and also look deeper into Vallejo as a destination. The ferry to San Fran.; Mare Island wine, beer and museum, shopping unique spots downtown. City fathers made a real effort this year on trash and crime- it is as safe as anyplace. This is the best weather and Vallejo is pretty right now. Out on the shore there are seabirds migrating in, and swans at the little lake in Dan Foley Park."
2018-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Visitors can relax in their back yard garden, and soon they may grow vegetables. This family welcomes you with open arms, a few mannerly canines and lots of comforts. Sleeping in the Comfy Cozy 2 room is a revelation: like being in a tree top. First rain!"

The bathroom is always clean and those towels! Large thirsty and scrumptious. There’s coffee or cocoa and refrigerator for your food. Welcomed by the dog chorus, I disappear upstairs and rest."
2018-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The back yard is one of the most outstanding features of this lodging, beautifully landscaped, with a fire pit-or if they choose, serene silence for the guest. The neighbors are often around but party in a mellow fashion, guests are welcome to greet and join. A family atmosphere."

2018-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"In ""Cozy/Comfy 2"" the amazing experience happens when you open the windows and go to bed, you'll sleep with the sound of wind in the trees, occasional road noise, and wake to the sweet sight of birds playing in the tall tees next to the window! what an experience. A heavenly set of sheets, comfortable bed and great bathroom-plus a family atmosphere.

2020-02-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"This place is a pretty good deal. It's close to downtown Napa, about 20 minutes. It was pretty much exactly as listed. The bed was small but comfy and clean. Roomy was tidy. There were towels available if I needed to shower, but I did not know where the bathroom was in the large house. Tried to use the kitchen sink but there were no faucet handles? Ended up stumbling across people sleeping in the other rooms (I arrived late at night) so I gave up. I lost reception in the area, so really needed the wifi to communicate with the host and plan the rest of my trip to the area. I would recommend to ask for the wifi in advance. Other than some hiccups with the details, this place was a good value. I would stay here again."

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We enjoyed our stay!
2023-10-01,5.0,Group trip,"Amazing view, nice quiet neighborhood. House worked out great, and especially noteworthy is the fact that the listing says 4 bed, and it genuinely has 4 beds in 4 proper bedrooms. Only minor issue is noise carrying easily under the doors which do not fit particularly well."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,We had a great stay and would love to stay again! Jee was really friendly and responsive. So glad we were able to stay!

2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Jee’s place is exactly as advertised in the photos. Great views and space. We were here for 2 nights for a Napa long weekend. Jee was also very responsive to questions on the first day.
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We enjoyed our stay at Jee Wung’s place! It was very clean, in a safe-feeling neighborhood, and the view is incredible. The kids loved watching boats and birds go by from the deck. There was a pack n’ play, which we were very grateful for. Beds were comfortable. Only downside was that the space was pretty reverberant, which made it a bit loud when the kids were playing. Other than that, it was great! We would stay again."
2023-08-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,"Her was wonderful and the view so relaxing. All communication and instructions were clear. The kitchen was well equipped and we appreciate Oates the handicap accessible bathroom.
Unfortunately there were several issues with the house from toilet not flushing to a hole in the wall, and dirty walls, to the living room chair being broken, water on the refrigerator broken leaving us to pump water from a plastic container on the floor, to very sparsely decorated. Most walls are empty. It worked for our purposes and we made the best of it but for over $400 a night that place should be impeccably kept and it is not at all. Put some love and care into this place and it would be worth the spend."
2023-08-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,A million dollar view in the backyard. The immediate neighbourhood was fine but in general it’s a bit rough. The house and amenities were nice and as advertised.
2023-07-01,5.0,Group trip,Jee's house was exactly what we were looking for. The house was clean upon arrival. It has everything that we needed for a group of 8. The views from the house were incredible. Jee was very responsive to messages when we had questions. Great stay!

2023-06-01,4.0,Group trip,"We really enjoyed our stay! Jee was very responsive. We appreciated being allowed an early arrival. We LOVED the daily happy hours on the deck! The view is wonderful and it was fun watching the birds, the ships coming and going and one day, a bunch of sail boats. The garden is lovely! So many flowers in bloom and the hummingbirds loved them as well. This single level home w/4 bedrooms, all w/king beds was a perfect fit for our gathering of 8 senior adults. The house was not as clean as it should be though! I washed the kitchen and dining room windows. The freezer is very dirty, the bathroom rugs dirty or stained. There were not enough coffee cups for all 8 of us, which is kinda a big deal for us coffee drinkers. The dining room is spacious and easily fits 8 people."
2023-06-01,4.0,Group trip,The view was spectacular!
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Great place to stay. Home was very clean, layout was awesome, and the view was spectacular. The beds were comfortable, too."
2023-06-01,3.0,Group trip,"It was not very clean. There were stains on the sheets. We had to clean and wash coffee mugs because there are only 5. For a place that sleeps 8, that is not acceptable. The cooking utensils still had food stuck to it and the glasses had greasy lip prints on the rim of the glass. It lacks seating for 8 people. The freezer was disgusting as there were crumbs and food stuck to the inside of it. The water pressure in the shower was severely lacking. The shower would not stay on due to lack of pressure. If you need a place in a pinch this would be ok but I would not stay here again."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Beautiful view. Great host.
2023-05-01,5.0,Group trip,"Good location, safe, nice to have 4 bedrooms with king beds."
2023-05-01,4.0,Group trip,"The view is unbeatable. The unit can use some updating. There are lots of rule about cleaning up behind yourself, a reasonable of cleaning should be expected; however, with all the cleaning rules I question why were charged a cleaning fee."

2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Jee was very easy to communicate with and we enjoyed her home. Highly recommend.
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This view is everything! I was in town for a family wedding and Jee's home was the perfect place for my family to convene. My fiance, parents, siblings, and niece (2) all shared the space and had room to sleep, relax, and eat together.
It was peaceful, fairly private, and had unbelievable views we loved taking in each day. We were even treated to watching Osprey and Paragliders soaring over the cliffside.
One thing to note - the neighbors have two (friendly) dogs next door, but they bark like mad if you or your family is playing with a ball or blowing bubbles."

2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We had a really nice visit with relatives in the area and the home was a good location for going to San Francisco, the East Bay and Napa. The home slept 7 people comfortably. One child decided they wanted their own bed so they took the roll away bed into the living room. That was nice to have available and it did have a sheet and pillow but no blankets. It worked out fine with towels and a coat.
The kitchen could use some medium size serving bowls and some zip lock bags. Other than that it was a spacious accommodating home with great views of the Carquinez straits and pretty skys. Jee responded quickly when the code wasn't letting us in. He sent correct code for front door. All in all a great place to stay."
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Great place to stay if you plan to visit Napa. Stunning lake view from backyard. Highly recommended.
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My guest and I absolutely loved this property! We watched the sunrise with our coffee in the morning and the sunset with our cocktails in the evening. The view is phenomenal, 12 out of 10!!! The only con is there's only one TV. Everything else is amazing!!!!!!"

2022-10-01,5.0,Group trip,"Jee's place is 🤩. The rooms are very spacious and comfortable. The bay view from the house is amazing. Although the bay was foggy most of the time, I imagine sunsets here are absolutely beautiful. Many of us enjoyed spending time just sitting on the armchair and looking out the window.
The location is very convenient, especially when traveling between Bay Area and the Napa/Sonoma Valley.
I highly recommend this location and would happily return. Thank you Jee for the great stay!"
2022-10-01,5.0,Group trip,Thank you for the stay Jee. The place was amazing and we had a great time at the house.
2022-10-01,5.0,Group trip,"Everything was great and as described (except there wasn't an iron available even though it was in the listing--so if you need one, confirm with Jee Wing ASAP.) The location was great and the views were scenic. Very enjoyable stay."

2022-07-01,5.0,Group trip,The views of the water from the backyard were amazing! We loved our stay!
2022-07-01,4.0,Group trip,"Great views from Jee's place! There were some basic amenities missing or needed upgrade. Examples: did not have ironing board and iron; Mats in bathrooms were very dingy; a good number of furnishings/wall art and table lamps (some had knobs missing) were very basic and of motel calibre. Jee's place is in a nice area of Vallejo - but Vallejo quickly deteriorates in the surrounding neighborhoods (it just is what it is I guess, not Jee's fault but guests who are not familiar with the area should be aware of this). Big plus is that Vallejo is centrally located to regional attractions and Jee's place is easy on and off from the highway."
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This home was very relaxing. Plenty of room to stretch out after a day of exploring. OUTDOOR area is a real charmer!
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This home is exactly what you see posted in the listing. It is beautiful..spacious, comfortable and relaxing. The location is breathtaking. Our host Jee was very accommodating and quick to reply to our questions. We appreciated that he sent over a toaster for my mom which she used for breakfast each day. Very memorable time spent with family. I couldn’t wait to wake up each morning just to look at the gorgeous flowers in the yard and the lovely scenery surrounding us! We will be back for another visit!"
2022-05-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,I would highly recommend this property for anyone staying in Vallejo. The house and grounds are beautiful with an awesome view of the bay. Beds and furniture were comfortable and good space for our group of seven. Would have liked a few more wash clothes and no dish cloth or towels were provided. Owner also requires no toilet paper be put in toilet. Which was not disclosed until we arrived. The neighborhood was nice and we felt safe even though the surrounding area is awful. I would suggest cooking at home and stay out of town as much as possible.
2022-04-01,5.0,Group trip,"The view is spectacular, the flowers and humming birds in the back yard were wonderful. The house is spacious and in a safe area. The owner was very attentive. It was perfect for our family!"
2022-04-01,5.0,Group trip,"We had a great stay at this Airbnb. It has four king-sized beds that comfortably sleep 8, cookware and kitchen utensils, and a scenic backyard that overlooks the bay. It is located within a quiet neighborhood, and is around a 35 minute drive to downtown Napa."

Would stay again when back in area."
2021-08-01,4.0,Group trip,"The house was beautifully situated above the bay and delivered wonderful sunsets. The house was as pictured and spacious for our larger group. We recommend this to anyone who needs to access the wider Bay Area and has a mode of transportation.
A couple things to note: each bed had only two pillows and there was little kitchenware (a couple plates and silverware). Other than those small things, we were satisfied with our stay."

2021-04-01,5.0,Group trip,"View from the patio was amazing! Clean space. Appreciate the prompt responses from the host. However, since we did have 7 guests, wish there were more rugs to make the house feels more cozy and definitely more seating in the living room area other than the couch. There was a lack of little touches around the house as far as decor. Pillows weren’t comfortable and way too flat. Other than that, everything was squeaky clean and very nice view."
2021-03-01,5.0,Group trip,Wungs place was amazing! The views here are sooooo nice. You won’t regret it. Not to mention the house is super spacious. With a huge tv!

2020-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"The pictures do not do this place justice! The view of the water is absolutely gorgeous. I love that you can enjoy it from the living room, kitchen, and dining room. I feel like we always had a beautiful backdrop. The kids loved seeing the boats, the jet-skis, the birds, and the paragliders go by. They came so close to the back deck, it was really cool to see. The house is clean, decorated well, spacious, and we felt right at home. Everything is closed due to COVID, but I would definitely come back and drive the 15 minutes to get to SF or Napa the next time we go. Highly recommend!"

Note: the area has power cuts if the winds get too strong. Didn't affect us much as it only happened a few times right before we left. However, please be prepared if possible."
2020-02-01,4.0,Group trip,"Everything was great but it’s not a luxury home, beds and cabinets need to be updated. The view and sunset are fantastic. Nice living and dining room area. However be aware that the shared bathroom has no locks and you can enter it through both bedrooms so you might need to figure out to not come in when someone is using it. Hosts were easy to communicate with and didn’t have an issue at all."

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place would definitely come back again
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,I had a great stay at this clean guest suite. Street parking was never an issue. Wifi is strong. I stayed during the warm spring days and I was impressed how well the room stayed cool. Only during the peak sun hours did it warm up slightly. Opening a window easily cooled down the room. The guest suite is near a freeway but it only sounds like it’s windy outside so it was never an issue when sleeping. Neighbors are quiet. Communication with Taylor was always friendly and she is quick to respond. If you stay you should have a car.
2024-06-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Taylor was super nice and quick to respond. Nice place to use a home base for Bay area visits since it's so close to the major freeway. Good amount of privacy and clean. Bit hard to find the entrance in the dark, and can get some noise from the freeway with the windows open. Very good value for money overall."

2023-05-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Taylor's place is as described, but very minimalist. It's a good deal for the price, but don't expect anything extraordinary. There were very basic amenities in the unit. Just enough pots and pans to get by, a few plates, bowls and two mugs, but no real water glasses. The bed was surprisingly comfortable, but the comforter was white with yellow stains, which never makes you feel good regarding cleanliness. The appliances in the kitchen were nice. Overall, it worked decently for what we were looking for."

2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We absolutely LOVED our stay at Taylor’s studio! It was a perfect little studio nook for us in a quiet and safe neighborhood in Vallejo. The inside looks just like the pictures, and it has it’s own private entrance too, which was nice. The bed sheets and towels were clean and smelt lovely. In fact, everything was clean—including the bathtub and shower. Because the studio is located near the freeway, when the windows are open, you do hear the freeway noise, but when you close the windows, you hear absolutely nothing from outside so it’s super quiet and sound-proof! We brought along our own fan as we stayed during the hotter season, but if you’re not heat intolerant like us, then I think you’d be fine with the temperature inside the studio. The bed was SO comfortable, we slept really well. We had no problems finding street parking every day/night, and the place is so conveniently situated next to major freeways. The giant TV along with a 2-seater dining table and love sofa were delightful, not to mention the wifi which was super fast! The kitchen is stocked with plates, utensils, dish soap, sponge, paper towels, and pots and pans, so it was awesome being able to cook meals or reheat some leftovers!! The value of this studio is worth it. What a great find and an even more fantastic host who was always so quick to respond and very kind (thank you Taylor!). We definitely recommend Taylor’s studio and we look forward to staying again in the future!"
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,Taylor’s place is a great quiet and quaint space. The modern design makes it comfy and cozy. It is also such a great price point as well. Taylor is a great host and upset responsive. This place is a Great find !! I would certainly stay here again.

2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This is a perfect spot for you to stay at if you are going to the area. I like the fact that it was near a freeway that leads to everything in Napa Valley. Taylor was a gracious host and was really responsive. I would stay here again!

I will definitely book your place again. Thank you so much. You have a wonderful heart. God bless you always!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Would definitely recommend staying at James place! We stayed after a last minute trip to Napa and it was a good location.

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Exactly as advertised, well worth the price."
2024-06-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"The room and communal areas are great. I enjoyed using the hanging chair and a good nights rest in my room. Other guests were quiet and we respected each other's space.
The location is an older neighborhood in Vallejo. It was just as I expected. As a single female traveller, I felt comfortable and safe where I stayed and where I parked.
My 'less than 5' star rating is simple. I arrived mid-evening. The map app I used directed me to the small alleyway near the front of the house. It took just a moment, but I had to figure out the exact driveway and address on the street. Some better lighting and clear number on the house would have been preferred. (All the homes in the area have street numbers that are 3"" high. Hard to see in the dark.)
James was a capable host and the stay had every amenity you could ask for. There was an impressively large full kitchen (shared) and comfortable living room. My room had it's wall air unit (needed on my stay) and portable room heater. Bathroom clean."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I just stayed at James's for one night but I was fully satisfied with the place, it was exactly as expected. Bed was comfortable and shower was nice. Cozy and beautiful living room. Nicely stocked kitchen, lots of teas. Walking distance to the ferry. Great price. James is very friendly, has lots of stories to tell and knows the area well. Would definitely recommend for an affordable and comfortable place to stay in Vallejo!"

2022-09-01,2.0,Stayed over a week,James was honest about the noise and shared an incident where his car's catalytic converter was stolen. I may have arrived with bad timing as the other room was occupied by 2-3 people who took showers at midnight and went to their car at 1:40am that triggered the alarm to wake me up. I am glad my stay was safe albeit I did not sleep well many nights with the noise both inside and outside the house.

2022-06-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Very nice host and really nice new home. My only complaint is that I left a few drunk caprisun drinks out and when I returned the room was infested with ants from a tiny crack in trim in the corner of the room. They were EVERYWHERE. Now to be fair I was warned not to have any food in the room because he knew of the ants but I didn’t think it would be that crazy just from some juices. Still my fault but it would be nice to have that crack sealed up. Overall great place
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"you'll find a nice, bright and colorful home here with Truman. rubber ducks greet you in the bathroom, and the pillows on the bed have you falling asleep instantly.

2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"My wife and I just completed a two month stay in this studio, and it really is a hidden gem in Vallejo. The hosts were very responsive throughout the booking process and even greeted us upon arrival. Their kindness makes you feel welcome in the area.
The studio is a short walk from the Vallejo ferry building, which is an hour ride away from the heart of San Francisco. The back patio also has a beautiful view of the sunset and waterfront.
Although Vallejo has a bit of a reputation for crime, I always felt safe in this neighborhood. As always, just make sure to take precautions to protect yourself and your belongings.
Some recommendations in the area:
Pho #1 Noodle House
The Quarters Coffee House
168 Market

2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"I spent six weeks in this fantastic studio during a clinical rotation and couldn't be happier with the experience. The private space had all the essentials, making it comfortable and convenient. Despite the host, Juan, being abroad most of the time, her responsiveness was exceptional.
What set this stay apart was the warmth of Juan and her husband Ron. They invited my boyfriend and I for dinner in the last week, and it was a delightful evening of great food and conversation. It transformed the stay from comfortable to truly memorable.
The personal touch and generosity of Juan and Ron made me feel not just like a guest but a friend. If you're looking for a well-equipped, private space with hosts who go above and beyond, this is the perfect Airbnb. Thank you, Juan and Ron, for turning my clinical rotation into a professionally enriching and personally memorable experience."

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very nice person very attentive to what one would need . But the place is very small the town sucks the area has nothing to offer
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Juan and her husband were extremely responsive and accomodating.

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Juan’s place is what Airbnb used to be and should still be. It’s about connecting with a local, feeling welcome in their home with your own privacy as well. Juan went above and beyond helping me with getting public transportation. She even brought my daughter cake. It was 20 degrees cooler here than the wine country, right near the water. Really great place. Loved the diverse neighborhood too!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Juan and Ron are amazing hosts! I drove up the street to their charming home, parked my car, and stepped out just in time to see a breathtaking sight—the sun setting over the Bay! I was greeted by Juan, whose warm smile and delightful personality instantly made me feel welcomed and appreciated. Her husband, Ron, is a very kind man, who told me everything I needed to know about the ferry ride into the city, and other points of interest. Their spacious, bright, cheerful, and nicely decorated studio is a completely private, 100% clean, relaxing and peaceful place! It features all the comforts of home— including a super-comfortable king size bed, full kitchen, washer/dryer, and a covered outdoor space with Bay views!
FYI: Juan is a FAB cook! Authentic, home cooked, Chinese food is Juan’s specialty. Her wonton soup is not to be missed! Absolutely delicious!!"

2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This airbnb was a pit-stop for my drive from LA to Portland. I was beat after my 7-hour drive. When I entered at late hour, owners welcomed me so warmly, I felt such comfort like I am home.
The place is charming, homey, and very well-maintained, even though the place looked built a long ago.
Not to mention, the owner offered a bowl of Chinese soup that was so delicious. I am a very picky eater, and rarely eat food offered by others.
Highly recommend the place to anybody, and would definitely choose to stay here again whenever I am around the area."

The studio is so clean, the bed is huge with quality bedding. Outdoor space with view of Yacht Club. Charming decoration.
I ordered delicious dumplings and fish dish. I strongly recommended her spicy chili sauce. The price is reasonable and less expensive than restaurants. Clean, good food, great location. The couple are very nice and made me feel like an old friend. I will be back."

2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,I needed to stay near Napa for work and finding this place last minute was great. Cesar and Cristina were great hosts and there communication was greatly appreciated.
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Good value and comfy bed. The neighbors did play music really loudly one Saturday night starting about 9pm for a couple of hours so if you are an early bird staying over a weekend you might want to make note of it. Not sure if it’s a regular thing or not. It didn’t bother me though. Would definitely stay again.
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This is my second stay and, as usual, the room I stayed in was incredibly clean and the hosts were very communicative and accommodating. Definitely looking forward to future visits!"

2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I worked a 16 hour shift and just needed somewhere to crash for the night before heading to another shift in the morning. I’ve never stayed in Vallejo and appreciated that the house was in a quiet, safe neighborhood. The bed was amazingly comfortable and the bathroom and room were very clean. I also had to check in close to midnight so the self-check in/keypad entry was a helpful feature. The home is also close to the freeway which was an added bonus. I’d definitely stay here again!"

2024-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Comfortable and lovely stay! Danielle accommodated our last minute booking and was very responsive.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Cozy house with pretty decoration! The neighborhood is quiet and feels safe. A 10-15min drive to stores. The door lock system is nice. There's a sunny backyard. The windows have bug nets. Highly recommend this place :)
Downsides to improve :
- bad narrow matress, was over used, laying down felt like being inside a taco pushing you to its center
- clearer instructions for hot water in the bathroom, improve bathroom cleaning, hand hold showerhead, more toilet paper (for 4 persons)
- not enough towels for all 4 of us (usually a min of 2/person at least, 3 would be better for people with long hair)
- more places/hangers to hang dry the wet towels (not enough for 4people)
- more plugs or an extension in the bedroom (to allow for basic charging of 2 phones and a side lamp at the same time)
- the bulb of the bedside lamp was off, no substitute bulbs were found at the property
- some luggage racks in the bedrooms
- some olive oil and herbs to cook with (there was vinegar, salt and pepper)"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"Very nice and cozy home! Quiet and private. Danielle was very accommodating, helpful, quick to respond to any questions . Would definitely stay here again"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We stay in Danielle’s home every time we come to Vallejo. It is a lovely home close to Benicia and Vallejo.
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We loved this place. It was very tastefully decorated and quiet.
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Place was clean and quiet. would stay again.
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We really enjoyed our stay. Danielle was very friendly and responsive. We felt comfortable in her home. And I felt like we were close to the stars. Very beautiful home, quiet neighborhood and close to all the freeways. We visited Golden Gate Bridge and the Bay Bridge; just to name a few😊"
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Keep in mind this is an older home. It's cute and homey with a little old fashioned charm. Yes, the driveway is steep, so if you have any mobility issues, this may not be for you. Danielle is responsive to any issues."
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This is the second we have stayed here and this time was just as great as the first time. Easy access to Interstate for quick trips to Benicia or Vallejo. Highly recommended!
2024-01-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"It's a good basic setup with the amenities listed. If you need to cook while there, it's decent but limited. The bedrooms are not heated, but have space heaters you can use. The backyard is a nice space. Unfortunately, I cannot recommend the beds if you have a sensitive back. On a similar note, the drive is incredibly steep, so a heads up to anyone with mobility issues as well."
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Danielle’s place is a comfy pad for those who would like a space to themselves or even with a kid or two! It’s got a good neighborhood, proximity to great restaurants, museums, churches and even coffee places made it a memorable. Her choice of furnishings are quite pragmatic and overall well organized place indoors and outdoor space too. She is quite a responsive and fun person to interact with too. I do hope to revisit her place sometime in the future!
Best,
Aloysius"
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This place is exactly as described. The house is clean. We had an entire cozy small house located in a quiet residential area. The central heater and exclusive heaters in both bedrooms keeps house warm in the winter. The rooms retain the temperature so you don't need the portable heater open overnight. The host is quite responsive.
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,Excellent stay
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Another great stay! Awesome hosts!
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This was my family's home for a week and we had everything everything we needed. A good kitchen to cook our meals, a place to watch movies, and a peaceful backyard to read a book or get some quiet time."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Great, clean and quite neighborhood! Spacious and nicely decorated. We’re definitely rented again ;)"
2023-10-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Our stay was great ! We were a little worried about the lack of AC but with a fan on it wasn’t bad at all . We would definitely stay again!
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Place as described, easy check in and host is communicative"
2023-09-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Highly recommend! This was one of the cleanest and beautifully decorated homes we have stayed in.. completely matches the description and a very responsive host.
The house was quiet and has a gorgeous little back yard perfect for a morning coffee and listening to the birds.
The only thing I'd mention is the shower is quite slow pressure wise and I had to wash my hair in the bath, which was not a problem , and definitely would deter me from staying here again. A great Airbnb if you're looking for a cute spot in the Vallejo area."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We loved our stay! The house was fully stocked and so clean. We didn’t really use the outdoor space, but I wish we had more time to. Overall a very lovely stay! Thank you!"
2023-09-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,"The living room is cute, the backyard is nice, but I probably wouldn’t stay here again. I made a mistake and didn’t read the amenities, so I missed that there’s no A/C. Which isn’t bad after 6/7pm, but it gets extremely hot midday. Fan or not. So after a long drive, and climbing a driveway on a steep hill, we were so hot!!! I’m not sure if they mention the hill or not but they should. It’s important, trust me! Anyway, the place has spiders and spider webs everywhere; including one of the bedrooms. Something kept falling in the bathroom. (We never found it) SMH. Luckily we were only there for a quick stay, so we slept in the same bedroom. The water took awhile to heat up for the shower, so my bff left it running for me when she got out. When I searched Airbnb I was looking for places close to Napa, I’m not sure why this place was included being it was 30 mins or so away. I wouldn’t stay again."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful home in a nice quiet neighborhood. Danielle was very accommodating during our trip and we would definitely stay here again.
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Thank you so much perfect cozy house, the window breeze in every room is wonderful."

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Danielle was incredibly friendly and gracious as we had to cancel our trip halfway through or stay.
The home is quiet, in a quiet neighborhood, incredibly clean, and cools off nicely at night with the windows open.
Thank you for allowing us to stay in your home and for helping us when we had to depart early."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Convenient location, clean and comfortable. Nice outdoor space. Private."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Danielle was amazing! She gave us clear and concise instructions on check in and out. She gave us great recommendations for restaurants and even let us pick some plums from a mini plum tree. They were DELICIOUS. Loved the place, would book again!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Home was absolutely perfect! Clean, well stocked with all the amenities, extra bedding, blankets & pillows was nice! Great location & such a beautiful cozy home! The fenced back yard was a plus with having littles. Also the fruit trees in the back were a even more bonus! Have also rented the Airbnb right next door Danielle also hosts, and both homes are amazing! I even got to meet her & her family when we were in town, very sweet polite & easy communication! definitely will be staying again!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Stayed here during for a week while visiting Napa. The place felt very homey, was extremely clean and had everything we needed. The orange tree in the back yard was very unique."

2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a great say, and Danielle was quick to respond to our questions and very helpful. Home was very clean and had everything we needed for our stay!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Everything was nearly perfect. Danielle was super responsive, everything was very clean. Everything was well stocked, and it was a really cute and private place. It was incredibly neat and tidy. I don't really have any complaints except that there were some TV issues - for example, the living room TV has parental controls and they don't know the code, so you can't add any other apps even if you have your own account. Very small issue, if at all, and it still has some pretty main big ones like Netflix and Hulu, etc. Otherwise I can't say enough good things about this listing. Everything worked well. Hot water worked, windows opened easily, oven and stove worked flawlessly. The driveway is very steep, just be wary."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very cozy place in a lovely neighbourhood. Very convenient to visit Napa valley. Though the bedroom door was a bit creaky we were happy with the place!
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great place, just as described"
2023-05-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Good place. It was 40 mins from Napa in traffic. Everything was good but the only thing I would complain about are the beds. Not as comfortable because they are full size beds and not queen size.
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We stayed here for 3 nights while visiting family who live nearby.
The house was as good or better than the photos. Everything was clean and convenient. Everything was on hand for a comfortable stay. Really responsive host.
Neighborhood was quiet and peaceful. Not walkable to much, but a short drive to stores, ferry to San Francisco, etc.
Will definitely stay again when we visit the area!"
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Perfect place to stay when visiting Napa Valley/Sonoma and San Francisco! About 30-40 min to Napa and 45-60 min to San Fran. Danielle was extremely communicative and super accommodating! Home was clean and comfortable - exactly as seen in photos. Thank you for a wonderful week in Vallejo!
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Thanks so much! Enjoyed our 2-night stay as it was close to a wedding we were in town for. The place is super cute. Danielle was very kind and responsive and I appreciated her ability to communicate through the process. Thanks again!
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,This was a lovely home and exactly what we were looking for. Great for our two young kids. Would definitely book again.
2023-03-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great place for the price. Danielle is a wonderful host. Very responsive and accommodating!
Our only complaints were the beds were not very comfy/ sheets were uncomfortable and there is no central heat. I know these are very much so 1st world problems and not a big deal for most people which is why I would still recommend her home to those looking for a cheap alternative to the Napa area."
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This was a perfect home away from home. The house was spotless and had all the amenities and more we needed. Very spacious and has great natural sun light as well. Danielle Nicole was a great communicator and even gave suggestions on things to do. Definitely would stay here again!
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"During WW2 Vallejo was the major submarine building site in the U.S.
Numerous bungalows were built during this time to house the workers and families. This home is a classic 1942 example of such a bungalow. It’s nostalgic in its design and oozes comfort and efficiency. The backyard is large with a producing orange tree and one of the largest rosemary hedges I’ve ever seen.
The location is very quiet and provided amazing night sleeps.

2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Very responsive and a great host! Thank you, Danielle. Nice, clean, spacious and a peaceful place. 10/10 would highly recommend :)"
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great little house and awesome it had tvs in the bedrooms. Lots of airbnbs do not have this (not sure why - tvs are not expensive) and my family was staying due to work and it’s great to wind down (by yourself) watching tv laying in bed after a long/ physical day of work! Danielle is super friendly and helpful too!
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Great place.
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We enjoyed our stay here! The house is very cute, well decorated, and in a quiet neighborhood. It had everything we needed and the pictures don’t do it justice. Our only regret is that we couldn’t stay longer."
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful and clean place.
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"A very cozy place, a refuge, like a vacation home"
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Great stay at Danielle’s place in Vallejo. Close access to major highways, Napa etc. The communication was first class - stayed there during a cold front and Danielle bought additional heaters to ensure our family was comfortable and safe. Highly recommend!"
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Great place for our family of four. Danielle’s place had everything we needed for an eleven day stay. Clean and comfortable. Great backyard. Danielle is a very responsive host. Would definitely book this stay again!
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Danielle's home was a perfect base for our last-minute Thanksgiving meetup with friends in Sonoma. The home was clean, comfortable, and much more reasonably-priced than homes in wine country. Danielle's communication was also more clear than many hosts, which made check-in and check-out easy. Thanks for a nice stay!"
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a wedding in SF and another in Sonoma, so the location of this airbnb was a perfect midway spot. If you're also looking for a good home base between wine country & the city, I recommend this airbnb!
Pros:
- Super clean. The whole place smelled like it had been deep cleaned when we arrived.
- Cute and cozy decor and vibe
- Safe, residential
- Easy checkin and checkout, no problems.
- Cute outdoors area, but we didn't use it.
Cons
- Pillows were very flat (might be time to replace?), but we were able to find two firmer ones
- Limited food options in Vallejo, so be prepared to cook your meals or venture out to other neighborhoods."
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Wow the VALUE in this stay was just amazing. We enjoyed Danielle’s property and hope to stay again one day with our kids.

2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Danielle’s home provided a comfortable, convenient, and enjoyable stay for our trip to Napa and San Francisco. She’s prompt in her messages should you need anything. Definitely would recommend her home if you need a place to stay Bay Area."
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Danielle Nicole is an absolute gem as an Airbnb host. She is just a message away, so friendly, inviting, and truly makes you feel welcome as a guest. The home is beautiful and provides everything you would need for your stay. We loved cooking in the kitchen, seeing the backyard space, and enjoying the front room. The photos truly don’t do this stay justice. Check in and check out are a breeze. The neighborhood is safe, and we got to enjoy our short stay visiting family."

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I liked everything about this place. It's small - but it was just me, so it was perfect. Leticia was a great host. Super friendly and worked with me with what I needed, etc. Super clean. Not a ton of supplies in the kitchen, but it had what I needed. I would only give 2 suggestions: 1. I don't personally like glass on my front door, but I know some people do. So maybe have an option of covering the front door? Secondly, I would have lower chairs at the table/desk. I was working at the desk quite a bit and the chairs were definitely too high. Other than that, it was a perfect place. And if I am ever in that area again, I super hope I will be able to secure Leticia's place for my stay. Stay here! You won't regret it!"

The only issue me and my fiance had was theres no air conditioning there was 2 fans 1 really little on in the bedroom and mediium one in the living room however with cooking it was still smothering hot hot so my advise to to Leticia is to get 2 more big fans.

2023-07-01,4.0,Stayed one night,This house was good value for the location but it was still a ways away from the local attractions. It was a good spot for the night but I will look for somewhere more robust and closer to Napa valley / downtown. Overall good experience! Just left a little to be desired.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The place is beautifully renovated, small and immaculate. There are two steps you have to climb to get to the bathroom, if that is not a problem for you this is a perfect place to rest your head. The bed felt amazing.

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Judy’s Garden retreat was a beautiful oasis for us to return to each evening after our adventures. We were often greeted by the sweet Pepper as well (Judy’s little dog ☺️). Her garden suite is the perfect size for two people and she had lots of little extras for us (asked us what we wanted in our coffees and had a special breakfast for us). From start to finish, Judy was a gracious host- she communicated well, gave us great suggestions (like taking the ferry into San Francisco) and the best breakfast places in town. She told us stories about her garden (she had fresh lemons for us!!) and about her experience of the region from her teenage years until today. The location of this oasis is perfect for travelling in the Bay Area- an hour from the airport, an hour (by ferry) into Fisherman’s Wharf, 30 minutes to Napa and and hour to Muir Woods. We truly felt welcomed into Judy’s place- it was obvious she cares a lot about her suite, her garden and the people who share it."

Judy was a great hostess, very nice and down to earth and provided treats and goodies way beyond the usual expectations when you stay at an Airbnb. I would recommend this place to anyone who wants to experience a great stay in Vallejo, California. 5 well deserved Stars for Judy! Thank you for such a wonderful time."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Judy's place is in the heart of Vallejo, close to a collection of great restaurants and walking distance from the farmer's market. We really enjoyed getting to know Judy. She was very friendly and welcoming, and went above and beyond to make us feel right at home. Her recommendations were invaluable to us having a great time in Vallejo. If we're ever in the area again, we'll make sure to include it on our itinerary."

Best of all, the host Judy is a wonderful conversationalist, and her dog Pepper was an absolute sweetheart. Would highly recommend this stay!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Place is just as described. One of the better airbnb kitchens I've had access to-- not very big but plenty of cookware to work with. The location is a little confusing but the instructions we received more than compensated for that.

2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,A lovely home away from home. It was well decorated and with nice touches and upgrades throughout. I felt safe coming in and out due to the fence and locked gate.
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Judy's place was perfect. It was spotless, homey, close to anywhere I needed to get to and to the freeways. It was a very comfortable place to stay, and everything I needed was right there.....even right down to the iron/board & clothing steamer. She even had some wonderful bread and coffee creamer ingredients placed in the home ready for my first morning.

The room is spacious and the kitchen fully stocked with quality items - we really enjoyed sitting in the private garden.We biked Vallejo one day and drove to Napa and biked the Vineyard Trail - the ferry to San Francisco is just a 15 minute walk and takes you right to downtown.

It has a secure garden filled with fragrant flowers, fruit, and herbs. It is quiet at night and yet close everything you would need. The ferry to San Francisco is a short walk away and highways to Napa or toward the coast are within blocks. Judy provided many suggestions for places to eat and visit and time and again they led us to amazing experiences. We would gladly stay in this place again."

2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Judy was a very welcoming host! Right from the beginning of the stay, she was very communicative and flexible with our arrival time.

2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay! Judy is an amazing host and goes above and beyond to make you feel at home. Nice location that is somewhat central to everything in the Bay Area. Very quiet and relaxing place to get away and has everything you could possibly need. I’ve stayed at a variety of places either with family or friends and this place is in the top couple places. Hopefully we’ll be able to stay here in the future again.
2021-08-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Very nice place! Judy is very hands on during your stay and detailed about every aspect. Spacious enough to comfortably put luggage.
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Judy’s apartment is very well appointed and very comfortable. I was there for seven nights and have only positive comments. The kitchen is very well appointed with everything one might need to prepare daily meals. There is a large dining table as well as a hideaway work desk. I was there for a specific weeklong course and was very pleased. Having a private entrance was also a bonus as neither Judy nor I were disturbing one another with early morning departures etc
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Judy is an excellent host and made us feel very welcomed and at home during our stay! The house was beautifully decorated and we enjoyed walking around the luscious garden. She does have 2 dogs and one of them is really friendly and will interact with you. One thing I do want to note is that if you have long legs, the bed may be a bit short since it's a double. But other than that, wonderful stay!"
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I’m not sure where to start. First of all Judy is maybe the most pleasant host I’ve encountered. The place itself checks all the boxes of making you feel like you’re at home. She has a wonderful garden that she allows you to use at you leisure if you like to cook, while the tv could be bigger the technology on what’s offered for you’re viewing is adequate. She really thought of everything you need to feel at home. I highly recommend and would absolutely revisit her place.
Thank you Judy"
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Judy’s place is adorable! Very close to Napa and other the city isn’t too far away either! She greeted us with open arms and even had my choice of creamer there in the fridge! It’s a great place, highly recommend!"

2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Judy is a lovely host! The photos of the rental were accurate and the space was very clean. Judy made sure we had everything we needed for a comfortable stay (milk, butter, bread, soap, shampoo, conditioner, coffee, coffee maker, etc.). My partner and I loved to drink our morning coffee in the garden and watch cassette tapes in the evening. We felt welcome and at home during our stay. Thank you, Judy!"
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The house is very pretty.
The garden is so amazing and a nice place to chill
Wifi is good, working from home was not a problem
Napa is just half an hour far, loved that proximity."

2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We thoroughly enjoyed Judy's place! She thought of everything and had many delightful touches. We had ample space and really enjoyed going out to the garden to pick fresh arugula for our sandwiches each day! We'd stay again in a heartbeat n highly recommend this airbnb.
2021-06-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,"Overall the host was really nice, I did find that the description of the place was not as described. I thought it was detached from the main home, but we had to enter through the garage because the private entrance was not working but Judy got that taken of right away. Besides the space being not as described it was a nice studio and her backyard was beautiful. The city seems good during the day but very unpleasant after dark."
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Judy was a wonderful attentive host. She had the apartment well prepared and was a great resource for things to do. Highly recommend!
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"A comfortable large room that feels like home. The garden is lovely and well kept, making for a great place to sip your morning coffee or wind down for the night. Judy provides for most anything you'd hope to have in your home and a fully equipped kitchen and bathroom. The street and home is quiet and a short walk to various amenities. Driving is central to anywhere you're going by the water or North. I'll be back when next in town to visit my family."
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"We had a great time during our stay at Judy’s place. The place was clean, comfortable and had all the things that you will need. We stayed for a full week and worked at her place during the weekdays. Judy was very sweet and hospitable. She checks in on us, made sure we were ok. I especially enjoyed our tour of her beautiful garden and playing with Pepper. We’ll definitely stay here again on our next trip to Napa."
2021-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Judy is warm and kind and a superb superhost, highly recommend this place :)"
2021-04-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Excellent location for exploring the Bay area, N, S, E and W!
The apartment is comfortable, meeting all needs for an extended visit/stay. The lush oasis garden is truly calming and delightful, whether experienced 1st thing in the morning, or after returning from a full day of sightseeing.
Judy is a warm, friendly and the perfect host, on site, welcoming and most helpful!"
2021-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"A GREAT stay in Mr. Pepper’s Paradise. Beautiful garden apartment. Quiet, safe, and therapy for all my senses. Totally had a friend crush on Judy. She’s super cool. Very chill. So is the sweet lady upstairs (Dowager Queen to Their Majesties, Poppy and Mr. Pepper.) I was able to teach, work, study, and hang out with my partner in one place. Mr. Pepper was both, my best friend and (fake) arch nemesis. So sweet. So protective. Best work/study-cation week ever!"
2021-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Lovely stay, and very friendly host. I'll hope to stay again.
While Vallejo might not be anyone's vision of paradise, Judy's backyard garden just might be."
2021-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Judy's place is perfect for Napa valley visitors. It has everything you need. Beautiful garden. You will be glad for chosing Judy as your host
2020-11-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,Very nice place in the gold one is beautiful
2020-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We enjoyed our stay at Judy's. Her cozy apartment feels quite homey for our 5-day stay. The best thing is the fast and reliable internet which made working there during the day head-ache free!!! The provisions for breakfast was a nice touch!
2020-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Judy is a kind and thoughtful host! Her place has everything you need for a getaway!
2020-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Judy was Amazing! My wife and I can't say enough. She meets the standard in every way. Very easy to communicate with, readily available and provides great ideas for things to do. This location is centrally located to just about everything. San Francisco being the furthest destination at about 60min away. Judy keeps this place sparkling clean and well maintained. I could go on & on here but it'd be best if you just book a stay. We'll come back!"
2020-09-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"Judy was a very accommodating host, I would definitely stay again."
2020-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Lovely garden and spacious room. Great value overall, highly recommended!"
2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Such a great location! I had to go into my job in Napa, and the drive was rather short due to the location. Judy was very responsive and she’s very flexible. Super kind, really enjoyed my stay in Vallejo! Will book again in the future."
2020-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"2nd Time here, best as always!"
2020-07-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"Great Location, great host. Enjoyed my stay here, everything was great, and very comfortable and cozy, will definitely book this place if Im in the area again!"
2020-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Judy is really nice and welcoming. The apartment is really cute and has great amenities.
2020-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,I was unable to make it to judys place due to the start of the pandemic. But withouth hesitation she let me reschedule for a future visit until it is over. I appreciate it a lot. Look forward to visiting your beautiful place! 😁⭐️🏡
2020-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"A few words to describe the place:
Charming, central, clean, and full of amenities. Fantastic backyard garden.
A few words about Judy:
Wow. She is accommodating and generous with her space. She offered nice, thoughtful touches, maintained regular contact throughout our stay, and suggested many local experiences that we enjoyed. Great, kind host.
A few words about Vallejo:
30 minutes to Napa/Yountville/Oakville; 30-40 minutes to mid-Sonoma; an hour to San Francisco; 45 min to Oakland. Central to a trip to experience all these places."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We LOVED our stay at Susans!! We stayed here for our honeymoon and Susan was engaged and responsive throughout our stay! Whatever issues we had (like finding the internet modem or getting in) she was very responsive and answered immediately. She gotten us a few things to celebrate our nuptials, so sweet!!
It was a lot bigger than the pics shows, we loved the size, perfect for a couple!! And it felt so private and cozy! I had read in past reviews that you could see through the living room and we had no issues with that; the windows closer to the neighbors had a window film on them along with curtains so light could come in but not see though at all and other side had mature trees. It can get hot upstairs during the day but if you put windows up and use the fan provided it’s nice at night, even chilly! Not much to do in Vallejo but we planned on being in Napa and San Fran so it was fine for us, just the traffic is awful for the Bay Area so took longer than we projected to get around."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great stay at Susan’s lovely place. Grateful for the gift of a nice bottle of wine and cookies on our arrival. The location is perfect for exploring the Bay Area and Napa. The upstairs does get a little warm without an AC but the provided box fan and open windows were sufficient during the mild temperatures of our stay.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We loved Susan’s cottage - it was so very peaceful. The lovely garden was beautiful and provided my 89 year old mother with hours of enjoyment, beauty and repose. The nearby views of the North Bay and sunset are absolutely in breathtaking. We will definitely stay here each and every time we come to Vallejo!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Stay was great!
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We stayed at Susan’s place for a couple of days while visiting Napa, which was a 30-40 min Uber ride depending on which wineries we wanted to visit. It was a comfortable stay and felt right at home with everything we’d need including a full kitchen to cook. It was in a safe neighborhood as well and was overall a great stay."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Sudan’s place was a great base to explore Napa Valley, we enjoyed a great wine tasting recommended by Susan. Brunch at the nearby Oxbow Market was a highlight too. A lovely place to relax at the end of a day sightseeing."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Susan is a perfect host. She was available to our needs but was never, never intrusive. She is clearly proud of her beautiful cottage. Her warmth and class are apparent throughout. Her neighborhood is quiet, and the cottage is first-class. Yes, four and five-star hotels will have greater amenities, but you'll still be in a hotel. Compared to lesser hotels (chains) . . . well there simply is no comparison.
Anyone looking for a comfortable and private place to stay in the North East Bay region of San Francisco would be hard-pressed to find better accommodations, especially at her competitive and quite fair price.
The bottom line is, if Susan's cottage is available when you need it, jump on it. You'll be happy you did.
Michael, Rebecca, Claire - Redmond, WA"
2024-03-01,4.0,Stayed about a week,"Good place to sleep, cook, hangout, relax"
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,The cottage was beautiful and perfectly located for spending time in wine country. Susan was responsive and offered great suggestions for places to eat and things to do in the area. Would definitely recommend Susan and the cottage as a wonderful place to stay and relax while visiting California wine country.
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,Cozy cottage in a great location. Very clean and well equipped with all the necessities. Susan is very responsive and helpful. We would stay here again!
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,We were the beneficiaries of Susan's outstanding reputation as a host . We very much felt welcomed and at home in her cottage.
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"5 out of 5.
We had no problems and when there were questions Susan went above and beyond to address them."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"The unit is located 1/2 mile from interstate and 2 blocks from major thoroughfare yet quiet, garden setting with natural light and playful squirrels. Parking and laundry are onsite and Host Susan provides a helpful information sheet to familiarize me appliances, smart tv and security. Host Susan is friendly yet very respectful of privacy. The property and host are a gem! and I’d be happy to return!"
2023-11-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"I highly recommend staying at Susan's place. The Airbnb is very private and in a quiet street. Very friendly neighbours! We had a little trouble with the gate lock and door code but figured it out in the end. Susan had so kindly provided a welcome bottle of (very nice) red wine, some meat and cheese, yogurt, coffee, creamer, and strawberries. There was a high level of cleanliness. The bedroom upstairs can get a little stifling, even with the windows open, but Susan has provided a fan. The Wi-Fi can also be a little sketchy. But really those are the only critiques. The bathroom was pristine, the shower was lovely, and there were plenty of towels. There is a Safeway close by in case you need to get groceries, and it's just a short (20 minute) drive to Napa. The Michael Warring restaurant is also a ten minute drive away and highly recommended! We would certainly stay with Susan again if we are ever in the area!"
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"My daughter and I stayed for 7 days at Susan and Tom's cozy cottage. It exceeded our expectations. We really appreciated the goodies left for us in the kitchen along with a bottle of wine. We felt very ""at home"" and highly recommend for other prospective travelers."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We enjoyed staying at Susan's place. It was very comfortable and homey, and we appreciated the snacks left for us. The location is convenient and a good value if you are visiting Napa. Susan was very responsive whenever we had a question, thank you!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Excellent place to stay
2023-09-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Enjoyed Susan's place. Very peaceful, beautiful yard and quiet. Loved the added bonus... complimentary bottle of wine and light breakfast items.
The T.V. didn't work the whole time we were there which really didn't matter a lot to us. We were out and about the majority of the time."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We enjoyed the stay and the great gardens. Good location for the price. We will recommend this cottage to friends,
thanks again. Todd"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Nice separate cottage space and kitchen had everything we needed to make meals there. Also nice they had a couple fans and left us a bottle of wine! Nice that they left us park in the driveway. The immediately surrounding neighborhood was nice but just down the road seemed a bit questionable but we just didn’t do much around the area so didn’t bother us. The direct neighborhood felt safe. We enjoyed our stay here.
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Susan’s cottage was everything we expected and more. The cottage is kept in wonderful shape and is decorated very tastefully. It is just beautiful! Susan and Tom were very friendly and helpful during our stay. She also provided us with goodies when we checked in. They were very much appreciated! My family and I were very comfortable and felt safe there. We would definitely stay in the cottage again as it has all the comforts of home. Thank you Susan!
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Susan‘s place was lovely! It was as described, clean, and Susan was very informative and accommodating. Aside from a small snafu with the entry code, which Susan more than made up for, it was a perfect stay! I would definitely recommend!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Susan was very responsive with great recommendations for local restaurants and things to do in the area. Her home was very cozy and clean. The bed was very comfortable with nice linens. Would definitely stay here again.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"It was a great, clean, easy, and homey experience! I would definitely recommend it!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,What a great cottage… We were greeted by a sweet and helpful host who otherwise left us to enjoy our visit to wine country in peace. The place is fully stocked for your stay. The best part are the fragrances blowing through the windows.
2023-06-01,4.0,Stayed about a week,"I enjoyed my stay at Susan‘s cottage. It was perfect for what I needed and in a central location. I was there for 8 days.
The neighborhood was quiet, and the cottage was very comfortable, quaint and private.
The kitchen had great basics which allowed me to cook some days. It was kind of Susan to have some treats available upon arrival: fresh cherries, English muffins, coffee. The upstairs loft area was cozy. It does get hot during the day; however, raising the windows and using a fan she left cooled down the space quickly.
The Wi-Fi was spotty so it was hard to work or watch TV. I had to use my hotspot. I did mention to Susan who had noticed and was very responsive.
My only issue was checking in. Me and my daughter arrived at 1:30 AM from the East Coast. We were both beyond tired and on a 3-hour time difference. I totally forgot the cottage entrance was further down the driveway and was using my code at the wrong door. A sign on the garage pointing to the cottage could help."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very enjoyable and a great place to stay. Would stay here again.
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a wonderful stay, thank you!"

2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful place to stay for a trip to Napa! Susan has a gorgeous cottage, she leaves you a bottle of wine, & she goes above & beyond by providing a list of recommendations to visit/ try in the Napa valley area! Not to mention she’s very quick with responding & is always available to help you out. 10/10 stay, would do it again!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,Susan and Tom made is feel at home and went out for there way to accommodate use and assist us with any problems we may encountered! Great host!
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Really enjoyed our stay. Close enough to Napa and Sonoma to go check out wineries around area.

2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,Great stay! The cottage was comfortable and had the basics needed for a two week stay. Susan was very responsive to help when we had any questions.
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,My boyfriend and I stayed at Susan’s for two weeks while traveling. Vallejo was in the perfect location for us between San Francisco and Napa! We thoroughly enjoyed our time at Susan’s! We had everything we needed and it such a cute cozy spot for us. The bed was extremely comfortable! Susan was an amazing host! She provided great recommendations for us and was always a quick call away if we needed anything. We would definitely come back to stay here😊 I can’t say enough good things about our stay!
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"Highly recommend Susan's place to anyone looking to stay in the Vallejo area. Safe, quiet neighborhood located near the freeway for easy access to all of the Bay Area. The Airbnb had everything I needed during my six week stay. Susan was very responsive to the minor issues I had. Would stay again."
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"The guest house was very nice and we appreciated being able to park on the driveway. The interior was cozy and had good energy. It was annoying that we had to buy our own toilet paper and paper towels because there was only a quarter roll for our 1 week stay. And the heater is so loud and clanky it takes over the whole room. Also, the TV is very small and needs to be updated, the buttons on the remote barely work even after changing the battery's. Also, there is not a lot of privacy downstairs because there are only sheer, see through window coverings. So when you get out of the shower everyone can see you. When you do anything everyone can potentially see you."
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"great stay, cozy house, great location, great host - very helpful"
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Very well put together, comfortable, had everything I needed for my stay, would recommend for anyone to stay here. beautiful and charming"

Very clean and comfortable. Would highly recommend."

2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My wife and I had a great time in Vallejo at Susan's place. Alexander was a tremendous host setting everything up as we arrived. The location was great and central to everything we did - Sanoma Valley, Napa Valley, Bodega Bay, Sausalito and San Francisco. We will stay again should we return to the area. Thanks, Alexander, for everything and Tom, for all the local gems you provided in San Fran."

2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Thank you so much for having us. It was the perfect location for us, split between Napa and Sausalito and had everything we needed to have a great stay. Our host provided us with a continental type breakfast, to get our vacation started. We loved how private, charming and comfortable, the guest house was. We will definitely book again when we come back to Napa."
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Great hosts, location can’t be beat to do everything Northern California. Right in the middle."
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Nice and clean. Quiet area. Communication from Susan was great. We would stay here again and would definitely recommend it to others.
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"Beautiful stay in Vallejo! The hosts were so kind from the moment I got there and throughout my entire stay. The house was beautifully furnished with a well-stocked kitchen. Very comfortable stay. The bedroom upstairs was very comfortable and cozy. Laundry was conveniently in the garage. Thank you, Susan and your family!"
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The cottage felt much more spacious than we were expecting! It was perfectly cozy, clean, and relaxing. It was the most ideal oasis after a long week. Susan and Tom left the best recommendations for dining, local activities, and even a new band! We are definitely looking forward to staying here again."
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Susan was very responsive and helpful. She was eager to share her knowledge of the area. The check-in and check-out process was easy and worked around our crazy flight times without disruption. The cottage was so cute and perfect for my mom and I to stay.

It was clean and well kept.
Susan was always helpful."
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"This cottage was wonderful and even better than we could have hoped for. Totally private space on the property with tons of natural light and very spacious. It’s in the neighborhood of Vallejo, which has some activities that Susan suggested and we had a great time. It’s also an easy ferry ride or drive to San Francisco, which is always a great visit. All in all, we give everything about this stay a 10/10. We will miss this place for sure! It was so comfortable, cozy and perfect for us."
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Vallejo’s hidden gem. I enjoyed the stay at the cottage. Susan provided a clean space and lots of snacks. It was the perfect getaway.
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,Susan was terrific and her quaint cottage is great for a short visit to Vallejo. Nice space for a short remote working stay
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"We stayed here for about 3 weeks. Susan was so thoughtful, from the goodies when we arrived, to her responsiveness when we needed anything. The cottage is beautiful and cozy. The neighborhood has a great area to walk/run in (not a lot of sidewalks, but not a lot of cars either). Vallejo is great for its proximity to San Francisco, Sonoma/Napa and Yosemite."
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,Absolutely beautiful property. Susan was an exceptional host and was attentive to all of our needs. Cannot recommend enough.
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"There’s probably not a whole lot I can add on top of what’s already been said. But in short, this is a terrific place to stay in Vallejo. Best neighborhood, quick and reliable communication, really nice and cute space/ relaxing backyard, great WiFi for long term stays/ working from home, and really kind and generous host. If there’s anything that could be improved it’s more storage space for long term stays, especially for clothes and kitchen stuff. But still undoubtedly 5/5, thanks for the terrific stay Susan!"
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This is a great place to be close to wine country (and get a driver!). Susan is an excellent host and her place is so charming. Would definitely stay here again and recommend to anyone!
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I won’t be able to say enough good things about this place. Susan greeted us when we arrived and was very friendly and helpful. The cottage was clean, comfortable, well-stocked and well-maintained. It's very cute, and Susan's garden outside the window gives it a lovely, idyllic feel."
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Place was beautiful! Great distance from the bay as well as napa valley, it is gorgeous and easy to access. Would definitely recommend!"
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"I was a guest at this Airbnb for 14 weeks and I am very pleased with my stay. Susan and Tom were very kind, respectful, and quick to answer any questions and fix anything that needed attention. I enjoyed the privacy and security this place offered; I parked in the driveway and had keycode access to the backyard where I used another code to enter the cottage. I felt safe staying alone and had no issues. The cottage was very clean when I arrived and fully stocked as indicated on the cottage description. Susan and Tom provided a lengthy list of things to do/places to eat in and outside of Vallejo. I did enjoy that the cottage was near many popular stores and restaurants. I would highly recommend this Airbnb to those visiting Vallejo. The only challenge I came across was using a minifridge for 14 weeks. I had plenty of room in the fridge when it was just myself there, however, when I had guests I wished I had more fridge space. Having a freezer would have been nice but I lived without it just fine. I highly recommend this Airbnb to anyone looking to stay in Vallejo as it was clean, safe, charming, and run by wonderful hosts!"
2020-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Susan's place is lovely - we stayed there for a couple of months with our infant son and had a wonderful time. It has everything we needed and was very comfortable - especially appreciated having the backyard/garden! Susan was a great host, excellent communication from start to finish and so helpful with making sure we had everything we needed. We had some trouble with the internet upon arrival and she immediately worked with us to make sure it was resolved. Highly recommend staying here!"
2020-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful, immaculately clean, and in cute little neighborhood. The hosts were really great about checking in, and I just had a fantastic time."
2020-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Susan's cottage was very cozy, had everything we needed, and was a great central location to explore the Marin coast and East Bay Area."
2020-10-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,I loved staying here! Everything was as described and I really appreciated the thoughtful amenities provided. I highly recommend this place!
2020-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,a very beautiful place.
2020-10-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Susan’s cottage is the perfect little getaway for you and your significant other or a couple close friends. It’s surrounded by a beautiful garden that’s sure to have you feeling connected to Mother Nature, especially considering that there isn’t any AC so you’re likely to keep the windows open most of the time. There are a lot of well placed windows and a fan to help with circulation so you really don’t the lack of air conditioning. My boyfriend and I worked out of the cottage for a week without any issues and felt quite at home with all of the personalized touches. There was a bottle of wine waiting for us when we arrived, along with a couple of other snacks that ended up coming in very handy! We ran into a couple spiders during our stay but nothing major, to be expected with a garden as nice as hers. Check in is easy and really flexible but be prepared to check out promptly at 11 or maybe even a little earlier as she is likely to have another guest arriving later that day. Overall, we really enjoyed our stay and would definitely recommend booking this place. We didn’t run into Susan at all but nonetheless she was still very helpful."
2020-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Awesome
2020-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was a fantastic find for us. It’s 20 min from Sonoma Raceway and a great place to jump into any wine tasting trips you’d like to make. The place is very clean and our hosts left us snacks and wine, which was unexpected and very much appreciated. Parking is super easy, right in front of the main house. We’d definitely stay here again. I can’t recommend this place enough."
2020-09-01,4.0,Stayed over a week,"Susan's was a great host. Her little cottage was clean, quite, easy to access in the back of the main house. I would recommend this place for long stays and short stays. Easy to access I-80."
2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,A lovely place to get to know the area!
2020-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Amazing garden and cozy little cottage makes getting to know the Solano county area really nice!! Waking up to a beautiful garden and was such a mood changer, and I had a 2 year old with me who absolutely loved pointing out the beautiful flowers. It was a lovely place to stay while getting familiar with the area."
2020-06-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"A great one-month housing experience, the house is very comfortable and quiet. Because my child played basketball outside the house, they also specifically found him a basketball hoop. Thanks Susan. Be sure to stay next time."

2020-03-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,Susan is a great host. The house had everything i needed. She even leaves some food and coffee for the guest when you arrive. I also appreciated her letting me put a large tray of food in her fridge for a work party
2020-01-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"I always felt safe and secure, staying by myself. Parking is SO easy, off the beaten track but still easy access. And it’s just so quiet !"
2019-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Susan’s place was perfect for our little Napa/Sonoma trip. It’s a super cute cottage with extremely thoughtful amenities. It’s about 50 minutes away from the wineries, but honestly worth the drive as Susans place is well priced for what you get. She provided us with a long list of recommendations which was really sweet. Would definitely recommend and stay again!"
2019-09-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Cozy cottage, very clean."

2019-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is a darling little place and a great spot for a single person or couple. The living space is great with lots of amenities. So, I suggest you make plans to enjoy some time on the cottage to relax or cook.
The bedroom is functional -- but if you are over six feet tall, be ready to hunch over or hit your head as you walk around the bed. I would call this a mild annoyance, but something to keep in mind."
2019-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Comfortable bed, easy access to the space, and all as expected. Appreciated the extra touches such as the wine/snacks."
2019-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"A fantastic space with very hospitable hosts. Was close enough to the wedding we attended, yet also a manageable distance to head into the city for a night. Highly recommended!"
2019-05-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Good space and appreciated the bottle of wine and cookies. Easy check in process.
2019-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We had a wedding to attend but this place would be AMAZING if you were planning a Napa/Sonoma/SFO trip. It is centrally located AND easy to get onto a freeway. Susan is lovely. I only wish the weather had been better so we could sit outside and sip our coffee in her lovely backyard.
2019-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,All around great.
2019-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Susan was an amazing host. The communication was excellent. Let her know that I was planning on proposing in Napa that weekend and she made sure everything was perfect. Such a good spot for a couple to stay. Good jumping off point for wine country. Only 20 mins or so to downtown Napa. No complaints. Loved everything!
2019-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Susan's place is tucked away in a nice suburb about 30 minutes away from downtown Napa. It's a quaint little place that is full of lush greenery on the outside. On the inside everything is up to date and has a fair amount of space for two people. The bed upstairs is incredibly comfy as well! Further, Susan is quick to respond to any questions you may have over the weekend and extends great hospitality to her guests."
2019-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Lovely cottage and lovely host! :) Very nice amenities. Cute loft bedroom with stairs - watch your head with the slanted ceilings, just on the sides, but really nice room, with a cozy armchair and VERY comfy bed!! Private little home all to yourself, in great location - perfect for visiting the marina in Vallejo. Mare Island is fun, too! Nice drive to Napa, also! We had a wonderful stay!! :) :)"
2019-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Susan's guest cottage is a great place to stay when exploring the Napa Valley. The Netflix was much appreciated, and the fruit, wine, salami, cheese, coffee cream, and tea were an amazing touch. We immediately felt at home, and wished we could have stayed longer."
2019-04-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Susan's place is great, charming, well appointed with everything you need. Susan added the nicest personalized touches which made us feel welcomed and a bit spoiled. Would definitely return as the place is great and Susan is a great host!"
2019-03-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,Don't pass this up. You'll love the privacy and amenities!
2019-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We loved staying here. The place is lovely, Susan is a wonderful hostess. The location is perfect as you seem to be in the centre between San Francisco and Napa! Safe , quiet neighbourhood...and was able to pick fresh oranges and lemons from the back yard! For a Canadian that was stellar.....when returning to this area we will definitely be wanting to stay here again. Thank you so much, Susan."
2019-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This comfortable cottage is located in a beautiful, quiet neighborhood. The kitchen is well-stocked with everything we needed to cook pasta, as well as good wine glasses and a hot water boiler that we used to make our coffee. The shower has good water pressure and the bed is remarkably comfortable. There were additional food items not mentioned in the description that were pleasantly surprising. Access is easy, and the hosts are responsive and nonintrusive. Hope to return soon!"
2019-02-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,Susan and Nick were my angels. I lived at their place for many months and felt at home. I hope to return for Season 4 of our TV series! I love this space soooo much!!!!! Thank you thank you! Xoxox
2018-06-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Susan's cottage is lovely place to rest your head, with a gorgeous garden to look out onto in the morning. The bed was extremely comfy and the english muffins were a very sweet touch. Great central location when visiting NorCal with easy access to both wine country and the city.
Thanks for having us Susan!"
2018-06-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,It’s a great spot.
2018-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Our stay was really nice! We used this location to go to a music festival in Napa and the location was not too far! The house was perfect for a great getaway- plenty of room to hang out at the house, the utmost cleanliness, full amenities, a comfy bed, and great local food options. Plus the hosts were beyond gracious and helpful! Would highly recommend it!"
2018-05-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,"Overall, this cottage is perfectly located to go to San Francisco or Napa; a nice place to escape the busyness of San Francisco. Based on the property profile, I expected breakfast at least being offered. We did not see the owners at all, much less being invited to breakfast. We did have a package of English Muffins, butter, and strawberries in the cottage when we arrived.
Everyone vacations differently but for us, we like to wind down in the evening by watching TV. The cable service to this cottage is extremely limited and there is no DVD player. They do provide an HDMI cable so if you are so inclined, bring your laptop to connect."
2018-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We loved the place. Susan provided us with English muffins, cheese, strawberries, and yogurt. The place was quiet and clean and very spacious. Would definitely stay again!"
2018-04-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"This cottage is quaint, clean and quiet. It was perfect for us, especially since we were working just a few miles away. The bathroom is wonderful, including the shower head and the shower in general. It is well stocked.
The only complaint that I have is that the kitchen is very small, and there is no oven. This is only important if you are planning to invite people over.
In general, the large bedroom, which is sort of a loft, is large and nice. The downstairs is just one room, but it serves as a living room / dining room / kitchen, and it, too, is very large. Susan's house was perfect for us!"
2018-03-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"This is my 2nd visit at this lovely home. I feel safe and secure. My kitty loves it - so many little spots to explore. For me - wine, fruit, juice boxes, shampoo, conditioner, nice towels & sheets and comfy pillows. Really, too many little touches to name, but I'm so grateful for every single one of them. Thank you for another great stay!"
2018-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My stay at Susan's guest house was wonderful! My favorite part was relaxing in a chaise lounge in the backyard; it was just so lovely to sit among their beautiful landscaping and garden, reading my book while listening to the leaves rustling in the wind, and watching the squirrels and birds. It was so peaceful I actually took a nap! I appreciated that some food, wine, and beer were provided. Beware, the bed was heavenly...you might not want to get out of it! The sheets and the towels were luxurious too. Thanks for a great stay!"
2018-03-01,4.0,Stayed about a week,"Hosts are very friendly, but respected our privacy. Clean, quiet and private."
2018-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The perfect jumping point for our Bay area travels!! My Mom and I were on a mother and daughter trip and truly enjoyed our stay at the cottage! The drive to Napa was simple, the town of Vallejo is quaint, the scenery was beautiful, and San Francisco less than an hour drive! Hosts are very responsive when asking for recommendations and when an issue did arise, it was taken care of in minutes! The sun shining in the kitchen window was magnificent as we enjoyed our morning tea and muffins! We would recommend to those looking for a nice get away, centrally located but peaceful! Thanks again Susan and Nick!"
2018-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,A warm cottage to relax at the end of an adventure. My girlfriend and I had a wonderful time and would definitely recommend it to anyone.

2017-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay. Not too far from Napa.
2017-10-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"We caught a flight from London to Oakland and then hired a car to drive to the cottage. The drive took us 1 1/2 hours in rush hour traffic to find the property. The cottage is in the garden of the main house.
Property was as described in the photos clean and comfortable. The bedroom was very large and had an extremely comfortable bed. There was plenty of outside parking.
We used the property as a base to visit family in Fairfield.
We ate at the Dirty Fish which was excellent and walked to the market and had breakfast at the Good Day cafe. Catching ferry to San Francisco very easy and convenient. Enjoyed walking along the waterfront in Vallejo. Also found the local bar Kesslers which took us under 10 minutes to walk, the night we were they had live bar"
2017-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Susan’s cottage is a great place to stay just steps from wine country. It’s a short drive from Vallejo to Napa where we toured the world class wineries. The cottage was well stocked and clean while being quite spacious. Susan was a great host. She was very helpful with special requests as well as providing recommendations and information regarding our excursions.
2017-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I can't say enough positive things about our experience with the cottage and Susan. We arrived for our honeymoon and unfortunately came during the fires. Susan was so helpful and understanding when we were scrambling to make new plans. Her cottage was beautiful, bed comfortable, quiet neighborhood, and the hospitality couldn't be beat. We will definitely re-book - wish we could have stayed!"
2017-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Susan's backyard cottage is the perfect place to relax after a day of wine tasting. The location is great and really easy to get to no matter which direction you are coming from. Coffee and a light breakfast were provided and the welcoming bottle of wine was a lovely extra touch.
2017-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Clean and cozy. Love it!
2017-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This cottage was the perfect location in between San Francisco and Napa. Susan provided breakfast items/essentials and a bottle of wine! We felt very comfortable and enjoyed our stay!
2017-09-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Susans friendlyness and hospitality, perfect location for many activities. A safe whole home for yourselves which is very kozy,spacious and beautiful."
2017-09-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Lovely house to stay at with very reasonable price. Great location and host is very accommodating. Just be aware of a big garden in front of the house for pollen allergy issues. Other than that, this place is a gem! 👍"
2017-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Susan's place is beautiful, clean, and just as it looks.
There was a minor issue when I arrived, and she took care of it right away.
Thank you Susan for being so wonderful!"
2017-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Susan and Nick's Wine Country Cottage is absolutely perfect as a home base to explore Napa and Sonoma, a reasonable drive or ferry to San Fransisco (GORGEOUS to take from the city at night!), and set in a lush garden setting that will make you feel so at home. Susan was super clear on instructions for check in and the house, welcomed us warmly with a bottle of wine and breakfast items for the morning, even helped us decide on the best transportation options given our arrival times in the city on a holiday weekend. We absolutely loved staying and recommend for anyone looking for a great alternative to spending all your wine tasting and city exploring monies on accommodations, this was an AWESOME value and super sweet place to stay! Also of particular interest- the temperatures were over 100 degrees each day with excessive heat warnings and advisories and with the circulation and tons of screened in open windows the house was comfortable every time we walked in. MUST in the city: Sweet Maple for brekky/brunch and SFMOMA (wow.); in Napa: Turnbull Winery (ask for Tyler) and Napa Live (live music crawl downtown); in Sonoma: WestWineTours with Garrett in his VW bus was an absolute weekend highlight and a definite high recommendation (also available as an Air BnB experience and worth every penny). Thanks so much Susan and Nick for setting us up so pretty to enjoy this Wine Country Weekend!"
2017-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I loved this spot. It's in a great location for going south to the Bay Area or north to Wine Country, and the cottage is nestled near a truly beautiful garden. I was very comfortable and wish I could have stayed longer!"

2017-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Absolutely wonderful place to stay. The cottage is located in a beautiful and quiet garden, close to Napa, and a quick car or ferry ride to San Francisco. Susan has thought of everything!!! We will be recommending the cottage to our friends and family!"
2017-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The Cottage was perfect. We flew into SFO for a wedding in Napa and the Cottage was perfectly located. We were out of the hustle and bustle of SF, but close enough to visit friends there. We were also close enough to Napa that we took a couple day trips to nearby sites.
Susan's suggestions for food and ""to see's"" were very helpful. The space was clean and her garden is beautiful. I would absolutely recommend this place to friends. Thank you Susan!"
2017-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Nice & cozy place to stay with a beautiful backyard. Close to Napa valley and now to busy of a place like San Francisco.
2017-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is a charming, private cottage nestled in a fairytale garden behind the larger home. Susan and Nick have put a lot of care into every detail of the place including a luxurious comforter and sheets; and a few items in the mini fridge. The bed is a tempurpedic type mattress which I don't care for but if you do, you'll be set! I wish there was a tub but the shower was awesome! The bedroom is upstairs in an attic room above the garage. If you are really tall watch your head! The location is awesome. We were a short drive to Napa for a wine tour and a ferry ride to San Fransisco. One downside was the wifi which was problematic at times so we used our hotspot. The neighborhood was hilly which made for some nice walks with our pup. We can def recommend this place!"
2017-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place. Susan is super nice.
2017-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The cottage is nice and spacious, set in a lovely garden space. Susan and Nick were really friendly and provided excellent information and communication."
2017-07-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,"Susan was friendly and helpful. The place is ok, but the bed and the polyester sheets were uncomfortable. Good value for the price, but it could do with an upgrade of the furniture, specially the sofa, which is too small."
2017-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Susan's place darn near perfect! Great jumping off point to the Napa and Sonoma Valleys and San Francisco by ferry. Space was clean, unique and the breakfast foods that greet you on arrival are just what you need in the morning. Would 1000% stay here again."
2017-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Thank you for allowing us to bring our puppy, Ramesses. We all loved your intimate garden and enjoyed a refreshing departure from the big city."

2017-06-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"The place is very charming. The pictures and descriptions are very accurate. I would've loved a larger fridge, but its so minor compare to all the other great things the place has to offer."
2017-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My boyfriend and I had the pleasure of staying at the cottage during our weekend Napa trip. It was the perfect place for us, clean, bright, private, quiet, spacious and very comfortable, it had everything we needed and we felt right at home. Susan and Nick have a beautiful garden which was a treat. It was very thoughtful of them to leave some goodies in the fridge for us, even though there were stores close by. Communication was easy and responsive, and she was very accommodating with our check in and check out time. The neighborhood is quiet but only 5 minutes or less from the main highway, which we took to and from Napa, only about 20 minutes or so, very convenient. We would highly recommend this place to anyone visiting the area."
2017-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Susan's place was great! She had goodies in the fridge, the place was clean, organized and well kept. The fountain in the garden was great to fall asleep to at night. We would recommend this place to anyone looking to explore the Bay Area!"
2017-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The cottage was adorable and pretty spacious. The pictures are very accurate and I loved the little fridge snacks and bottle of wine left for us!

2017-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,My niece and her boyfriend stayed at Susan's place while visiting me in Napa. They loved it! The space was airy and bright and Susan's restaurant suggestions were excellent. We would love to return some day.
2017-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Susan's place is perfect! She was kind of enough to stock the fridge with some light breakfast snacks and made sure we had everything we needed. The cottage was cozy, clean, and spacious. We really liked the location of this cottage because it was in a quiet neighborhood but close enough to the freeway so that we could hop right on. It was also really close to surrounding cities, 20 minutes from Napa, 30-40 from SF and Berkeley."
2016-12-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"Susan and Nick's cottage was an absolute pleasure to stay at. We loved that we had our own private space and that the space was cozy and welcoming to boot - perfect for sipping wine in the evenings when you're settling down. The space was clean and not a hair was out of place. We loved the little kitchen and were so thankful to have it at our disposal. The loft like bedroom was another plus that made that space incredibly fun to stay at. Susan was also incredibly quick to respond to any inquiries I had (and there were many!). She was also helpful in recommending restaurants and areas to visit! The location of the cottage was perfect considering we visited Napa, Sonoma, Berkeley, San Francisco, San Jose, Concord and Oakland during our stay. We're excited for the next time we have to visit the Northern California region, because now we have a great place to stay for next time!"
2016-11-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,This adorable cottage is a short drive from Napa and the wine country. Vallejo can be explored from the waterfront to old town. Your hostess is generous and kind.
2016-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The cottage was super cute and Susan was a lovely host! Everything was set up for us and clearly communicated, we had a great time."
2016-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Can't say enough about Susan and Nick. I had the unfortunate experience of arriving later Friday evening to a suitcase that had been tampered with en route. Could not get the TSA lock open. Susan happened to be in the cottage and wasted no time in enlisting her husbands expertise. He not only successfully got my suitcase open, he then offered to drive me to meet my friends (due to lock, I had to wait behind). Their garden is beautiful and I wish we'd had time to sit outside and enjoy the flowers and foliage. I highly recommend this cottage and the wonderful hosts."
2016-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Susan's cottage is wonderful. So homey and relaxing and perfect for our stay. Susan is such a thoughtful and kind host who's included all the details for everything you could possibly need during your stay from coffee to wine. It's a great location that's easy to get to from SF and a short distance from the wineries.
Thanks so much for everything Susan!"
2016-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"What a precious gem not too far from Napa/Sonoma wine country! Susan was a lovely host and always responded extremely fast when I had any inquiries. The cottage is truly a charming resting place after a long day of exploring wineries… And the best part… You can bring your furry friend! Everything was so comfortable… We always slept well. It's very spacious and you can really make yourself at home for however long your stay is. It is gated so you can let your dog go out and wander to smell her pretty flowers ..
Susan came to greet us on our first night upon arrival and she was so very helpful, recommending all kinds of wineries (and even offering coupons! Yea! Gets expensive tasting all that wine! :) ) and other fun things to do like the ferry to San Francisco ..
There were some yogurt and English muffins with jam and even a bottle of wine that greeted us. We made very good use of those. ;)
You can hit a winery in 20 minutes. Our favorite was Turnbull! Excellent. (Unpretentious, down to earth and did I mention the AMAZING wine?)
Needless to say, we had an amazing experience and always loved returning to Susan's precious wine country cottage to relax and prepare for the next day of adventures in winetasting. :)"
2016-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great location for exploring Napa. Very clean, safe, and private cottage with plenty of amenities for additional comfort. Susan was a great host with excellent suggestions for restaurants, wineries, and attractions (she even gave us coupons!). Parking and access is easy and well lit. It was the perfect place for our trip."
2016-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Susan did a wonderful job of welcoming us. She left some personal touches and was very considerate of us when she thought there may be inconveniences with the weather. Susan made herself available when needed but also gave us the privacy we needed. We enjoyed our stay very much!
2016-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The cottage was perfect for our stay. It was centrally located between wine country and San Francisco. We took Susan and Nick's advice on taking the ferry to San Francisco and it worked out perfectly. We ate at 2 restaurants they recommended and both were wonderful. We had complete privacy, but they were available if we needed them. We would highly recommend this Airbnb and would definitely stay here again."
2016-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great communication and was a very easy and convenient stay.
2016-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This is an amazing apartment. I love that the bedroom is kind of like a loft on the second floor. Super cute. We only stayed one night but definitely could've cooked in house had it been a longer stay. It was very comfortable and nice to have our own access at the back of Susan's property. She also allowed us to change the dates of our stay with a couple weeks notice which was very helpful. Thank you!!
2016-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Cozy space and very smooth check in/out. Susan had many things prepared for us upon arrival. We would love to stay another time!
2016-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This was such a charming and lovely place. It had everything you could possibly need including cheese and wine and the most beautiful surroundings. We were in town for a wedding and it was the perfect spot for that and for wine tasting the following day. You seriously can't go wrong here! It is spectacular!
2016-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Susan is a wonderful host. Her hospitality started before I arrived with her providing answers to my many questions. When we arrived everything was exactly the way described. Susan stopped by just to confirm everything was satisfactory. Her genuine concern for the comfort of her guests is heartwarming. We knew we could let her know if there was anything we might need. She also provided written information about local places for dining. I highly recommend Wine Country Cottage as a warm, friendly and ""home away from home"" to the San Francisco/Napa Valley area. I have already booked a second stay, and am looking forward to it."
2016-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a fantastic stay! The hosts were gracious, the home just perfect for us and the location was ideal for eating, relaxing, hiking and generally exploring. I can't recommend staying here enough."
2016-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Our stay was perfect! Everything was exactly as described, and better than we could have imagined. The location is great as it is super close to the SF ferry and a quick drive to napa. We would definitely stay here again!"

2016-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The guest house in Vallejo was excellent for my business trip needs. It is perfectly located in a very nice area of Vallejo and is a very spacious and charming space. Susan and Nick were both very kind and helpful and I would absolutely stay there again.
2016-07-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,The host was very quick in responding to our inquiries. Although we never actually met she left us some excellent suggestions as to where to eat. I loved the layout of the place and the decor. the garden from the kitchen window was lovely.
2016-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Susan and Nick's cottage was perfect for my stay in the Vallejo/Napa area! The cottage was clean, very comfortable, and very nicely decorated. It was a beautiful oasis in the middle of a residential area and felt very safe. The shared yard was lovely to look upon when at the kitchen sink.
Susan and Nick were graceful hosts and very, very accommodating. They were available to offer information and a nice conversation, yet they didn't intrude and you felt your area was quite private.
I would definitely recommend this place to others seeking a sweet cottage close to wine country, san francisco, and other bay locations."
2016-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Susan was super friendly upon our arrival. Her place was spacious and clean for the two of us. Her backyard was lovely to walk through to get to the cottage. Enjoyed everything about it including the 2 for 1 wine tasting coupon she gave us!
2016-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I spent several ours on AirBnB looking for a place that we could stay while we were doing some business travel up in the east bay area. Susan and Nick's guest house stood out to me because it looked so tidy and beautiful, prepared with intention and kindness. We found this spot to exceed our expectations---and felt like we truly found a ""home-away-from-home."" The bed was SO comfortable and we enjoyed cooking a few meals on the kitchen that was equipped with all we needed. As I cooked a few meals I had the privilege of looking out the windows at their Eden-like backyard---breathtaking. Oh, and their hospitality was superior. Being in their peaceful home was a true gift. As we made the long drive home to Los Angeles after a long week of work, we were refreshed, connected, and grateful for this retreat space that let us feel like we never left home. The neighborhood is so nice, neighbors walked by with warm greetings, parking was easy and the energy of this couple and their home is quite beautiful, full of warmth. Sweet people with a perfect spot! Thank you!"
2016-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,My friends and I had a very comfortable stay at Susan and Nick's cottage. The keypad lock made checking in a breeze. The neighborhood was quiet and we had everything we needed.
2016-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very neat little cabin with complete privacy. Susan was very personable and available for help. Great host and great experience overall!
2016-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Susan's space worked well for our group. It's a separate guesthouse in the back yard - not attached to the main house. Definitely roomy enough for 4 people. It was well stocked with toilet paper, paper towels, linens and soap and shampoo. I would stay here again"
2016-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My family stayed at Susan's for a wedding on Mare Island in Vallejo. We loved her cottage. It was easily accessible, quiet and comfortable."
2016-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Comfortable cottage located in back of a home in a quiet neighborhood in Valle Vista area in Vallejo. It's convenient to freeway entrance and any shopping you need.
You walk into an open space with the dining, living and kitchen area in view. Bathroom is on the same level.
Kitchen has a gas stove, mini fridge, toaster oven and microwave convection oven. Kitchen essentials are provided for cooking your meals if you decided to stay-in and eat. I cooked the entire two days of my stay.
Walk up a few steps into the bedroom located on top of the garage. The attic room has a queen bed with ample space for another bed. A cozy chair with ottoman is located in the corner for a nice restful read before you sleep. Plenty of blankets and linens are provided.
I met Nick in person. He was very nice and made me feel comfortable. Anything we needed he was always quick to respond. I communicated with Susan via Airbnb. She was also quick to response with anything we needed. They were very quiet and I almost thought they were never home.
Although this place is located on the same property of someone's home, it felt very private. This is a place we would definitely stay again."
2016-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We spent a week in the region to attend our son's wedding and meet up with some old friends in Napa for wine tasting. Susan's place is much bigger than we expected, and it has all we needed to stay comfortably for 6 nights. It is conveniently located near the wedding venue in and it's only less than 30 minutes drive from Napa. It is on a quiet street with easy street parking in front of the house. I like the view from the kitchen window in the morning when the beautiful flower garden is basking in the soft sunlight. Thank Susan and Nic for making our stay a blissful experience."
2016-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I've stayed at several Airbnb locations and this was one of my favorites. I thoroughly enjoyed my time there and wished I could have stayed longer. The Cottage is just as nice as the photos and the location is in a lovely, quiet neighborhood. There's a beautiful garden area right outside the front door, which added to the charm. Thanks to the hosts, Susan and Nick for a great stay!"
2016-06-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Susan's place was very quaint and served us well. We stayed for two nights and met both her and her husband who were warm. The one complaint was the lack of curtains to maintain privacy in some parts of the place. Other than that, it was very good and Susan was a great host."
2016-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,I stayed at Susan's cottage over the weekend with my mom. It was very well maintained and perfectly clean. It was easy to get to and from the area by car and was exactly what we hoped the stay would be like. Upon arriving we had some trouble with getting through the back door but Susan quickly responded by phone and helped us out with instructions (she was away from her home at the time). We never met with Susan but had a pleasant stay.
2016-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a great time staying at Susan's cottage. This cottage is detached from the main house and has an open living/dining/kitchen area downstairs and a loft bedroom upstairs. We were a party of 4 adults and 1 toddler and we didn't feel cramped. The cottage was clean and well-lit, with a small refrigerator, dishwasher, microwave oven and toaster oven. Susan left us a bottle of wine and a box of croissants (yum!) + a few other items in the mini-fridge. The cottage itself is located in a quiet neighborhood in Vallejo, not too far from wine country (Napa/ Sonoma) and not too far from downtown Vallejo.

We barely saw our hosts as we were out most of the time, visiting breweries, wineries and other local attractions. Susan's recommendations were good - we especially enjoyed the Mare Island brewery at the Vallejo ferry terminal building and the Rutherford Ranch Winery. She even left us a discount coupon for the winery!

Overall, we had an excellent experience and would recommend staying at Susan's cottage if you want a relaxing vacation near wine country or if you want to experience any of the other attractions of the area."
2016-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My boyfriend and I didn't get to meet Susan face to face, but we thoroughly enjoyed our stay. The entry is a kepyad, so there was no need to meet for key exchanges. Also, we're professional travellers always on the go with ideas of places we want to hit, so there was no need to ""hold our hands"" so to speak. Susan did leave us a sheet of great food recommendations (several of which we did try-thanks Susan!) We were also pleased to come home in the evening to some complimentary goodies that we greatly enjoyed and appreciated. The place looks just like in the pictures and is in a nice, quiet neighborhood away from the Napa craziness but close enough to get where you need to go. Extremely cozy and comfortable. I would definitely recommend."
2016-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Susan's cottage war very nice and Susan very helpful, and nice."
2016-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Our host Susan was wonderful! She was very helpful and clear in her communication as far as instructions. She also made sure to give us great recommendations and even offered us some coupons for some local wineries! The neighborhood is quiet, clean and very pleasant. It was our first experience with airbnb that really gave us that traditional bnb feel. It really felt cozy and comforting to feel like we were almost at home. The cottage was very clean, tidy, well stocked with supplies and there were even little snacks for us! Very well thought out home, will definitely recommend for future stays!"
2016-04-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,I enjoyed my stay. The hosts were very thoughtful and extremely accommodating. The space was clean and looked exactly like the pictures. I would strongly encourage potential guests to stay at the property.
2016-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Susan's place was just as pictured! We truly enjoyed the cottage feel. What isn't in the description is the cute garden you pass through on your way to entering the house. The bed was extra comfortable. We have a tv in out bedroom and that was a concern for me but once we got inside and relaxed no tv was needed. The shower was great with good pressure.
2016-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We enjoyed our stay. The cottage is clean, spacious, comfortable and provided everything we needed. Very nice set up!"
2016-01-01,4.0,Stayed over a week,"The pictures, etc on the website very much matched the reality.

Very comfortable and quiet. Being close to grocery shopping was very convenient. We walked to Food Maxx."
2016-01-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Susa's place was just wonderful. I can easily live there. Thank you again Susan.
2016-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Susan's cottage felt just like home - the space was private, clean and so comfortable. Susan herself was very accommodating to us and we are so thankful! She had lots of special touches that helped it feel like home. Thanks again Susan!"
2015-12-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"Had a wonderful 1-month stay at this cottage - had more than enough space for myself, partner, and our chocolate lab. Kitchen came well-stocked, plenty to cook with during our stay. Hosts were very friendly and helpful. Great place for an extended stay for us in a nice neighborhood!"
2015-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We had a wonderful stay at Susan's cottage! It was just as pictured and made for a great Thanksgiving for my little family. It was an easy drive to Napa and all the wineries. The cottage was very clean and comfortable. The towels in the bathroom made you feel like you were in a luxury hotel. Susan's husband even found my son a charger for his Macbook which made his trip happier. We are very thankful for Susan sharing her home and cat :-)
2015-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Susan's place is clean and homey. We enjoyed our stay and proximity to the wineries - and also appreciated some of the snacks Susan left to welcome us!
2015-11-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"This property is exactly as advertised! Spacious, tastefully appointed, comfortable, and quiet. We ""cooked-in"" most nights and the kitchen had most everything we needed including a dishwasher. We would highly recommend this cottage as your base for exploring the wine country - considerably more affordable than options actually in the Napa Valley (which has become excessively overpriced)."
2015-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The cottage is clean, quiet and well equipped."
2015-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Really very lovely accommodations. Our host, Susan, was very communicative and helpful. She goes the extra distance to make guests feel welcome. Thanks Susan!"
2015-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I stayed there with my parents for a weekend at the Wine Country and thoroughly enjoyed my experience. Susan's cottage is a lovely place in a nice and quiet neighbourhood in Vallejo, a quick drive away from wineries in Napa and Sonoma.
Everything was very well organized, the kitchen had all the supplies needed to cook comfortably and there were also supplies for breakfast and even a bottle of wine! The street also had lots of parking spaces. The place looks just like the pictures!
Checking in and out was very easy as they have coded gate and doors with codes they change to every guest, takes away the hassle of keys and stuff, a nice touch!
I, unfortunately, didn't get to meet Susan because she was sick, but she always replied to my questions quickly and was very helpful. She also gave great recommendations of where to eat near us! Her husband, Nick, paid a visit to us on our second night to make sure we were ok and welcome us, he was very nice!
Definitely recommended!"
2015-09-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Our group of 4 enjoyed the cottage very much. It was a convenient location for us and fit our needs well.
2015-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This cottage was so nice and adorable! The pictures were exactly accurate. We were super close to the ferry that takes you straight into san fran. My sister, doggie and i had a lovely experience!"
2015-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We enjoyed very much your apparment,it was like home,very well equipped and cozy.We would give you a 10/10 évaluation.
Gérard and Elyse"
2015-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Our experience at the cottage was wonderful! Our party of 4 traveling from San Francisco to visit Napa were all extremely pleased with the overall space and ease of access. One couple stayed in the upstairs bedroom while the second stayed on an air mattress. There was more than enough space for us to spread out and relax while not sleeping. Downtown Napa was a 20 minute drive even with traffic so this was a perfect location for our trip to wine country. The grocery store was right around the corner which allowed us to purchase breakfast and dinner items and enjoy them in the cottage. The owner's home is in the front yard, but the owners were extremely pleasant and helpful. I would highly recommend this unit for anyone looking to visit Napa with a party of 4 or less."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Highly recommend this place, very clean , safe, was ver easy to communicate with Stephanie."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,Thank you! Stephanie was great

2024-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Sheer delght
2024-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Lovely, historic home that feels like a real B&B. Birds chirping in a beautiful garden where you can pick your own oranges!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,We enjoyed our stay in Vallejo at Kay’s Place. Kay was very sweet to us and answered any questions we had for her. Her house has a lot of history and is centrally located to so many things to see and do. Thank you Kay for having us !!! 😁
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,I stay here a few days once a month for work and feel right at home each time. Dr. Kay is very responsive and ensures it is a pleasant stay.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Dr. Kay is a kind host and her home is a lovely place to stay. We were able to check in late and check out early which was extremely helpful for us since we were on a tight schedule with a lot of travel. The home and neighborhood were very quiet. Also very affordable. I would happily book this room again if I found myself in north bay again!
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Kay was an extremely attentive and friendly host. She was kind enough to make up with our late check-in, and was very available. The bedroom is very comfortable, even though the bed may seem narrow in the land of king size beds! But it reminded us of ours in France;))
The house is extremely charming and full of beautiful antique objects. We regret that we only spent a few hours sleeping there. Everything is thought out to make the stay enjoyable: water carafe available, kettle, mugs and tea bags...
Excellent value for money!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great host, comfortable room and lovely garden."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We so enjoyed our stay and look forward to our next visit.
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,I had a wonderful stay at Kay's place. Lovely room and very clean. She is very hospitable. Thanks Kay!
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Originally we had booked Dr. Kay's place only for a day & we ended up extending it by another day.
The place is beautiful & nicely done. Napa valley is about 30 min drive from here. Definitely recommended.
The house is a bit old & hence the floor is squeaky. The itself has a small fridge, microwave and basic cutlery. Dr. Kay helped us with restaurant & wine tasting recommendations.
Overall, highly recommend this place!"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Beautiful and historical. A wonderful stop over. Dr. Kay is very kind and accommodating.
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Like everyone else says, Dr. Kay is a kind and thoughtful host. I was very comfortable at her home. I used this as my base and explored one nearby city per day: Napa, Sonoma, Calistoga and St. Helena. As you can see I checked the cities that are closer to Vallejo first before driving up north to Calistoga during the last two days of my trip. I didn't feel rushed and the entire stay felt calm and peaceful. I would love to go back and stay here!"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Dr. Kay was an amiable host! Her home was beautiful, quiet, and very cozy. We felt right at home. The rooms for guests are upstairs, and because we were the only guests, it felt very private and comfortable. But if there had been another person, we would have had to share the bathroom. That would not be a problem at all, but it's worth noting! Dr. Kay also allowed us to pick fresh oranges from her tree, which were delicious! I highly recommend staying with Dr. Kay if you're visiting Napa Valley. The home is about 30ish minutes away from Yountville. Overall, it was a lovely home with a gracious host!"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,A wonderful cozy stay. Felt very peaceful and safe. Dr Kay was very welcoming and kind
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great air b and b for a night! Dr.Kay was super sweet and flexible with our check in. We enjoyed picking oranges from her back yard. Very quaint and unique home. She gave some great recommendations and safety tips for the area we were in.
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Her place was such a calm and tranquil hug after a long drive as I was preparing to continue my journey the next day. The garden was peaceful and the room cozy. It was such an honor to be her guest. Thank you.
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Dr Kay
Is a wonderful host. I enjoyed our conversation about her making the move to Vallejo when she was my age and about her opening the home to artists to tap into their creative talents.
My stay was very short but next time I too would love to visit during warmer weather and sit in the lovely garden to tap into my gifts.
Thank you Dr Kay for sharing your adobe. 💜"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,It was amazing!
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"What a special place to stay. Very private, quiet and comfortable. A short stay but I would’ve loved to stay longer."
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Very nice home. I liked the history of the home and Dr Kay’s involvement in critical local events. The room was nice with a nice bed, microwave and refrigerator."
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,My sister and I had an amazing time at Dr. Kay’s place.
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This small victorian farmhouse was wonderful in every respect. Dr Kay is the consummate hostess and went out of her way to make us feel special even offering to cook a light dinner for us. She is very informed about the past history of Vallejo as well as community activities to save and restore the unique place in history this area possesses. We will not hesitate to tell others about it or to stay here again.
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Wonderful stay! Kay is such a sweetheart - we needed to check in late and she welcomed and greeted us in so we felt at home. Very clean and cozy.
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Lovely lady who welcomed us into her space. The floors are a bit squeaky but it’s a non-complaint. Perfect for a short stay.
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I always enjoying staying at Dr. Kay's place - its comfortable, clean, and convenient to my work. She takes care to meet the needs of her guests."
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Such beautiful and peaceful historical house. I was supposed to be finishing up a lot of paperwork that night I stayed but instead i found myself looking up the history of the family that built the house that dates back to the 1850s. I love history and it was such a nice place to relax. I look to stay there again and hopefully will have more time to talk with Dr. Kay who was a very gracious host.
2024-02-01,2.0,Stayed one night,Stay was fine last time. Second time around there was a dog barking all night. Guest next door watching tv loudly through paper thin walls all night. Trash can was filled with a previous guests hair and trash. Host was unclear about disposal of trash. We did not want to throw old soup into her trash bin so we thought it would be nicer to flush it down the toilet as there is no kitchen sink available. Host waited hours after we already departed to insult us and complain. She knows my husband is a general contractor and has experience with plumbing and could have helped. Rather for asking for help all she did was accuse us and insult us. Never again.
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Lovely hostess. Felt like a home. Did not have the 'standard' AirBNB towels, fixtures, and electronics. a nice change. She has furnished the room as the room that one lived in for years. Comfortable, calm."

2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Dr. Kay is amazing! I'm so glad we got a chance to connect while I was at her home. It is beautiful, calm, quiet and very well decorated.

2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"very cozy, comfortable space. Dr. Kay was a great hostess!"
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,many thanks
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Had a wonderful stay in this enchanted historic home! Impressive at how well kept it is for a home built in the 1850’s, and still has the nostalgia of another place and time with period correct furnishings and decor, and I love the original artwork. Dr Kay was friendly and made us feel special with a warm welcome! I appreciate the quiet vicinity of the home as well as the neighborhood filled with other charming historic homes. This was my first experience renting a room within a home, but there was plenty of privacy. It was very clean and charming at every turn. I felt like I was in a classic romance novel or film! It’s the best deal for such a special place and I highly recommend it!"
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Dr Kay was absolutely wonderful. She is kind and welcoming. Her story filled life is a treasure should you be lucky enough to hear about! It is very homey and you will feel as though you have an extra family member. The bed is very firm is the only downside unless you like firm beds.
2023-12-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,She was very engaging and helpful
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,I have come here several times now for my work and love it each time. Dr. Kay has created a very welcoming and comfortable environment which makes me feel right at home.
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Dr. Kay's place is a rare gem of a great host, wonderful location and a comfortable place to stay. I enjoy visiting the Napa area but too many places are pricing themselves into the stratosphere. I am really glad I found Kay's place!
Kay was very responsive and caring. She communicated frequently prior to and during the trip; she ensured I had everything I needed for a great stay.
Everything I needed was in the room and bathroom. The room itself was very comfortable with a lovely bed. I tend to be cold at night and she had a space heater in the room which was a nice touch to boost the temperature.
There is also a fridge and microwave in the room (along with utensils), water, coffee, etc.
Kay greeted me when I arrived and gave me a tour. It was nice to meet her and she even offered to chat one night if I was free. I was glad I did - she has a wealth of knowledge of the area and was a great conversationalist.
I look forward to staying at Kay's place again. Highly recommended!"

2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Delightful host in a beautiful, historic home. Clean and comfortable. The rental room faces the front of the home, which may be an issue if you are sensitive to light while sleeping. Window air conditioning and free-standing radiators for heat. A small frig, microwave, wine glasses, coffee cups and table utensils are in the room. There is a lovely front porch and a gorgeous back porch and garden. Kitchen access can be arranged. Vallejo is an interesting town with several good restaurants and a lovely downtown with a variety of shops. It is an easy drive to the Napa Valley.
I was there under very difficult circumstances. Dr. Kay was kind and supportive, which helped me immensely. She is a thoughtful person with broad interests, making her a great conversationalist."

2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"What an absolutely wonderful stay in every possible way! Dr Kay has created a gem in Vallejo. I’d encourage everyone who is headed to the Bay Area to stay in her charming, relaxing, welcoming and uniquely curated and well appointed place. (And in season the fresh figs off the tree are a bonus.) Thank you, Kay!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We stumbled upon Dr. Kay's place at the very last minute. What a gem! It was a slice of artistic heaven where we least expected it. Dr. Kay was very hospitable without being overbearing. She even encouraged us to enjoy figs from an abundant crop of the tree in her backyard. There is so much rich history in this place, we felt truly honored to be able to spend several days under its roof, within its walls. But history didn't get in the way of modern conveniences - everything we needed was right there. Would highly recommend this place to anyone seeking a quiet retreat with plenty of inspiration at every corner."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We enjoyed our short stay. Very nice lady who had many amenities for us
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Overall, Dr. Kay’s place was beautiful. Very quaint and an artists dream. Everything was clean and pretty. However, we learned a lesson about communicating with our host. When I arrived I was called a “bad girl” for not communicating our arrival ahead of time. Check in was until 11pm and we arrived at 8:30pm but even then we were reprimanded for not responding sooner. We had a long travel day and did not expect that. I’m sure it was a joke but it did not land well. She didn’t know where I was coming from when she said it, but I actually came from a volatile family experience that day and getting reprimanded did not help me feel welcome. Overall good place, just some clunky miscommunication. We were all trying our best but it just wasn’t working. Dr. Kay showed us cool places around the area and offered us fresh figs too. She is a great host and it’s a great place, just be aware of different ways of communication and that guests may be coming from all different emotions/ experiences :)"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,What an amazing person Dr. Kay is. The story of her beautiful historical home and the continued work she continues to do today to preserve her home for other generations to enjoy and learn about the beauties of art.

Comfy bed, beautiful art, a lovely garden, and the attention to detail made it a lovely, though too short, stay. her home is super close to Kaiser and was the perfect place to lay my head after a long day of training."
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I’ve stayed at Dr. Kay’s place a few times while on work assignment. It is a nice and quiet home with some history behind it. The neighborhood is decent and parking is usually not an issue. Dr. Kay herself has been friendly the few times I’ve met her and was accommodating to a very last minute booking on my most recent trip. The room has everything you need for a simple and pleasant stay, including a comfy bed, a desk, and silverware/bowls/plates/microwave/mini fridge to enjoy your own food. No TV is in the room, but having a phone will suffice, especially since the power outlet is located conveniently next to the bed. The bathroom is nearby and always clean. The shower can be confusing to operate between its two knobs, so just a heads up that the left knob is basically off/on and the right knob is hot/cold. Because it is an older home with wooden floors, it is best to carry luggage instead of drag it, but just note you do have to walk up a thin flight of stairs to get to your room. Lastly, it would be nice if full access was granted to the kitchen, but I give props to Dr. Kay to being upfront about kitchen usage being on a case-by-case basis with advanced approval in her description. However, I personally have not used the kitchen during any of my visits."
,,,I didn’t like it
,,,"I would NOT recommend this place to anyone. While the cottage appears nice in photos, looks are indeed deceiving. The kitchen appliances are faulty, the sheets had stains, the fridge barely worked, there is no air conditioning, and the host will try to nickel-and-dime you for EVERY THING. We arrived to a broken stove that was not fixed during our stay. Instead she attempted to blame and charge us for the faulty stove. I have never had a bad experience at an Air BNB before this stay, but please do yourself a favor and choose somewhere else. We tried to keep a positive attitude but had nothing but issues. Very very disappointing. Beware!"
