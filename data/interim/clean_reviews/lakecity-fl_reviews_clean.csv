If you are afraid of frogs, please don’t turn on the porch light, they appeared to be attracted by the light... Overall it was a wonderful stay, I recommend and would definitely stay again."
2020-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Shannon’s home is adorable. Very comfortable and clean in a quite neighborhood. Shannon herself is amazing! She was incredibly understanding about a change in plans that was completely last minute. She gets back to you very quickly and is super helpful!
2020-06-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"Great home to stay over on drive down 75 south. Nice open yard. Only thing we were unaware of was the owners actually live in this home. So we were confused by where we should and shouldn’t go in home or what things to use since we wanted to be respectful.
But awesome value for money."

There was a Publix 5 miles away and her kitchen had everything for us to make dinner and breakfast. Our dogs LOVED the fenced in backyard and doggy door. She also had dog treats on the counter. Everything was spotless clean and the location was perfectly right off the interstate. Would gladly stay there again.
2020-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay, including our dogs, in this spacious house. It’s easy to access, about 3 minutes from I-75 but off the beaten path in a quiet neighborhood.
We stayed during COVID and felt comfortable with the cleanliness. The open floor plan is nice with lots of personal touches. Our dogs loved the backyard too!
Shannon was responsive and helpful. Would definitely stay again."
2020-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Awesome place. Very nice hosts. Accidently left some beer and towels and they contacted us making sure we were ok forgetting them. Extremely pleasant to deal with.

2020-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great place!
2020-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Squeaky clean, beach vibe, fenced back yard, big open living room; what else to ask for? We stayed with our two dogs and they loved it. We will definitely try to book again. The host rents the place when they are away, so keep in mind that it is their actual house. Only thing missing is a chromecast or roku, I'll be bringing an hdmi next time to hookup my laptop."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,There were 6 of us (2 kids included) staying here for Memorial Day weekend and it was such a great place. The house is much bigger than the pictures make it seem. The pool and the backyard were definitely the highlight. The location was very close to restaurants and grocery stores. As many air BnB’s as I’ve stayed in this was definitely my favorite and we are already planning to come back year. Thanks to all the hosts for the quick replies and recommendations in the area. Looking forward to staying again.
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Our family enjoyed our visit to this beautiful and large home, very close to everything in Lake City. The pool was great and the backyard was lovely, with a fire pit area and fruit trees. We hope to return soon."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Being from Lake City I’m very picky about where I stay when visiting. This place has a great location and is close to town and restaurants.
One of the first times traveling with my 1 year old the host provided a high chair without me asking which was a huge help.
I did have to baby proof the house a bit, like relocating the glass coffee table and unplugging wall outlets. The host was understanding."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Excellent host would definitely stay again. Kids loved the pool and fenced in backyard was nice for them to run around the yard.

2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,We like this Airbnb so much. This is our second time to stay for a week. It’s a beautifully renovated home. We love picking the grapefruits and oranges. I left a long fruit picker there for reading the fruit that’s out of reach on the beautiful mature trees.
2024-01-01,5.0,Group trip,"We have an amazing time in this house. We have everything needed to stay comfortable and feel like our own house and highly recommended for families and friends. The host always was friendly, and communicative. We have to return soon; this will be my first option to stay."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We loved our stay at this Airbnb. It was so comfortable and had everything we needed. While the neighborhood is older, it is very family-friendly, and quiet. We loved hearing the fountain each time we open the sliding door to the backyard. The grapefruit and kumquats were so from the fruit trees. The house was clean, easy to find, beautifully, renovated, and exceeded our expectations. We would love to stay here again."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The stay was excellent and the house was very clean and had everything we needed. Highly recommended!!!
2023-11-01,4.0,Group trip,"Recently renovated. Area seemed a little rough. Would’ve been nice to have a king bed in one of the rooms and real bedroom doors, instead of closet doors. Host was quick to respond and very accommodating."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Great home to celebrate Thanksgiving with the whole family, including my airman stationed at Moody AFB just hour away. The home is much larger than I expected, personal space for everyone but had large enough areas for us to have game night and dinner together. Conveniently close to grocery and dollar store but the neighborhood itself was a little questionable and had a lot of late night traffic for a side street. It was very safe and well lit with outdoor security cameras. Ichatucknee Springs is one of the most beautiful places I’ve ever seen!! Overall a great stay!!"
2023-11-01,5.0,Group trip,"My ONLY complaint is it was slightly annoying that the two bathrooms were only on one side of the house. But it was a great location, clean, and comfortable!"

2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Our work employees stayed here for 3 different weeks and enjoyed it. Clean and comfy. We had an issue with the air conditioner unit going out but communication was good and it was fixed that night. Would stay here again.
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,my family and I really enjoyed this property!
2023-08-01,3.0,Stayed with kids,"Positives: great value compared to the cost of a hotel room. The pool was fantastic and the hosts provided pool noodles and floats for guests. The primary’s bathroom/closet lead to the pool so you don’t have to walk all the way through the house to go to the bathroom. They provided charcoal & a lighter for the grill. The provide coffee (tip the cups hold 8 oz). Plenty of room to spread out and kids can play inside and outside. They have a high chair for littles who need one. Awesome response time from the hosts all weekend and leading up to the weekend. Minimal check out clean up.
Negatives: there were carpenter ants in the lower den and third bedroom(more lower den than bedroom); the third bedroom is not close to a bathroom; primary bedroom didn’t have a door for the primary bath (was completely open). 2 bedroom doors are not solid-they are vented doors so there’s no noise blocking for littles to fall asleep. Floors look clean, but bring socks for everyone so feet don’t turn black."
2023-08-01,5.0,Group trip,We had a great stay here! The pool was a hit and very much needed with the excessive heat. The sliding glass door was very hard to close is my only gripe and that’s all! I would definitely stay here again and my family that we visited will recommend to others as well.
2023-08-01,5.0,Group trip,Beautiful property an awesome host will definitely stay here again when I’m working in this area

2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"I don’t know where to start. We usually rent Airbnb for our getaways as we always travel with our dog. This house got everything we needed and more it was so easy and comfortable to stay here like we were home. Emanuel is amazing communicating and helping with any questions we may have. He even offer to send me a device I forgot in the bed. The pool was pristine and the outdoor space was so relaxing and fun. The attention to detail was amazing in every aspect like having complimentary coffee and cream (plenty not 2 or 3 like other places) the welcoming environment of the house, the clear and easy instructions it makes this one of our favorite Airbnb ever and we definitely recommend you visit this place and of course visit the multiple springs outside the town"

2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Had a really good time here.

2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This house is amazing. We enjoyed the pool greatly. House was huge and able to accommodate so many people if needed. No need to bring pool floats, everything needed was provided. Would definitely stay again when in Lake City."

2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Lovely cottage & fantastic host! Host has thought of every last detail that one might need during a stay. So much better than overnighting in a hotel. Would definitely stay again!
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I booked Kimberly’s home for a overnight stay while traveling to Savannah from Pensacola. It was the perfect location not far off of i10. Her place is beautiful, cozy and clean! Awesome communication with her as well. Absolutely would stay here again and longer in the future if needed."

2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We absolutely loved everything about this adorable, clean, cozy home. It has a very comfy-cottage boho feel.
The hosts paid special attention to details we’ve honestly never seen in other Airbnbs. Everything from the upgraded coffee pot & k-cups to the q-tips in the bathroom lended itself to an upscale expensive spa resort..
The owners are very helpful and responsive! We will def stay again and again (it maybe our home away from home lol) wish I could give it more than 5 stars. Now go book your stay and enjoy!"
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Loved this neat gem! I am a sucker for Florida cracker houses, and this was the cutest place. Everything was clean, taken care of, and it was very comfortable for us. It was evident that it has just been remodeled and touched up. The owner took everything into consideration and has created the perfect environment for guests. We hope to stay again."

2022-10-01,4.0,Group trip,a very cozy and quiet place I recommend
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,If you want to get away this is the perfect place. The sliding glass doors are really cool to look out of and see deer grazing and birds eating from the bird feeders. It was very quiet.
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Jimmys place was clean, jimmy made sure we had everything we may have needed and more. He was responsive and ensured getting in was smooth. We will be back!!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I had a late check-in, however Jimmy still met me and showed me in. The home is very nice and the surrounding area was quite. The next time I am in the area, I will book with him again."

2024-06-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,Looks exactly like the pictures. A few imperfections we noticed but overall nice place for the price! Very secluded area/driveway. Jimmy was very responsive and helpful during our stay.
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This place was great to get some rest after a long day at the springs! It looked exactly like the pictures and is more than enough space for 2 people. It was very clean and stocked well. I saw some people complain about loud music but we didn’t have that problem at all. It was a very peaceful stay and I will definitely be back. It was a great price and I would recommend booking it over anything else in the area if you’re looking for something cheap but clean!
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Kind and friendly host whom always answered quickly if we needed anything.
2024-05-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"Had a lovely stay at Jimmy's place! Everything was as described. Good location close to many springs. In-unit laundry was perfect. Jimmy was very helpful and responsive. I'd be thrilled to stay here again, thanks for everything!"

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Jimmy’s place was great! We were in the area to visit some springs and his trailer cabin was perfectly secluded and quiet to come back to relax in. He’s very helpful and friendly with recommendations. All in all would recommend:)

2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Nice home in the woods that is close to many of Florida's freshwater springs. Has all the needed amenities. Quiet rural setting.

2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great place to stay on the way down to Florida.
2024-02-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Jimmy’s place is great for a little getaway! It was perfect for a weekend in the woods and I enjoyed my stay, the value was on point. He was a good host and was responsive for any needs. I only have a couple of complaints, one being cleanliness. Although we personally didn’t mind due to the value you’re getting for what you pay, there were some issues with the floors being pretty dirty and some pet hair. We just cleaned up a bit with the swiffer and washed the comforter for the fur and the rest of the stay was good, but be warned you might have to do some light cleaning. Also, for some reason there was always very loud music being blasted at the cabin, even as early as 7am which was a bit annoying. Overall I would just keep the cleanliness in mind for this Airbnb if that’s a dealbreaker for you but we still enjoyed our stay regardless."
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"What an awesome place to stay. You feel right at home and it’s very private. Jimmy is also an awesome host, I would recommend this stay 100%!!"
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Everything about Jimmy's place was perfect. Easy to find, beautiful location, all the amenities I needed. Jimmy greeted me and was great to deal with. Will definitely be back."
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We were looking for a place to go to relax. Jimmy's place provided that for us.
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Hideaway in the woods off the beaten path-perfectly located for our midway point to St. Pete. Peaceful, private & clean. Stocked kitchen, comfy bed. GPS got us there, also mailbox at road. Great Internet, good value. Bring in your food and drink for the night. Close to the north entrance of Ichetucknee State park and it’s two springs. We didn’t meet host but he aimed to please."
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Quiet, peaceful break from the highway !!
Loved the place and the setting!!"
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"super chill, super cute, had everything I needed! it was exactly what I was looking for."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"It was a the perfect little getaway for the boyfriend and I. It was so peaceful, we barely left. Jimmy was amazing, responded quickly, and will check on you but not bother you. He told us to go outside and look at the stars and they did not disappoint! We will definitely keep this place in mind and be back soon."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Cute cabin in the woods. Very private property with full bird feeders. I had my coffee on the deck and watched the birds. Kitchen was stocked, bathroom was nice, bedroom was comfy and the living room was great with the glass patio door! The host, Jimmie was very nice to check in, on me. I would stay here again."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Jimmy did a great job getting the place clean and ready for our check in. Also, we needed a corkscrew and Jimmy picked 1 up for us! Definitely recommend this place!"
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We loved our stay at Jimmy's. The squirrels and birds were fun to watch while enjoying our coffee. The partially stocked kitchen made our stay much easier. The location was a bit out of the way, but that's part of why i chose it. Would definitely stay again, and recommend for anyone looking to stay in the area."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great little hideaway in the woods that is not too far from any desired activities. I have only two very minor issues with the property. Neither will keep me from staying in the future nor would they prevent me from recommending this property to others. The first is that the bed is mildly saggy in the middle. It is noticeable but did not hinder my sleep. The other issue is that the parking area is not paved. We had to take care not to track sand inside the house and it was difficult to keep from tracking it into the car. These statements are not meant to be complaints but rather information so people can be prepared. I will be staying in the area in the future and I will definitely use this property again.
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"A wonderful place to relax your mind and body. A quiet, comfortable, clean, cozy, warm, and relaxing home in the woods. Hot showers and laundry too. Jimmy is very responsive and proactive. A great find."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The cabin, location and everything else were very nice and peaceful. The only complaint I have is the next door neighbor's blaring music at 930 on Thanksgiving morning, and then at 7 30, the following morning. This detracted a bit from the otherwise peaceful atmosphere prevented us from sitting on the front porch within our coffee and listening to the birds in the morning. Everything that Jimmy had control over was wonderful. The cabin was so cute and all of the amenities were great. We will definitely be back"
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Jimmy was extremely helpful and super responsive. Would definitely recommend him and this amazing location!
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Everything was as advertised 👍

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Super beautiful place on gorgeous secluded property. The pics are the most accurate I’ve seen on air b&b at a steal of a price. It was super clean and the internet was really fast! Felt very cozy and right at home. We are definitely going to be back here in the future. Was just the quiet getaway we needed. 🙂
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We loved everything this little house. So private, quiet, and peaceful. Centrally located to all the lovely springs. Cant wait to visit again!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Jimmy's place is cozy and comfortable! It is nestled back into the woods and extremely peaceful. The living room couch is comfortable after a long day of exploring springs. He has a full kitchen setup for cooking and the bed is super comfortable. Conveniently there is a washer and dryer to dry clothes after swimming. Thankful he allows pets so we could bring our fur baby. The wifi works great. Highly recommend this place! Can't wait to return.
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This nice tidy pleasant hideaway is in the woods and great proximity to ichatucknee springs! Listed accurately. WiFi solid Had a washer/dryer! Didn’t use them but how handy! Place is clean. Bring some food /drink as jimmys place is remote! We didn’t bring a pet but it was noticeable that pets were there. Bed is small but soft for us folk who are use to firm Kings. Linens were polyester fresh and clean. Overnite stay suit us fine and we are grateful for the experience.
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,We had a nice relaxing night at the cabin! We had everything we needed. Everything is as described. Thank you!

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Stayed here an extra night to check out more of the Springs. Ichetucknee is close by and is beautiful. Jimmy was very friendly. I had everything I needed to cook and clean. I appreciated having toiletries, bug spray and food in the refrigerator..nice touch. I would recommend staying here."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We had a great time on our anniversary trip! The stay was very private and peaceful. Do note that cell service can be spotty so if you need to use navigation connect to the WiFi and search directions to your destination before leaving the cabin.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Had a great stay of several days at Jimmy’s place and would return. Jimmy came out in the rain to meet me and help me navigate in, and he checked in to see how I was doing. The place was clean and as described. There was some food, water, and snacks in the kitchen, which was very nice, especially since it is a little more remote. Very well-stocked home—above and beyond, in my experience. Wifi was good. Jimmy’s description of the rental is clear that there might be a few bugs and the smell of smoke inside—I saw and smelled both, but neither were so problematic that I had an issue. There are bird feeders outside and I really enjoyed watching them. The house is close to Ichetucknee (about 15-20 mins). GPS drops you a little short of the home, so just look for the large sign with the house number. Check out the Farm Stand nearby for Mexican food and some local goods if you can. This stay is a great value. Thanks for your hospitality, Jimmy!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Jimmy’s place was our first time booking an air BNB. He provided drinks and some snacks. He was very friendly and conveniently located for us! We loved this cozy place and look forward to booking again!

2023-05-01,4.0,Stayed one night,We only stayed for one night and didn’t get to enjoy his place much as we were attending an all day event. Only slept & showered there. The bed was very comfortable and clean. Jimmy met us bright and early as we were leaving the next morning. Thank you Jimmy for sharing your place with us and being such a gracious host.
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Love the place, Jimmy was very pleasant to talk to and offered a lot of foods, definitely I will book again. Quiet neighborhood ♥️"
2023-05-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,"This cabin is perfect for someone looking to get close to nature, with an amazing scenic drive before getting to it. It is located in a quiet, wooded area just a short drive from several state parks, including Ichetucknee State Park, which is known for its beautiful springs and crystal-clear waters.
The cabin itself is cozy and well-equipped, with everything you need for a comfortable stay. There is one bedroom, a full kitchen, a living room, and a washer and dryer. The cabin is also dog friendly, so you can bring your furry friend along for the ride.
Jimmy (the host) is friendly and accommodating, and makes sure to provide everything you need for a relaxing stay. There are welcome goodies (snacks and drinks), and the hosts are always available to answer any questions you may have."

I would recommend this place to anyone and I would stay there again if we were in the area!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The place was very clean and the area was remote and quiet. The entrance is a little hard to find, the house is not visible from the road and the gps stops before the actual address, but checking the mailbox numbers will get you there fine. Overall, the place was very nice and I was happy with the accommodations."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Jimmy was an awesome host
he had water in the refrigerator
food for breakfast, which was above and beyond.

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,My second stay at this location. It’s my first choice for my monthly business visits but I’ve had to stay other places due to availability. There is no comparison.

The little porch was great for coffee in the morning. We even saw 5 wild turkeys cross the lawn and walk into the wooded areas. Super cool for my grandson (and me too!). We will definitely be back!
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"Our stay at the cottage was wonderful. Debbie and Patrick are gracious hosts, whose main concern is your comfort. The cottage is beautiful; it is nestled in a country setting, yet you are only minutes from restaurants, interstate, and natural Springs. You can cook on the grill while sitting on the patio listening to the birds chirping and watching the squirrels play. Highly recommend staying at this lovely cottage."

2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We came into town to be with family during a challenging time and this location was more than we could have ever wished for.

They messaged us to make sure everything was great with the cottage. The cottage was clean, decorated to make you feel at home, they even supplied coffee and snacks there which was great.

2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Debi & Patrick have created a little slice of heaven with their guest cottage tucked away in the very back of a beautiful neighborhood. It felt very country-cozy and welcoming. The home was extremely clean & the beds very comfortable. I appreciated how conveniently located it was off the hwy as we were only there to sleep one night before getting back on the road again. We briefly walked the trail behind their home in the morning. One special highlight was seeing a wild turkey run across their lawn upon pulling onto their property. All encounters with Debi & Patrick were friendly. Only regret was not being able to stay longer.

I just can't say enough about her cleanliness, luxury accommodations, and attention to detail on EVERY aspect of your stay. Sadie even remembered we just celebrated our 29th wedding anniversary and left us a beautiful card & treats! Her family is also very awesome! Sadie's son is very respectful and even offered to help us pack our car - truly a nice young man. Sadie is very responsive and you can reach her at any time prior, during, and even after your stay!

My main compliment was that everything I needed was right in place, nothing extra I had to purchase. To my surprise the place looked better in person, to the lovely paintings on the wall and the whole theme of the place felt romantic. The movies on the side was something that I loved, simply because I forgot mine and they were a good replacement."

Sadie's home more than exceeded my expectations! Truly, her suite is luxury hotel action. From the moment we opened the door I WAS IMPRESSED...and that's hard to do. Sadie thought of every detail possible. The suite is beautifully decorated, right down to the curtains. The bath towels are nice & plush. The bed has a very comfortable mattress. Nicely appointed kitchenette with a refrigerator that can accommodate a bag of ice! The place is immaculately clean! No dust, no dirt. Sadie spared no expense, right down to the fixtures. Easy check-in & parking. Centrally located & just a couple of miles from Downtown. Sadie is very responsive & she & her hubby are extremely nice people. I HIGHLY recommend this stay.

She is also very responsive to her messages, and if needed anything, she will respond right away.
Also provides a book by the bed with instructions on how to operate the devices and listing of places to eat or order food.

The decor, the response time to any need /question that you may have, but more than anything she is a wonderful person with a love of hosting. This was the first stop on a birthday week for my wife. The time that she has taken to personalize and get special gifts upon our arrival will be unmatched.
It seems everyone says “hidden gem” in their reviews. The place that she provides for you to stay will speak for itself. But the hidden gem at this stay is Sadie. Thank you for this weekend!!!"

We typically stay at hotels however, her price was way more reasonable......so I decided to give it a try. I’ve never stayed in someone’s guest house and I was a tad bit apprehensive. Tracys prompt responses and friendly communication assisted in allowing me to feel very comfortable. She greeted us upon check in and had a very soft, genuine spirit. I instantly felt at home. The living quarters were incredibly cozy, comfortable and clean! All of the possible essentials that you may need we're easily accessible, the pool was perfect my son thoroughly enjoyed it! Her backyard oasis is like a breath of fresh air and the three friendly kittens were an icing on the cake!

2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We needed a place to stay on our way home from Florida and this was perfect as it is very near I-75, and reasonably priced. The bonus was the beautiful setting— so nice to site beside the pool in the early evening. They have the cutest lighthouse setup in the suite and all kinds of things stocked to make your stay nice. Thank you for allowing a one night stay and for everything you provide!"

2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Tracie definitely goes above and beyond with all the things she provides in case we might have forgotten a toothbrush, etc. The room was very clean. We enjoyed having the ability to make coffee. We ate dinner at Piesanos Stone Fired Pizza--highly recommend. Before booking, we read lots of reviews on this property and several mentioned a comfortable bed. We are senior citizens and perhaps that's part of the reason, but sorry to say, we found the bed to be uncomfortable. Overall we had a good stay. Thanks Tracie."

From the snacks, water bottles, toiletries, etc. And even though there isn’t a kitchenette, she has made sure you have what you need with even a hot plate!! 😁😁. The inside is clean and absolutely beautiful. We brought a cooler and had plenty for breakfast. Was able to enjoy the beautiful weather by the pool. Just make sure you put the umbrella down when you leave as it can get pretty windy and it will blow out of its holder!! 😳🤪. We were fortunate to meet Tracie and her husband Jesse and they were wonderful! We were down for a funeral so unfortunately we weren’t able to enjoy much of anything in the area, but will most definitely stay here again!!!!!"

Tracie and Jesse met us and made us feel comfortably welcome. Self-check-in was so easy, directions clear and communication effortless. Theirs is a graciously appointed accommodation and a welcoming environment - a sweet bit of home away from home. The gracious care built into this private accommodation is visibly tangible, and every little something to make our stay comfortable was thoughtfully available.

Tracie and Bandit greeted us when we got there and showed us around. Had the cutest little touches (tip:turn off all the lights and only have the lighthouses on-very relaxing!) coffee, tea, snacks, water, a basket of toiletries in the bathroom and shampoo/conditioner (smells really good!) and body wash. You will not regret staying here."
2020-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was one of the best airbnb's I've stayed in.

Tracie had good advice for local attractions. I loved my time here!"

2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,What a great cozy cottage. The little touches like the lighthouses around the room that can light up at night and all the small things made a big difference.

We highly recommend this cottage to anyone that wants to experience such a luxurious stay. We felt spoiled and pampered.
2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Traci's place was perfect for our weekend getaway. It was beautifully decorated, comfortable and welcoming.

2022-11-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"We had a great stay at Lauren's place. It is located very conveniently off one of the main roads, close to numerous stores and restaurants, and only a 15 minute drive to my mom's place! We visited for Thanksgiving and were able to cook the full meal with everything provided. There are a ton of faux tupperware sets to store leftovers. There was tin foil, canola oil, S&P, other spices, coffee, etc. as well.
The house is very open and spacious, with the master suite across the living/dining rooms and separate from the other 2 rooms. There are remote-controlled ceiling fans in each bedroom and the living room. The air conditioning and heating system is efficient and life-saving (oh, the humidity in FL!). I'm from Northern CA and was shocked by the 81 degree weather during Thanksgiving week!
Check-in was a breeze. There is a 2-car garage with a remote garage door opener for your use. Check-out was easy too, without a bunch of tasks. (That always bothers me when I have to strip beds, etc. when I'm paying a cleaning fee, but Lauren doesn't require that! We only needed to empty garbage and run the dishwasher one last time.)"
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The house was clean, the communication was great and the location was central. Thank you Lauren!"

2024-04-01,5.0,Group trip,"We saw the great value from the time we arrived. All the comforts of home, everything we needed including cleaning products, washer/dryer, condiments for cooking, stocked kitchen, steam iron and board, I could go on. The place was impeccably clean. Comfy Adirondak seats on front and back porch and a fireplace for smores. There were lots of local cuisine restaurants, and a fabulous steak dinner at Texas Roadhouse just down the road. Convenient to Publix. We couldn't ask for more.
Lake City has an adorable historic downtown district and a wonderful country feel yet still has all the conveniences of any city. We spent one afternoon drifting down the crystal clear Ichetucknee Springs River, so relaxiing. It was just what the doctor ordered for Sunday after a wonderful wedding at the most beautiful outdoor wedding venue I've ever seen.
We highly recommend this home, and will definitely stay there again in the future. Thanks Abby and Steve!"

Perfect description of home and fully welcoming host and house.
Everything needed to feel at home was available. Last but not least the fireplace is Amazing!"
2023-12-01,5.0,Group trip,"Close enough to 75 that it’s super convenient while traveling. The house was just as the pictures showed. Nicely decorated to make you feel welcome and at home. Enough space for my family of 4 (with grown kids) that we could space out and have our privacy. They had great smelling cozy sheets and towels. They had little extra things available in case you forgot something (like my bar of soap).
Very responsive hosts and communicated quickly anytime I had a question. We will book again when we are in town again to visit my parents."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We could not have asked for a nicer place. Noah and family were friendly and welcoming. The house was clean and very comfortable. Having the pool right outside our door was a real bonus. Already booked it again for next year.

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My stay at Windswept Farm pool house was very nice. The location is perfect and peaceful.

It beats a Lake City hotel for sure!!"

I hope one day we can get back to stay.

2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We were traveling for work, and as a homeschooling family, it was great to have a home with all the basics to live life. Clean, stylish, and simple inside and plenty of yard space for my kids. we enjoyed the fire pit and starry sky at night. Erick answered any questions I had during our stay. The screened in porch was perfect for rainy days!
The kitchen was very clean and stocked with a great variety of spices for cooking. Other guests have left condiments in the refrigerator and other staples in the cabinet, which is very helpful. Overall a great place."

2023-10-01,3.0,Group trip,"Overall, our stay was great! We really enjoyed the overall feel of the home, decor, and the fully stocked fire pit! The home was in a quiet area and a nice getaway with friends. The cabinets and fridge had some staple groceries that I found were really convenient, considering Wal-mart is 15-20 mins away. They also had a good amount of cleaning supplies at our disposal.
some minor inconveniences would be that there was an iron but no ironing board, the motion lighting in the closet kept turning off, some sort of welcome package with things to do or local emergency numbers would have been a great touch, and the remotes to various fans and lights could have been labeled with what they go to.
Our greatest inconveniences would be that the master bed was really firm and uncomfortable, the water pressure was really low throughout the home, the pull out couch was dirty, we needed more shelving or dressers to put items on during our stay, and the water hose did not reach the fire pit."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This home was an amazing! We had four adults, three small children, and a toddler in our group and this place was the perfect fit. Everything about this house exceeded expectations. Even the pictures do not do it justice. Amazing nighttime views around the fire. Plenty of space for the kids to run around during the day in the safe and well-maintained yard. The updated house was pristine! When we needed to run into town it was less than a 12 minute drive to everything. We came for the Denmark Acres Fall Festival and we left with great memories that really center around this house. If you need to stay around Lake City, this is place has it all."

,,,"Be aware that Host will decide with out communication to lock Bedrooms of their choice, when even though you rented entire house. Very discouraging and shameful of Host to take this kind of action. Master Room and one guest room was locked for an elderly couple and Mother in-law. Mind you I paid for entire house ( service & cleaning fees with no discounts)."
