2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Kevin was VERY responsive. The home was nice and very clean. Room was very basic and plain. If all you're doing is stopping in for a sleep this is great. If I was staying for more than 1 night I would have liked to have a nightstand between the beds and maybe a small table in the corner with a chair or 2. Beds were soft (too soft for my husband but ok for me). Overall was great for a few hours of sleep.
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The beds were more comfortable than my bed at home, and the same goes for the shower. Would stay here again 10 times out of 10"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Beds were VERY comfortable. Space was very clean and it nice that there was a fridge in the room. Instructions were clear and easy to understand. Kevin was prompt in responding to our questions. We would definitely stay again and highly recommend.
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,They are pretty nice and understanding
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,The beds were super comfy and very clean. There are multiple guests there at a time but we had our own bathroom and felt like we had privacy as well. We had a great time!

2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Kevin's place was great for me and my friends as we needed a place to stay before going to the Grand Tetons. The room itself was clean, Kevin was very responsive, and the price was well worth it."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"It was a great place to stay! Super friendly, helpful hosts, and very clean and quiet!"

Recommend to everyone , really a great experience."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We loved our stay! Kevin was responsive, friendly and made the whole process easy. The location is great — a nice, quiet neighborhood with close access to restaurants and shopping.
Kevin’s place was clean and the mattresses were really comfortable. We appreciated that there were block-out curtains too. We slept really well.
With this being in the basement of a shared space, we did hear our upstairs neighbors during sleeping hours, but we simply turned on a white noise maker to resolve the issue.
Definitely recommend!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,The place is big- a large area for TV. The bedroom is big with 2 beds. Everything is pretty new. A very enjoyable stay. Note - it is down a set of stairs.
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"It's with the best accommodation we've ever stayed in.
Rooms are renovated, Kevin was always available for questions within seconds.
The kitchen has everything you need. The beds and linens are super comfy and there is a huge TV + fridge in the room.
The neighborhood is very safe and quiet.
We loved it so much that we booked one more night.
We can recommend this place to everyone!
Nico & Laura"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Really great place
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Definitely the BEST place I’ve stayed in a while. The single room had the most comfortable beds and carpet I’ve ever experienced at an AirBnB/Hotel (not exaggerating) and the hosts were seriously so accommodating and kind. I could not recommend this room ENOUGH. I’m so glad we chose to crash here instead of anywhere else.
The room had it’s own locked door and private bathroom and the house was super quiet! The blinds kept the room super dark and the brand new TV had everything you could need!
Side Note: We were headed to a wedding the next morning and the hosts proactively offered to go BUY an iron early in the morning if we needed one. They seriously went above and beyond in every way."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Thank you so much for hosting us even we arrived late at night.

2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Jay and Sandra were so friendly and welcoming. We loved staying in their home and meeting them. We especially appreciated the yummy, healthy breakfast we shared with them at their kitchen table. We would definitely stay with them again!"

2023-09-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a big room and great hosts with whom we had interesting conversations. We could do our laundry there and use the kitchen that was great. However, the bathroom could be a bit cleaner. The location of the house is very good."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Great place, Jay and Sandra were very friendly. good place to stay just as describe on pictures, safe area. I recommend their place."
2023-09-01,3.0,Stayed one night,"Space is small to share with people you don't know. Could hardly turn around in the bathroom. Did say we could use the bathroom upstairs, but felt like it was their space. No refrigerator, microwave or coffee pot to use. Needs to be a table between the twin beds. No fan but could open the window for fresh air. He did invite us to breakfast at 9a but we chose to get on the road."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The room is very clean and comfortable, and will stay again next time."

It was fun to learning about their humanitarian travels and adventures. We ended up arriving late and they were more than accommodating.

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Jay and Sandra welcomed us to their house and made us feel comfortable. They let us use their kitchen and refrigerator to store our food. The space was very clean and location was super convenient. Walmart is 15 mints drive and nearest gas station is like 5 minutes distance. good overall location to explore SE Idaho and NPs in Wyoming. The bathroom is shared and shower is bit tiny but it's doable.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Good host and accommodated us checking in late.
2023-07-01,3.0,Stayed one night,We never stayed there. Their internet was done and were unable to get in touch with them.

2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Great hosts, clean bathroom and nice bedroom. I recommend!"
2023-06-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Cons: Jay and Sandra were slow to respond on the AirBNB app and their phone number listed was incorrect. I arrived plenty after the check-in time and the hosts were not home. Typically, this isn’t an issue with most AirBNBs as most tend to have a keypad lock, but this one was a regular lock to which we had no key for access until after we were let in. I was not aware of this situation before check-in. I messaged the hosts an hour and a half prior to arrival as well.
Pros: Jay and Sandra were very welcoming, and the breakfast they offered was delicious (especially the strawberry jam). The bed was *very* comfortable!"

2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This Airbnb was great. Jay and Sandra are extremely lovely people and very helpful. They also offered us breakfast and ate with us. Their place is also very clean and in good location. Beautiful people, beautiful place. thanks"
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Very kind people. Very accomodating. Very clean. The place matched their description. My one complaint, and I am sure it was an oversight is that they baked homemade bread and didn't offer me a warm slice out of the oven. ;)"
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Jay and Sandra were awesome hosts. Wouldn't mind staying again.
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Lovely place, lovely people"
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Great hosts! Very friendly and helpful! The breakfast they made was delicious and nutritious ❤️ we have stayed with them twice and they are always very accommodating and gracious!
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Jay and Sandra have a beautiful home in a beautiful snowy neighborhood! We enjoyed our stay there even though we pretty much just slept & showered there! It was clean and the bed was comfortable and the room was big! The bathroom was small but clean and served our needs adequately! Would definitely recommend!
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Jay and Sandra were wonderful hosts. The space they offered was clean, warm, (it was 5 degrees outside), and very peaceful.
The bed was very comfortable and my husband and I slept like babies. Would definitely come again."
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Jay and Sandra are delightful. They were very accommodating and very kind. Jay even ran outside the morning we left to scrape the frost off my windshield for me! I would stay with them again any time.
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Nice accommodations. Nice couple.
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,I took my daughter to check out BYU-Idaho for a month. Jay and Sandra were the nicest hosts. The place was clean. We were able to do laundry and there was workout equipment we could use. We loved the convenience and how close they were to the school. It was very affordable which is a big plus. I would stay with them again if we were to visit there again. Thanks for the memories.
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Very comfy place and great warmth!
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Loved how close it was to campus! The only downside(s) I have was that the single beds were pretty loud when you would move. The bathroom was also a little small. However, the bedroom was a great size - very spacious!
With that being said, I would definitely stay here again. I would also recommend to anybody who is needing a place to stay close to campus. Very clean and cozy home. Great price too!"
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"such friendly , kind people . It was comfy and so close to the college."

2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"First of all this is a beautiful home in a lovely neighborhood. Spotlessly clean, wonderful communication with the host who were to be out when we arrived, private room with bathroom in a private area of the home, and delightful, down to earth, really enjoyable hosts.
The area of the home we had was extremely large with a wonderful comfortable bed. There is a large seating area with even an area for children to play. This was perfect for us as a couple but would be a wonderful home for a family too.
This would be a home and hosts we would love to stay at their home whenever in Rexburg."
2022-09-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,Everything was as expected except the bathroom. It was very small and had a sour smell. The towels were especially bad. The hosts were very kind and accommodating.
2022-09-01,4.0,Stayed one night,Perfect description of place as written in the ad. We booked because instabook was available…. But unfortunately Jay and Sandra were out and didn’t check their texts or calls from us so the house was dark upon our 830 pm arrival- tgey arrived around 915 when we informed them of who we were! . I think this is a one off for them- and other than that it was so perfect for us to have the extra beds in room etc! This was our first time using instabook and likely won’t again… but would return to this room!
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Jay and Sandra are amazing host! they were very accommodating and The space was comfortable, clean, and was perfect for our stay.
Definitely would reccomend to anyone visiting Rexburg."

I loved staying there"
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We had a very nice stay, Jay and Sandra are lovely and the room is big anf comfortable !"
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Rexburge is a very beautiful town, and it is located within a reasonable distance from Yellowstone and Teton Park, therefore Jay and Sandra's house provides a good stop for those who want to visit those places. The host has made our stop at their home very pleasant and easy. The room is clean and all facilities are easy to access. I would like to thanks them for allowing us to stay there."
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"If you come into Jay and Sandra’s home you directly feel welcome. I had an great stay here and the breakfast they made was more than delicious and truly American!
Would absolutely recommend staying here if you wanna be close to campus and be in a nice and safe neighborhood."

2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This clean and pleasant home has plenty of room, a kind and attentive couple who will try to meet your specific needs and provide great breakfasts, and is in a safe neighborhood. It id close to campus and within a reasonable distance from Idaho Falls, Yellowstone, Jackson Hole, and the Tetons. We will definitely stay here again, as our children attend BYU-Idaho."
2022-08-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,Cozy place to stay.
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Very nice hosts. Nice place. Nice neighborhood close to campus. We've stayed in some other AirBnB basement rentals which have had separate entries and doors that separated the basement from the upstairs so we kind of assumed that going in. However there wasn't a separate entry for us nor a door that separates the basement area from the upstairs. The host also mentioned there was another lady renting one of the other bedrooms there in the basement and that we probably wouldn't see her - and we didn't. So not quite the same feeling of privacy as we've had with other basement rentals. Again, a very pleasant place to stay with warm and gracious hosts."
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Great stay, very polite. Nice area. Reminded me of my grandparent's home+"

2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"A nice, quiet neighborhood. Perfect for the price. Had a very relaxing sleep. Would stay here again, for sure. Thank you!"
2022-07-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"The room was comfortable and spacious with a bathroom right next to it. The hosts were nice, polite, and helpful, though at the same time they asked some odd questions and seemed slightly suspicious of us, which felt uncomfortable. They were kind to let us use their kitchen and store food in the fridge as well as do laundry. The house is large and new and located in a nice neighborhood. The location has convenient access to Yellowstone and Grand Teton National Parks, about 2 hours away from each, and is a great place to stay without paying the high prices of the gateway communities. The room was clean, and though the cleanliness of the kitchen and bathroom suffered a bit, it was OK. Overall it was great value for the price."
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Clean place, quick communication, very nice people!"
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Jay and Sandra were very welcoming and accommodating hosts. I checked in very late and they were nothing but helpful. Room was clean and spacious, and we had the entire lower level to ourselves. Unfortunately I overslept, or else I would’ve loved to join them for breakfast. I will definitely stay again next time I visit Yellowstone and Grand Teton!"

2022-05-01,3.0,Stayed one night,"Location is amazing,
Sandra and Jay were very kind to offer breakfast
Place was clean
We found beds to be uncomfortable, smaller ones wobble a-lot.
Although it was a shared unit, the bathroom had no locks and had ants moving around.
The room is in the basement.
The only way to checkin is to call Jay.
Response on airbnb messaging platform was negligible.
Reading reviews one can definitely say that Jay and Sandra are very kind people. The host came to the room to ask for breakfast without any notice..although the gesture was great but we got little scared with no sense of privacy.
I cannot deny that Jay and Sandra are amazing people , and i hope the feedback is taken constructively."
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Jay and Sandra were wonderful hosts! They were very thoughtful and kind and made our stay very nice!

The beds were comfortable and their home was very clean. They prepared a tasty breakfast for us, including toast made with homemade wheat bread and apricot freezer jam. They even grind their own flour! Their home is just a few short minutes away from the Rexburg Temple which was the reason for our visit. Jay and Sandra were very quick to respond to the questions I had before our trip regarding road conditions in the area in the winter. They were gracious hosts and we will definitely stay with them the next time we’re in town!"

2021-02-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"Our preference is an unshared space, but for the price of Jay's and Sandra's place, and the absolutely amazing breakfast, you won't find a place you'll like better. They are thorough and thoughtful hosts who do all they can to assure your privacy and comfort."

2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I would have to agree with all the past reviews...Jay and Sandra are delightful! We had such an enjoyable stay with them. And as so many others have commented, the breakfast was the highlight of the stay! Not just the most delicious food each morning, but the chance to become acquainted with Sandra and Jay and the other guests. That feel of a true bed and breakfast that is no longer so available. The wheat was freshly ground the morning of our first breakfast to make delicious whole wheat blueberry muffins. Eggs and sausage. Fresh fruit. Whole wheat bread. Just such a treat!
The location is fantastic! I don’t think I could have found a better location. Just a few minutes from the temple and the university. Plenty of parking. Located on a quiet, pretty street. Our room was great! Exactly what we needed! I am so pleased to have discovered Sandra and Jay and their home. I hope to stay here often in the future. Thank you!!"

2020-01-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Jay and Sandra were great. Very nice people and kind hosts. Our schedule didn’t allow us to enjoy Sandras breakfast but I bet it’s delicious. The place was clean and everything worked. We loved playing their beautiful piano. Something to remember is you do have a space to yourself but if you want to cook or anything you’ll use their kitchen. All in all they were great hosts.
2020-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,A lovely couple and home
2019-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Our stay with Jay and Sandra was quiet and comfortable. The neighborhood is close to BYUI and the room and bed were comfortable. Jay invited us to eat breakfast with them and it felt like home with nutritious food to start our day.

2019-08-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,"It’s a lovely old couple, whit interesting conversation during the breakfast that they prepare, little disappointing for me though after all I have read about, but I’m sure they always do their best, ..."
2019-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,A nice experience.
2019-07-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"The room is actually one of the two rooms in the basement.When I checked in, the other room was occupied by an American mother with her children, and it felt a little strange that they would pass my door when they went in and out.And the door is not locked, not steady!But this is the custom in the United States, the door inside the house is not locked.
The two families share a bathroom, and the bathroom is small and poor, although the owner offers to use the bathroom upstairs, I think that it is basically not used.
The owner is a Mormon, provides breakfast and participates in their prayer ceremony, as a tourist or a good experience, the owner also sent a book about Mormonism as a gift."
2019-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Jay and Sandra are very nice people. Room is nice and clean and has its own privacy down stairs. Breakfast with family was super!

Mr Jay and Sandra are very kind!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great place. Clean, plenty of space and very peaceful neighborhood. Used it as a stopover point in our way to yellow stone and Grand Teton. Reasonable driving time to both. The host was very responsive to any queries and checkin/checkout was very smooth. One thing to improve is that the listing states a maximum of 8 people but if you have more than 6, you will need spare bedding/linen. There was a 20$ charge per person (after 6 people) which wasn’t on the listing."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,Kaitlyn was amazing and it worked perfect for us
2024-04-01,5.0,Group trip,.

We were moving our student near the college campus and we were within walking distance to her apartment and could actually see her place. It was very convenient being close and having a home base near everything.
It was very clean and we really enjoyed our stay. We had most everything we needed right there in the house. Check in was very clear and easy, and communicated when we checked in. We will definitely be looking to see if Kaitlyn's place is available when we go back to visit!"

Kaitlyn was so great about 3 parking passes since we were all coming from different locations. Would definitely stay here again!
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great host! Condo is close to campus as it used to be student apartments. Comfortably converted for groups with couples by putting king beds in two of the rooms. Not extravagant, but very comfortable. Would stay again!"

2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The only 2 things I could change is the shower heads weren’t the greatest and sprayed everywhere and there wasn’t scrubber or sponge for dishes. But still would give it a 5 star. Great price and great location. We will stay there again for sure!

2023-07-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"Great spot, Kaitlyn was great and the condo was perfect for our family. My only gripe and this is completely out of kaitlyns control is that the condo was quite noisy at night as this is student approved housing. I was unaware of this when I booked the place with our 2 kids under 3! Outside of that great experience."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We felt right at home! There was enough space for my whole family as well as the amenities to cook at home or warm up the frozen fare we tend towards when traveling. Kaitlyn was very friendly and responsive. Check-in and check-out expectations were very clear and concise.
2023-07-01,5.0,Group trip,"Very comfortable beds and pretty well equipped kitchen! (Needs a potato masher). It would have been nice to have a selection of coffee for the Krueg coffee maker! Overall all we were happy with the space! I would like a recliner couch or chair!
Eating area is ok for 4 people!

Walking distance to some great restaurants (be sure to check out Righteous Slice pizzeria), Porter Park, and BYUi Campus. We would definitely stay here again! For those not familiar with Porter Park, it is a great city park featuring toys and a really great splash pad for younger children. It also has a walking path, tennis and basketball courts, and even a carousel (all activities free except a small cost for the carousel). Be aware that the unit we stayed in is located on the third floor, but there is a nice elevator in the central part of the complex if needed for getting heavier bags, etc. up to the third floor."

2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay! Very clean and inviting. The only thing that was a little odd was the bathroom situation.

2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Lucky find in the heart of Rexburg. The Townhouse was exactly as shown in photos. There were plenty of linens, and the kitchen was well stocked with everything needed to prepare meals. Easy in and out parking spots and the area was very quiet. We hope this is available during our next day in Rexburg!"

2023-08-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"When we arrived, the main floor window a/c was no longer working and the kitchen/living room were very warm.

Before long, the main floor was cool & enjoyable.
Excellent service, we thoroughly enjoyed our stay!"

2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,nothing to say but stunning we loved it
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Our stay was great! We had a hard time finding extra blankets but it was too late to contact the host. Still not sure where they are kept. Also, the listing says a/c unit. While there is an A/C unit, it is in the playroom only and doesn’t cool the entire house. When we arrived the temp in the house was 80 degrees with no way to cool it. There are fans in the house and Rexburg cools off nicely in the evenings so we were able to get the temp down to 72 overnight, luckily. There is plenty of room in this house for a large group- more so than I expected from the photos."

The house stayed comfortable even though temps outside were around 100 degrees. Loved it!"
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Great large space and yard nice and quiet in a rural location.
2022-08-01,5.0,Group trip,"The home was in the middle of the country. Calm quiet setting close to nature. Close enough to visit Yellowstone, grand Tetons, and Craters of the moon NP. Would definitely book it again. Very spacious."
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We started in the house for one night on our way to Yellowstone. Wished we could stay for much longer!

2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Totally amazing stay! I don’t even know where to start! It is the most picturesque Airbnb we’ve stayed at so far. Just gorgeous! First thing my kids did was jump out to visit the horses. Then to the swings surrounding the fire. The owner lives next door and was extremely accommodating. He treated us like family, it was so cool! The lock was easy to use, and taking shoes off wasn’t a big deal since everything was easily accessible once you entered the house. Plenty of beds for the whole family. And they were so comfy! The downstairs family room and upstairs family/Rec room were all perfect size for our family reunion get togethers. It almost felt like the owners decorated and set up this house just for us! It felt like home! Piano, rocking chair, a place for everyone to spend time with who they wanted to. Just enough TVs. The kitchen was a little small for all of us, but we took it outside and that was so perfect sitting under the stars with twinkle lights above and fire in the middle as we swayed on the swings. I loved that the kids could play games upstairs and the adults could play games downstairs. So yeah, I hope we get to come again!"
2022-07-01,5.0,Group trip,Great location with an AMAZING firepit area! The kids loved the very friendly horses right over the fence. Lots of lawn space for yard games!
2022-06-01,5.0,Group trip,We had an amazing time. We were disappointed that we didn't have more time to stay and enjoy the property and house as we were in Jackson Hole and Yellowstone for most of our stay. There is more room than expected and everything was extremely clean. We look forward to visiting again.
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This is a really nice beautiful home and location for anyone but is super for large families. It's beautifully decorated with a lot of rooms and space for people to sit and visit kids to play in the play room and 3 bathrooms! Kitchen to cook in to save money on your trip. Big yard with fire pit, hammocks and seat swings. It was awesome!!"
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,The Rexburg house was awesome! Close enough to Yellowstone and Tetons and an added bonus of the St Anthony Sand Dunes! House was spacious for three families with eight kids total. They had a blast there! Such a comfy and cozy home that had everything we could possibly need!
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This property was gorgeous, and way closer to the sand dunes than we expected. Had plenty of parking for all of our trailers. The cupboards were all well stocked and lots of gathering space to socialize. Had a few kids riding 4 wheelers around the lawn but that wasn’t a bother! Loved this property!"
2022-06-01,5.0,Group trip,"Great house in a great location. Very clean and spacious house. It is situated at the half way point between Yellowstone national park and Grand teton national park. Will stay again if I visit Yellowstone.
Sam is a very great host and very accomodating."

2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We are a large family and it was great to have a large home that everyone could have a bed. The kids loved the game room and living room spacious to play other games. Lots of seating couches very comfortable. Several meeting areas, beds comfortable, lots of bowls, plates, cups, pots, frying pan, crockpot, cookie sheets, pizza pans, food holders for leftovers. Very equipped home towels, shampoo, conditioner. 15 minutes from any store. I will definitely stay here again."
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"The Country House is such a beautiful place! We loved that we felt secluded without being far from Rexburg and other attractions we wanted to visit! Everything was clean, neat, cozy, and comfortable. Lots of space to spread out, to play, to relax, to enjoy, and really nice comfortable beds! The hosts are so kind. They are good to respond quickly and we loved that check in and check out were super simple! The Country House really made our vacation perfect! We'll definitely be back!"
2021-12-01,5.0,Group trip,Great Place. Our family had tons of fun and loved the location.
2021-12-01,5.0,Group trip,"This was a wonderful place to stay. Everything we needed was there including shower supplies. We had 16 stay there and we were completely comfortable. The teens especially enjoyed the ping pong and basketball game. We couldn't get our heat to work and Sam, the owner, came right away to fix it. He was very friendly and welcoming. We will go back again if we are in that area."
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Huge! Nice location to Rexburg. Beautiful grounds. Super large space for us. We really enjoyed it.
2021-12-01,5.0,Group trip,"We absolutely loved our stay! Great house. We loved all the space we had, plenty of room and a very nice yard. The game room was very fun! The beds were all very nice and comfortable, good pillows and linens. Everything felt very clean and comfortable. Would 100% recommend and will be back to stay again."
2021-11-01,5.0,Group trip,"Sam's home was exactly what our family needed. plenty of space for a huge family, all the indoor amenities of a modern house, great water pressure, reclining sofas and every bed was comfortable! Although the location is a couple miles into the country it's also only a couple miles from the north end of town, Wal-Mart, the Teton River, Henry's Fork River, and not far from the Salmon River! It's also conveniently located from restaurants, fast food and BYU-I.
The Rexburg Temple is an easy 20 min drive, which was good for our wedding group. It eased some of the stress I had about getting everyone to my daughter's wedding.
Sam's house is clean and he doesn't ask tenants to do much cleanup beyond sheets, towels, kitchen messes and any blood on the walls after a fierce ping pong tournament!!! (Just teasing, my adult brothers behaved at ping pong while their kids tried to catch chickens!)
The kitchen has plenty of space for prep, cooking and eating and has the cooking equipment we needed for cooking breakfast for 30 and other smaller meals.
We're glad that we found Sam's listing, but my 4 sisters got upset that we 6 brothers were discussing a return trip to fish the local waters! So, the next trip to Sam's may be a family reunion when the weather is warm and we can enjoy the excellent grill patio and amazing firepit!
Thank you, Sam! We hope to see you again.
To all y'all looking, I highly recommend it!"
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This is a great place to stay. If you ever have the opportunity to stay, my whole family recommends the country house. A well maintained space with lots of space for a large group. Would love to stay there if we’re ever in Rexburg again."
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"very clean and roomy, everything was decorated super adorable, lots of room for everyone, comfortable beds wide doorways and stairs were very nice. Love the Gazebo and patio area, wish we were spending more time here to enjoy it all."

2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"The country home is perfect for large families or friends to gather. The kitchen is very well equipped even a few seasonings, blender and small mixer.

The hosts were very accommodating with a great location!"

2021-09-01,5.0,Group trip,"This is my new favorite place to be! Spacious, peaceful, clean and good beds!!"
2021-09-01,5.0,Group trip,This place is amazing. It’s so close to Henry’s Fork and the Teton River. It’s not too far away from Yellowstone and Jackson Hole. The house is equipped with all the amenities you can possibly need. It’s very relaxing and very spacious. It is only a few minutes away from town which is convenient. I would definitely recommend this beautiful place to anyone looking for a beautiful getaway.
2021-09-01,5.0,Group trip,"This was the perfect house for a large group and only 10 minutes away from the day use area at St. Anthony’s. We loved the game room and fire pit, plus the basics provided in the kitchen/bathroom/ laundry, it really had everything you need for a great trip!"
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This was a nice place in the country, so green, and the chickens and horses were nice to see. It was also nice to have well water to drink. The owner is also very patriotic and has inspirational sayings all over the house. We loved it! The fire pit was the bomb with the hammocks and swings. We had the best flame broiled hamburgers! Suggestion: bring your own wood, or an axe to chop some huge logs they already have there, so they will burn. Also bring a grate with legs if you want to BBQ over the fire. The house is great for kids with a ping pong table and basketball game and 2 tv’s! Also there is lots of lawn to run around on, enough to play soccer on if you have enough players. There are 2 big very friendly dogs who bark at anything passing by, giving plenty of protection, so nothing will bother you at night. Definitely recommend!"
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Such a wonderful place to stay! Very clean and very nice hosts! A great country house! Definitely reccomend to others!

The location was peaceful. Our city grandchildren loved seeing the horses and chickens and gathering around the fire in the evening. Some family favorites were the hammocks and the ping-pong table. The host was friendly and welcoming."
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We really liked the stay at Sam's place. It is a cute little place on his farm and our kids had lots of fun petting horses, chasing chickens. It is quite a bit of drive around 1.5hour each way if you are staying there to visit Yellowstone. So be prepared for the daily drive."
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Great experience! A lot of room, and Sam was always quick to get back to us. Great experience!"

2021-07-01,5.0,Group trip,"Wow. I didn’t think it was possible to pull off a wedding reception luncheon on the grass outside in Rexburg, far away from where we live or any family our friends support, but this place and Sam made this possible for us. Everything was beautiful and peaceful and the weather worked out, and the house was a great gathering place for our family to come. The fire pit area we enjoyed the last night is just such a great place to be & hang out together. The upstairs game room is also a great gathering place, and we enjoyed playing games there together. Any question or concern was quickly answered, and Sam bent over backwards to make our stay as comfortable as possible. I can do nothing but recommend this place highly."
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,This was perfect for our size of family. We used to live in this area almost 20 years ago. Staying here brought back a lot of peaceful memories of the simple life in Idaho. Having the room to run around on the property for the grandkids was a big plus! We will most likely be back again!
2021-07-01,5.0,Group trip,"This place is fabulous! We had such a short stay as this was just a place to lay our heads for the night. Now I'm kicking myself for not making it a longer stay. The place is huge, super clean, has a fun game room, tons of nice, comfy beds. It is a little off the beaten path, yet a short drive to everything in town. The exterior looks like a big barn. So much charm! I can't wait to return!"

The surrounding property provided so much fun space for our kids to run around, play night games, run races, play frisbee, while the adults could just relax and talk. The indoor basketball and ping pong table also provided so much fun when it was a little hot outside. Wonderful and kind hosts that went about and beyond. We’d love to come back!"

2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This is a great place to stay in Rexburg. Sean was more than accommodating for us and our local college students who hung out there all day while snowed in.

2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We needed to make a last-minute trip to Rexburg and Sean’s place was a top recommendation. I had a few questions before booking and Sean was incredibly responsive and understanding.
The place is incredible! Even better than the photos. Super clean, incredible scent, and very welcoming. It’s also bigger than you’d think from the photos. Checking in and out was simple and easy as well.
I completely recommend Sean’s place for anyone making a trip to Rexburg and the surrounding areas. You will not regret it."
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Sean is one of the best hosts I’ve ever dealt with through Airbnb. Had one minor challenge and he went above and beyond to exceed expectations.

2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great space, wish we could have spent more time there. Check-in was easy and we loved the convenience of 1.5 bathrooms, laundry, and full kitchen. The neighborhood is quiet, with easy access to the highway and restaurants. Good location to explore Grand Teton and Yellowstone for a much more reasonable price than the resort towns."

2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We are a regular Airbnb travelers and would rate Sean’s place as one of the nicest, best located, and real value of all the places we have stayed. Each Tempur Pedic bed in each bedroom provided an amazing night's sleep after a long day. The place was practically new, very clean, modern, had everything we needed to feel at home, and was easy to get to all the area restaurants and stores. Communication with Sean was great too. We would highly recommend this wonderful apartment that is located in a safe and quiet location."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"It was very clean, well equipped, and comfortable. Very spacious for the price. It’s in a residential neighborhood with lots of parks and playgrounds within a short walk, just a few blocks. The main street, called ‘Main Street’ is also a short walk away, or drive. As you’d expect, lot’s of stores, shops, restaurants are on Main Street. Though not a bustling metropolis, it is a pleasant place with plenty of options."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We had a wonderful stay. The place was large and beautifully decorated and very comfortable.

We went to visit our daughter who is in college and wanted a place where we could eat dinner and play games together, this was perfect! Couches are super comfy, plenty of fresh, clean towels. Sidewalks and walkways were clean from snow and ice, parking was great. Would definitely stay here again! Thank you!"
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The location is close to the freeway and BYUI. It is easy to check-in and out. Very clean. Couches were really comfortable. Tastefully decorated. They kept the drive and stairs to the apartment cleared of snow. Beds were okay, mattresses and pillows aren't supportive. Kitchen is fairly well stocked; oil, herbs, pots, pans, etc. They need to add pepper to their seasonings. They have a coffee/tea/hot cocoa maker, too bad the hot cocoa only had 3 packets, so we were shy one and only had it for the first day, but it was a nice thought. Quality of dishes are mostly good. The first night was really quiet and it felt like we were alone even though the hosts live upstairs. The second evening, we could hear various noises upstairs; walking around, dropping things, and other sounds. Overall it was a good experience and we would stay here again."
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"everything looked good, we had a good experience!"
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The place was awesome, it had everything you would need. Furnishings were great, and it was very close to our sons place. I would recommend it all my family and friends."

2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Sean was attentive to our needs and with just a simple text he was there to help us figure things out.

2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This home is a wonderful place to really see Rexburg and BYUI!

We will definitely be back!"

2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"The house was very clean! The check in/out process was very easy with clear instructions up front. Loved the privacy with the entrance being on the back side of the house. We found the neighborhood and house to be very quiet, and never heard noise from the main house. The house was stocked with towels and dishes, which was very appreciated for our week stay. The bed and couches were quite comfortable and there was plenty of storage for clothing and toiletry items, so we felt right at home. Overall, our stay was great and I would highly recommend staying here."
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great stay and awesome communication.
2022-09-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Unit updated, nice, and accomodating, with a good location and good price. Would use again for sure when visiting our son at BYU Idaho. Our only surprise was we had no idea this was a basement of another home, so that was quite a shock when we arrived. Not a problem, just something we would have preferred to have known upfront."
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great place, close to everything, clean and private!"
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Everything you want from an Airbnb! Just book it.

Everything went very smoothly and I would definitely stay there again"
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Sean is an amazing host. He got back to us quickly with all of our questions. And the place was amazing.
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Great place! It was very clean! The beds and couches were extremely comfortable. I love that there was a washer and dryer since our baby often needs an outfit change during the day. Perfect if you want to travel to Yellowstone or the Tetons. I would 100% stay here again.

2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great value. Costs about same as a hotel but 3 times the space and all the amenities or a house. Great value
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We have stayed in a number of Airbnb properties in Rexburg and without a doubt, this is our favorite. The location is convenient, the amenities were excellent, and it was clean and comfortable. Kudos."
2022-07-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"We loved staying at Sean’s place! It’s such a comfortable, homey, charming place and a great deal! His place is in a safe neighborhood, & we felt right at home! Be aware that it is a basement dwelling, & it can get quiet noisy during the day due to all the upstairs commotion. If you have napping toddlers, it might not be the best fit for you. Everything quieted down every night at nine, but it was quiet noisy before that. We didn’t mind & realized that was probably why his place was such a steal! We’d definitely stay there, again!"
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Eye easy check-in, very comfortable couches, relaxing stay."
2022-07-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"We enjoyed our stay! the home overall was clean and the neighborhood was conveniently located and quiet.
I would say, I think the people upstairs have little kiddos that run back and forth all day until around 8-830pm - which wasn't an issue for us as our 1 year old can sleep through literally anything and it stopped at a decent hour.
but if you have littles who have issues with taking naps or have an earlier bedtime and may have an issue with banging- be aware.
The array of k-cups and creamers was nice and so was having plates for kiddos !
One bed is basic and another is memory foam I believe. it's a very cute little duplex!
We would stay again!!"
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The perfect place to stay in Rexburg. Everything is close and the place is spacious, clean and in a quiet neighborhood. We'll definitely want to stay here again!"

2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This was the perfect stopover between our visit to Yellowstone one day, and Grand Teton National Park the next.

2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Sean’s place was clean and comfortable. It has all you would expect from an airbnb. appliances seemed to be new and very very clean. laundry room had all you would expect and it was very clean.
This place is a basement in a quiet neighborhood. Sean has lights and cameras in the driveway that makes you feel just fine when you leave your car outside. We could occasionally hear footsteps upstairs and see some bugs but it didn’t bother us."
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place! Very clean and very comfy!
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Sean's place was perfect for our visit to Rexburg! All of the amenities that you would expect with an Air BNB, and then some.

I would highly recommend Sean's place when visiting Rexburg!"

2022-06-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Clean, comfortable and convenient location. The only downside is that you can hear the upstairs people, which is understandable since it's a basement apartment. Would stay there again.!"
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Sean's place is amazing! It was a great base camp to see both Yellowstone and GTNP. Sean was a great host and answered all our questions with a quickness . The place has everything you could possibly need and it is immaculate. Recommend 100% and if I'm in the area again will certainly try and book Sean's.
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The airbnb was beautiful, spacious and has all the necessary ammenities! It's in a very nice neighbourhood as well!
The host, Sean, was super responsive and helpful the entire time!! This airbnb was 100% worth it! Book it before it gets snagged up!"
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Great place!! Clean, quite and check in was smooth!"
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Convenient location and it has all the amenities. The neighborhood has lots of playgrounds and feels safe. You can definitely hear the hosts upstairs but they were very quiet most of the time. I would definitely stay again.
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is a very nice basement apartment in a house in a quiet neighborhood. We loved the layout and the amenities. The appliances seemed very new and everything was very clean and comfortable. I thought the beds were very comfortable. We could occasionally hear footsteps upstairs but it didn’t bother us. Each bedroom has its own temperature controller and also a separate one near the dining table, so it was nice to be able to set the temperature the way you like it. The fan for the heater in the bedroom with the bathroom was a little bit loud but not too bad—definitely better than the ones that are usually in hotel rooms. The laundry room is also set up like a second bathroom with a toilet, sink and vanity. We really enjoyed each having our own bathroom during our stay. The shower has really good water pressure and a nice shower head but it doesn’t have a way to adjust the volume of water. It’s either on or off and you turn the handle from cold to hot. There were 2 of us and I showered second every morning and ran out of hot water at the very end of my shower (but I like long showers). Just plan accordingly if staying with a bigger group. Overall it is a great place and I would like to stay there again!"
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Loved it. Value was great and everything was super clean
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Wonderful stay! 10/10 would most definitely recommend! It was a cute little basement apartment feel and made it really easy to be able to stay and relax and Cook your own food in the kitchen. And the whole process was super easy! Very happy I found this place, will most definitely stay again"
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Exactly as described. Immaculately clean, comfortable beds, I could hear that there were people upstairs sometimes but the sound insulation worked really well. Great location, too. Sean responded very quickly with any questions and was extremely accommodating. 10/10 would recommend."
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Lovely, convenient place to stay! Our family really enjoyed the layout. Stocked well with kitchen essentials. Off road parking! Can hear the upstairs tenants sometimes. Would stay here again."
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I hesitate to give a great review because I want to keep this one to myself! Close to campus, clean, updated, plenty of space. The door lock gives you a little trouble, but once you understand it it works fine. It was a great cozy apartment with all the amenities you'd need."
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Very cozy and comfortable place. We got a feel like home with a lot of amenities. Very well maintained. If you don't mind a long drive to West Yellowstone (1.5 hrs), this is the place to stay.
Sean is an awesome host and very communicative. Definitely recommend for families!"
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was a great place to stay. It was clean and very comfortable. The GPS lead is to the wrong side of the street, so thankfully the house was well marked with the address. Sean gave us easy check in and check out directions. We hope to stay here again."

We really enjoyed our stay. Highly recommend."
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This basement duplex is very clean and modern with lots of space. My husband and I traveled with our toddler and baby and we're very comfortable. All appliances and up to date. Supplies did feel a bit bare minimum, but the essentials were covered. This place is well maintained and we would stay there again!"
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Sean did an amazing job making a basement feel like you’re in a regular house! Spacious, stocked, clean, and comfortable! I would literally recommend it for any sort of small group- couple, family, friends. Go there yourself ASAP to check it out!"
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This place is wonderful!!! It was SPOTLESS, and cozy.
Sean was great to work with. We had a family wedding. I asked Sean if my married children could get ready for the wedding at our place, (they had a later check in for their place) Sean was very nice and let them get ready there.
The real nice part l, after the wedding and being tired we were ready for bed. The bed sheets, were amazing. So soft and clean. We would stay here again for sure."
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Sean’s place was great! Rexburg is a good homebase if you’re trying to see Big Sky, Yellowstone, Grand Tetons, and Jackson Hole. We had a very comfortable stay and Sean’s home had all the amenities you would need including washer and dryer. Sean was also very responsive if we ever needed to text him. The house is in a quiet neighborhood which we appreciated since we were also working during our trip. I recommend staying at Sean’s!"

2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Such a great property! Very roomy and open for being a basement. Everything was very new, clean, and in great shape. We appreciated all of the amenities and fully stocked kitchen. Will definitely be staying here again if ever in Rexburg."
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place is newly updated, beautiful, fully stocked, and very clean. We loved having this place to enjoy at the end of each day that we visited Yellowstone. The drive to Yellowstone was not bad for us. The neighborhood is very safe and comfortable. This is a great deal and we will certainly stay again if in the area."

2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Exactly as described, very clean and neat. Fully equipped with everything that would be needed for a short or long stay.

2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,While our stay here was short it was very pleasant! It was exactly how it is listed out to be and very comfortable. We got in earlier than we originally planned and Sean was able to have the place ready for us in time. Then an emergency came up and we cut our stay short and he was very understanding and accommodating for that as well! I very much recommend staying here and will again if I’m ever in the area again!
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,This place was perfect! I stayed for a couple of weeks and it was great! The place was great for accommodating long-term stays. The location was amazing in a great neighborhood! I would definitely stay here again.

2024-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This was our first stay with an Airbnb, so we were nervous, but couldn't have been happier with the experience. The house was exactly as described, and we even got a surprise Harry Potter room that wasn't shown when we booked the stay. The only thing that would have made this stay better is if we could have stayed longer!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Great weekend! Everything was perfect! Jenna was on top of everything! Will be back.

2023-08-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"Had a great stay, sand dunes were close to location, lots of nice restaurants close by. Home was very nice, quiet location, had everything we needed. Only con would be its way too bright in the morning as the blinds/ curtains let a lot of light through."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a really good time at Joshua’s place while visiting the area. Very nicely appointed and beautiful house with lots of amenities, comfortable, well organized, the kitchen is fully equipped and the location is very central. Very thoughtful attention to the guests with coffee and snacks provided. Joshua was very responsive."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Joshua was a great host and his property was super quaint and sweet. Super clean/spacious for what we expected, well stocked kitchen that included: spices, coffee, hot cocoa, mixing bowls, griddle, skillet, etc.. Laundry room was stocked with detergent & dryer sheets. Showers stocked with nice shampoo, conditioner, and body wash. Everything about the house was pleasant. ONLY complaints were that we were unaware the house was a duplex. Apparently the basement is an apartment unit. Nobody was there when we stayed but we would have liked to know that prior to booking. Especially considering the door to the basement unit apartment was in the primary bedroom and locked from the basement side—not ours, which left us feeling a bit uneasy just because it’s after-all a stranger’s home and we are in an unfamiliar area. Didn’t love that. Also, the area is pretty boring itself. And if you want to get to parks, the driving back and forth gets old and tiring—especially after long days at them."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"The home was very clean and comfortable. Everything has been thought of and all we needed this place had. The beds were comfortable, the location was quiet, and it was walking distance to several things, including a nice park just a block and a half away. The space is well thought out and it was really one of the best AirBnB's we have stayed at. It was perfect! We would certainly stay here again!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,We loved how clean it was when we arrived. They thought of everything you might need. The kitchen was well stocked & we loved the comfortable living space. The beds were very comfortable & the entire experience was just perfect for the week.

2023-06-01,5.0,Group trip,"I recently had the pleasure of staying at this delightful Airbnb in Rexburg, the interior design was tasteful, stylish, and created a warm and inviting atmosphere.

2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We really enjoyed our stay here! The house is fully equipped and we didn't miss anything. There’s really everything you‘ll need.
The only thing that could be improved would be a dining table with enough chairs for all guests. We had to split between the counter and the dining table. Otherwise, the house really was one of the best Airbnbs we have ever stayed in. Thanks for that!
Joshua was also always very easy to reach whenever we had a question.
We had a very pleasant stay in a great house. We'd love to come back!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is such a great place to stay--great decor, roomy, clean and everything you could want or need and more!

2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This home was fantastic. We were visiting three of our children at BYUI, and it was spacious enough that they could come over and play games with us and visit. The host was receptive and flexible. We even contacted him to stay another day! Beautiful home. Easy to get to restaurants and the school if wanting to see the campus. We were even able to drive to Jackson Hole for the day! There is a deck on the back of the house, but it was too cold to enjoy. We would absolutely stay here again."
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Joshua and his home were both great. The location is about a 10 minute walk from campus and was easy to find. Very comfortable home.
2023-03-01,5.0,Group trip,"We’ve never stayed in a more comfortable Airbnb. We felt right at home. We enjoyed the puzzles and games that were provided. And we appreciated the foldout foam beds for our daughters to sleep on.

We will always book this home whenever we come to Rexburg."

2023-01-01,5.0,Group trip,"Absolutely wonderful experience!! Perfect location, top notch clean and beautifully decorated! Cozy, comfortable, welcoming home! This spot was exactly what we needed! My husband and I and our youngest son came to town with our oldest daughter and her husband to help them find an apartment to live in here while attending school! From the moment we walked in we wished this spot could be the home they could stay in for the years they will live in Rexburg! We did find them a great apartment to call home, but this airbnb was a highlight of our trip! We hoped to rent it again in two weeks when we are back to moved them into their new place but of course others have found how amazing this airbnb is so sadly it is already booked! But we will definitely be staying here again! Better than the pictures! Every detail was perfect in this home!"
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was my second stay at Joshua’s house and it was great. The location is perfect for visiting my daughter at BYU-Idaho.

Thanks for another great stay!"
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We loved our stay at this Airbnb in Rexburg. It was clean, organized, up to date, all the amenities that we needed, and so easy to get to.

2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,The house was excellent and perfect for what we needed. It is very close to the BYU-I campus. It snowed one night while we were staying at the house and they came and shoveled the drive way and put salt down which was very helpful. We will be looking to stay here for future visits.
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is the second time I have stayed here because it's a beautiful, comfortable home. I loved the extra touches of the holiday decorations this time round.

2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Joshua‘s place was a little slice of paradise! He was one of the best and most communicative hosts I’ve ever stayed with. We had a lot of drama on arrival in town because we had booked an Airbnb elsewhere but that host never sent us the check-in information, so it took several hours of work with Airbnb support to get refunded and re-booked in a new place. By the time we booked Joshua‘s place it was quite late in the evening, but he was wonderful about helping get us in as soon as possible. His rental is by far the nicest we’ve ever stayed in, with beautiful renovations, very nice beds, and lots of fun details like a hot chocolate bar which we really enjoyed. It was also conveniently located extremely close to campus and downtown which made it easy to coordinate with the family members we came to see. Highly recommended!"
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We could not have asked for a more lovely, convenient, comfortable or more spacious home. Even my children made comments about how much they loved the decor and general feel of the home. The owners made our stay easy and convenient and provided so many extras it made us feel like valued and welcome.. The best home - the best hosts - and the best value …hands down."

2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We loved our stay here. The house itself is located very close to everything, which made getting around extremely easy. The place felt spacious for us (especially since it was just myself and my husband), but it would also be great for more folks! The open concept in the kitchen/living/dining room area made it feel really homey, as a great space to hang out and catch up on the day.
Everything was extremely tidy, with lots of thoughtful touches. The home came with a fun little coffee area (with hot chocolate to boot!), a little welcome gift with snacks (that we nearly annihilated!), and well stocked bathrooms.
We couldn't recommend this home more for your time in Rexburg!"
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Joshua is an amazing host. Very clean house. The house is right in the center of the town and very accessible to restaurants, Yellowstone freeway and BYU.

2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Great stay here with our family. Beautiful house inside and out. Very clean and comfortable beds
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This home is so cozy! It is beautifully redone with modern touches. Big kitchen to cook in with lots of storage! comfortable couches, full washer and dryer, 3 bedrooms 2 bath with comfortable beds. The central AC was greatly appreciated as it was warm when we visited! It’s close to BYUI, right around the corner from the Abri apartments."
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Great place. Newer everything. Perfect location for any Rexburg/BYU Idaho visit.
2022-07-01,4.0,Group trip,"Super cute, very clean, good location, awesome deck, cushy towels! The only thing I would be aware of is the rooms aren’t quite as advertised. It shows there are two foam pads for kids to sleep on that will fit in a queen bedroom- the only room they fit in is the master. It also advertises a crib, but it is a pack n’ play. Not a huge deal, but something to be aware of!"
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Joshua's place was comfortable and a great place to spend the night after driving all day. The house was well-stocked and had some special touches, too. We also enjoyed unwinding by the firepit on the balcony."

2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"What an absolute pleasure to stay in your Rexburg home! It is by far the best Airbnb we've stayed in to date! The little welcome basket on the kitchen island and other amenities were awesome, too. Thank you so much Joshua!!!
Had the weather been warmer, we would have taken advantage of the deck fire place but we missed out on using that for this trip.
The fridge was spotless inside which is important to me, too. Compliments to the cleaning crew!
I would love to stay with you again in the future. Thank you very much for the hospitality, Joshua! Tracy and crew..."

2022-05-01,5.0,Group trip,"It was very clean, nice, and in a great location."
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was our home away from home. Everything you may have needed was provided! The fully-stocked kitchen (except food) was great for cooking our meals, the Hot Chocolate Bar was awesome for the cooler weather we experienced, a small snack package was on the island when we arrived, board games for the family, shampoo/conditioner/body wash/hair dryer included, and a washer and dryer are available. And if you do need something, Walgreens and a local grocery store are not far (1-2 blocks). Only an hour and a half from the West Yellowstone entrance and two hours and 15 minutes from Grand Teton, which we planned to visit during our trip. This is only a few blocks away from BYU-Idaho as well, which was great because we toured campus on a rainy day. Overall, this was an awesome find and would be wonderful for anyone staying short or long term. A very family friendly neighborhood! The only con: we could not get the fireplace on the back deck to work, which was not a deal breaker for us. We grabbed blankets from the living room and hot cocoa ☺️"

2022-01-01,5.0,Group trip,"Great Attention to Detail!! What does that mean? It means that anything you can think of that you would need during your stay, they have already thought of and provided! I am a bit of a vacation rental critic, however things in this unit went above and beyond. The nicest towels I’ve ever seen in a vacation rental or hotel, definitely enough dishes and kitchen supplies, clean, attractive decor, plenty of essentials, even high-quality toilet paper, lol! You will not be disappointed with this five star 3 bedroom/two bath home."

2024-04-01,4.0,Group trip,"We just stayed here last week. It was very easy to find, and super clean. Easy walk to BYU-I for my husband's graduation. The host was very responsive in answering questions , usually responding in less than an hour. There are a few things to note that might be a drawback to staying here. First, the master bedroom is on the side of the building next to a busy street. It was loud and made it hard for my husband to fall asleep. Second, the beds in the 2nd and 3rd bedrooms are not comfortable. The mattresses are not soft. Third, there is only one nightstand in the master bedroom, with a chair on the other side of the bed. The nightstand has no outlet close, and there really should be some sort of bedside lamp so that if you get up in the middle of the night you don't have to turn on the bedroom light. I would still give this at least 4 stars because the host was so responsive, it was extremely clean, check-in/check-out was super easy, and it was an easy walk to the BYU-I campus."
2024-04-01,3.0,Stayed about a week,"This was clean and the bed in the master was comfortable. The unit is on the ground floor and used to be student housing. The bathrooms are all in the same hallway with shared sinks. It seemed to be poorly insulated as I could hear the upstairs neighbors day and all night. They were noisy, though I don’t think they were doing anything other than moving around their apartment. The hot water went out for about 24 hrs. The hosts were responsive and working to get a plumber in but I was leaving so I asked them to wait until I checked out. By the morning I left the hot water was working again."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Awesome stay. Will book again if in Rexburg

2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Extremely close to restaurants, parks, and BYU. Clean and very comfortable, and the on-site gym was great!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Nice apartment. It had everything from shampoo and body wash to laundry detergent and dishwasher pods. Heads up on the twin sized beds they were very very firm. Hard as a rock. It took me a few nights to get used to it. There was no night stand next to the bed but I moved the little desk from the foot of the bed in between the 2 twin beds so I could have a place for my bottle of water in my ipad during the night. Also be aware that there doesn't seem to be any sound proofing so you can hear your neighbors walking in and out which is not a super big deal but if you are used to a quiet house with no neighbors it may bother you. With that being said if I were ever in the area again I would book it again.
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place for our family to relax. Loved having two bathrooms and the extra space!
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Excellent host. I have rented multiple times and they have always been great.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,thanks for the great trip
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We had an amazing experience. From the actual location all the way down to the response Time of angel host, everything was great. We look forward to staying here on our next trip to Rexburg."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Enjoyed our stay. No complaints. Would definitely stay there again.
2023-07-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"Perfect quick stop for our family of six. Good beds and bedding. Some of the neighbors were loud outside until well past midnight, but it’s apartments in a college town so we turned on the white noise and ignored. Host was super responsive and helpful."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"My recent stay at this Airbnb was an absolute dream! From the moment we set foot inside, we were captivated by the impeccable decor and clean ambiance. Every detail was carefully curated, creating a warm and welcoming atmosphere that made us feel right at home.
The kitchen was a true highlight - spacious, well-equipped, and ready to cater to our culinary adventures. It was a pleasure to prepare meals and indulge in delightful dishes as we gathered together.What delighted us was that the reality matched the pictures to perfection! The tasteful aesthetics and thoughtful touches were exactly as portrayed. The city itself was an enchanting destination. Our host played a pivotal role in making our stay exceptional. With clear instructions and quick responses, they made the check-in and check-out process seamless. Their attentiveness and willingness to assist with any query or concern showed their commitment to ensuring a delightful experience. I will recommend to friends & family."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Excellent place and wonderful host!
2023-07-01,5.0,Group trip,"The place was clean, peaceful and beautiful. The host was extremely helpful. We had a great time here. We will certainly be coming back!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We had such a nice time here! The bedding was soft and comfortable. We loved the large bathrooms and the extra door separating the hallway to the bedrooms from the living/kitchen spaces. Two blocks from Porter park, which the kids loved with a big splash park and carousel. Would stay again!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This property was perfect for our needs for our family vacation. It was very roomy, modern, clean, and comfortable. The beds were all very comfortable. The bathroom was huge and very convenient for a family. The location was convenient, near grocery stores, splash pad, parks, and the freeway. The host was very friendly and responsive. We highly recommend it, and would stay there again!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Group trip,Very nice place to stay with our group. Host was always responsive to questions. We enjoyed out stay.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Clean and comfortable. Great location. The parking was unclear, we need a parking pass but we were unsure if we were supposed to park in a certain spot. There was an elevator that we discovered after we hauled most of our things up to the third floor. One of the shower heads was so hard it hurt our skin so we all used the other shower. There was no soap in the kitchen and very limited kitchen/cooking supplies. Overall it was a 4/5. Beds were comfortable and we all slept well but probably would stay somewhere else next time that was a bit less $$."
2023-07-01,5.0,Group trip,We enjoyed our stay very much. Close to lots of things. The only downside for us was the noisy upstairs neighbors. They seemed to be running and stomping from 6 am to midnight. We thought there was 2 separate bathrooms. It was actually two separate toilets and showers. The sinks were outside of the toilet and shower areas. It was nice to have 3 sinks and lots of counter space.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Super clean! Nice amount of room for family.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,It was a great place to stay. I would definitely stay here again when I am in Rexburg. Everything went smoothly with no problems.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Had a good stay. Was quiet. Beds were pretty comfy. Easily accommodated our family of 6.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Perfect place for our stay in Rexburg
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,very cozy full of peace
2023-07-01,5.0,Group trip,"Clean, super convenient and safe!"
2023-07-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"We liked the apartment and were mostly satisfied, it's a nice place with very comfortable beds, plenty of space and free parking spots, in a peaceful area. Unfortunately the washing machine didn't work the whole time. Also some kitchen basics that usually are in Airbnbs were missing - like sponge, salt or oil. But other than that the apartment is well equiped and all in all it was a pleasant stay :)"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Had a good stay. Quiet neighborhood. Comfortable beds. Lots of light during the day. The kitchen had good utensils provided - but if you plan to cook, only a small salt & pepper shaker and a can of oil spray was provided. There's a Walmart about 2 miles away though, for cooking needs.
At check-in, we found that the parking permit was missing in the unit, but a quick message to the host took care of it fairly quickly."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great place, great location."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Great place, clean and great location. We'd stay here again!"

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Very nice and clean. We will stay again if we are in that town.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We had a great time staying here. They left us more than enough parking passes, made sure to get us a pack & play, and overall host a great place for the family to stay. The only thing I will mention for improvement is the cleanliness of the bath towels; each one was stained with some sort of brown (looked like self tanner maybe?) and although we were positive they were clean, the stains threw us off a bit. Overall, an absolutely wonderful stay in a comfortable place with great amenities!!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Group trip,"We really appreciated the top floor unit, with a beautiful view of the temple from the balcony. The room with the King mattress was comfortable, but just a heads up, that the twin mattresses are dorm type mattresses that are basically a thick pad on a metal frame, so it’s like sleeping on the ground. Plenty of drawers and closet space in each room.
The unit is open and feels spacious, with a large kitchen. It was very nice to have 2 private shower/toilet rooms!
We would for sure stay here again!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Group trip,"My family and myself enjoyed our stay, it was clean. We felt at home"
2023-07-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,Overall the place is good but a bit pricey given the location. We had to clean the bathroom as the toilet had choked during our stay.
2023-07-01,5.0,Group trip,Host was easy to reach and very responsive.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,it was perfect
2023-06-01,5.0,Group trip,Priced economically and clean. It was perfect for our needs.
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Excellent!
2023-06-01,3.0,Stayed with kids,"Very functional, spacious, & fits basic needs. It isn't warm, fuzzy or homey, but at least it was a home with functional beds and appliances. Kitchen accessories are enough for inexperienced or non-cooks as kitchen isn't stocked with a lot of cooking accessories. Bring your own wine glasses and bottle opener.
It's close to everything you need for your stay and seems like a quiet and safe family neighborhood."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great stay, highly recommended."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Will stay again!

2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Great place to stay for a great cost.
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Great place to stay if you want a large space. Angel was very detailed and helpful in accommodating us. The place had 3 bedrooms & 2 baths. Very close to shops and restaurants. Had a great stay.
The TV was the only challenging thing, to get it to connect to streaming services. Maybe we dint try enough. The place had a gym which was great! Also there is an elevator which is a plus."
2023-06-01,5.0,Group trip,"Excellent apartment and host. Great location and neighborhood. It's clean and big, perfect for groups. Awesome stay! I can't complain about anything, and I would definitely recommend it."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Great location, plenty of space, really enjoyed our stay. Nothing against the owner but take ear plugs the people above us walked so loud and jumped it was hard to sleep. Again I am stating this so you are prepared this isn’t something the owner can really prevent! We would stay again!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Group trip,There was everything we needed in this place. It is centrally located and has convenient access to shops and restaurants. Beds were comfortable. Bathrooms spotless. The whole place was homey and comfortable.
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great host! It was clean. We enjoyed our stay.
2023-06-01,5.0,Group trip,"Great place, worked great for our soccer weekend."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We were in town for a soccer tournament great place to stay.
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Great new building with a gym and public room that is close to the university campus and main strip in Rexburg. Building is quiet and excellent for extended work stays. The internet is fast and the kitchen is stocked with good utensils and appliances. Furniture is good and bed is comfortable.
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,100% recommended very nice place
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Clean and comfortable. Comfy beds. Plenty of space for 6 guests. Close to campus. But I couldn't figure out the ice maker, and there were no ice trays."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"The location was good for our needs. Shampoo conditioner body wash, no coffee. Bring a fan as the stair well is next to the master bedroom with all night users.
Was nice to have a washer and dryer handy."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"Fantastic find! This place in a great location close to campus and in walking distance to stores, parks, and restaurants.
It is VERY spacious! plenty of comfortable seating in the main living areas and a nice big kitchen fully stocked with dishes, utensils, pots, pans, linens, and other kitchen basics.
very clean and modern. well maintained and beautifully decorated. The bedrooms were large and the beds were very comfy.
The bathroom area is quite large too and it was nice to have 2 showers and a separate sink/vanity area.
I highly recommend Angel Host and Brighams Mill for your next stay in Rexburg!! You will not be disappointed!!
The hosts are super fast to respond and very kind."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"Upon arrival, we were given the wrong unit. We booked a unit with two king beds and this one only had one. Angel corrected and had us moved to a different unit.
Angel was very helpful throughout our stay. It did stink that she’d have to get in contact with other people for solutions, answers, and needs. Eventually, after a few days, she did provide us contact numbers for people who were local and they were great and very responsive.
One of the nights, a rain storm hit and the fire alarm started dripping water. We did have to put a bowl and some towels underneath. When we notified them, they immediately came to check it out and took care of the situation.
The unit we had was spacious! We loved that it had two toilets, two showers, three sinks, three bedrooms, a kitchen, and a living room. It was very clean too. We were missing an ironing board and pans, but I know if we asked, they would have found a solution for us!
Overall, great extended stay. Thank you Angel and team!"
2023-05-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"The stay was great. Good accommodations, the washer didn’t work though."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Thoroughly enjoyed our time here, beds were comfy and all amenities were excellent!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,overall stay was pleasant and neat.
2023-05-01,3.0,Stayed about a week,"Don't stay here!
Repeat: don't stay here!
It's a beautiful condo unit in a big complex, BUT it's very noisy because construction workers, college students, travelers are coming/going at all hours. Outside corridors and very disruptive - partying next to us until 2am! Kids jumping up/down above us. Traffic late at night and early in morning. It was like renting a room in a cheap motel ... for Holiday Inn prices! I asked for a 2 night out of 7 refund, but no joy! The site also listed complimentary coffee daily but the host didn't know about that!
NOT A GOOD DEAL or RESPONSIVE HOST."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"These are great apartments located right off a main street in Rexburg, close the park, BYU, and the downtown strip. There is a gym on site, which was a big plus for me. There is high turn over here and the only downside is that you may have a noisy upstairs neighbors, but everyone generally turns down around 10 PM. By noisy, I mean people running around above you. Otherwise, the trade off for a little intermittent noise is totally tolerable, because these apartments are stocked with great appliances, utensils, good internet, and furniture. For travelling families, it is good to note that these apartments have large bathrooms, main bedroom, and two bedrooms each with two twin beds, plenty of utensils, large spacious common areas."
2023-05-01,5.0,Group trip,This space was great for 3 of us traveling through the area. Big perks are the two bathrooms and large sink area. I would recommend staying here to anyone else.
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We enjoyed our stay here! Everything was clean, the bedding was comfortable. My kids loved the card games. Nice big kitchen. Thank you so much!"

2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I loved this place and will definitely rebook it when I come back to Rexburg. It was convenient, clean, very cute. It had enough supplies for all who were staying with us. I especially liked the washer and dryer convenience and being able to wash our clothes before leaving. (Less work when we get home. 😉.)
There is only one draw back and that was the traffic noise from the street. It isn’t terrible and it does die down at night ….but this place is worth a little noise.
Great Host, Great experience and Great price. Thank you."
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Clean, quiet, and very adequate, the place was a well furnished three bedroom apartment very close to BYUI. The check-in was easy and the kitchen and bathroom was well stocked. The place was well furnished and the beds were comfortable. I would stay here again."

2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place for our stay
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We were initially concerned that the unit was on the third floor - concerned about climbing stairs with luggage, and especially with the possibility of snow and ice on the steps (plus we're a little on the older age side). However, we were pleased that there was a convenient elevator next to our unit, so there were no problems.
The unit itself was spacious and pleasant. A large kitchen area, a relaxing living area, three bedrooms and a large bathroom area with two separate, private showers and toilets.
It was also convenient to most local restaurants and eating places.
We will definitely book here again when we need a place in the Rexburg area."
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great location. Easy walk to BYU Idaho and restaurants. Immaculate apartment. Well equipped. Spacious. Will definitely stay here again. And highly recommend.

2023-01-01,5.0,Group trip,It met Al of our expectations and provided a nice “home base” for our trip. Very comfortable and easily accessible.
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I am already considering staying here again. The place was clean, spacious, and warm in January (a big plus!). The king-size bed was comfortable; the kitchen was well-stocked.
Be aware that this is a unit in a college town, and these condos are BYUI approved housing. That means sometimes it feels a little like living in a dorm because of the way the space is laid out (open closets, for example), but this wasn't a problem for our family."
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Wonderful location. Perfect for parents/family visiting BYU-I.
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Clean, comfortable, and well equipped. Would definitely stay here again!"

2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"First experience using air bnb and it was great. Clean, and felt like home. She was quick to reply to any questions I had."
2022-12-01,5.0,Group trip,"We had an amazing stay at this Airbnb! The Angel was an amazing host and the location was on point. The apartment have everything we needed and was super cozy. It fit all our needs for a wonderful stay. The location was exactly what we needed…restaurants, shopping and close to BYUI. Parking was amazing and it even had an elevator which made everything even better for me since I just injured my knee. Well worth the price and convenience. We can’t wait to be back in the spring and summer."
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"The host was very prompt with responding to our needs, especially involving our front door lock. No matter the timd of day, our host responded very quickly. The parking situation was my main concern, but we were actually able to use the parking lot without any towing happening. Living space and kitchen were great and clean, I would definitely stay here again."
2022-12-01,4.0,Group trip,"These apartments are very roomy and nice. Some very minor improvements could make this a 5 star rating across the board. Our particular until was located right next to the stairwell and twobof the bedrooms back up to the stairwell which is steel and you can unfortunately hear people going up and down the stairs in the early morning and late at night. Only one of the bedrooms has a bed that couples can sleep on together although all three rooms are big enough for a queen. The small twin beds in each of the other two rooms are sufficient for rest and sleep but not ideal if you are tall, or married and want to sleep next to your significant other. Overall it's a great place and convenient location to stay and the accomodations are very clean and nice. I would definitely use them again in the future if I had to."
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is honestly the best AirBnb place we have stayed at, the quality of mattress pillow la and linens looked and felt like a luxury hotel, it was the best but better because it had two bathrooms and kitchen !!!Highly highly recommended"

2022-10-01,4.0,Group trip,"Clean and nice place. The beds were not twins but full-size singles, which was perfect for all the folks in our party. The street parking was very difficult and it was frustrating as the inside parking lot was nearly empty. Nice location and close to mostly everything in Rexburg."

2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Very spacious, clean and comfortable place to relax when finished with hiking, biking and spending time with family.

2022-09-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"We had a good time at this place, specially being so close to all the outdoor activities and things we had planned. The kitchen and bathroom was well stocked with what we needed. The place was generally clean so that was nice.

2024-05-01,5.0,Group trip,We stayed at Sean's house. Its a very pretty house to stay and had almost everything we needed. Just make sure its located in a quiet neighborhood and you might need to lower your voice during night.
2024-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This was probably one of the best places we’ve stayed at through Airbnb. The place was nice, instructions were simple, it was well-stocked, and there was plenty of space for our group of 6."
2024-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was our second stay at Sean’s place (we stayed in his basement unit a few months ago).
The house was perfect for our needs. Clean & tidy with all the necessities. We cooked dinner one night for our kids who live in Rexburg- all the pots & pans & dishes, etc we needed for cooking & serving were there. The dining & living room area were roomy & comfortable.
Convenient location, quiet neighborhood. Host is quick to reply.
We will be back!"

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Great place. Clean & comfy beds. If you have a big group or heavy footed family, this might not be for you… there are several signs around the home reminding you to not jump, stomp or horseplay. We didn’t have a problem since we only had a few of our teenage kids with us. I was constantly paranoid & kept telling my kids to talk quietly & not be loud or take showers after quiet hours. Also, we were going to have our adult married kids come over for a dinner but decided it might be too loud for downstairs renters. Other than that… great property!!! Highly recommend!!!"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,My family had a great stay here. The host thought of everything putting this place together. We will be booking here again!
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Great place!!

2024-01-01,5.0,Group trip,"Had a fantastic stay at Sean's Place. This is the third time I've stayed here and prefer it because of the location to the people we come to see, the amount it sleeps and what a very nice house it is. It meets our needs every time."
2023-12-01,5.0,Group trip,"This is a beautiful place to stay. It felt like my own home. Not far from BYU Idaho campus.
We traveled from Texas to have Christmas with my son's family. Sean provided a small Christmas tree for us to have on Christmas day. 💕
Sean is quick to respond to questions. We would love to stay here again."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay! We loved the garage. So amazing in the winter! We loved the games, soft carpet, comfy beds, bunk beds for the kids and individualized temp in each room was a super plus. The kids loved the hot chocolate and oatmeal that came with the house! It was such a quiet neighborhood and we all slept so well. We Definitely would love to stay here again!"

2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Everything was great. We only stayed a night. It was clean and well stocked. It felt comfortable. The owners were very clear and responsive. The only thing I would change is that there are signs everywhere telling you not to stomp because of the people below. Not that I was planning on it, but there were 8 of us and I felt on edge everytime someone would walk across the room."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We loved our stay at Sean's place. the location is fantastic and a great neighborhood. the home looked exactly like the pictures and was very clean. Sean was great to work with and we would be happy to stay here again.

2023-08-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,Worked great for our two families. It did get hot in the bedrooms at night even with windows open and fans running.

2023-08-01,5.0,Group trip,"Nice, house only a few miles from town. Space was clean and very comfortable for our stay. Instructions were clear and Sean was a great host. Would definitely stay here again if we pass through town again."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We enjoyed Sean’s Airbnb. Our family really loved it. My only recommendation is if you have children with you, because there is a basement unit , you need to make sure the kids don’t stomp or rough house. A bit of a challenge for my grandsons. Maybe ask for the basement unit if you have kids.
Otherwise it was the perfect location. Our family really enjoyed it."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Very satisfied,👍🏻 very clean, very clean!Unforgettable experience!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We were very comfortable. Thank you
2023-07-01,5.0,Group trip,Great place to stay. Appreciated the last minute booking.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"The house had all the amenities you'd need when traveling. kitchen had basic spices and oils, coffee, etc.. stocked fully with beautiful dishes and ample kid dishes. Tons of extra linens and comfortable bed, family games.... We loved the use of the garage to park our car. Do be mindful of the quiet hours from 8pm-8am - we have young kids so tried our best to be respectful of those hours, but definitely a bit tricky at times. There was an amazing park just a few minutes away with a splash pad & carousel that we visited a few times and loved!!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Group trip,"We enjoyed our stay at Sean’s. It had space for our family, was clean and cozy. We definitely felt at home while there and would love to visit again."
2023-07-01,5.0,Group trip,"Used this as a home base for Yellowstone and Teton. Very clean and updated. Easy to book and gain access. No central air but there are portable A/C units plus a wall mounted unit. New, soft carpet. Would book again."
2023-07-01,5.0,Group trip,This place was very well organized and taken care of. When we walked in the house we loved how clean it was and how private and calm.This house is close to Yellowstone and Grand Teton.
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Quiet neighborhood. Nice home, it was clean and tidy with plenty of towels"
2023-06-01,5.0,Group trip,"Place is nice…clean, quiet. Excellent.. recommend someone stay this house.."
2023-06-01,4.0,Stayed about a week,"Overall a good stay. description of property said entire house. That is not accurate, there is an apartment in the basement. Quiet hours started at 8pm. That was not clearly communicated in the listing. With that said, it was not a problem and the price was appropriate. Very clean home in a quiet area. Nice to have use of the garage, made for very easy access."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is a beautiful home in the heart of Rexburg, Idaho. Sean was a great host. He communicated very well through Airbnb messaging and text messaging. He was pretty quick to respond and very professional. The check-in and check-out instructions were very clear and to the point. A home manual is provided in the home with instructions on how to operate certain items within the home. There is only one small AC unit in the living room and not throughout the entire house. My family and I had to be mindful of the 8pm-8am quiet time rule because there were also guests who stayed right below us in the home. They are completely separated from where we stayed and we rarely saw the other guests so no issues there. Local grocery stores, fast food restaurants, and gas stations are minutes away which is nice. Overall, my family and I enjoyed our stay here."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Beautiful clean home, in a safe and manicured neighborhood. Comfy mattresses, soft towels, and all the amenities! Fenced backyard, and games for the kids!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We spent 3 nights here and we all had a great time. The place is clean and cozy. Strongly Recommend!
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Place was very clean & nice .. definitely will recommend & if I’m ever in twin falls I will be staying again
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Loved the books and games that were available. Comfortable home with a nice layout and good location for Bear World and Yellowstone.
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Such a cute house. We felt right at home. Sean was a great host and was very great about helping us get checked in.
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,My family and I stayed here while attending a wedding. The place was perfect for us and Sean was very accomplished to our needs!
2023-05-01,5.0,Group trip,"Perfect place and size for 8 people! 4 kids in the bunkbeds and parents in the their own rooms. Even with 8 people in the house, it never felt crowded. Plenty of room to relax and talk. We LOVED that there was a fan in each room, kept things cool and blocked out any extra noise. Getting in every time was a breeze because the front door and the garage were the last 4 digits of our phone number-couldn't have been simpler! A/C worked great, charging ports of all different kinds were so convenient and we found them in the living room and the bedrooms. This place was so close to everything we needed and it had a great garage for parking and unloading. Couldn't have asked for a better place!!!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Group trip,Great place
2023-05-01,4.0,Stayed about a week,Sean is a great host. We enjoyed our stay at this place. Thank you for everything.
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Quiet stay
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Great home! Had a great experience! Everything was just as expected!
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Our stay was wonderful! Highly recommend. Would hope to return sometime.
2023-04-01,5.0,Group trip,We had a great stay! A nice home with plenty of room
2023-04-01,5.0,Group trip,This was a great stay! Super clean and easy to access. Would stay here again :)
2023-04-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"Pros: Very clean and comfortable place for our family of 5. We enjoyed having a garage we could park in with the snow. We also appreciated the spices and oils in the kitchen as we cooked a lot. Night lights throughout the house were awesome as was the phone charging lamps by the bed. Lots of little touches throughout the place. Comfortable couches and beds.
Cons: Could use some upgrades on some kitchen utensils - and again, we cooked a lot so this was a bigger deal to me. Easy fixes though- like the can opener hardly worked at all, some better knifes, a decent cheese grater & a bottle opener. Also, no garage disposal so we had to dig out the food scraps when washing the pans.
The dryer didn’t work well so we had to dry our loads 2-3 times.
It’s bright in the bedrooms in the morning with the sheer curtains, but I just used a sleeping mask and that was fine. There was a noisy neighborhood dog a couple mornings, but what can you do about that? Overall our stay was positive!"
2023-04-01,5.0,Group trip,"Sean's place is very nice and convenient to BYUI and Rexburg in general. It's in a nice neighborhood. Sean lives close by in case his guests need anything during their stay. In fact, I texted Sean and asked if there should be an iron in the house. He was there in a matter of minutes with a brand new in box iron. Highly recommend this place.

2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This house is in a great location if you are visiting a college student- 5 min from the college, 5 min from eating places and a grocery store in Rexburg. It is in a quiet neighborhood as well.
The house is old but renovated and very clean and comfortable. The sheets on the beds were great - something I don’t usually say about hotel rooms/places we pay to stay. The space is smallish if you plan to have lots of people over, but we did have enough room for our sons and their friends. There is a “quiet time” between 8 pm and 8 am, and if this is difficult because of noisy children, this may not be the best option. There is a downstairs apartment we had to be aware of (take shoes off, no stomping). The kitchen isn’t as fully appointed as some places we’ve stayed, but we still were able to prepare food there without difficulty. All that being said, we did like this house very much."
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,All I all it was great! It could have been more clear that there is another dwelling in the basement.
2023-03-01,5.0,Group trip,Cute little place in rexburg!
2023-03-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"This home was very clean and cozy inside and hosted our family well. The mattresses were very comfortable and I loved all the pillows! The electric fireplace was very helpful as our stay was during a cold period.
Quiet time was from 8pm to 8am, and I think quiet time should probably start more around 9pm or so.
We did have to buy more toilet paper as there was only 1 additional roll provided and for a family of 6, we needed more.
I loved that they provided shampoo and conditioner in each bathroom.
This home fit all 6 of us well."
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We loved Sean’s place! It was peaceful and cozy and we felt right at home! We loved the extras like lots of pillows and blankets! It was great and we will definitely stay here again!
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Just a few minutes from the main part of town where you'll find BYU-I, the Rexburg temple, Deseret Book, grocery stores, restaurants and more. Home was very clean and comfy, felt right at home. Liked being able to park in the garage on the snowy day. Had different apps available on TV for streaming shows. Liked the ability to cook a meal for the family and sit down at the table and eat together. Really enjoyed the opportunity to stay here!"
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Wonderful place to stay. Exceptionally clean. Living room has plenty of room to stretch out and couches are comfortable (which is rare for a rental). Loved having the garage to pull our cars into. Sean was very quick to respond to any questions we had. Would definitely stay here again.
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We found the home to be cozy and in the perfect location for what we were there to achieve. We would definitely stay again.

2023-02-01,5.0,Group trip,Sean was kind and responsive. The house was very clean and well kept. Great stay and experience! We would stay here again!
2023-02-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"Very clean home and the bedding and mattresses were comfortable. The only thing I was a bit alarmed with is that it had people living in the bottom of the house. I didn't hear them, but was worried about our noise level and trying to be respectful to them. I will most likely be choosing to stay at this location again when we return."
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Nice place to stay. Thank you !
2023-01-01,5.0,Group trip,This home was exactly as described. I would definitely stay here again.
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This place was great. So easy to check in. They have a large empty garage which makes loading and unloading bags really easy. Each room has its own thermostat which was great. Place was really clean and smelled nice and clean upon arrival. Kitchen was well stocked with cooking supplies (oil,tin foil, etc) fast wifi that supported gaming flawlessly. The beds and pillows were very comfortable as well as the high quality feeling living room furniture. Just a really great experience."
2023-01-01,5.0,Group trip,It was great! I will definitely stay there again!
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My husband and I loved Sean’s place! The house had everything we needed and more. The place was nice and cozy and had that homey feel. The master bed was super comfortable with lots of pillows. The added bonus was parking in the garage, kept our car nice and warm.
Thanks again, we will be back next time."
2023-01-01,5.0,Group trip,"Sean's place was perfect for visiting family over New Year's. The large open family room was comfortable and great for spending time together. The house was perfectly clean, the kitchen had good amenities for cooking, and there was plenty of space for our family (5 adults). The mattresses on the bunk beds and in the master bedroom were very firm, and the queen bed in the third room was softer. Depending on your preference, some of the beds might be difficult to sleep on. Other than that, everything was great. Heating the house was easy, and there were lots of extra blankets. Having use of the garage was great, especially in winter. We would stay here again."
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We love our stay at the house. Everything is how the pictures show. Private and calm street, well furnished. I highly recommend this place to everyone."
2022-12-01,5.0,Group trip,Sean was a very responsive host and the Airbnb was great. Exactly as described and great location for an intermediate stop on our trip.
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"The pictures don’t do this place justice! It was so nice, clean, well maintained, and so comfortable. We all felt right at home and it was such a great place to relax and unwind. Sean is a great host! If we come back to rexburg ever we will definitely look this one up again! Highly recommend."
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We loved it so much! We stayed here to cisit my daughter and her hisband for christmas who had to work. It was beautiful and cozy and a perfect place to stay! We all slept great which is unusual! Great details, everything you need is there! We loved it so much!! Thank you!"
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This place was exactly what we needed while visiting family in Rexburg. It's located in a quiet neighborhood near campus. Having the garage to park in made it super nice for the -12° weather snap we had. The kitchen had most everything we happened to need. No blender but that was not a biggie... breakfast smoothies would have made us cold. Instead we indulged in oatmeal and hot cocoa. The place was roomy and having two bathrooms was nice. The owner was super nice and communication was great. Thanks again!
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This home was just right for our short trip to Rexburg. It had all the amenities we needed. The home was clean.
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a lovely stay, and would definitely book with this host again."
2022-12-01,5.0,Group trip,"This place is very clean, well-kept, and convenient. The bedrooms are well-sized and clean. The best thing about this beautiful home was the large amount of common area space, where we could gather & relax. Many Airbnbs in Rexburg have limited parking, but this place has plenty. That was a huge plus for us, because we have multiple children living in the area, and they sometimes braught their friends.
Sean was friendly, polite, and extremely responsive. For example, we asked for extra hangers, and he delivered them to the front door within minutes.
I've stayed in Rexburg several times, and this is easily the best place we've stayed at. If the stars align for my next stay and this home is available, I will definitely book it."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Loved staying here! Very sweet host!
2024-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I had an amazing stay at this Airbnb! The host was super friendly and accommodating, the apartment was clean and cozy, and the location was perfect for exploring the city. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone looking for a comfortable and convenient stay. I would stay here again!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,It was great! Air bnb was clean and comfortable!
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Bryce was a great host - very responsive and proactive about communicating. Everything was exactly as I expected and a great value for the cost. The only downside was the noise when someone was upstairs. Luckily I brought earplugs so I heard nothing once I put those in. Would stay here again!
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"It is a private place, cozy and perfect for a small stay at Rexburg."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great location! Loved having a washer/dryer, separate room."

2024-03-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Cozy and comfortable... was able to do laundry during our stay which was so nice! Only negative would be the shower. Small and needs updated badly!
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"This place was perfect for my visit to rexburg. Enough space for my daughter to come stay with me. The place is actually decent size as well. The bathroom is no frills but works fine. As previous reviews stated the walls and ceiling are paper thin…like don’t have a private conversation. We were able to hear everything going on upstairs…conversations, the blender, vacuum,etc, but the hours were never extreme and it did not affect our stay at all. It is cozy and warm and had fans to keep the warm air moving. It was also nice to have laundry in the unit. Parking is right at the top of the exterior stairs. Would definitely stay again!"
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Good location.
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Perfect for what I needed. Would go again!

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"wonderful stay, very cozy !"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The host was very helpful and answered all my questions.
2023-10-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,"The place was tidy, the host helped me check in, and the place is really close to BYU-Idaho. The walls are pretty thin, so the privacy is a little questionable, but the security system in the apartment made me feel safe. All and all, the only complaint I would have is about a beetle problem."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Clean place exactly as advertised. Super convenient as it’s close to BYUI. No complaints at all, very comfortable!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"The basement apartment is exactly as pictured. Good quality for the price. Thank you Bryce, for letting us stay in your Airbnb!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great host and great spot in rexburg. Cute, clean place with new flooring in main area. Definitely recommend."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The place was just like the photos, very clean, temperature was great and everything I needed was provided! I will continue to come back here! The host was very responsive and very friendly too."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I booked this studio literally 90 minutes before checking in and these guys STILL brought out all the stops to make their space accommodating.
I was amazed at how quickly they were able to prepare the studio on such short notice! The space was comfortable and in a great location
Will definitely book again when I’m in town!!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Thank you very much for everything
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great host. Home was exactly as advertised. Had no issues at all. I will definitely stay here again if I am in the area again.
2023-07-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,"The property was small and kinda cute, but more like a college kids apartment. Bryce responded quickly, and I could tell was willing to help if needed."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Very pleasant place if you are not in need of a kitchen. For us, it was perfect, one week of vacation and not looking for cook anyway. Host very easy to communicate. Place very clean and cozy."
2023-07-01,4.0,Stayed about a week,"Great room for a low price. I basically just slept there- I did not have a need for any other amenities- so this worked out well. There is a good amount of sound from footsteps above, but for the price and my needs it was great and served me well. Bed was comfortable (I stayed in the little one) and Bryce was friendly and very accommodating for my fluctuating schedule."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Communication was easy and the place was clean, worked great for what we needed. It is on a basement, so you can hear them, but that didn’t bothered us."
2023-06-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Nice clean space, great if needing a place to crash for a night or two. Good value for money, the only thing worth noting is that the walls are very tin and we could hear everything the upstairs neighbors did"
2023-06-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Staying in this cozy basement was overall decently clean and nice. The only things I would change are the shower floor and the noise level of the neighbors. But overall it wad well worth the price as I felt safe and comfortable
2023-06-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"As shown in the pictures. Good accommodation for one night and cheap. Not recommended for sensitive sleepers or any person who wants to go to sleep early. The house is very noisy, you can hear every single word of people who are in the apartment above, every step and the water pipe."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Their place was perfect in pretty much every way: great location, private, very clean and simple, lots of things to do and places to eat within a minute drive, very close to campus and the temple, and I could go on and on. More than anything, though, Bryce was very responsive, gave very clear instructions for checking in and checking out, and was very kind. Would definitely book here again!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"For the price, it’s worth the money! I felt right at home and Bryce was super responsive to all my questions. This is definitely a nice place and I love the privacy of it as you don’t have to go through the main door of the house to get to your place, you have your very own little home, perfect for a nice weekend getaway! I will definitely be using their place more!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,My husband had a great stay! The bed was comfortable and just what he needed for a 4 night stay!
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very responsive
2023-05-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Wonderful little place in the heart are Rexburg. Grateful to have a budget friendly option. Floor and walls are thin so be prepared for some shared noise. Does have that “basement smell”. Bathroom was a little janky but worth the affordable price. Great option for a weekend away
2023-05-01,4.0,Stayed about a week,As advertised. Inexpensive and convenient
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We ejected our stay. The location was in walking distance from campus. The queen size bed was very comfortable for my picky husband.
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Just what I needed!
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This was my second stay at this location. Comfortable both times.
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The stay was amazing. Everything that Bryce promised was what I got during my stay. A cozy and perfect place to spend the weekend. An incredible host who helped me with everything I needed.
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Definitely worth the price! I didn’t have super high expectations so I was thoroughly pleased with what I paid for. I’ll admit the shower was a little run down looking but it was clean and I had a good time.
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Bryce’s place was just as described. The wall heater kept the unit cozy and warm. There were plenty of extra blankets, pillows and towels. Bryce was helpful and quick to respond to questions. We enjoyed playing games at the table and found the apartment to be spacious and perfect for our 3 day stay."
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Second time staying here, Bryce was very responsive when communicating, and I only needed minimal communication as everything was well and a great deal for the price. Will probably stay again this summer when I’m back a third time :)"
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We enjoyed staying here and it was exactly as expected!
2023-01-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Just as described. You can hear the people upstairs, but they didn't stay up too late or get up early."
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great price for great space
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Wonderful home for a few days! Great at communicating! Loved it!

2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"It was really well kept, felt comfy and cozy. Despite being a basement room, it felt like a living room/bedroom combo. I loved my stay there, and I would stay again."
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great place if you are in the area or visiting kids at school. Very clean and comfortable. Lots of comfortable, clean bedding. It was our first air bnb stay and we were very happy with our couple night stay. Very easy to communicate with."
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Affordable, cozy and comfortable."
2022-10-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great warm place to stay! Comfy beds, good amenities, and the WiFi worked great. Check-in was super easy and the instructions from the host were super clear and convenient. Walls seemed a bit thin, but we weren’t expecting 100% privacy - I only hope that me having to take some work calls didn’t annoy the hosts upstairs."
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Awesome place to stay
2022-10-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"A wonderful price, and description is accurate. Since it’s a basement you can hear walking on the floor above"

2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great little place! Close to campus and convenient for my needs and a last minute reservation. I would stay here again!

2022-09-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Decent little spot with a fantastic location in Rexburg. Beds were comfortable and the space was clean. The bathroom is older than expected and the shower is very tiny and old.
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Host was welcoming, cutest little place in Rexburg, great location at a good price!"
2022-07-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,Very good communication and smooth check in. Bryce was a gracious host.
2022-07-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great place, especially for the price. My mom was impressed with everything. I wish the parking spot by the trash cans were a bit neater for when we pulled in."
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I had a comfortable stay in this cozy basement. It is quite spacious and the private entrance is nice. Bryce was very quick and willing to answer any questions. Overall, a great value."
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great place to stay! Comfortable and clean. Bryce was great, he answered my questions promptly and told me everything I needed to know!"

2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,It’s a very clean place has what you need and their super kind.
2022-06-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"If you are looking for affordable value, this place is it."
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Spacious and convenient housing. My partner and I were able to take advantage of the cozy space, after our daily adventures in Idaho and abroad. Yellowstone Park in Montana is a mere 2 hour drive and a nice excursion from quaint Rexburg. Idaho Falls is also worth a visit if you plan to stay here as well. It does get a little drafty at night, but the sheets provided pretty much negated my concerns."
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This place is just as advertised. There's two beds and a hot shower.
2022-06-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Hassle-free booking, clean, everything you need."

2022-03-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Bryce was great at communicating! The ease of checking in and out was so appreciated.
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,place was clean and perfect for what we needed. very comfortable. feels lonely if your by yourself but that's because you get all the privacy you need at this place. Bryce was always a text or phone call away. great communication. easy parking spot. 5 star all around!
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay for a long weekend
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"Nice place to stay for a couple days, especially if you are visiting BYUI. The accommodations are very basic, but comfortable enough for a short term stay. The apartment is conveniently located; within close walking distance to campus. You can definitely hear the upstairs occupants at all times of the day, as this is a modified basement and not a true apartment (lacks a kitchen), but it’s not a deal breaker and the place is fairly comfortable. As mentioned in other reviews, the shower stall is very small and dark. The saving grace is that water gets warm quickly, stays warm, and has adequate pressure-good enough to get the job done. It is worth noting, however, that the bathroom area has no electrical outlets which makes using a blow dryer or curling iron by the mirror very difficult. If those are items you regularly use, prepare to get creative and fly blind, or simply bring an extension cord. All in all, this is a great, no-frills place to stay that includes an off-street parking spot, which is appreciated, especially during the winter months when there is snow on the ground. Communication with the host is easy, as he is prompt, clear, and polite. A reachable and attentive host is a nice bonus, which you will find here."
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This was the perfect place for our week long stay. The location was perfect. Bryce was so responsive and kind. I highly recommend this location. Would definitely stay here again.
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Comfy Airbnb nearby BYUI
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"very good price, fantastic location. perfect for a short stay."
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Clean, comfortable, and convenient!"
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is a great little apartment with wonderful amenities. The cozy apartment has heaters that work extremely well, the beds are so comfortable, and the check in process is a dream. The host is responsive and the apartment is super close to BYU Idaho and lots of other stores. Loved my stay!"
2022-01-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great place. Simplistic and was warm during cold temps. Also, Bryce was communicating regularly as we asked questions. Would recommend to all."
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Cute little basement space.
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay and was perfect for what I was looking for. It was a comfortable and cozy accommodation. I would stay here again.
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was definitely cozy. I worried about being cold in the basement, but the heater works well and we were plenty warm. The queen bed was comfortable and my mother said the twin in the private room was as well. The washer/dryer was handy. I liked that we had a private entry."
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Second time staying here, which shows what I think about the place. Great proximity to BYU-I’s campus for visiting friends and family, and Bryce is very responsive if you have questions :)"
2021-10-01,4.0,Stayed about a week,Great deal. Nice and clean.
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"That was great spot, close to the mountains"
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Bryce was a great host. Communication was very clear before and throughout our stay. We have everything we need for our trip.
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great little apartment close to campus. Excellent value. It is a basement so you can hear the people above, but just normal living noises."
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very clean and close to campus.
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Nice, small, cozy private studio. It was in a good location near BYU-I and some local parks, shops, & restaurants. I'd say my only complaint was that the beds didn't have the most supportive pillows for your head and neck, but other than that, my friend and I had a good time."
2021-08-01,4.0,Stayed about a week,Small basement apartment. No kitchen but it has a microwave and fridge.
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"You get what you pay for - in a generally good way. This place was nothing fancy, but we didn't need that. There were a few things I didn't expect that we ran into: Although I knew it was a basement apartment, I had not prepared for a fairly steep set of stairs (especially for my elderly mother). Also, being from the south, I expected there to be air conditioning. If it was there, I didn't see a way to control it. But, these things were manageable - and should not have thrown me for a loop at all. Bryce does provide large box fans which kept the air moving, and the stairs are well lit. Little things made it nice, including larger size, plush towels. All in all, nothing fancy, but something just right. Thank you Bryce!"
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great location, easy to get to everything around! Super easy for sleep if you are going to be out and about doing things!"
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great host. Good communication
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Perfect for small trips! My friends and I needed a place to stay for a few days and it was well priced, a nice stay, and the host had great communication!"
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Everything was as expected from the description. Having laundry in the unit was nice and Bryce also provided two fans which helped keep the place cool. His communication was outstanding. Answered any questions I had very quickly and even reached out one day to see how my stay was going.
2021-07-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Very great apartment
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great place to stay near Yellowstone. Bryce was very responsive through the whole trip. The parking spot is easily accessible, and the entry to the basement is convenient since it doesn't go through the rest of the building. Everything was clean and in good condition. The shower was fine but the showerhead is very low, making it somewhat difficult to use if you're tall. The light switch in the bathroom is in a confusing location. I don't remember if there was A/C, but the temperature was comfortable. The two beds are separated by a door, which is helpful when traveling with someone who snores."
2021-07-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,Great place! Very modest and nothing fancy but it’s a good deal for what you pay for. Has no AC but we stayed in July and it was fine as there were two box fans provided and we were only there at night.
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,It a cozy location. Host are really great in keeping with you and making sure you are doing great.
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Bryce is a great host, very flexible. The apartment is very comfortable.
I recommend."
2021-07-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"Bryce is a great host, very nice and do his best to make guest happen. response time is very short and prompt!!"
2021-06-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Stayed to be near Grand Teton and Yellowstone without the outrageous rates of actually staying at the park. Great value for location to the parks. Washer / dryer machine was a plus. Could be a bit noisy since In basement with a family upstairs. Other than that I would definitely recommend for a place to lay your head after a full day of adventuring.
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Everything was as advertised. Host even brought a box fan over after we checked in for us to use if we got too hot. Very impressed!
2021-06-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,As advertised. No surprises.
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great location for both Yellowstone and Grand Teton! Bryce was easy to communicate with and we had a seamless check in/out experience.
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"A great space with value! Bryce’s space was perfect for what we needed, a place to lay our heads after exploring nearby national parks. He was great to communicate with. We would stay again!"
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,Enjoyed my stay and enjoyed the privacy.
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great location and was a wonderful stay! Bryce was very helpful and communicative !
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We came for a weekend to visit friends in Rexburg, and Bryce's place was perfect for our needs. It was very clean, and having a mini fridge was extremely convenient for us. Bryce messaged us a few times to make sure we had everything we needed during our stay. Overall a great experience!"
2021-05-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,First off Bryce was amazing and so accommodating! The place is conveniently located an hour and a half from YellowstoneNP.The pictures are accurate.The place doesn’t have AC but they provided a fan when I needed! My only issue was the shower was tiny and kind of gross looking. But small price to pay for the location and price.
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Such a cute spot to stay. Great location! Clean and Bryce was so helpful! Will be back
2021-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Nice place right next to campus - super convenient if you are in town visiting friends or family there!
2021-04-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had an enjoyable stay, and Bryce was incredibly nice & accommodating! The price is appropriate for what you’re getting. Our only complaint is that the floors are very thin, so we could easily hear the neighbors above. Other than that, our stay was great!"
2021-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Conveniently located to BYUI. Made dropping my daughter off at school easier for me. Quick communication response.
2021-04-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"The listing is very accurate. This is a basement apartment and as such has issues associated with basements. However, this place was very clean and well maintained. We especially liked the fact that it included a washer and dryer. The heating system took some getting used to but that is not a problem with the listing. Bryce went out of his way to make our stay great."
2021-03-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Excellent place to stay. Had everything we needed and was in a great location.
2021-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Super easy to find and a close location to lots of places to eat. Checking in was nice and easy and the place was super clean. I definitely recommend staying here.
2021-02-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Bryce’s place was fantastic. I really enjoyed having a private bathroom and a washer and dryer. It is very close to BYU-I campus, which makes it very convenient. Bryce always got back to questions very quickly. I taught classes on ZOOM , and the wifi was great. I highly recommend this place."
2021-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Bryce’s place was so perfect! My friend and I only stayed for 2 nights, but if we go to Rexburg again we want to stay here. The location was great, the place was so clean, and the beds were so comfortable."
2021-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"It's a spacious, clean and very comfortable place"
2021-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Bryce's place was nice and it had all of what we needed for a good stay.
2021-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Bryce's place is perfect for anyone visiting campus. It's literally 2 blocks. The place had everything I needed and could have slept 2 adults and 1 child easily. Can't beat the value. Just be aware there is no parking on the street at night without a permit, but if you only have one vehicle there is off-street parking."
2021-01-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,Shower floor was pretty disgusting. Other than that it was a great value!
2021-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I loved how close this is to BYUI. The neighborhood is very quiet, but close enough to easily walk to campus or visit my daughter's apartment. I was glad I didn't have to depend on the visitor parking on campus."
2021-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Super quick at responding. Easy to find. Greta wifi and heat! Very much recommend!

2020-11-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Amazingly cozy and convenient! I was able to park my rental car easily and the bed was very, very comfy."
2020-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is a nice little place. This was our second time staying here. Last time was for a weekend, this time was for 5 days. We really like that it is our own private living space. It is in a basement but there is a separate entry from outside and you are provided your own parking space right at the top of the stairs.
Because this stay was longer we really appreciated having the mini fridge and microwave for meals and the washer and dryer was very convenient. Also, the WiFi is great. My husband worked online during the days with no problem. The shower is a little small, but works fine and has good water pressure. We would definitely stay here again in the future."
2020-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great stay!
2020-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,It was a great place for me and my friend that came down to stay and to visit our friends that were in college and that we could meet with them right there and not have to travel far for activities as well
2020-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This was a great place to sleep for out of towners! Great value for what was offered.

2020-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We needed a place to crash for a night and this place was great for just that. We could hear footsteps from the tenants above but that didn’t bother us at night. The shower is on the smaller side but the place was clean and the host was very responsive.

2020-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Bryce's place read great. Exactly what I needed for my night in Rexburg
2020-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Space is very basic, which is just what we were looking for at this price. Our son slept on the twin bed. It was nice to have a separate space for him. Washer and dryer worked well. We appreciated the provided paper plates and plastic utensils."
2020-06-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Not the best, but good. I liked the good quality plastic ware and I had plenty of hot water. It needed vacuuming and the lamp was dusty and missing a bulb. The twin mattress tilted to one side, but wasn't bad. It was cold in the basement but the heaters worked well."

Roku TV with most streaming services already logged in was wonderful, and water bottles in the fridge were a very nice touch. Beds were very comfortable, and everything was spotless clean. Bryce was a very communicative host and made my stay completely painless. I can't recommend this place enough."
2020-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,It is a great apartment in a great quiet neighbourhood. The apartment was in sparking great condition and it was really clean. Great service from Bryce. It would of been great if there were utensils such as forks and plates but apart from that everything was great.

2020-01-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,"This little place is clean and very cute. The only problem was the noisy tenants upstairs which may change in the future so I gave it 5 stars! The twin bed is uncomfortable but maybe a child wouldn’t notice? The queen bed, sheets, blankets etc were wonderful!"
