2024-04-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"The place was wonderful and clean! Upon arriving the temperature in house was 75 with a lock box over thermostat. I reached out and was told cannot go below 73 due to a previous electric bill being high. That is not comfortable for me and my family. The issue was resolved and she came and turned down to 70.
Would have just liked to have known that there was a restriction on what temperature could be at booking."

Definitely worth everything !!!!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Angelique’s house is beautiful, comfortable and very clean! The back patio was wonderful to sit in the mornings with a cup of coffee (which was provided by Angelique!) and just listen to the peacefulness and birds. This is a highly recommended host!"

2023-12-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Good location clean & comfortable
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Very nice house, nice bottle of wine and comfy bed!"
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Such a lovely home in a peaceful and quiet neighborhood close to restaurants and shops but still secluded for privacy. Angelique was very helpful and responsive with our late check in due to unexpected travel delays. Upon arrival after a long day it was so refreshing to come into this home to find it spotlessly clean with absolutely gorgeous decor with everything we could possibly need for our long weekend getaway. The bedrooms were spacious and very comfortable and the master bathroom has a relaxing spa atmosphere. We will definitely recommend The Mediterranean Villas to friends and family and look forward to the next opportunity to stay again when in the area. Thank you for a great experience’

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"We had a great stay at Angelique's place! Everything was as advertised and more. It's a very beautiful property and one we would definitely come back for again. I appreciate the extra mile she went by getting a grill for the property as I had made a request for it. Everyone of my messages were returned promptly and very informative. We felt at home there and appreciate the fact that she wanted our stay to go well, which it did! Thank you very much for sharing your beautiful home!
Thanks,
Marty S."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,This is a beautiful and cozy home in a nice neighborhood. Angelique was a great host and communication was awesome. Thank you for everything!
2023-06-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"This was a perfect home to stay with my family! We didn’t do much cooking, so I can not speak on the kitchen cookware, but the Keurig was a plus. The backyard was a nice size for activities! The lawn could be kept up better, and their could be more guest toiletries, as well as complimentary items other than the normal body wash, shampoo, and conditioner. Other than that, the house was very nice, very very clean and the host answered all of our questions! It was a very peaceful stay, neighbors were friendly and nice. Will be back, thank you for sharing your home."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"We had a wonderful stay at the villa! The home was so comfortable an inviting. The master bedroom is so luxurious, especially the shower! Loved the extra touches such as the bottle of wine and the shower products. The shops are just a short 5 minute drive down the road and you can even have groceries delivered. The back yard was nice for morning coffee and the house is well taken care of. Would love to stay again next time we are in town!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"absolutely gorgeous home. the price was amazing. my only issue which is just a personal preference, was that the rooms were a lot warmer than the rest of the house. But again that is just a personal preference. other than that I would highly recommend this home."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We enjoyed our one night stay, the house was welcoming and clean. Master bedroom bed was so comfortable & I loved the shower. My only complaint is that we spent very little time in the house! We attended a family function & spent only a few hours there. Check in was at 3pm & checkout was at 11am, which is very standard….sure wish we had had more time. Great place!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"After reading the comments before booking, I thought some people may have been overzealous in their reviews. I was wrong! The pictures do not serve justice of how beautiful the home is! It is very spacious. It accommodated my family of 5 quite well. The host is also very responsive. Keeps you updated throughout the stay, usually responds within the hour (during normal hours) and a really nice person! For our next visit to Killeen, we will definitely book with Angelique again!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,The place was beautiful and easy to find. We felt right at home.
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We enjoyed our stay and Angelique was an outstanding host! She was very quick to respond to any and all messages, very friendly and her home was absolutely beautiful and clean! We have nothing negative to say about our experience, the home or the host! The house was located in a great neighborhood and close to about anything we needed! We HIGHLY recommend this place!"

2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,It was great! The home provided everything we needed and we were very comfortable
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We came to visit my fiance for his birthday and needed a ""homey"" place to stay. Angelique's place was perfect! Enough space for the kids to hang out and not feel bored, and ample space for me to relax and unwind as well. This house has my dream bathroom. The complimentary wine was a thoughtful touch, and having makeup removal cloths was great. The host was super sweet and responsive even though I had a ton of questions and did her best to accommodate my requests. We definitely plan on booking again when we can and look forward to another mini getaway."
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Angelique is a top notch host. We stay at a lot of home away from home lodges for work. This time around we had to stay an extra work day so I was at the last minute trying to find an AirBnB to jump to. She allowed us to check in early without any down time. The jacuzzi tub was the ultimate finish to a successful work trip not to mention the at home vibes this place has. We melted in the lush king size bed. She obviously rents out her place with a lot of thoughtfulness for the guest. I highly recommend her home
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We had a great stay at this house. The master bathroom is immaculate and the house was very well kept and clean. Will definitely be using again.
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Had a relaxing weekend at Angelique’s. It was a nice stay and looks exactly as pictured. Angelique was very friendly . Will most likely visit again soon.
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Amazing shower, clean, and relaxing!
Comfortable home! Made you want to grab a book and stay in!"
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Firstly I will say that this house was very nice, extremely clean. I would say the photos are inaccurate in that the house is actually even nicer in person. There is a lot of space and the office was a private additional place to study, with a chalkboard easel for children.
Two main things to consider:
1. It is located on the edge of town. This could be a pro if you want a quiet neighborhood, the road has a cul-de-sac so it’s good for walks/runs, no traffic, private. On the other hand, it’s so out of the way it takes at least 10 min to drive anywhere and was just as far from Fort Hood as Copperas Cove is. (15 min).
2. I would definitely recommend it for a couple. However with a lot of fragile decor, as well as the amenities being geared more towards 1-2 guests (small pots/pans, mini fridge, single serve coffee) it’s not set up for toddlers/large family. I think Angelique would agree it’s just not designed that way.
Angelique was very helpful and reached out, overall very pleased."
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Cute place and huge master bedroom/bathroom.
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is a beautiful property, the host communicated very well and everything was smooth. Thank you so much!"
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Very beautiful house. I enjoyed the jacuzzi tub and the walk through shower. Neat touches to an already beautiful home!
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Keisonna was a super responsive host. She was very helpful. Her place is a two-story duplex with three bedrooms upstairs. It was great for our family. I would consider it kid-friendly because the stairs are carpeted and the furniture is all safe.
2024-06-01,5.0,Group trip,We really enjoyed our time there! The host was friendly and helpful and we were glad to walk into a sparkling clean house that looked and smelled nice.

2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We visit Killeen regularly since we have family in the area. Typically we stay at a hotel closer to them, but the cost has gone up and quality has gone down. I’m so glad I looked into getting an AirBnb. The location was in a very quiet neighborhood and the inside of the home looked brand new. Cherry had done a beautiful job decorating. The whole house had a cool, gray and silver esthetic. We loved it! Beds were super comfortable, closets had hangers, plenty of towels, kitchen had major appliances and tye coffee maker included coffee pods. My Mom raved about the coffee! We had a great visit and will definitely plan to stay here on our next visit!"

Cherry is very friendly and knowledgeable! When messaging her I felt like I had known her forever! If you’re looking for a safe and relaxing stay definitely book Cherry’s place!

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Check-in was very easy. I had messaged the host prior to booking about checking in at 1am instead of 8am and he was perfectly okay with it. This place was absolutely beautiful and very comfortable. The host was very prompt with an issue we had at 2am and came to fix it. The home was very clean and the beds and furniture were very comfortable. We will never book another place if this one is available for future visits. The bathrooms were huge and fully stocked w/everything you could possibly need. This host literally thought of everything when it comes to what you will need for a stay away from home. The host is very friendly and communication was quick. I would 10/10 recommend this home to anyone who is visiting very spacious house. We had 4 Adults and 4 kids and we were not on top of each other. The kids even played outside in the back yard area.

2023-04-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,"We were in town for the weekend to attend a party honoring our Grandson's departure for Airforce boot camp. The property was a short 15 minute drive to our daughter's home. It is conveniently located near a large HEB grocery store, numerous restaurants, and mall shopping. I could not rate this property as 5 star due to the neighborhood which I rate as fair to good. That being said, we had no issues whatsoever. Sarah's property stands out as the neatest and most updated on the street. The interior - though dated in some ways and in need of a few minor repairs, was very clean and well appointed. All of our needs were met. I want to stress that we had a VERY GOOD stay and would certainly rent again in the future if Sarah will have us."

The piglets were an absolute joy to watch playing and the goats were even kind enough to let me pet them! Whether you're seeking relaxation, adventure, or simply a chance to be around cute farm animals, this tiny home was a gem that had it all. I can't wait to return for another stay!!"
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a wonderful time staying at The Hideaway! It is a beautiful property in a peaceful, rural setting. Michele is a spectacular hostess! From reservations to check-out, she provided excellent communication, made us feel at home and went the extra mile to provide special treats for our stay. This was our first time staying at her place, but it certainly won't be our last! What a treasure!"
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We were in town for a family funeral and Michele’s cottage was just the place we needed to unwind in in the evenings. Michele thought of everything that you could possibly need during your stay. We will 100% book again when back in town from Ohio. Thanks again Michele for your thoughtfulness and welcoming hospitality.
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Absolutely loved loved this place! Will be coming again for sure!!! I loved seeing all the animals and the stars are so bright at night! Lots of privacy and you’re still close to the shops and restaurants!
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This was the PERFECT local getaway! It looks exactly like the photos! I told Michele my boyfriend & I were celebrating our anniversary. It was so sweet of her to leave chocolates on the bed and put wine tumblers in the frig for us. That was such a special & personalized touch! Michele is EXTREMELY responsive and kind! We wish we could live at the Hideaway forever. This was a great experience! We will definitely be staying here again!

Thank you again!!"
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,What a beautiful location for a get away. I loved the dirt road entry. It couldn't have been more perfect for a get away. So peaceful and quiet.
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We absolutely loved staying here. It was about 10 minutes from restaurants which was perfect for the feeling of getting away but still being close enough to grab food and spend sometime in Killeen and Harker Heights. We visited family and this was the perfect amount of separation! We loved the animals and how quiet it was. We slept so peacefully and everything we needed for a comfortable stay was available to us from extra blankets to coffee for the morning. We will definitely try to stay here again in the future!
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"My husband and I stayed at Michele’s place this past weekend and it was perfect for us. The suite was extremely clean and even more beautiful than the photos!

Overall, Michele was an excellent host and we would enjoy another stay in the future."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,100% one of my favorite air bnb experiences I’ve had. I felt so much at home and so relaxed and yet so peaceful being there. The hideaway was so beautiful and the views of all the trees and animals and just not being in the city is to die for. Such a friendly atmosphere and hosts are so friendly and very attentive to make sure we had a great stay. Will definitely come back soon. Thank you Michelle !
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Spent our Honeymoon night at “The Hideaway” in the hilly, winding roads, rural area out of Killeen.
My daughter knew we wanted a quiet, relaxing place where we could sit on a porch & watch the sunset/sunrise. She found this place for us & handled all arrangements. She said Michele was gracious & accommodating, which we also found her to be later. The Hideaway is a Guesthouse on the far back property from the front main house where our host & her family live. It is completely furnished with everything you can think of in the way of household amenities. It's cozy, comfortable, quaint, relaxing & private …just our cup of tea.
The patio has little lights strung about overhead for those wanting to sit outside at night with just the right amount of light. Michele is a very thoughtful host…she even set up a little “Love” corner for us Honeymooners…with an illuminated “Love “ lamp/sign, a beautiful long-stemmed red rose and a bottle of red wine.
We wiil always remember our special night!"
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,This place is so beautiful and the perfect size for a couple! My boyfriend and I really enjoyed staying here and the whole family is nice and helpful!

2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,I had a great quick getaway here. It was close to some great fishing spots on the Lampasas River and was the perfect place to relax at after an afternoon on the river.
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"My husband and I needed a night away and we couldn't be happier with our stay. When we arrived, Michele's daughter greeted us and made sure we had what we needed along with making herself available if we had questions. As we drove in, we passed goats! A little later, we met Michele. She made sure that we were comfortable and made herself available in case we needed anything. I was so excited when she offered for us to pet and feed the goats. She showed us the rest of the farm where we saw the cutest piglets, pigs, ducks, chickens and dogs that she breeds. During our tour, we met her husband who was also very kind. The cabin was the cleanest AirBnB space I have ever stayed in- very relaxing. It's like a well laid out studio apartment. There was a Kitchenette with coffee, smart TV, reclining loveseat, comfy bed, large bathroom and outside was a large porch with string lights and a clear view of the stars. We will definitely be back in the future."

2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"A great spot in the country to relax and enjoy some lovely animals. Expect no less than great hospitality from Michele and her family. Along with this point, it is ideal to stay here with Killen TX minutes away and Austin just an hour south. You will love this oasis in the country and meet some lovely people who host this Air BnB."

2022-08-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Quiet and secluded with an open style guest cottage that is separated from the main home but a little close for me.

2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Everything was perfect in every way!! This was definitely our home away from home. We will be back and plan to stay many more times. Our children and grandchildren loved the game rooms and all this home had to offer. Andrew was very responsive to us at all times. We visited during Christmas and things could not have been any better than us being at home in N.C. The home was very spacious, clean, and updated. I’m so glad we booked with Andrew. He is honestly the greatest host EVER!!! There is nothing we would change or complain about our stay!!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We loved Ty’s place! Tidy and clean and done in tasteful colors and decor too. We walked in to a wonderfully clean smelling place, the fan on and a cool temperature. We usually have a lot of equipment with us when we travel and Ty was nice enough to allow us to park our motorcycles in the garage which is a huge thing for us so it was extra brownie points for Ty! Ty was very responsive to all our questions and concerns. The place is close to many shops and restaurants and easy access to I-14 and I-35. If you’re waffling between places just go on and pick Ty’s place. You’ll not regret it!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Group trip,We stayed at Tyrone's place for a week and had an amazing stay! My son graduated from high school and it was literally only 6 minutes from where his dad house is so we constantly could go back and forth with no issues. When we first got there everything was clean and smelling really good. If you're looking for a peaceful and beautiful stay while in Killeen you should definitely look him up. My children and I were able to spend time together and really enjoy our stay. Anything we needed all it took was one message and he was right on it. Definitely would book again with him and we really enjoyed our stay!
2024-06-01,3.0,Group trip,"Space stated it sleeps 7; however, the double bed bunk on bottom was a broken futon with only 1 pillow and the top bunk was a twin. Both mattresses were extremely thin and uncomfortable. Bed frames and mattresses had stains and damaged wood. Our 7th guest had to sleep on the couch and additional pillows and blankets had to be purchased. Overall, due to not having responsive assistance from the host in navigating air conditioning and shower drain issues would not recommend."
2024-06-01,4.0,Stayed over a week,Kitchen was very well equipped. The shower in the main bedroom was great. Tyrone was responsive to sent messages.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The donut place around the corner has amazing kolaches and that alone is worth staying at this location again. the kitchen was more well stocked with kitchen essentials than a standard bnb. Will be booking again for our next trip to the area.

The home was immaculate, very comfortable, loved the decor, & was listed at an incredible price, especially for the size. The only tiny minor issue we had was with the TV remotes running out of batteries. But it was late & we didn't want to disturb anyone over something so small, so we made it work! We would love to stay here again if we ever need a place to stay in Killeen again."

2023-08-01,3.0,Stayed with a pet,"Rental is close to a lot of places to eat and shop. The house is well laid out and the bathrooms are a nice size. What I didn’t like was the lack of control of the a/c. I get that you want to make as much money on a rental verses spending a lot of money on bills, but it was over 100 outside and to be forced to have it at 76 during the day is miserable. We got up several times during the night to adjust it, but it said it would stay at that temperature for so long. Not acceptable for us."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Comfortable and clean
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Will definitely use this property again! Well appointed with TVs in each room, all appliances in working orderand crisp clean bedding in each room. The grill is a plus! child friendly and spacious for family travelers."

The beds were super comfy…so comfy that I’m now contemplating about getting a new bed myself! The water pressure in the showers was fabulous and because the house is temperature controlled, we didn’t feel sticky and muggy after we got out of the shower.
Tyrone was a great host, also. He sent me everything we needed to get into the house and checked in with us throughout the stay to make sure everything was going smoothly.
We’ll absolutely stay here again when we come back to Killeen to visit our solider. If you’re either coming to Killeen to stay awhile or just passing through and need somewhere to stay for the night, you should stay here, too!"

Would definitely recommend to anyone in the area, and will definitely stay again next time we’re in the area."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Beautiful home in a quiet neighborhood. I really enjoyed that their were board games, especially since we had our children with us. We were within 10 mins of every place we needed to go to."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Excellent service and responses. Only (very minor) issue we had was from the master bedrooms toilet. When reaching out to the host, he made sure to rectify the issue ASAP - however we still had some issues even after the plumbing came. We ending up primarily using the other restroom which wasn’t too big of a deal.
The beds / couch was VERY comfortable and the location was great. Overall genuinely pleased with our experience!"

2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Good location. The place was clean and well maintained. It has the usual AirBNB dings and dents but it didn’t look trashy. We had a very minor problem with the shower head, it was spraying a small
Amount if water from the joint. It didn’t effect anything, but it got fixed that day. Management checked in on us every step of the process. The closest hotel was twice the price for 1 less bed, one less bathroom, and way fewer square feet. Would rent again."

My one and only issue was the washer and dryer. We went on a hike during our stay and wanted to wash our super dirty clothes, but the washer and dryer were both full of sheets and towels. We opted to not do laundry bc we didn’t know what to do with the laundry. But it wasn’t a major issue for us. We would definitely come back and stay here again."

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The host was very responsive to questions before arrival as well as during our stay. Nice neighborhood for walking.
The only thing was the air conditioner right above the bed and the ceiling fan blowing down on us. Once we figured out the proper temp for the air and reversing the direction of the ceiling fan it was okay."

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"BluStudio hosted by Janelle is a hidden gem. From the moment you step in you can tell that Janelle put lots of thought into making this place the perfect home away from home. This place is nicely decorated and very clean. She went above and beyond to make sure that the guest has everything needed to make it an enjoyable stay. I loved how she provided snacks and drinks.

The host has truly mastered the art of hospitality. From the snacks and sparkling wine on the table to the personalized welcome note, it was clear that they went above and beyond to make us feel at home. The amenities provided were top-notch, and we were pleasantly surprised by the abundance of little extras, from a well-stocked kitchen to a selection of coffee flavors.
The decor was tastefully chosen, creating a cozy and inviting atmosphere. We loved the comfortable beds, plush linens, and the carefully curated bookshelf that added a touch of personality to the space.

2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,I’ve stayed here 2 separate nights and I’ll definitely stay again. The bed is COMFORTABLE A++
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"If you’re lookin for something simple, yet super clean, this is it. I only stayed for one night, but I think it’s perfect for 1 or 2 people to feel very comfortable. It was quiet and peaceful. I enjoyed myself. It was pretty private considering the garage was turned in to the guest house and it’s all one building. I didn’t hear or see anyone living in the home at all. I’m a chronic vaper too, so I stepped outside to the smoking area quite a few times. Everything you need to feel clean and have a full belly is provided. Plenty of kitchenware is provided to cook a meal and the toiletries were above and beyond. I would definitely stay here again.!"

2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Janelle's place was just the ideal place for my husband and I. The place was easy to locate and the surrounding area is close to Fort Hood and many familiar chain based stores and restaurants. I never communicated with Janelle because everything was spelled out for us and easy to understand, so there was no need to. This place is fabulous for the price. I plan to stay here again when I visit Killeen.
I will say that the place is more ideal for 2 adults and maybe a child. Three adults for a stay longer than a couple of days won't be as comfortable."

The BluStudio was the perfect size and location for our visit to family in Killeen. The bed was extremely comfortable, the availability of a washer and dryer was a great bonus and the well-stocked kitchen and pantry guaranteed anything we needed was available as well as anything we could have forgotten was there!
We enjoyed a very private and quiet shared space - we would have never guessed the host(s) we’re home or on the property!
We will definitely return to The BluStudio for future stays in Killeen and recommend other family members who plan to visit Killeen to stay with Janelle at The BluStudio!"
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I wish I could give MANY MORE stars!! This was by far the nicest and cleanest place that we have ever stayed at! Janelle saved our trip and accepted our last minute reservation at such a late hour in the night. It’s located in a very quiet and safe neighborhood.

She always replied quick, with the info requested and very respectful. I give her place a 5 star in everything and if it was possible to give a 10 that would be my rating. Place is very clean, bed super comfy, kitchen well equipped with everything you can need and more. There was goodies in the pantry and cold water and soda which was very nice since temp outside was 93°. Area is very silent at all times which I loved. This place is so cozy that just calls to stay there all day. Will definitely be booking again and recommend 100%."
2022-05-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"Great place! Very clean! Nice decor of the room and loved the snacks and drinks that are provided for free and the amenities she provides in case you need them. But There are a ton of rules to follow I was nervous the whole time I’d mess up and not follow a Rule and be charged a up charge fine as stated in her rule book she has. Other than that I’d recommend staying here, if you are a tidy person who doesn’t mind some rules to follow."

2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"“Excellent Place!”… the location is remarkable with so much variety of restaurants, you’ll never eat the same thing (unless you choose). The place is well stocked with all your needs to call it “ a home away from home”. The communication is beyond top notch. If I sent a message, it was answered within 5 minutes. The location is very quite and relaxing, I’ll definitely stay again."

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,The place was clean and accommodating.
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Very Responsive and Private area , Quiet Neighborhood."
2024-03-01,3.0,Stayed with a pet,"Our stay turned into one nights to a couple, the only thing that honestly bothered us was that it rained majority of our stay so to get in & out the gate the mud was annoying but overall nothing was too bad. The host is very responsive and very kind ! Will stay again :)"
2024-03-01,3.0,Stayed with a pet,"House: fantastic! My 3 year old loved the pull out bed and jacuzzi tub! Place was perfect location for us to house hunt and get around.
Yard: Not great… as a dog owner, we were excited to see the Airbnb listed a fenced in yard for our 2 pups to have their own outdoor space. It’s one of the reasons we chose it. But that was not the case. The yard was wildly overgrown and there fence was falling apart to the point that there were at least 3 openings my 40 lb dogs could escape from. It’s a disservice to the customer to list this Airbnb as “dog friendly” if you’re not willing to maintain the outdoor space. It put a huge damper on what was otherwise a great stay"
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Good
2024-02-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"The air bnb space was incredible, very cute set up. Unfortunately we did have some issues. The communication was not great, responses were very slow and I never received an answer to know if there was a washer and dryer for more clarification. We had a struggle with check in, but Paul did rectify that he apologized and let us know he would do a 30 dollar credit. When I went to run the bath, because the main thing that stuck out to me was the jacuzzi tub but the water was luke warm, so we were unable to use it.
This air bnb entrance is very difficult to get to if you are physically disabled. I am on a scooter due to my ankle and struggled getting through."

2024-02-01,3.0,Stayed about a week,"Nice little area, fairly quiet and very clean room. The gate to the entrance needs to be replaced and maybe an update to the bedding but that’s really all I have for constructive feedback. I’d definitely come back for a second visit and would recommend to friends as well"
2024-01-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,"Paul was great with helping us check in, and the guest home was very clean. How ever the neighborhood is not very nice, there were people slamming car doors and driving around at 3am waking up our dogs to bark for an hour. I’m not familiar with the area but I would not stay again based off of that alone. Besides the neighborhood Paul’s home and service was fantastic."

2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"I am thrilled to share my wonderful experience of staying at a local Airbnb that turned out to be a hidden gem.

2023-11-01,2.0,Stayed with a pet,"Gate was broken, my dog escaped through the missing fence posts and openings and didn’t realize it as I was guarding the entrance gate that also was broken so couldn’t shut. Host made the heater situation right, no heat and was 30 degrees outside, he ordered a space heater. Bed was nice and so was the bathroom. The space is their garage converted into a unit and nice inside."

2023-10-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,"Safe, clean, comfy bed, and TV access. But there is smoke smell, unclear/ slow response, and tall grass. They allow pets but the yard is not private, the wood fence is not 100% secure, you can’t close the gate; so basically you have to leash walk your dog so you can stay in the side yard."

Paul is amazing!
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Paul's place was conveniently located only 4 minutes away from where our family were gathering for my father-in-law's funeral.
Paul's place provided a much-needed space for us to get away.

I traveled from California, where I also live in a quiet neighborhood, so this felt like home away from home (minus the amazing low taxes *cough * cough). The house is extremely clean, both inside and out, and was perfect for me and my 2 boys (ages 11 and 12). They ranted and raved about the environment the entire time, quiet and cozy, being their words choice.
Absolutely enjoyed our stay!"
