Check in was seamless, the location was easy to find (minus the construction, no fault of hers) and she checked in to make sure we didn't need anything. We visit Montrose to see our son and grandkids and have used hotels and a couple of other Airbnb locations in the past. Going forward we hope to only use Cat's Airbnb when we come in to Montrose to stay as it was by far the best experience and the most comfortable stay; we could enjoy our time with our grandkids in the spacious living room and it was just really perfect!
Thank You Cat for such a wonderful stay!"

2023-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Cat has made this place so easy to find, check in, and get cozy. It was a very private home, with a beautiful walking path right out the front door that takes you to a big park with a playground which was perfect for our family with littles. Cat was quick to respond with communications, receptive to feedback regarding the comfort of the mattresses (which she said she’s looking into), and overall very sweet and kind. 5 stars we recommend if you’re looking for a place that gives you great privacy, is only a 5 minute drive to whatever you may need, and has access to quick walkable parks/playgrounds.

2023-06-01,5,Group trip,I'd definitely recommend Cat's place if you are in need of accomodations in Montrose! It was very spacious and clean. Perfect for our family of 6. The neighborhood was newer and very walkable. Cat provided great instructions on how to get in and what to expect.

2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My sister was in the ICU in Montrose. Cat's place was a quiet, clean, comfortable place to go at the end of pretty grueling days.

I loved all the little touches like the artwork on the walls and the basket in the bathroom with lots of things a traveler might need."

2023-04-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Nice two bedroom, co-joined living area with kitchenette. Quite location in a residential area about 5 minutes from main streets. We enjoyed our stay, however, my wife is sensitive to strong smells. When we arrived, there were air fresheners placed in every room which was a bit overwhelming. We just placed them on the porch during our say. Lots of room for less than the price of a decent hotel so very good value."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"We spent a night here with a same-day booking. Cat was very kind to host us on such a short notice. The place was super pretty and comfortable, as well as spotlessly clean. Thank you for having us!"

2023-03-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Great location, easy to get to and quiet, clean neighborhood. You will get a nice quiet good nights sleep at Cats home. We came for a week to work at our sons shop and I especially enjoyed the good shower head for a nice strong spray with really hot water. It felt so good. She also provided good quality towels. It’s a nice clean, cozy and comfy home. The little kitchen area was a big help in saving us money on not having to eat out. We would stay here again on future visits."

2023-01-01,4,Group trip,"Was perfect for our one night stay on our travels! Clean and efficient, keep in mind that it shares a wall with the main house but Cat and her family were very quiet!"
2023-01-01,4,Group trip,We stayed for one night and the experience was awesome. The neighborhood is surrounded with beautiful sceneries for walk and the home itself is really good. There were few minor glitches like expired products in the kitchen but Cat sorted that out immediately. The hosts are very responsive and kind making the experience more joyful. There are games to play which makes it more lively to stay. The walls are a bit thin i.e. you can hear the sound of tap water in the bathroom from bedroom pretty loudly but overall the stay was really pleasant and fun.

And we especially enjoyed relaxing on the back patio after spending the day exploring. We would stay here again if we ever return to the area."

2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Cat and Mike's home was very well equipped. Everything was great for my family of four. Cat and Mike were very friendly and the shared kitchen was never a problem. Many amenities in the bathroom for the taking. We would gladly stay again if we come back to the area.

2022-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Great stay!
2022-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Mike and Cat were amazing hosts! This particular trip back home to Montrose was a last minute one due to the recent passing of my Grandfather. My mom accompanied me on this trip and she had nothing but good things to say about her experience as well. I was able to bring my dog, which really made things easier so I didn't have to plan someone to watch him back home. Mike and Cat made the stay very enjoyable considering the circumstance. They were very responsive and if I had any questions, due to this being my first airbnb, they had answers. They even made chili and corn bread on one of the nights, which was delicious. Definitely hosts I would consider on another trip back to visit family in Montrose."

2022-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Nice home and great hosts. Provided lots of little extras to make sure the stay was comfortable and nice including some snacks and toiletries in case we forgot something. I always worry about a shared place - esp. when I have my dogs with me, but the space is private enough that we rarely crossed paths and Cat and Mike were both lovely and helpful when we did."
2022-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Couldn't give enough stars. Place was very clean, plenty of space, and very dog friendly. Cat made us feel very welcome, and we hope to stay again next ski season!"

2022-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Wonderful house to stay with family away from home. House has all the amenities and entertainment, which will make you feel as home away from home. The hosts are friendly and cooperative! House very clean, and the only thing I am sad is we didn’t have much time to stay in it, as our travel plan was huge! Will definitely recommend!"
2022-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Cat and Mike were absolutely fantastic. We stayed in their AirBnb over the New Year while they were also there and barely heard/saw them. When we did encounter each other throughout the days, it was a pleasure chatting with them about the area and playing with their adorable pup ❤️
The house itself felt like a home away from home, and being musicians we were thrilled to find a piano and 12-string guitar waiting to be played! Another bonus is the massive flat screen and reclining couch to watch a movie while you eat; and if you want to cook, they have supplied EVERYTHING you need in a kitchen to cook an extravagant meal.
The decor is minimalistic yet charming, not too much not too little. Lots of play room for our own pup and a beautiful fenced backyard to hang out in (if its not 5°!). The home was spotless when we arrived 👍
I would highly recommend staying with Cat and Mike should you decide to visit Colorado, they are wonderful people and will accommodate you greatly! When my girlfriend and I decide to return to that amazing state, this will be the place we choose to stay! 🥰"

We appreciated their hospitality and would stay there again."

The location was convenient to coffee shops and restaurants in Montrose and the neighborhood was quiet with easy street parking. The house is very comfortable and clean. It had everything we needed for our short stay. We did not have a need for the kitchen while we were there, but it had new appliances that would be ideal for anyone looking to cook. Michael was helpful and communicative throughout our stay. He sent ample information ahead of time to make sure we had everything we needed to check in easily and we arrived to some welcome snacks he'd provided. We had a late request for a later check out and he very kindly accommodated us. Montrose does not have a ton of affordable options for travelers and Michael's place is definitely a great option for anyone looking for something cozy and spacious!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was our second time staying at Michael’s home in Montrose, and even it being one year later, it is still amazing, comfortable, clean and impressive. Michael is a phenomenal host! I will be staying here every time I come to Montrose! Thank you, Michael!"

2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"This Airbnb was the cleanest places we have ever stayed in. Location was great, only 3 mins from food and not far from Black Canyon. Neighborhood was quiet, we walked around. There is a drive-in move theater down the road too, which is nice. Michael was very responsive and helpful. Again, one of the cleanest places we have stayed in, it is a little pricey but I’ll take it because it was clean, location is great, and Michael was a great host."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Michael’s Airbnb truly is a home away from home! It feels comfortable as soon as you walk inside. You will find any amenity you might need during your stay. I would happily stay here again :)
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Michael’s place was very cute and extremely clean. It was in a quiet and good location being a few blocks off Main Street to be able to get to restaurants in town, as well central to a number of other great locations nearby. Would certainly recommend his place to others."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great stay in Montrose. For us, it was perfect for our trip to Black Canyon of the Gunninson, with less than a 30 minute drive to the visitors center. Michael’s place is very cozy, would definitely recommend for your visit!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,Spotlessly clean and neat and comfortable - a good place to spend a night - pretty little porch and front yard. Great communication with Michael!
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This little cottage was the perfect place to stay in charming Montrose. Close to restaurants,services and the old town yet it was so peaceful and quiet. After a day of hiking at nearby Black Canyon of the Gunnison NP, it was so nice to relax on the porch with a glass of wine and cook dinner in the well stocked kitchen. One standout was the capacious washer and dryer a luxury for us road warriors! We highly recommend Michaels place when visiting Montrose and surroundings."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"Excellent in every way. Unbelievable, actually! Definitely 5 stars! Thank you for everything, Michael! My daughter & I loved it!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We stayed in this beautiful little house , everything was perfect , very clean , very nice thank you"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very much enjoyed my stay at this place. I was in Montrose for a work event and this spot worked well for me and my colleague. The house is close to everything and is just a 20ish minute drive from Black Canyon. Very comfortable and had a cute backyard as well. I would very likely stay again if ever traveling back to Montrose.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Michael’s place was just as described! Very close to many things to do and a short drive away from Ouray, Black Canyon, etc. The place had everything the 4 of us needed to feel right at home!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"This was a great place with a great kitchen area. We only stayed the one night, but decided to stay in and cook because it was so well equipped.
The bed was comfortable. Plenty of space and nice front porch."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,This little jewel was amazing! So clean and welcoming! Michael was amazing and very responsive to a question I had. ♥️
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was a really wonderful little house. We stayed for the weekend so that we could go hiking at the Black Canyon of the Gunnison. We got in on Friday night, relaxed and got up early to hike on Saturday. Then, in the afternoon, we came back to the house to relax and take a nap before going back out again - it was perfect for that! I really recommend this place! I'd like to come back in the winter, I think it would be very cozy."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great clean
Well equipped"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The location is excellent. Near restaurants and highway to Black Canyon. Neighborhood was quiet. House was cute and clean.
Easy to find and get anywhere in Montrose.
Michael was very responsive."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great place and location. The property was very clean and the linens and towels were soft and good quality. Michael was a great host, would definitely stay here again."
2023-08-01,4,Stayed with kids,"This was a last-minute booking due to the Chemical smell at the local hotel Greentree Inn Montrose. The chemicals made my Daughter and myself sick. This was a cute, clean house. We would have initially booked something like this over the hotel but the prices in this area are... insane. We didn't pay this much for a house in Hawaii! This was not a good value especially when check out is 9 am. We will avoid staying in this area again due to the outrageous prices."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a very comfortable time at Michael's place. Everything was clean. The beds are extremely comfortable. It was hard to get up in the morning. This place was close to Black Canyon of Gunnison NP, about 45 minutes from the beautiful town of Ouray and 1.5 hours from Telluride. So it was quite convenient for our week since we ended up visiting all three places. We wish the fridge could get colder though. Our drinks were just barely cold, despite sitting in the fridge for a few days. But it wasn't that big of a deal. We would definitely come back here again."
2023-08-01,4,Stayed one night,Check out time is a bit too early when you’ve been traveling.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,Michaels place was super clean and homey.. It was absolutely perfect for what we needed! Wish we could’ve stayed longer.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"We were traveling and did not plan on renting an Airbnb but the hotels were mostly all booked. Very last minute we asked to book Michaels house with an hour’s notice. We arrived to a house with lamps on, flowers and a flag hanging on the porch and most importantly- a spotless house! The neighborhood was quiet and we got a good nights rest instead of being disturbed in a loud hotel! Michael was very attentive, responsive, and friendly!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"Easy, clean, nice"

2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"Easy to find with clear instructions on how to enter. Michael is very responsive and easy to reach. Our party of 3 had everything we needed for a comfortable stay. The location is within a few minutes drive to the highways and town center and only about 15 minutes from the entrance to the national park. We were heading back home to Denver from a stay in southwestern Colorado and wanted to break the drive into two separate days. The fact that we were able to spend some time in the nearby Black Canyon was an added bonus. Well maintained and spotless, we highly recommend Michael's place."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"Michaels place was exactly what we were looking for! It was clean, quiet, perfectly stocked and was the perfect spot for us to visit Black Canyon! We will definitely stay here again the next time we are in town."

2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"Michael was an incredible host, extremely attentive and kind. The space was beautiful, much bigger than it looks in the photos! Decorated with taste and stocked with everything you may need. Nice fenced in yard in the back with kitchen/sliding door access. Felt very safe (I travel often as a single female), really appreciated the exterior cameras and door code/locking system. Thank you, Michael! I hope to be back soon!"

The home was clean and quiet and communication was perfect! We walked a short walk into town to grab pizza at Colorado Boy (so good)! We will definitely stay again when passing through!
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The house was wonderful and equipped with everything needed for an enjoyable stay. The location was great. We walked to the downtown shops and breweries. Michael is a great host and responded quickly to questions.

2022-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"Exactly as described. Michael is a thorough, excellent host. You won't regret staying here."
2022-08-01,5,Stayed over a week,Great place. The house was perfect for my girlfriend. Exceptionally clean and quiet. She felt quite safe and comfy while staying there. While she did not use the kitchen she said it contained most everything she would need if she did. The house is in a quiet neighborhood and not too far from anything you might need. We want to rent it again in the fall.
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a very nice stay at this property which is pretty much exactly as described and pictured. The house is comfortable, well equipped, and is in a fairly good location. Street parking is plentiful, and the neighborhood seems nice enough. The house was VERY clean, and the kitchen had everything we needed to prepare meals each day. Michael's communication is excellent which made the entire process seamless.
There are a few items of note which may be worth consideration.
We could not find a hair dryer even though one is listed in the amenities. We did not mention it to the host while we were there because it was not a big deal for this stay, but you may want to consider travelling with your own just in case.
The shower is comically small. Think of something you might find in an RV. It did serve its purpose, and I guess is somewhat common in a 1920's home, but it could be an issue for larger adults.
Finally, a 9:00 am check out is pretty early. So, make sure that works with your plans. I imagine having extra time between guests helps Michael to maintain the cleanliness of his home which, in the end, is probably worth the sacrifice.
In all, this was a great experience, and I would not hesitate to recommend this property to my family or friends.
Thank you Michael!"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great place. Clean, beautiful with lots of amenities."

HUGE kitchen, two dining room tables enormous washing machine and dryer. So big I couldn’t get the laundry out, tall husband to the rescue. Lovely comfy couches and a big tv. Not only that the bed is comfy and the place is warm as toast. Michael is an excellent communicator, and made sure everything was sparkling clean for us. Only five minutes to grocery stores and great coffee. As well we visited two excellent museums in town. Highly recommend the Ute Museum of Indigenous culture, and the Wild West Museum. Both had amazing exhibitions. We feel blessed to have been able to stay in your cottage, Michael."

2019-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Michael’s home is bright, fresh, and clean. The original wood floors are gorgeous. I loved having a full sized (huge) washer and dryer in the kitchen. So much to do in the area. Hiking and fly fishing filled our time as well as trips to Grand Junction and Telluride. Great part of CO, great home to come back to at the end of the day."

- Visited Black Canyon National Park and did some great hikes
- Rented a pontoon boat on Blue Mesa Reservoir
- Viewed wildflowers and did some shopping in Crested Butte
- Played 18 holes of golf at Cobble Creek
- Walked to nearby restaurants in Montrose.
The house itself is pretty basic - as advertised, and the location was great. The size was perfect for three of us including my 11-yo. daughter. There was a nice selection of movies and games, and the back porch is pleasant for sitting and having a drink or playing cards. Check-in was easy with a smart lock, and Michael checked in with us a couple of times to make sure that we had everything we needed. Overall a good value and experience."
2019-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"House is very good, very clean and had everything as told.
Only thing that wasn’t upto the mark was that there was one bathroom and it’s door wasn’t working."
2019-07-01,5,Stayed one night,Take note of the 9 am check out. It caught us a little by surprise. But host allowed us a little extra time to pack up.

Located about 20 to 25 minutes from the south rim of the Black Canyon visitor center and very close to town for any groceries or restaurants. The place is beautifully decorated and also felt very homey. Very quiet location and I’m a very light sleeper. The only regret I have was not spending more time at the place!"
2019-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This is a super place-beautifully decorated and very clean- has everything you need for a comfortable stay. Nice walk into town-pizza and beer at Colorado boy!

The location is in the center of town, so close to everything and has a nice walking path a block away. I was most impressed with how thoughtful Michael was both as a host planning the space and for communication. The house is very well stocked with amenities, including one of the best pantries I’ve had at an Airbnb (including plenty of gluten free foods which was great). He even remembered a fire extinguisher for emergencies! The locking system is also very easy and makes going in and out a breeze. I could keep going on and on about all the pros of Michael’s place, but better yet book the space and find out for yourself. It’s a great deal!"

The kitchen is really nice and spacious and had everything we needed for cooking including some basic staples that were great to have. The outdoor area is really nice too, with a big umbrella so we loved hanging out there in the shade. The bedrooms were comfortable and it was great having ceiling fans in every room. It was close enough to walk to some shops and restaurants. We walked over to get donuts one morning. We would definitely stay there again. Thanks!"

2019-03-01,5,Stayed one night,Superbly clean and comfortable space. Amazing host that went above and beyond to make sure I received an item I had forgotten. I look forward to my next stay!
2019-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This place is clean, has everything you need, is strategically organized and easy to find all the essentials. It is also in a central location. The back deck was functional and added an additional room so to say. The washer/dryer were very nice, little things I forgot at home and thought I’d have to buy were there, plenty of towels/blankets/pillows. The linens were nice and very clean. Felt like it had just been somewhat renovated and smelled fresh. It has a few little flaws but it ads to its charm.
Only thing that was a little off were the doors to the bedrooms, one was a folding door and offered little privacy/quiet, and the other door did not latch closed all the way which made it hard with a baby.
Still though, great place, great stay"

2018-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We had a great stay here while exploring the National Park. Being close to main street there is a bunch of restaurants within walking distance. First day we locked ourself out but Michael was there within minutes to let us back in. The place is very nice and cozy, we felt right at home!"
2018-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"A charming, comfortable house in a quiet street, but close to amenities. Also very close to Black Canyon of the Gunnison National Park. The house has a comfortable lounge, a large kitchen, and a bathroom between it and the main bedroom. The second bedroom seems to be getting decorated and was missing a bedside chest and chair, while we stayed. It was very quiet and peaceful, and had a lovely garden and sitting area. Montrose is a very nice town, well kept and with many nice shops. We enjoyed the Camp Robbers restaurant. Recommended rental."
2018-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place in Montrose! Would definitely stay there again.

Sparkling clean, all amenities, and excellent location close to Telluride, Ouray and the Black Canyon of the Gunnison. Best of all, Michael replied to our messages IMMEDIATELY after we sent them every single time. Thick towels, soft sheets, and fluffy duvets were icing on the cake. We couldn’t have asked for more and I would highly recommend this Home for a short or long getaway vacation"
2018-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The House was very clean and bed was very comfortable. Michael was quick to respond and answer questions. Check in instructions were clear.

It's the perfect place from which to explore Black Canyon of the Gunnison National Park. Many restaurants are closed on Sunday evening, just something to keep in mind. We ended up with a great meal at El Jimador, which had great margaritas, really good food and friendly staff and is only about 5 blocks away from Michael's place. We ate in the other night. We would definitely stay here again!"
2018-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Michael was an absolute blessing to work with-always fast and informative with his responses- and his place was PERFECT!

2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We loved staying in Greg's place! It was spotlessly clean, well-stocked with everything we needed, and the bed was super comfortable. The listing said it was recently remodeled and we were impressed with the high quality finishes, upscale appliances and comfortable layout. Parking was spacious and we appreciated the motion-detector lights when we returned after dark. Greg was very friendly and responsive and had some great tips in his guidebook - we really liked the CO Boy Brewery and Camp Robber restaurants, San Juan Coffee House and Backstreet Bagel. The location was great - we were walking distance to downtown Montrose, a short drive from the South Rim entrance of Black Canyon National Park and only 45 minutes from the town of Ouray (we loved hiking the challenging but amazing Perimeter Trail there). We would definitely stay at Greg's place again and highly recommend it to other travelers!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This property was great for our purpose of recruiting medical professionals to the area, with walking distance to the hospital and doctor's office. It was cute inside too. Thanks Greg!"
2023-10-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"I was surprised how quite the neighborhood is with the hospital right there. When you park behind the Airbnb, you drive thru the employee parking lot. The house was really clean, the bed was really comfortable. This is a duplex. The walls are thin and you can hear everything on the other side. Getting more insulation in the walls would help and the floors creak in both units."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The place was better than the pictures. Very clean, quaint neighborhood feeling, excellent parking, super clean. Greg was incredibly accommodating as I had problems with my account, he was professional, understanding and had solutions. My elderly father was amazed at his first stay at a AirBnB."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was my first time using Airbnb, and thanks to Greg, my experience was great! Greg’s rental and service were top notch! I’ll absolutely do business with Greg again when I’m in the area again. Thank you!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Greg's place was one of the nicest Airbnbs that we've stayed at in terms of location and amenities. The fully stocked kitchen (with even essential cooking ingredients like oil, salt and pepper, spices, etc.) gave us the option to cook instead of eating out, which is so convenient when your travel plans may involve late evenings after many restaurants have closed. The listing was very clean, the bed was comfortable, and the neighborhood was very quiet. Location was amazing - only 20 minutes to Black Canyon of the Gunnison, an hour from hikes near Mt Sneffels, and a bit further than that to Ouray and Telluride. I would highly recommend this place!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We loved staying at Greg's place in Montrose. It was extremely clean and well anointed and very easy to locate. Conveniently located close to the main street and a great base to explore the San Juan mountains as well as the Black Cannyon of the Gunnison NP. Greg was a great host and very graciously accommodated our late checkout request (~ 1 hour later than usual).
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Perfect location for Black Canyon of the Gunnison and so convenient to Telluride and hiking Blue Lakes Trail. Greg’s instructions were perfect and we loved the cleanliness as well as the washer and dryer. Nice quiet neighborhood and we felt right at home. We will be back.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Clean and great location. Satisfied our desire for a place near downtown and is walkable to plenty of places. Would stay again if in Montrose!
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Cute 1 bedroom, close to Black Canyon NP and to downtown Montrose. Greg’s place was a perfect stay: clean, well stocked kitchen, comfy bed and very nice bathroom and shower (even supplied shampoo, conditioner, body wash and lotion). Everything was easy to figure out (ie: TV, unlocking and locking door). We walked to Horse Fly Brewery for beer and dinner - great brewery/restaurant (turn right out if the apartment to the bike path and turn left down the path 2 blocks and you are there!) I would recommend Greg’s place for anyone traveling into Montrose!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This place is an absolute 💎 gem and Greg is a great communicator and you can tell he takes pride in his home. Will stay here in a heart beat in the future!
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Greg's listing was very clean, had a comfortable bed and any amenity you may need. My only knock was the cheap, small bath towels, everything else was perfect! highly recommend"
2023-09-01,4,Stayed a few nights,This Newley remodeled duplex was very clean and had everything that one could need for a stay. It was especially nice to have laundry on site. Only downfall and nothing of the owners fault. The floor is very squeaky and the wall between the duplex is very thin. Luckily we knew the neighbors that were stay in the other unit. I can see this being an ongoing issue if you are staying next to strangers. Overall great place. Would recommend and would stay again!!!!!
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Greg’s place had everything you could need, it was comfortable and stylish. The airbnb was spotless and the kitchen was so easy to cook in.

2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Amazing remodel, very clean and perfect for a couple or 1 person. The kitchen is so well equipped and everything is labeled.

2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Greg is an amazing host and the unit is lovely!
2023-08-01,3,Stayed a few nights,"Everything indicated in the previous reviews , great decor, location, amenities, are all true, but a single issue made us uncomfortable the whole time. The wall between the two units lacks soundproofing. We could hear the other tenants walking around, sounds like they are in our unit. Also could hear muffled talking and water, etc. The other tenants did nothing out of the ordinary or loud, but we were so aware of them it made us very cautious about any sounds we made."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"really fantastic location, walking distance to great restaurants! peaceful, clean, and comfortable!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Cute place with a comfortable bed, located walking distance from all the fun in downtown Montrose as well as a short drive from the national park. A great stay, would recommend!"

2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What a wonderful find! I have been to Montrose several times for work, and decided to try Greg's place. So very glad that I did! First, the property is spotless. Clearly, Greg takes pride in his property. The kitchen was well stocked with all of the necessary cookware to make a meal. I really appreciated that, because I travel a lot, and I get tired of eating in restaurants. There was even a blender so I could make my breakfast smoothie! The bed was comfortable, the furniture was all in great condition, and the unit was tastefully decorated. It is located in a walkable neighborhood as well. I have upcoming work in Montrose, and I will definitely stay here again!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place!! Exactly as Greg described and everything was super comfortable. He had more than enough amenities- even ziploc baggies! It was super convenient to things in town and Black Canyon of the Gunnison!! Would definitely stay here again!

2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Greg has thought of everything. The apt. is in a great location and had a well-stocked kitchen/bathroom. We love when hosts provide local recommendations which Greg covered! We would love to stay here again.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Greg's duplex was the perfect hub for our Southwestern Colorado adventure! The place is located in a cute, quiet, safe neighborhood and located within walking distance of town. The unit itself was beyond our expectations. It was cute, clean, had top tier amenities, easy parking, and a new shed for our bikes. This is a remodel of an older home but it was done well...very modern but still had original wood flooring! My wife is allergic to dogs so finding a rental that doesn't bother her allergies is tough. I know 'no pets' may be a deterrent for some but that is exactly why we would rent this place again.
This was a nice place to come back to as we explored Silverton, Telluride, Ouray, Gunnison Natl Park, Glenwood Springs, Grand Mesa Natl Park and much more! Perfect location!
Greg is a great host that made us feel at home: with clear instructions on anything we needed with the home, as well as recommendations for how to enjoy Montrose."

2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great unit, completely updated and squeaky clean. This location is perfect for visiting Telluride, Black Canyon of the Gunnison, and Curecanti Rec Area. The town of Montrose has tons of amenities, too. This is a wonderful location within Montrose and is quiet and comfortable. Just as pictured. Very responsive host."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,Highly recommend Greg’s place! We stayed here with our 8 month old son while visiting Black Canyon NP and it was perfect for our visit. The air bnb was pristinely cleaned and had all the extras you could need - with labels on everything. You can tell this is a host who cares about providing their guests with a nice experience. Highly recommend!
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Convenient and comfortable. It was nice they provide little things like dish washing liquid, laundry detergent, ziplock bags, aluminum foil, etc."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Greg’s place was perfect for our stay.

The unit was outfitted very well with everything you need. It was very comfortable and we felt safe there."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a fantastic stay at Greg's lovely, modern duplex in Montrose! It was very clean, spacious, well-designed and outfitted with high-quality fixtures and stylish lighting. Greg was an excellent host -- fast, warm, welcoming, helpful and detailed in all his communication. His attention to detail and thoughtfulness in supplying many items beyond the essentials made it one of the best-equipped Airbnbs we've stayed at. The kitchen was extremely well-stocked with a huge range of kitchenware including plenty of glasses, kitchen tools and baking tools not often found in Airbnbs, Pyrex dishes, oven trays, blender, cover for food in the microwave, cling wrap, foil, ziplock bags and a drawer of spices. The couch was very comfortable as were the stools and bed. It was really handy to have a washer/dryer in the bedroom plus parking at the rear. Last but not least, it was great the location was so close to Main Street and Riverbottom Park."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Lovely place in a cute, quiet, safe neighborhood. I walked each morning and found coffee, breakfast, brewpub, stores all within easy waking distance.
The property has a hospital right behind it, which I thought might be a bit noisy, but not at all.
Greg was easy to work with and had great communication.
Part of my stay, there were folks in the other side of the duplex. The only time I knew they were there was when the oak floors creaked, which was not at all disruptive.
All in all a great, well located place."

2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Super clean remodel. Also great temperature control. Location was perfect to, Greg’s spot was walkable to all the restaurants downtown on Main Street.

2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Greg was so flexible and easy to work with on a last minute booking. The place was exactly as described, and in a better location than we planned. For all Telluride transient folks, I highly recommend Greg’s house. For those visiting Montrose longer term, there isn’t a better option."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay. Very clean. Would stay again.
2023-03-01,5,Stayed about a week,Another great stay at Greg's in Montrose. It is like a second home when visiting our daughter and son in law. The place in always clean and stocked with essentials.

Everything was labeled, drawers and soaps for dishwasher and clothes washer. Nicely decorated with western theme. The perfect place. I wish I could carry it with me in our travels.

Randy"

It was clean, comfortable, has all of the cookware, utensils, linens, etc that you could possibly need. We loved walking to The Coffee Trader in the morning and enjoyed the front porch on this quiet neighborhood street. It's a great location for day trips to Telluride, Ouray and Grand Junction - we enjoyed exploring the western slope from this nice cozy home. We would book again if we come back to Montrose!"

2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Greg’s place was very well done. It was very clean, updated, and convenient to many restaurants and shops in downtown Montrose. A very good location for visiting Black Canyon and the San Juan Mountains. We also enjoyed going to one of the parks and watching people “surf” on the Uncompaghre River. We look forward to staying there again!"
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great stay! Greg's place is spotless and open/spacious, with everything you could need including a washer and dryer. The remodel and furnishings are high quality. The mini-split is super quiet and effective and the bed is comfy, so I got a great night's sleep here. There are thoughtful little touches like remotes for the light, fan and AC/heat which is nice when you don't want to get out of bed to turn them off.
I met the housecleaner and she was super nice and took pride in her work. The neighborhood is very cute and an easy walk to downtown. The storage shed in back looks like a very secure place to store bikes or other outdoor toys if you're traveling with them. I'd definitely stay here again!"
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Greg is a wonderful host and his place was very organized and clean. I have nothing negative to say. Great place to stay and I will be in contact with Greg in the future for my vacations. I have passed his info over to my family so they can stay here as well.

2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We enjoyed our stay here! Right in the central area of Montrose and close to shops and restaurants. It was modern and cozy, the kitchen was big and well supplied - good for people who liked to cook (like us!). The host was very responsive and accommodated a slightly earlier check-in when we requested for it. He also provided check-in and check-out instructions, though he required guests to clear the rubbish bins ourselves and throw them in the back alley. Took us a few tries to get the back gate open as the lock seemed to be misaligned"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,Greg is an awesome host. Our kiddos enjoyed the place. Great for anyone to stay peaceful but close to everything. Greg made sure all the items needed for a comfortable stay. Would like to come back and stay here when in town.

2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What a delightful Colorado retreat! :) The home was stunning, exuding a wonderful atmosphere and plenty of space. I particularly loved the view of the horses from my window. It was also conveniently close to town, with some fantastic places nearby. 10 minutes from the airport! I couldn't get enough of Colorado Boy's Pizza (thanks to Madison's recommendation); I ended up going there twice! Madison was incredibly kind, always quick to respond, and provided helpful information. Thanks for an unforgettable stay!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Lovely spot just 10mins outside of town. Easy to navigate to and from. Host made the check-in/out process super quick and easy. Beautiful, quiet location. And the bathroom was gorgeous!"
2024-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Immaculate inside and out as the surroundings are stunning and tranquil and the interior thoughtfully furnished and spotlessly clean. Easy access and check-in; Madison’s communication is quick. Lovely getaway.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,We loved this place! We will definitely be coming back. It felt like home away from home. ❤️
2024-04-01,5,Stayed over a week,"This place is just magical!! This location is a perfect distance from town. Provides for a peaceful respite from the hustle and bustle of daily life. The ranch is teeming with wildlife, as well as a working cattle ranch with horses. Walking the ranch at sunset is incredible. Madison and her family are lovely, pleasant, and friendly! I thoroughly enjoyed my stay here, and will definitely return."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great space Host very nice and friendly ! I would visit here again thanks again !
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Wonderful place! Very peaceful and quiet. If anything the pictures undersold the apartment. It was spacious and had everything I needed. Very clean throughout. Would definately stay here again!!
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We had such a nice stay! Peaceful and beautiful! The kitchen had everything you’d need to make a delicious meal !

2024-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"Such a cozy space - and clean, clean, clean! Great little getaway!"
2024-02-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"This place is newer, beautiful and very clean. The porch light was out and she had it fixed that same day. The kitchen was stocked with plenty of pans and dishes. There were only two negative things I can say about it. One is it is downstairs and there is a space they rent upstairs. No one was there while I was there but someone came to clean. You can hear every footstep. I don't think there is carpet upstairs. There was a little one that was running around quite a bit. I heard every step of the person cleaning. I could hear them talking at one point. I was trying to work and the noise was very distracting. Also, I think the bed has a plastic type of mattress cover. Despite keeping the temperature very cool at night, the plastic caused me to sweat which made it difficult to sleep well. While I loved everything else about it, I wouldn't want to stay there if someone was renting the space above."
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I have stayed here a number of times and left several reviews. All very positive. Nothing has changed. Absolute gem of a place to stay. I love the quiet and peaceful surroundings.
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This was our second stay here. It was perfect and a great place to stay! Beautiful and clean! It will be our go to Airbnb when staying in the Montrose area!
2023-12-01,5,Stayed one night,This was the most peaceful location ever. Everything was spotless. Madison was super helpful and responsive. Perfect adorable space!!! Loved it!!
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This apartment is just beautiful, right down to the horses strolling by our windows. It was a very comfy stay. Madison was very responsive when we could not find her place in the pitch black of the moonless night, and quickly corrected the problem of there not being exterior lights turned on. Once we were settled, all was just perfect!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Madison's place had everything we needed. The kitchen was well stocked. Cleanliness is my wife's top priority and it was super clean. As others have commented, the upstairs occupants could be heard, but we would stay here again."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This is one of my favorite places to stay. I’ve written multiple reviews for Madison’s place and if anything it is getting better. I had mentioned on a private review from my last stay that I would appreciate a pot to make some soup while staying there. This trip I found a soup pot added to the kitchen! Great host! I can’t say enough positive things. Stay here and you will be happy.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed over a week,This is such a great place to stay. It has become my favorite place to stay in Montrose. It was fun this stay to wake up to snow one morning. The combination of snow on the fall color leaves was really beautiful. The space is so comfortable. It is so quiet and peaceful in the evenings. It really is a great place to get away and relax.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,Great place! Easily can commute to downtown and black canyon of the Gunnison. She communicates pretty well. Thank you!
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,Nice place conveniently located close black canyon national park.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This was the second time I have stayed at this place. As before it was clean and comfortable. I felt right at home. It has all the things that make an AirBnB comfortable and convenient with furniture and kitchen amenities without the personal items that make it feel like someone else's home as is often the case with short term rentals. Great bathroom and shower. I also love the rural setting. It is an amazing stress relief to be away from the busy atmosphere of the city or even a suburb. I can't say enough good things about this place. It is a gem I wish I could have every time I travel.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"Beautiful places, felt right at home"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This apt is located on a working ranch. If you love seeing green fields, mountains, cows and horses grazing you will love it here. It is peaceful and quiet and the owners invite you to wander freely to see the ranch. The apt is sparkly clean and modern."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Loved Madison’s place. Nice quiet location just a short drive to everything in Montrose. Would definitely stay again.
2023-09-01,4,Stayed one night,"2 weeks later we still remember our stay as a bad experience. We arrived almost at 9pm, it was already dark. There are several houses at this address but the sign does NOT list the proper one. It lists other houses & also some Twin Pines. The AirBnB description does NOT say Twin Pines anywhere (only the last pic does - but who ever remembers a picture after they booked their stay)! We drove in nonetheless hoping to see our house but it was nowhere seen. Instead several dogs were ran at us, barking. We turned around, went up the street hoping to find our house but it wasn't there. We returned to where GMaps led us & tried calling the host. No answer, the mailbox is full - unprofessional! We drove again in, this time someone came out & said this is the right place, pointed somewhere into black night, saying the host should've left the lights on (indeed).
We wouldn't complain in other circumstance, but: there was Keurig with 1 pod only, no tea bags, empty roll of toilet paper (come on!)"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Surpassed our expectations. Well appointed. Was close to town but felt miles away , very peaceful and quite . Wish we had more time to explore the property. We were there to see black canyon and it worked out great."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Very clean , quiet and comfortable place."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,Great spot. Very roomy interior and spacious bathroom. Large walk in shower. Very clean. On a ranch - so it was refreshing to open the windows and let the fresh air inside. Beautiful spot. We would stay here again next time we’re in town.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Madison's apartment was so cute and cozy after long mornings in the mountains! The pictures are accurate, and the apartment is bright and beautiful. The property is on a farm a few miles outside of town, which was so nice to have peace and quiet. The only thing to take into account is you're on the first floor of a two floor building, and upstairs is another Airbnb property. I could hear the upstairs guests as they got home, walked up the stairs, and around the unit. Something to consider if you're sensitive to this!
Overall, I would 100% stay here again. It's a lovely location and less than an hour from the San Juans."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great place at a great price. Clean, spacious 1-bed. Close to peach valley ohv."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This place is amazing. super clean and modern and comfortable. it's a great location if visiting black canyon of the gunnison. we also were not too far from Telluride and Ouray. highly recommend.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"Where to start? The location is fantastic. Remote feeling yet all the convenience one could need a short drive away.
The house was absolutely gorgeous and well appointed. Very quiet! We only stayed a night on our road trip around Colorado but wish we stayed longer!
The best part!? Puppies! We were greeted by 3 of the friendliest 🐶 as dog parents missing our two at home it made this feel like home! We opened the blinds on the door the next morning to a happy go lucky chocolate lab waiting for some lovin’.
We could not recommend this stay enough! This was our second trip to Colorado and we absolutely love the state. When we go back we’ll be booking here again!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed about a week,"I want to thank Madison and Family for a great place to stay! We enjoyed everything about it!! The bed was comfy and so on!! Always could get a hold of her when needed and helped with local cuisine!!
Thank you for the wonderful stay!!

2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,Cute place!
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,Very nice place to rest your head.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed over a week,"This was a great place to stay. It was very quiet and peaceful. I loved seeing the horses, cows and saying hello to the dogs.

2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"We absolutely loved staying here. It’s beautifully decorated and very clean. Our gps had trouble picking up the address, but we just put it into go0gle maps and that led us there with no issues. Madison was extremely helpful in accepting our reservation last minister and giving clear instructions. 10/10 highly recommend staying here!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,Great place to stay. Very quite clean and easy to find. Would recommend for anyone heading to telluride or black canyon National park. Close to downtown montrose. Very helpful host as well!

2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Such an adorable Airstream! The decorations were so beautiful, you can tell the owners really want to make the place pleasant and comfortable. Although the bathroom is in the house, it is extremely private and doesn’t feel like you’re intruding. I loved the backyard the most - super well kept and cute. We got to meet their cat Fritz who is just the sweetest! The owners provided us with coffee too :)"

2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,Wonderful hosts! Brittany and Matt have created such a wonderful environment that you can truly enjoy as soon as you pull in the driveway. The camper is so unique and you can see the potential that the outdoor space will reach once completed. Look forward to staying here again and recommending it to anyone passing through.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"Really enjoyed our stay! Very charming and comfortable place. Nice touches, great communication, fun, easy peasy! Would have loved to stay longer if we could.
Highly recommend"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,We only got to stay for the night & had to wake up in leave but the bed was super comfy!

2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"Nice place, very easy and convenient"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"Hosts were friendly and very accommodating. My husband and I needed a place to stay last minute after we got to the campground at Black Canyon of the Gunnison was covered in ~4 ft of snow. So happy we found this place, very affordable and right in central Montrose. Great stay all around. Was nice and toasty inside the airstream and plenty of blankets to stay warm. Complementary coffee and their cat Mr. Fritz (don’t worry if you’re allergic - he hangs outside) made the stay all that better. Bathroom inside the house easily accessible, just a few steps from the airstream, and very clean. 10/10 would recommend."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"Matt and Brittany were awesome hosts and went above and beyond. to my surprise, it snowed a lot the evening I stayed, yet when I walked outside, they had already shoveled the walk so I could get around safely. plus they were really pleasant and had great recommendations for local restaurants."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"Cozy, stayed warm ( February stay), easy access to bathroom just few feet inside hosts home, from Airstream."
2024-01-01,5,Stayed one night,Comfortable and clean place to stay. Warm during the winter. We would definitely stay again.
2024-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"Came to stay here while attending the Ice Fest in Ouray last weekend. We were blown away by the cleanliness and how homey the Airstream felt! It was a great place to stay after a long day of climbing, and we'd recommend this stay to anyone going to the Ouray/Ridgway/Montrose area of the San Juans!"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed one night,Super cute spot and perfect for going to Black Canyon NP! We stayed in the dead of winter and still stayed super cozy in the Airstream. Access to a nice bathroom was very appreciated and the details were so well thought out. Cute cat too :) Loved our stay!

2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,Simple place to spend the night. Walking distance to downtown.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"Unique experience staying a night in an airstream while road tripping accross the USA
Was a lovely stay, recommend if staying in the winter to setup the thermostat correctly on the provided space heater otherwise it can be cold in the morning when you wake up"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"This was a fun and unique stay! Airstream is cozy and the bathroom and shower across is super clean. This is well situated in montrose and surrounding outdoor areas like black canyon. Hosts responsive and gave great recs, would stay again!"

2023-10-01,4,Stayed one night,Cute – retro – bathroom is in the main house and not in the camper
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,Very cute spot to stay in!
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,if you ever wanted to stay in an airstream this is the one to pick. Brittany has done such a great job of decorating and it feels very cozy. the bathroom is just steps away and the yard is very welcoming and pleasant to enjoy a morning cup of coffee
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Brittany’s place was wonderful! The airstream was a little chilly but as described there was a space heater that worked very quickly! The bathroom is in the main house but still felt very private for us, and very clean. Had great food recommendations as well."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,This was the perfect place to stay overnight when my car broke down in Montrose. I was able to book super last minute and Brittany was very helpful and thought of everything! Would definitely stay again.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,Great stay. The airstream was comfortable and the little details inside were great. Brittany was very responsive and friendly. Would recommend.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"These hosts have thought of everything. Everything has a purpose and a use, but anything that you would think to need is there. The space was homey and comfortable."
2023-09-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"The accommodation is okay given the other offers in the area and worth the price.. The verdict ""awesome"" , ""fantastic"" I wouldn't choose...it's just an old, spent caravan, (without cooking possibility, hot water works) that's in a private yard. Pros: the area, on the outskirts of the city, the bathroom in the house is very clean and beautiful."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,Cute little place to stay for a couple nights!
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,This was a great stay overall.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"This is a very comfy, cozy trailer. Lots of thoughtful touches including coffee and cream in the trailer for your morning coffee. (I wish all hosts did this. It’s so gracious.). Bathroom was large and spotless and just steps away from the trailer. We enjoyed sitting outside at the picnic table in the evening with a lovely glow from the hanging lights."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,Such a cute place with an enjoyable yard to be outside. I appreciated the coffee and French press
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"The place was so nice and cozy, easy to access and it’s quiet. The spaces are very clean too. I really enjoyed my stay there."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My fiancé and I stayed here for 2 nights and it was so cozy! Great place to unwind after a long day of hiking the Gunnison!

2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Unique accommodations, easy check-in, and kind hosts (along with an adorable cat), all located a short drive from some of the most beautiful places in Colorado!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"Could not recommend enough. Great for one or two people. Total retro vibe, friendly, comfy, cozy. Thank you for having me"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"We had an amazing time in Britanny & Matthew's Airstream !
The Airstream itself is great, well decorated with thoughtful little details that honour its heritage from the past. Everything worked perfectly and although we did not really use it since the weather was not too hot, the AC is a real plus. It is quite spacious for two, with many compartments for organising your personal belongings, a couch, a counter to prepare your meal and a table to dine inside if you want to. The backyard it is located on is also very beautiful with its string lights, a quite original teepee, and an outdoor table for those who enjoy dining under the stars.
We found the use of the shared bathroom very convenient since it is in reality quite private and very easy to access : you just have to cross the backyard and you use a private entrance. The bathroom is nice and clean, and once again very nicely-decorated.
Communication was really easy and we met with Matthew on our departure, who was very nice !"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"Super cute place, great hosts!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"The airstream was awesome! Such a cool experience, different than the average Airbnb. I thought the hosts went above and beyond with accommodations and amenities provided. Would recommend to anyone!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"They were wonderful hosts!
My partner and I enjoyed the overnight stay in Montrose before hitting the road for camping. Being able to take a shower & stay in a vintage airstream before hitting the road was an ideal setup. I even left a hat and communicated with them to pick up on our way back. Thanks again for the hospitality :)"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Very comfortable stay. Close to the black canyon National park, about 20 minutes from the entrance. Would stay again."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,Very nice for an unusual night!
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"So far the airstream has been our favorite place to stay on our vacation. It was quite cozy with helpful instructions and recommendations inside. A/C worked wonderfully and the bed was quite comfy.
Hosts were super welcoming, it’s obvious that a lot of thought went into every detail of this stay."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"A wonderful and unique place to stay. The hosts were friendly, quick to respond, and made great recommendations of things to do in the area. The RV was very clean and decorated beautifully. Thank you Brittany!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I stayed here for a work conference and it was a great escape to the work day. It was hot in Montrose and the AC cooled down the sleeping berth. Important to note that the bathroom - which was nice - is outside the airstream and in the house. It’s not far at all. Just something to be aware of for midnight bathroom trips. The airstream had everything I need, and I appreciate the cool water left on in the fridge. Great and easy instructions. Definitely a nice change of pace from the typical room."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,It was a great place to stay after other housing plans fell through. I did not mind the bathroom being attached to the house and their cat was very cute.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,I really enjoyed the trailer. The instructions were very clear on how to get in and hour to use the amenities. I was able to keep it quite cool in the trailer which is how I like it when I sleep. It worked out perfectly for what I needed and it was lots of fun staying there!
2023-08-01,4,Stayed one night,Great place for our one night stay in Montrose! She has put together a very cute space.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"I very much enjoyed my stay at Brittany’s property. The airstream was cozy but welcoming. Instructions were clear on how to access the restroom (which I thought could be a problem, but definitely was not). Brittany also has guides to Montrose and personal recommendations all laid out for you when you get there. Additionally, she helped us with recommendations for other cities on our trip! Overall, great stay :)"
2023-08-01,4,Stayed one night,Really fun camper. Quiet neighborhood. I might suggest a memory foam mattress but that's it.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"This camper was adorable!!! We felt safe and comfortable staying here. The camper and bathroom were very clean. Property manager, Joe, was friendly on site. Thank you for the wonderful stay!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"Brittany and Matt had a convenient place, were responsive and flexible. You'll receive a nice welcome from Mr. Fritzs.
The listing was good value and provided all the necessary amenities."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We had an excellent stay here! Our host was super responsive, and their property care taker did an excellent job. Would definitely stay here again."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"I really enjoyed staying here! We needed a last minute place to stay and this one was such a blessing!
The property manger was amazing and the hosts were super kind and responsive! Definitely recommend!!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,Such a cool place!
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,The cutest airstream. The host was always quick to respond and gave some great reccomendations as to things to see around the area and great restaurants to try. Will definitely book again if I come back through Colorado.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"I loved staying here! So cute, clean, and convenient!!!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,This was an awesome find! Very affordable and clean. Thank you for making our trip memorable!
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,This spot was exactly what we needed - a good place to catch some sleep on our road trip. The Airstream was clean and comfortable. The bathroom was pristine. The directions we were given were clear and check-out was super smooth. Even the cat gave us a very friendly greeting. I would highly recommend.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"We loved this little Airstream! It was one of the most fun places we stayed during our two weeks in Colorado.
The airstream was well-decorated and charming. Even more than that, being in the airstream felt transportive. We listened to the records on the old-style record player and felt like we could glimpse another era.
Accessing the stylish bathroom in the main house was very easy. The internet connection was strong and we were able to get work done.
We enjoyed our stay and would stay here again. We highly recommend it!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"We were here for one night passing through but we loved our stay in the camper! It was very clean, cozy, and surprisingly spacious. The bathroom was conveniently located inside the house and the area was really quite. The resident cat, Mr. Fritz, was adorable and friendly. The attention to detail was top notch. They had cold water in the fridge and delicious coffee for us in the morning. Can't wait to come back to Montrose and stay here again!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,We loved Brittanys place!!! So cute and had everything we needed. A perfect stay!
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"Our stay in the 1969 Airstream RV was like stepping into a vintage dreamland! From the moment we set foot inside, we were instantly transported back in time to an era of classic charm and adventure. It was an unforgettable experience that we will cherish forever.
The Airstream itself was a true gem. Lovingly restored and maintained, it showcased the perfect blend of nostalgia and modern comforts. The sleeping area was surprisingly comfortable, with the cozy bedding embracing us in a warm embrace each night.
Lastly, the hosts were outstanding. They were attentive, warm, and welcoming, making sure we had everything we needed for a fantastic stay.
I also want to highlight the outstanding hosting by Brittany, who truly went above and beyond to ensure our stay was exceptional. Throughout our stay, she was available to answer any questions we had and offered helpful tips for exploring the area."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,This is a great place - recommend staying here - and Brittany is a great host.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Brittany has curated a wonderful mix of vintage airstream (Clyde) with modern amenities. The location is close to everything Montrose and many restaurants and coffeeshops are easily within walking distance. Off street parking, outdoor chill area with fire ring and picnic table, along with their adorable cat (Fritz) pushed this listing over top. Clyde is a very welcoming stay with a very comfortable bed. Be sure to read the hand written note and check in instructions, this adds to understanding the layout, although simple enough, I did not and wished I had earlier. I hope this listing is available on our next visit to the Western Slope."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,First time ever staying in an airstream and we really enjoyed it! The bed was comfortable and the shared bathroom felt private and not a problem at all! Mr Fritz their cat was a great added bonus. Such a sweet cat! Brittany was friendly and kind to us! Thank you!
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Amazing host, great communication and responsiveness. Place was exactly as described."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,Loved it!
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Staying at Brittney's residence was a delightful experience. Even though the bathroom was shared, it did not cause any inconvenience at all and its thoughtful positioning away from the main part of the house was appreciated. I will definitely plan another stay here. The Airstream provided a great night's sleep and it was thoroughly enjoyable to experience living in this nostalgic piece of history."
2023-06-01,4,Stayed one night,Place is as described. The bathroom isn’t connected so it’s a little hassle to go back and forth. The price is a little cheaper than other airbnbs because you’re sacrificing some things in place of a standard room. I was satisfied with everything.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed about a week,Brittany and Matt were fantastic. Very friendly and always willing to go out of their way to assist and accommodate you. Brittany would even text me detailed information about what local events were going to be taking place. The airstream was really comfortable and unique. They really created a nice little paradise with all the features and landscaping. Mr. Fritz was also awesome!
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,I loved my stay at the Airstream and all the experience. It was so cute and cozy inside. They literally thought about everything when they were doing the vintage decorations. I had a problem with the lock and they immediately solved it. Super friendly host and super friendly cat. I stayed there for one night and I wish I could stayed more. 💕
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Shady, green, quiet and a great place. Even better- a dozen farm fresh eggs! This is one of the best ABB places I've been in."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Kim and Gerald's cottage was great. It's located in a very quiet and peaceful area yet still very close to town. We used it as a base point for visiting the Black Canyon and a trip to Ouray. The cottage was very clean, the bed was very comfortable and had very nice linens. The bathroom was clean and had plenty of towels. The kitchen was very well stocked, so may extras that are very rare in other rentals. We had a dozen fresh eggs and some brownies waiting for us as well, delicious. My wife and I were very pleased with everything and would recommend a stay at this cottage."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Kim and Jerry were fabulous hosts and The Commons at Spring Creek Cottage was a fantastic spot to call our home while in SW Colorado!
Even before arriving, Kim and Jerry made us welcome with clear, friendly, and helpful communications. They went above and beyond answering questions I asked about the area.
The cottage was perfect: cozy living room space, well stocked kitchen (with homemade baked goods from the hosts), comfortable bedroom and bathroom, and an adorable patio with breathtaking views.
We loved that the cottage was situated on a quiet country road outside of Montrose, which is full of amenities. We did day trips to Telluride, Silverton/Durango, Black Canyon of the Gunnison National Park, and Ouray. This cottage truly is a fantastic location to do it all!
Check out was super easy and we even got to meet the hosts. They are so kind and welcoming. If we are ever back in the area, we will definitely stay with them again! Thanks for providing us a home away from home!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"What a wonderful place with marvelous hosts, beautiful surroundings and just perfect in every way. I've stayed in many Airbnbs all over America and Europe and this is probably the nicest one ever. Montose is an excellent location to see so many great sights: Black Canyon of the Gunnison NP, Ridgway, Ouray, Telluride, Rico and many other lovely places. The street where you'll stay is like staying in the country with chickens, cows, horses and lots of interesting neighbors engaged in farming. It's like a step back in time.
I also want to mention that if you're travelling with your dog, the house is very dog friendly. Kim provides water/food bowls, doggy bedding and an ample backyard where your furry friend can sniff, explore and get some exercise. Dog walks are great on a bucolic road with little traffic. The kitchen is well stocked with anything you might need to cook or prepare your meals.
I give this Airbnb by highest recommendation, it's perfect in every way!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The home is very well cared for. It could be a bit crowded for two adults but very comfortable. It is decorated well and homey felling.
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Kim's place was clean, comfortable and very peaceful. A great get-away! Fresh eggs, homemade cookies and a bouquet of lilacs made us feel very welcome!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"By far one of the best paces we’ve stayed! Kim’s place is cozy and comfortable and they have thought of every need you could have! We were greeted with a vase of fresh cut lilacs and a plate of home made cookies! Fresh farm eggs were in the fridge! Easy drive to Black Canyon and The Million Dollar Highway! Kim answered every question promptly and checked in with us to see if we needed anything (which we didn’t because she’d thought of everything already!) If you’re staying in Montrose, this home is PERFECT!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Great little spot within 1.5 hour drive of many national parks. Black Canyon of the Gunnison is especially cool and is less than an hour drive from this location. The hosts are great, they'll give plenty of recommendations for parks/sights to see if you ask, and they're simultaneously responsive while also not being obtrusive/overbearing. Overall a great place to stay, and Montrose has a LOT of good restaurants and a really cool Ute Indian Museum. :)"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Really nice place. Wonderful people and super easy to communicate with.
2024-02-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Always delightful to stay at Kim and Jerry’s .❤️
2024-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,We enjoyed staying here! Kim was extremely responsive and helpful! Beautiful and convenient location! Definitely recommend:)
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I was in town on business. The cottage was great and cozy. A great place to go to between appointments. Kim and Jerry were very friendly and helped me with schedule changes. The neighborhood was quiet and very comfortable. I liked the rural atmosphere. Overall it worked very well for me and I enjoyed my stay very much.
2024-01-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Beautiful place to stay right outside of town. Felt very at home and peaceful staying here. Very clean, cozy, and had everything you could possibly need to be comfortable. The fresh cookies provided were an added special touch."
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Very nice ! We enjoyed staying here. As described, nice quiet are but still driving distance to different areas."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,It was a very nice place to stay just perfect for what we needed had everything in place and even left a very good lemon poppyseed cake and some food in refrigerator and plenty of coffee job well done
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Kim's place was a great peaceful retreat!
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Had a great time at The Commons! The place was cozy and very clean! It was the perfect little getaway and very accessible to many great destinations. Would love to stay here again in the summer when the garden is available. Highly recommend staying here and also the Ouray Rim Perimeter Trail and the La Noue Dubois Winery in Montrose (a 10 min drive from the air bnb)!
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We loved our stay at the commons❣️Felt like coming home after a long day on the mountains! Kim and her husband we very responsive and helpful and the baked goods and eggs were delicious! What an amazing place to stay!
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"I've had good Air BnB experiences, but this by far has been the best. In just a few words, I would say that when i walked in, I immediately felt at home. Every effort was made to make me feel welcome, and I didn't have to guess about anything. Coffee and baked goods were great, and the crowning touch was fresh eggs. I will definitely return!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed over a week,"The location of The Commons is centered between downtown Montrose and large recreational areas in the Uncompahgre Plateau. There are a lot of things to do, great restaurants nearby, and still have that feeling of a quiet country lifestyle when you return to the house.
The house itself was clean and well designed. The hosts were very responsive and assisted us when needed.
I would definitely recommend The Commons and we plan to return in the future!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Kim’s place was as listed and location was more beautiful than an expected. Very cozy, comfortable with everything you need even extra bowls and beds for the dog. Extremely welcoming with delicious home made muffins, eggs and extras in the fridge. Felt very private even though their house was next door. Washer and dryer a plus. Enjoyed the backyard covered patio looking out at the mountains. Heat worked great. Definitely recommend."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,One of the most perfect airbnbs I’ve stayed at - and I’ve stayed at many!
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The star of this AirBnB is the hosts - we arrived to fresh baked goods, fresh cut flowers, and farm-fresh eggs. The communication was great, and the cottage has all kinds of unexpected extras - spices, cooking oils, toiletries, teas and coffees, so many extras. The cottage also has amenities you won’t find at many AirBnBs, including fiber-based internet (the WiFi was 300 Mbps downlink/uplink, incredible and perfect for work!), a dishwasher and full-sized washer and dryer.
The decor of the cottage is just like the pictures, I would call it “grandma’s farmhouse” The back porch has a great view of the mountains, but the back of the Cottage has no windows in the common areas to see this view. There are small windows in the laundry room and back bedroom, but we were disappointed we couldn’t see the view from the kitchen or living room.
Overall a great experience, and we enjoyed our time in Montrose at the Cottage."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Relaxing getaway, but lots to do around the area."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Kim and Jerry were wonderful hosts, among the best I've ever had anywhere. The house was exactly as advertised, and very comfortable. Kim's pre-arrival communications were great. The instructions were clear and easy to use, and there was a book of useful information about the house and a basket of local information brochures. But the best part of the stay was how warm and welcoming they were. They invited us to pick produce and herbs from their garden, and left eggs from their chickens in the frig and a freshly baked treat on the table. The plums from their tree were good enough to be worth a trip back on their own! It was so peaceful to stay there that if I lived closer than half a continent away I would be a regular guest."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with a pet,We absolutely love our visits in Montrose staying at Kim’s cottage. Setting is peaceful and Kim and Jerry are the perfect hosts
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Kim’s place has just about anything you will want for a stay. Fully stocked kitchen. 2 beautiful bedrooms. Outdoor covered patio. But also little things like bathrobes and board games. (Not to mention lots of easy reading materials like Dante’s “Inferno”! )
But I also enjoyed that she left free eggs from their chickens, offered produce from their garden and baked a sweet treat.
This property is a few miles outside of town so may not work for those wanting to walk places but virtually all visitors need a car for this area and the quiet here makes for a great stay!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We can’t wait to come back - a cute cottage, delightful hosts, and the bounty from their garden and chickens! Oh and the huge plush pillows and comfy bed! Oh and the darling porch, lit up at night against the mountains! About 30 minutes from Black Canyon NP and 10 minutes from the biking trail (Montrose Water Sports Park trailhead). Exceeded our expectations!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"My time as a country princess fueled my soul. Incredible, peaceful space. The hosts thought of everything. Sweet, caring people. Gorgeous location."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed over a week,Kim & Jerry were great hosts - The adjacent home was just as described - We would recommend this property to others - The Montrose area is a wonderful base to explore all the beauty of this Western Wonderland
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Awesome muffins Great stay. I will definitely return.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We had the best time at Kim and Jerry’s place. The surroundings are so beautiful and peaceful, and the cottage was very cute. The baked muffins and fresh eggs waiting for us when we arrived were such a treat, and the vegetable garden was the icing on the cake. We loved cooking meals with the fresh vegetables. Kim and Jerry were kind and friendly hosts. The Wi-Fi was very good and strong enough for video calls. We liked exploring the area, including Black Canyon of the Gunnison, Telluride, Ouray, and Montrose. In Montrose, we especially liked the speakeasy Phelanie’s. If you are looking for a relaxing stay, I highly highly recommend staying at Kim and Jerry’s."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"outstanding little cottage with a great back patio with pergola for shade, and the most amazing views of the mountains!"

2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We were absolutely delighted when we walked in. Everything was pristine. Kim had left us homemade muffins, some of her yard eggs and other refrigerated items, too! The house had everything one could possibly need for a stay, lots of supplies, many spices, well equipped kitchen, and a whole cabinet full of breakfast food! Of note, the refrigerator is a mini refrigerator, but there is also a full-size refrigerator/freezer available in the shed next door so that was perfect for all of our drinking water and freezer items. The house even had two coffee makers in it! One was a Keurig, which I loved, and the other was a drip coffee maker. Plenty of coffees, too! We very much enjoyed sitting out on the patio in the mornings and evenings watching the birds, and looking at the gorgeous snow covered mountains in the distance. The setting is very peaceful. I highly recommend Kim’s place! You won’t be disappointed."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was an absolutely wonderful place to stay! The hosts were very responsive and super nice. The place is exactly as described and the views are beautiful! I would highly recommend staying here. It was an awesome experience for us.

2023-05-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We loved our stay at Kim’s place! They went over the top to make us feel at home, leaving fresh eggs and gluten free baked goods, even some treats for our dog. The setting is so serene and beautiful, off the beaten path but only 10 or so minutes from town. Very friendly hosts. Perfect home base to go explore the canyon, telluride, ouray, etc."

The kitchen is well equipped . The bedrooms are lovely with comfortable beds. The patio is inviting with birds at the bird feeder and views of surrounding farmland and distant snow capped mountains.
Kim responded promptly to questions and recommendations. I would definitely recommend Kim’s place.

2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We’ve stayed in a bunch of perfectly good Airbnbs on this trip, but this was the very best. The hosts take great care and were very thoughtful about all aspects of hosting. House was well-equipped, very clean, and extremely homey. We liked staying amidst farmland outside of the center of town, and the cottage has a lovely outdoor patio space with bird and hummingbird feeders to keep the birds visiting. 30 minutes to Black Canyon NP, where we spent a chunk of the day hiking and is well worth a visit. Highly recommend!"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a wonderful stay. The location is so peaceful and I fell in love with all the birds that were singing in the morning. The house was so comfortable and welcoming. I loved the plate of fresh cookies upon our arrival. What a little gem.
Thank you.

2023-03-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Only need one word
AMAZING. !!!!!!!!!!"
2023-02-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Beautiful and cozy cottage with so many thoughtful details. Kim was extremely responsive and understanding with some changes as we were traveling with our newborn baby.

We will definitely be coming back in summer/fall time.

It is a cozy home with everything you could need. She left delicious goodies for us and even fresh eggs in a well-stocked fridge (condiments, creamers and such). Lots of clean fresh towels and useful toiletries were stocked in the bathroom as well. I was grateful to find such a quiet and cute home that accepted pets so we could bring our pup along. We would definitely stay here again when we are in town to visit family. Thank you both for everything!"
2022-11-01,5,Stayed about a week,Great place. Cozy and warm. It had everything that we needed for our stay. Will be back again.
2022-11-01,5,Stayed over a week,A perfect vacation residence! Great location!

2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My friends and I loved staying at Kim’s! We were in town for a wedding and being able to retreat to The Commons between festivities was so nice. The place is clean, cozy, and comfortable. It has one of the best stocked kitchens we’ve ever seen at an AirBnb. Kim was very responsive and made sure we had everything we needed.
Highly recommend enjoying coffee on the patio!"
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a lovely, peaceful stay in this cottage. It was clean, particularly comfortable, and matched the listing exactly. Kim’s directions to the cottage were incredibly detailed, and helped us, as the sun was going down as we arrived. A perfect spot to recharge on a long trip."
2022-09-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"The Cottage was very nice! Quiet, clean and very well stocked! We will definitely stay again when in the Montrose area and would recommend this lovley place to others.

2022-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Great location with easy accessibility to the center of Montrose. This house was a great fit for our family of two adults and two small children. The hosts were very thoughtful in the household amenities and the space itself was spotless. I felt like the communication was consistent and helpful, very responsive. The eggs and homemade cookies made the experience even more enjoyable and personalized. Our stay was relaxing and we would love to stay again in the future."
2022-09-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Our stay at Kim's house was a ""home away from home"", where we could enjoy morning tea and coffee with fresh eggs in a well equipped kitchen, rest in a comfortable living area after exploring nearby hiking trails, browse through the bookshelf of helpful guidebooks for the area, and find all the comforts to make a guest welcome. All this in a quiet, sweet little house just outside town, where you can see the mountains in the distance. I would absolutely recommend it."
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The Commons is comfortable, quiet, and convenient. The host is knowledgeable on local amenities. Hope to be able to stay here again on my next trip!"
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"If you are looking to get away from the daily grind of everyday living, this is THE place to go. Situated on a dirt road out in the country, this place is an oasis of calm and beauty. The adorable 2-bedroom cottage sits on a spacious lot across from corn fields with spectacular views of the mountains. There is a small stream that runs along the back of the property whose sounds soothe the soul. Deer visited from the cornfield and the neighboring cat came for morning rubs. Sitting out on the patio was so relaxing after a busy day of exploring. The house was immaculately clean, the bed was super comfy, and the shower was hot. The location was close enough to Montrose but far enough away to make you feel like you were in a special place, all your own. I would definitely recommend the cottage a a premier place to enjoy the area!!!!"
2022-08-01,5,Stayed about a week,"We loved our week-long stay at Kim's cottage! There were yummy freshly baked muffins and eggs to welcome us upon our arrival. Everything was very clean, the bed was cozy and we loved the country setting. We had everything we needed and especially appreciated the washer and dryer! I loved the beautiful backyard patio and view of the San Juan mountains as well, I wish I had more time to spend out there during our stay. Thank you both so much and we hope to return!"
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"A wonderful, cozy place to stay. The back yard and patio are great for a peaceful evening of relaxing after a day of exploring Black Canyon National Park.
Kim and Jerry are great hosts!
The restaurants in the area are wonderful."
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had an amazing time at Jerry and Kim’s cottage. The location is incredible, being about 5 minutes outside of Downtown Montrose, it’s surrounded by farmland. It’s super quiet and serene. The front and back yard of the cottage are beautiful and I enjoyed sitting in the back drinking coffee in the morning and eating dinner in the evening and listening to the animals and running water. The cottage itself is great also. Two comfortable queen size beds, a good sized kitchen with all you would need, full sized bathroom, and a quaint living room with books and tv. Jerry and Kim were incredibly nice and communicated wonderfully. A couple weeks before our trip, they messaged us details about the ongoing road closures on the main highway into town and were very informative about getting to the cottage. Overall, I wish I could have stayed longer!!"
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great place for a quiet stay..
Kim and Jerry made our stay very special. Communication was fast, very friendly and helpful and even had some fresh vituals for us when we arrived. The Commons is fully equipped with lots of charming details. We loved taking our meals on the patio together with the marvelous view at the mountains. The peaceful atmosphere was emphasized by the delightful hummingbirds around us or the visiting doe. The Commons is in easy travelling distance to Black Canyon NP or the hot springs near Ridgeway. Montrose provides all necessary services nearby. We can definitely recommend Kim and Jerry‘s place!"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Beautiful home…great place to relax. Very peaceful environment, clean home and great hosts. Thank you!"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is such a great place to stay. It was very clean and comfortable. The check in and check out process and communication with the host was seamless. There were so many thoughtful little extras in the cottage for us I can't even list them all- toothpaste, ear plugs, snack bars, freshly baked zucchini bread, and on and on. I highly recommend staying here."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Kim and Jerry are fantastic hosts - warm and friendly, with fresh baked goods, eggs in the fridge, and little touches throughout the Commons that show their attention to detail and commitment to a special visit for their guests. I look forward to coming back!"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This cottage is perfect if you want to visit the Black Canyon of the Gunnison or if you just want to have a relaxed weekend away. Our favorite part was having breakfast in the patio while listening to the birds and enjoying the nice views. The cottage has everything you need and the hosts are super attentive and responsive. We totally recommend this stay!!
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This cottage is the perfect place to find serenity and peace while exploring all that Montrose and Black Canyon of the Gunnison NP offer. We loved our stay and enjoyed all of the little touches Kim provided. Our dogs were happy and relaxed here as well. The back porch area is a wonderful spot for yoga and coffee!
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Kim’s place was a perfect place to come home to after a day of exploring. Her place is extremely clean and has everything that you need. The fresh eggs and baked goods for breakfast were a huge crowd pleaser. We would definitely recommend that you stay here!
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This was the best Airbnb that we have ever stayed at! We fell in love immediately….when there was homemade chocolate chip cookies waiting for us. The cottage is so quaint and cozy. It has everything you could possibly need.
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What a wonderful place. I opened the door and began to feel the stress of travel and needs of life just bleed away. If you need rest and quiet this is the place. We were a party of three (married couple and daughter) and never felt crowded. Rather, for a smaller house it felt very spacious. It's clean, bright, comfortable and well-decorated. On the latter, some places we've stayed are almost choked with cute stuff - the decor here is tasteful and welcoming, not at all overpowering. Attention to detail??? Who puts earplugs in the bathroom on the chance that you find yourself with someone who snores? Someone who cares, who has the gift of hospitality. My only regret about staying here is not meeting Kim and Jerry - my bad, and another reason to return! Thanks for sharing your place."
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a wonderful stay at The Commons. The house is very comfortable, super clean and has all the amenities you could want. The homemade chocolate chip cookies and the fresh eggs were delicious! I so appreciated Kim's kindness when she put me in touch with her friend from the Audubon Society after she learned that I'm a birder. The neighborhood is idyllic. I miss those gorgeous views, strolling down the road past the neighbor's horses and enjoying the sunsets over the mountains from the back patio. Kim is available without being intrusive. She's compiled lots of helpful information about the area. My husband and I had a great time there and would stay there again in a heartbeat!!!"
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We thoroughly loved being here. It was so relaxing and the accommodations and response time were top notch. Although the owners live next door, we always had plenty of privacy and no intrusions. Sitting on the patio watching all the birds and gazing at the mountains in the distance was a perfect retreat for us after our long drives and National Park touring. We highly recommend."
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,My wife and I absolutely loved everything about our stay at this fantastic little farmhouse near Black Canyon NP. We arrived to find freshly baked chocolate chip cookies waiting for us and were provided farm fresh eggs for breakfast. Place is equipped with everything we could have needed and was a cozy and comfortable home away from home for us. For sure one of the best AirBnB experiences we’ve had.
2022-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,We had a lovely stay while visiting the Black Canyon of the Gunnison National Park. We loved the location and the space had everything we needed. Especially loved it being dog friendly!
2022-06-01,4,Stayed with a pet,Super cute place to stay for a time to relax and unwind. Glad we were able to stay here!
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We really enjoyed our two night stay and wish it could have been longer. The guest house is very quiet and comfortable. The surrounding farmland is splendid. We enjoyed having meals on the patio. The house location is good for access to town and the surround area. We appreciated that the kitchen was well stocked with spices, teas, coffees, breakfast items as well as pots, pans, bowls, utensils, and dishes. That made our meal prep much easier. The house had everything we needed to be comfortable. We will certainly consider the guest house should our travel bring us to Montrose in the future."
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great location. The cottage was quiet, clean and relaxing. We particularly enjoyed the patio and pergola."
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great views, nice comfortable place to relax after a long day of hiking!"

2022-05-01,5,Stayed about a week,"We booked this for my parents who were in town for graduation weekend. Kim went above and beyond, checking in to see that they had everything they needed, offering fresh eggs. Place was spotless, quiet, and comfortable. My parents kept saying over and over how nicely stocked it was and there were extras that they hadn't seen in any other AirBnB. Highly recommend."
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This cottage was well stocked with lots of amenities for the weary traveler. It was very quiet with comfortable beds. Being outside the small town of Montrose, CO, it is surrounded by small farms but only takes 5-10 minutes to get into town. We loved the farm fresh eggs and home baked sweet bread provided by the owner. Visiting the Black Canyon of the Gunnison National Park was well worth the trip to Montrose. The ""electric hills"" mountain biking trails were close by as well. Kim and Jerry were great hosts and the cottage was a great value. Should we ever return to the area, we would definitely stay here again."
2022-05-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Cleanest and comfiest stay in an AirBnB. If you are looking for a quiet/private location near Montrose and its sites, don't hesitate. Homeowners are delightful, added special touches (farm fresh eggs, baked treats, etc.) and most importantly, loved on our doggy."
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The Commons at Spring Creek is SUPERLATIVE! It is so well-appointed with everything a visitor might need! VERY comfortable! The location is a few miles out of downtown Montrose with a beautiful and rural setting, but so easy to get into town and to the Black Canyon. The hosts are lovely and helpful if you need them. We cannot recommend this place highly enough!"
2022-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Great place to stay! We spent our final week of parental leave here and it could not have been more relaxing and just what we needed!
2022-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This place was so cozy and adorable. Great proximity to downtown Montrose and only 30 min or so drive to Black Canyon of the Gunnison. Kim and her husband went above and beyond re: accomodations, leaving fresh eggs and sweets for us upon arrival. Would love to stay again."
2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Kim & Jerry’s cottage was an excellent base for our trip to visit the Black Canyon of the Gunnison & the Ouray hot springs. Kim’s homemade cookies & tea selection made a tasty afternoon treat and in addition to the fresh eggs for breakfast. Plus, Kim went above & beyond when she found my jacket & shipped it to me. Thank you 🙏"
2022-04-01,5,Stayed about a week,Great hospitality and the house was perfect!
2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great little place for a quiet Colorado getaway! My husband and I really enjoyed being there at the house. It was perfect for the two of us! We especially enjoyed the extra amenities and treats provided. Hope to stay there again next time!

Highly recommended!"
2022-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We loved staying here! Great location - close to downtown Montrose and the Black Canyon. Walking down the road to say hello to all of the farm animals was a total plus, as was the lovely, homey touches like the freshly baked muffins. Highly recommend!"
2022-02-01,5,Stayed with a pet,This is the best place in Montrose to stay. great views of the mountains from the back porch and they allow pets. Can't wait for the next trip. Beds are memory foam and really good. Has all the items needed for cooking small meals and good tea options provided.
2022-01-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Cozy 2 bedroom cottage with a little barn where we stored our 4 bikes and an extra refrigerator. Plenty of off street parking. A great base camp for visiting all the major sites in the area. I would definitely stay here again.
2022-01-01,5,Stayed with a pet,The house is even better than expected. Fresh cookies and eggs were delicious. The amenities were fantastic! From the snacks to the towels…..You will not be disappointed!! - my only regret is not staying there during the season to get to pick fresh veggies! We would definitely stay there again and highly recommend to anyone
2022-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Kim and Jerry provide a cozy, quiet space with many extra touches that will make your stay very pleasant."

We stayed at their beautiful cottage for several months while we completed our clinical rotation for school at the nearby hospital. The location was beautiful, the cottage was better than expected, Kim & Jerry‘s communication was amazing. We loved when their little kitties would come over to visit, and nearby neighbors were so friendly. We can’t say enough to express how wonderful our stay & the hosts were! I couldn’t have imagined staying anywhere better and I can’t wait to come back to visit! Thank you Kim & Jerry for everything!"

2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a great stay in Montrose at Kim’s place. The house was clean and tidy with extras like homemade cookies, snacks, and a great patio to hangout on late in the day. This was a perfect location to stay for our trip out to fish the Gunnison and high country rivers. The host sent us helpful info about the area and seemed to really care about the quality of our trip. Thank so much."
2021-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This place is great! There are beautiful mountain views off of the back porch, we enjoyed eating outside in playing games with them in view. Kim and Jerry were very kind and shared their garden veggies and fresh eggs with us. It's a comfortable place and easy drive to town. A very well put together guest book as well!"
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is such a wonderful little cottage. It is quiet, with a great view, and the patio is a wonderful place to enjoy a meal. It’s out in the country, but close enough to town that carryout is still warm when you get “home”. Kim and Jerry are great hosts, very kind and generous. The kitchen is well stocked with necessities, and Kim supplied many “extras” to make our stay more enjoyable. The furniture and bed are comfy, and the towels are plush. We truly enjoyed our stay!"
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place. Clean. close to town but far enough out it’s really nice. Host was super flexible and communicative with some of the changes to our trip
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Wow what a Air BnB…don’t look any further and book now. quite location, amazing host who goes the extra mile to make your stay super special and amazing property complete with mountain vista from your own personal patio.

2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This was our second stay at The Commons. This is a wonderful place to call home during our visit to Montrose. The cottage is very clean and well stocked. Kim and Jerry make sure that all of our needs are covered and are very responsive.
2021-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Comfortable, quiet, pastoral. But also close to town, the mountains, and the National Park. Highly recommended."
2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Kim’s space is in an excellent location in Montrose (about 30 minutes to the Black Canyon of the Gunnison NP South Rim visitor center) and about a 7-10 minute drive to the downtown area. The space is well organized, super comfortable and clean. We loved our farm fresh eggs and fresh veggies waiting for us. Kim was attentive and made sure to be available if we needed anything. We were also able to enjoy dinner outside one afternoon and really loved the view of the snow capped mountains in the background. This was just such a beautiful space inside and out. So happy we booked this Airbnb."

This. This is the standard that all other Airbnb’s should strive for.
Clean, well stocked, beautiful view, thoughtful hosts, convenient location, and welcoming!
The setting is out of a storybook. Cottage beside farm with spectacular Mountain View’s. The host greets us with fresh mixed greens (or vegetables in season ). On the dining table is homemade cookies, jam and protein bars ready to be packed for the days activities. In the fridge are fresh eggs and the coffee area is well stocked for morning. The back patio invites you to press pause and enjoy the beauty surrounding you. There is an extensive house Manuel including local information/tourism/medical or emergency info as well as an alphabetized list indicating where in the house the clothes iron or any number of amenities are located. Kim and Jerry are exceptional hosts and it was such a joy to stay here."
2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great little cottage in the countryside. Very close to the Black Canyon which was our reason for going to Montrose.
Kim and Jerry are great at communicating and answer questions very fast.
The kitchen is well equipped. Very quiet neighborhood.
We really enjoyed our stay there and would highly recommend it if you want to visit the Canyon."
2021-05-01,5,Stayed over a week,"We recently completed a 4 week work/play stay at The Commons. Kim and Jerry were wonderful hosts and were very accommodating to help us work productively, while allowing us to enjoy the beauty and peacefulness of the area. They made sure we had work spaces and plenty of power strips and USB connections for all of our devices. The internet speed was also very good and reliable.
There were tasty treats and breakfast foods provided for our first couple of mornings. The morning beverage selections include coffee, a nice assortment of teas, and hot cocoa with all the mix-ins. The kitchen was well stocked with all of the needed dishes, pots/pans, storage containers, and utensils. Although the refrigerator in the cottage is small, we had easy access to the full size refrigerator/freezer located in the small shed just outside. This was very handy and supported our longer stay needs.
Kim and Jerry were very welcoming of our dog. They provided a dog bed and dog bowls for him as well.

There was a lot of information regarding all of the different activities that are accessible in the area. This was very helpful in planning some of our weekend activities.
The outside shed was also a great place for us to safely store our road bikes. It was nice to be able to have them locked in a secure location during our stay.
The back patio with pergola was a wonderful feature. It allowed us to sit outside in the afternoon and enjoy some shade while soaking in the mountain views. The hanging lights from the pergola allowed us to enjoy the evening hours while watching the alpenglow on the mountain range.
It was a wonderful place to call home for a month!"
2021-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We loved this Airbnb. It is very clean and welcoming. The hosts are very thoughtful leaving notes and welcoming snacks. The hosts have everything you would need for cooking including some necessary food items. The view is amazing and the house is close to shopping and restaurants. If you are coming to the area this is your place to stay!! We will definitely be back!!
2021-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Was very clean and quite comfortable. Loved the little “extras” provided by the host - like cookies when we arrived and fresh eggs in the fridge! Enjoyed the more rural setting while still being just a couple minutes from the center of town. Parking is ample and easy, just outside the door. Had a great stay and would stay there again!"
2021-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"While the stay was enjoyable and comfortably, the biggest surprise was how incredible our host, Kim was during our time. We were greeted to fresh eggs and a delicious pie upon our arrival after a long drive, and Kim was always quick to respond with whatever we needed"

2021-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Comfortable, relaxing, with amazing views."
2021-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"You will be delighted upon opening the front door of this little cottage house! The furnishings are unique and pretty, as well as comfortable. The kitchen was stocked with all the basic foods and cookware. We were treated to a dozen fresh eggs from the hosts’ chickens and a plate of home baked muffins. Really wonderful. The view of the mountains from the patio and yard is stunning! We appreciated that they allowed our dogs. The yard is not fenced but we had our stake outs for them and you can walk them down the road around the farmer’s field behind the house. The hosts are very kind and were great to meet!"
2021-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The house is close enough to shopping and other food... with a full kitchen we opted to cook and eat out while on vacation in Montrose. The view from the backyard is incredible and we bbq’d on the grill one night and just enjoyed the backyard view of the mountains and surroundings.
The house was fully stocked with plenty of towels (bathroom and kitchen), dishes (to cook with and eat off), plenty of pillows in each of the bedrooms, lots of local information, great house information, and the owners live right next door if anything additional is needed."
2021-04-01,5,Stayed over a week,"The Cottage is so cozy and comfy, and the views out the back are amazing. Kim provided lawn chairs when the weather turned warm, and we got to just sit and soak in the sun and the mountain views. The beds and couches - especially the armchair! - are super comfortable. Plenty of style and character to the house as well, which we loved!! Kim responded quickly to all inquiries and let us know about neighbors' yardwork so we couldn't plan our day around the various goings-on. The wifi is super fast, and I was able to conduct my online video classes with no lags or problems. We loved everything about our stay."

2023-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"In our first time in the town of Montrose, visiting Black Canyons National Park, we had incredible accommodations with Jan's place. An older home that wears its years well, it was comfortable and cozy and made for a nice base of operations for the short time we were exploring area. An earlier reviewer mentioned the shower and we concur, it is one of the best ones I've ever encountered in an Airbnb - or any other place, for that matter. Jan was courteous and informative regarding the area and history of the house and town. As a former history teacher, this was one of my favorite elements to our stay. We would strongly recommend Jan's place if you are in the area. The neighborhood is wonderful, the town is nice and the house is truly homey."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We really enjoyed our stay at Jan’s home. Beds were very comfortable and he had the best shower. We got to chat with Jan a few times and enjoyed his hospitality.

We can only hope his place is available next time we are in town!"
2023-08-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Comfortable older home with lots of room. Updated kitchen and bathroom. The host suggested restaurants and things to do plus had water in the fridge.

It had everything we needed and more. Can’t wait for our next visit to the area and will try to stay at the Sunny Sleeper.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Surprisingly spacious house, in a quiet neighborhood. Great shower and fully equipped kitchen. The house has 2 AC units but both are the living/dining room so bedrooms can get warm at night if you don’t keep the doors open (we stayed here during the heat wave). Also, we stayed with our curious 2 year old toddler who loves to explore which was a challenge at times since the house had lots of breakable decor items."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Exactly as described. Jan was a pleasure to work with. Centrally located in Montrose, we could walk to every restaurant we wanted to go to. Beds were comfortable. Easy to drive to the sites we wanted to go to. Would stay again."

We want you to know, that even tho it is an old house (no fan in the bedrooms & no screens on the doors or windows) there IS a ceiling fan in the dining area and AC unit in the main living area.
MOST impressive were both beds! EXCELLENT nights sleep all around 👍
Newer mattresses and covers, with quality linen that smelled fresh!

You could tell that there was a fun culture to the property, and former guests would leave all types of supplies in the kitchen and bathroom. We happened to meet Jan and had a fun encounter with him.

2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great experience with Jan and his property. Jan was very responsive to my messages, helping me with questions or just replying to my followups.
The property was exactly what I wanted. It's a charming place, with a wonderful mix of orginal floorplan, with original doors and windows...and then with modern updates in the vital areas of bathroom and kitchen. Updates in the bathroom include a large shower, and the kitchen has an updated sink, dishwasher, fridge and stove. Other modern updates which came in handy was a printer that was available to tie into my laptop, as well as streaming TV, and a charging station with various connector types to charge devices. Jan has really put thought into making the space function for the traveller.
The back porch was large with chairs to sit out for morning coffee, and watch the hummingbirds.
My daughter and I spent five very comfortable days there, using the house as our base for the evening, as we enjoyed time with family that lives in the area. It was perfect for our needs."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed one night,We really liked this- it’s what airbandb is about. It’s a full functional house (very large) right near the downtown with everything you need. We loved the garden and the fire pit. Decorated with the owner’s (and perhaps family member) art etc it was very personal and comfortable. AC in front room so rest of house can get hot during day- night cools down just fine. Great location and very quiet. Very good communication with host about arrival etc.
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My husband and I enjoyed our stay at Jan's Sunny Sleeper so much! Jan is such a thoughtful and attentive host - whether you want to catch up on sleep, walk the neighborhood, watch TV/internet in comfort, use the house as a homeplace for adventures, or just lounge on the patio watching the hummingbirds, this is the place to do it.
The location is great - lots of restaurants and grocery stores are walking distance or a very short drive away. The beds are very comfortable, and I wish I had had more time - I probably would have cooked more!"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Perfect location. Jan's home is within walking distance to many restaurants, but not so close you hear street noise. Also, driving approximately 20 minutes puts you at Black Canyon of the Gunnison NP - close enough to go back at night to view the incredible night sky. He has a well stocked kitchen, comfy beds, excellent a/c and an incredible shower. Don't hesitate to book Jan's place when visiting the Montrose area."

It’s close to the southern entrance to Black Canyon National Park (10 mins from the park entrance). It’s also worth noting that Jan is a talented potter. You’ll find his flower pots and bowls around the house, which add to the homey feel of the house."

We would highly recommend your AirBnB to anyone needing to stay in Montrose!
Thank you again for everything!"
2022-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This home is more than just a charming historic haven in the heart of Montrose. Jan has placed such care into maintaining the integrity and beauty of this local gem; but more importantly, we found comfort when we needed it most. My father-in-law was admitted to the ICU at the local hospital just a few blocks down the street. The proximity was ideal and Our host was most understanding and accommodating. His demeanor and character are equally as charming and comforting as this home which is just what we needed while facing loss. Jan, you are a godsend. Words cannot express our gratitude."

We loved that it had easy access to shopping, etc. and that he even provided extra toothbrushes and toothpaste, soap, shampoo and conditioner. We flew in with just a personal bag that didn't allow us to bring these items in our bags on the flight so having them available at the house was a huge plus! We will definitely stay again while in Montrose. 🥰"

2023-09-01,5,Group trip,"We had an absolutely fantastic month-long stay at Ronnie’s Airbnb! The house itself was wonderful, and the location was ideal for our off-roading adventure. We had a blast exploring off-roading trails, hiking, and visiting Black Canyon off the Gunnison.
One of the standout features of this Airbnb is its prime location. It’s conveniently situated near grocery stores, gyms, and restaurants, making it incredibly convenient for day-to-day living.
Ronnie, our host, deserves special recognition. He truly went above and beyond to ensure our stay was as comfortable as possible. We had a few special requests, including an early check-in and check-out, and Ronnie was more than accommodating, handling everything with a pleasant and welcoming attitude.
I can’t recommend Ronnie’s Airbnb enough, and I look forward to returning for another memorable visit. Thank you for making our stay so enjoyable!"

2023-07-01,5,Stayed about a week,"5 Stars! Highly recommended.
Ronnie’s place is perfectly situated in Montrose. It is a short drive in any direction to many great places to see and experience. For my group, our mission was a fly-fishing expedition. We were able to fish the East Portal of the Gunnison at Black Canyon one day, then the Delores River just under Telluride the next. North Fork? No problem! All within an easy and very scenic drive. We took hundreds of photos! Aside from the house location, the house itself was sparkling clean and dust-free. The kitchen had everything we needed for cooking our own meals. Ha! My first experience with high-altitude cooking. Finally, that subsection for high-altitude cooking directions actually applied to me! They left coffee gift cards and bowl of chocolates. A nice touch. The beds are also quite comfortable. If you’re looking for a place that’s centrally located to some of Colorado’s finest, look no further!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed over a week,"The house was great! Roomie and clean. Great for multiple families. Ronnie was responsive to all my questions before and during our stay! We will

The house was near town so it was easy to eat out or go shopping."

2023-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,We were so impressed by our stay at Sue's B&B! The house was absolutely immaculate and was such a comfortable place for our stay. I loved all the amazing pictures around the house. This was the perfect location for all the day trips we were taking and for a much more affordable price than staying in Ouray or Telluride. The kitchen was stocked with all the essentials for cooking meals and we loved that coffee was provided so we did not have to bring our own.

2023-09-01,5,Group trip,Worked great for my group and would stayed again!
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"I believe the information given on web was accurate. The house was plenty in size for 2 couples and 2 kids. The bathroom off the hall was adequate, but a little tight, not a lot of space for putting personal items while getting ready. Missed my ceiling fans in bedrooms and missing some space to put phone, ipad etc. on, while charging at night. Also, missed a tv in bedroom but it all worked out. Had plenty of items in kitchen so we could make breakfast and a supper. Neighborhood was quiet, an unusual view out the backyard, but no issues with it, and a far off the mountains were nice to look at. We enjoyed our 2 day stay there and with the laundry facilities it was great not to have to go to the laundromat. I guess it would have been nice if the lights on the front of house could have been on when we arrived, as it was dark and had to pull into a couple of wrong driveways until we found the correct one, but we finally did. It's a nice house and it's well kept and clean."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This home had everything we needed and more. It was meticulously clean and very well maintained. The neighborhood seemed very safe, and it was extremely peaceful and quiet. It is an easy drive to Ouray, Telluride, Black Canyon NP, and Grand Mesa. Highly recommend this property if you're looking for a place to stay in Montrose!"

If available in the future, we would stay again."

It was very clean and had everything you needed including toilet paper, trash bags, dishwasher soap, laundry detergent, etc. The beds were comfortable too! We went into Black Canyon of the Gunnison twice and drove into Ouray a couple of times as well. It is a beautiful area, and Montrose is a lovely town to visit.

Part of our trip we encountered an incident with the southwest cancellation situation, our rental car stopped working, and Sue was so helpful, resourceful, and accommodating to us from day one. Our whole trip had many unforseen hiccups especially with our rental car not starting. Sue was so helpful she reached out to one of her resources for a battery jump, with the neighbor next door, on New Years Day at 8 am!!! What a relief! The house is very spacious and layout was great, letting us all stay together when eating and watching TV. Lots of towels, fully stocked kitchen, bath accessories, laundry detergent.

We slept soundly in the comfortable bed and cozy cottage. The sunset and sunrise from the porch were beautiful! The cottage has so many extras such as hot chocolate packets (in addition to the typical coffee pods), ziplock bags, soap/shampoo/conditioner dispensers in the shower; Valerie thought of everything! Also, there is a binder with local restaurant & shop information.

Quick and easy communication with Valerie, and we had the pleasure of chatting with her husband."

It was nice waking up to sunrise over the surrounding mountains & farmland. I bought some pear juice from the host’s farm stand to bring home. Zero complaints about the amenities there.
Location: There doesn’t seem to be much going on in Olathe itself so be prepared for a little bit of a drive to reach most of the main activities in the area. Montrose is ~20 min. & has everything you could need in terms of big box stores, pharmacies, etc. Rideway is ~40 min. & cute as can be if you’re looking for small town mountain feel. Ouray is about an hour - worth the drive to check out the “Switzerland of America.” Highly recommend a visit to Orvis Hot Springs near Ridgeway."
