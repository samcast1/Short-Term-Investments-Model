2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Such a beautiful house in a great quiet location tucked in the trees. The neighborhood was great and Kathys house was perfect spot to relax after travel and activities. The back porch is amazing with birds chirping and deer roaming outside of back yard fence on property. Everything was clean and in working order. The beds were very comfortable and couch and lounging chair. Huge tv in living room as well. I would highly recommend kathys house.
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Kathy’s place was perfect! By far the best air bnb I have found so far in Duncan. Clean, comfortable and very peaceful. Everything that you could possibly need is right there for you. And the bathtub was the best bonus to the stay! Can’t wait to stay again here soon."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed over a week,"I had a very pleasant stay at Kathy’s Home, so much so I’m going to miss the place. The neighbors are great in a nice neighborhood. Oh almost forgot You have deer come right up on the fence line if you pay attention at night you can see them or early morning ."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Kathy was such an amazing host. We had some last-minute accommodations that she was able to do right away. We were so grateful! Thank you, Kathy, for sharing your home with us."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Everything was as I expected and the owner is extremely accommodating and pleasant to deal with. I will not hesitate staying there again.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Kathy has a lovely home and a large peaceful backyard with comfortable rockers so that you can enjoy the Oklahoma evening breeze and a beautiful sunset after a long day. The home had everything we needed to make our stay an enjoyable one including a computer desk, propane grill, dishwasher, robot vacuum, & plenty of extra blankets and towels. There are 4 of us and we all had plenty of room without feeling like we were on top of one another, which is always appreciated when you’re traveling with children. I spent a good bit of time soaking in the jacuzzi tub and reading a book for some much needed alone time. We would absolutely stay here again."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Was my first stay at a bnb and exceeded all my expectations. Kathy went above and beyond in her duty as a host. Will definitely be back in the future.

2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The Emerald Bungalow was absolutely perfect. We got a little bit early check in and allowed to check out a bit late. It was so cute and everything was just what we needed to make our ""Sister"" trip perfect. We did alot of shopping, but mostly stayed right there in the bungalow and visited. The place was so comfortable and relaxing. Jana was just as sweet as she could be and so helpful!!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Saying that I enjoyed my time staying in this place would be an understatement. It is nice and quiet as it is located in a peaceful neighborhood. The check-in was quick and easy and Jana made sure I had everything I needed throughout my stay. She even measured the bathroom door for me before I arrived to make sure my wheelchair would fit through; this really meant a lot to me. It's a very accessible home and the decor is absolutely stunning. Organized, spacious, clean, relaxing, and serene are just a number of words I can use to describe this lovely home. I was also able to use the TV to watch my Dallas Mavericks play against the OKC Thunder in the playoffs. The dining room table was huge and allowed me to spread out and work accordingly. This place is amazing and I'm hoping to come back sometime in the future.
Thank You Jana!"

Everything about being here was easy; it was something we really appreciated even more during a trying time."

2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Truly a very special Tiny House.
Just arrived from a long flight followed by a long drive and this was just perfect for me to start my adventure road trip.
The Tiny House is super cute and very well stocked up with everything and more.
The outside and the surrogate beautiful.
Traci is fantastic, helpful and genuine a very lovely person.
When I made the reservation I asked her if she could remove something from the accommodation because it would have made me feel uncomfortable and she removed it without any question or hesitation.
This is what I call a Super Host.
I highly recommend this lovely Tiny House you won’t be disappointed.

Because cooking at home was limited to a 2 eye burner, toaster oven and microwave makes cooking multiple things hard. So this place gave me and my husband the luxury of a fully stocked kitchen as far as appliances and pots and pans. The back yard is amazing. We nearly lived out there. This place is amazing.

We had some weird interactions with a neighbor shining their flashing light at our windows and towards the backyard while we were out at night, and the neighborhood dogs never stop barking.

2023-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"The description of Traci’s place was very accurate. It’s in a rural setting, but literally just a couple minutes from town. Comfortable, attractive, and clean. Fun touches everywhere—we loved it—inside and out. Our dog was welcome, too, which is a great selling point for us. Roomy, fully-fenced (and mowed) backyard with great patio spaces where one can slow down for a bit, sit, listen to the crickets and frogs or watch the fireflies at dusk. We were just passing through for one night as part of a longer road trip, but we would purposely seek Traci’s place out if we were going to be anywhere near again, and add a couple or few days to our stay just for the enjoyment of it!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,This was our first stay at the Tiny House and it probably won't be our last.

The fenced yard is perfect for our small dog and the back porch is great for grilling and eating outside. The Tiny House is efficiently arranged. It has everything needed for cooking and a restful atmosphere . We enjoy the privacy of the location slightly out of town and the convenience of being close to family and friends. We give it a 10 out of 10 and look forward to returning.
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The house so super clean and cute!
2023-01-01,5,Stayed one night,My second stay was just as fabulous as the first. I have several more weeks of work in Duncan and will always choose Traci’s place for my stay!
2023-01-01,5,Stayed one night,Excellent as always.

2023-01-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We had a wonderful, relaxing 2 days at Traci's tiny house. The house was clean, decorated so cute and has everything a person could need and then some. The backyard was a comfortable place to sit and enjoy the evening and play with our dog. Will definitely stay again if we are in the area."
2023-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"Traci's Tiny House is the perfect get away with all the comforts of home. Oliver (the dog) gives it two paws up! His favorite - the backyard with the fire pit and chairs for his human to relax. Me (the human), I give it 2 thumbs up. My favorite - the welcoming sign on the side of the old Plymouth in the front yard!
Seriously, Traci has a wonderful home to share and I am already planning my next stay in the Spring/early Summer. Description and pictures of the property are exactly what you experience and the directions were perfect as our arrival was right after nightfall and I can no problem finding it. Traci had left the lights on for us and we felt like we were visiting a good friend's home. I highly recommend the Tiny House to anyone looking for a quiet, relaxing stay while in the area."
2023-01-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Very nice tiny home with plenty of privacy just outside of Duncan. We could get anywhere we wanted in town in 10-15 minutes and were far enough out that we felt secluded. The only problem we had the first day was that the water heater wasnt as large as we were accustomed. We scheduled our showers to be a little over an hour apart and had no problems afterward. The place was cozy and welcoming. We had a wonderful stay and would rent here if we needed to visit this area again.
2023-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"We loved staying at The Tiny House. It was spotlessly clean, the area was quiet, the decor was fun, and there was a great patio with a fenced-in yard. We've never stayed in an Airbnb that was so well equipped with information about the local area and personal items a person might need while traveling (toothpaste, razors, Q-Tips, etc). Traci was easy to communicate with, and we appreciated that her list of rules was short and simple (at some places it's like reading a novel)! We would definitely stay there again."

2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is a beautiful little house and a great spot to relax! Plus, if you like to bird watch, there are painted buntings(!), hummingbirds, red headed woodpeckers, cardinals, chickadees, titmouse, Guinea fowl, hawks, etc. around! I'd recommend bringing or getting a plastic hummingbird feeder and bringing some sugar to make the nectar if you come during late Spring-Summer. We put up our own bird feeder for the other birds, and also made our own birdbath out of an upside down frisbee...super classy, LOL. The neat downtown square in Duncan is best enjoyed during the week or earlier on Saturday, as everything shuts down early on Saturday and is closed on Sunday (so, we missed much of the stores). Eat at Bob's Landmark Eatery--thanks to our host, we did and it was delicious! Great stay, we hope to visit again!"

2022-05-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"The Tiny House is the perfect choice for a couple who enjoys spending time in the Duncan area. The house is new and quite cleverly designed and constructed. There are several upgrades (antique furnishings) and many personal decor touches. It has a cozy and comfy vibe. The 2 out door spaces are excellent for grilling (new grill), eating outside, and hanging out. The yard has a privacy fence on the north and the wooded area behind the west chain link fence gives an open-outdoor-wooded feel while keeping the dog in the yard.
The house is cozy and the space, albeit small, is designed to be functional for a nice stay. We can’t wait to go back. 💙"

My first time here, and I will definitely be back."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Excellent hosts!
Left us fresh brownies 😁
Great communication!
Amazing, peaceful back yard!
The second “bedroom” is very comfortable but it does not have a door and doesn’t offer privacy.
Therefore, if you are staying in the third bedroom, you have to walk through the second room to get to the rest of the house.
It’s a 2 bedroom with an additional area with a sleeping space."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This home was absolutely adorable! It was exactly as pictured and even better in person! She had fresh brownies when we arrived as well as a plate of goodies from chips to Candy to oatmeal to breakfast, bars, cheese and crackers. There were cold Waters in the fridge as well as a few pops and even had my favorite creamer for my coffee in the morning! This was far better than any motel I've ever stayed at! The backyard was unbelievably gorgeous. So many flowers and sitting areas even had a game room! We loved our stay here!"

2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,House was beautiful. A lot of different decorations. I had to keep my kids away from most of the things but they did great. Beds are comfortable. They left lots of treats like soda candy oatmeal.. that kind of stuff. The only thing I didn’t like is that one of the rooms doesn’t have a door. The floors are wood so it’s super loud at night lol. The backyard was beautiful. Thank you for allowing us to stay. We will definitely be back

2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This little “Gem” was a true find. Unfortunately the trip wasn’t pleasure. We were in Duncan for a funeral. Linda went out of her way to make our stay pleasurable. Looking forward to the next trip to Duncan. We were 2 older woman and an elderly lady. This place isn’t for little kids. Which she states. There is a game room older kids might enjoy though. But the place is furnished with lots of wonderful knick knacks. I’d be terrified to bring my grandkids, lol. The third bedroom is a walk through of the second bedroom so the only privacy is the master. So be sure people are comfortable without privacy."

Linda was a great hostess with welcoming note and attention to thoughtful details. The home is truly a ""Gem"" with outdoor space to relax. It was difficult to leave the oasis. Perfect for sister's getaway weekend.
As they say in the UK, the home is kitted out with amenities.
The quiet location is great for visiting downtown and museums, including family history center. The Wishbone Scratch Kitchen restaurant at the golf course is open to the public and one of my favorites.
We look forward to returning as soon as our schedule allows."
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay awsome host!!
2024-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The house is a couple blocks off the main highway. It is easy to find. Linda had the house set up beautifully for us when we walked in the door. Well lit, fireplace going, warm, and inviting. This is a cute place for couples to stay. There is a lot of knick knacks which would be tempting for young children which she mentions in the listing. Linda was very responsive in her communication and willing to do whatever it took to make our stay as nice as possible. Overall, the place was clean, updated, and pleasant. Highly recommend for a couples weekend get away."

2023-08-01,5,Stayed over a week,Great host who was very attentive. We will book again if we're ever back im the area.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Linda’s hospitality was exceptional! She was very responsive and her home was very clean and serene! We’ll most definitely return!
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Beautiful backyard that's large and fenced-in . Great game room for the kids to play in.
Linda was a super responsive host. The weather was very hot during our stay and she brought over and kiddie pool and sprinkler for the kids to play in.
Lots of thoughtful touches to the house.
We will definitely stay again if we're back in Oklahoma!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We loved our time at The Gem! Linda and her husband are Great Hosts. They were very quick to respond to our questions. Their home is very warm and inviting, we were greeted with soothing classical music, brownies, soft drinks and wine. Perfect after a long day driving to town. It is very clean and beds very comfortable. Beautiful backyard Oasis. We will stay again when we travel back to Duncan. There was a monkey inside one of the closets! You’ll just have to book a stay to find it!"
2023-05-01,5,Group trip,Very cute house...backyard was wonderful for hanging out. The refreshments were a great bonus!!
2023-05-01,5,Group trip,"This was an absolutely amazing space for the weekend. It was exactly what we needed to do before wedding photos for the bride and her bridesmaids, the backyard is absolutely beautiful."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed over a week,"We had traveled half way across the United States to deal with a large family estate here in Oklahoma. The main house was a mess and ultimately unlivable. Just by chance, right across the street was the Little Gem Air BnB. It was almost too good to true. We inquired as to it's availability and was joyed to find it was open. The host Linda and Bill where there to save the day. They both worked hard at making our stay as comfortable as possible. The house is lavishly furnished and has everything a family would need. The beautiful house so perfect in every detail, from the freshly cut tulips on the coffee table to the large spacious back yard. If your traveling for business or pleasure in or around Duncan Oklahoma, the Little Gem is your home away from home. Thank's Linda and Bill for being our family when we needed it."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Responsive hostess and she goes the extra mile in decor and having welcoming music playing upon arrival. Beautiful, peaceful backyard. Lovely swings & flowers."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"I loved it. It was too nice, in my opinion, for all of the kids we had. All between ages 3 and 4 (I didn't want them to break anything.)Unfortunately the kids got sick while at my Dads and only came for the last 2 nights of our stay. They has a blast, but the beds are high for small kids. We had one small issue but when we messaged about it, they were there within maybe 10-30 minutes. I was sleepy so i wasnt watching the clock. My mom is wheelchair bound so i found the best bedroom for her was the back room so we could get her in an entrance without too much struggle. There is a small issue of the middle room having no solid doors so there isnt much privacy. And the master room could not close all the way. Me and my husband slept there. Not having the privacy we are used to kind of bummed us out, but we still loved how nice the room was. The back yard is also amazing. Even though I did not get as much time back there, I loved the look. I would definitely recommend, in fact, I did."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,Our guests that stayed there said that everything was comfortable and that they really enjoyed their stay!
2023-03-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Nice place. Very well kept up and decorated. Main downside is there are too many nice decorations and therefore too cluttered to be practical. The limited counter space is covered up with decorations with no place to put them to use the space. Too many very nice pillows on the beds, but no place to put them."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Picture perfect! Linda’s love for decorating and hospitality is evident at the Gem! We loved the patio spaces with cozy furniture and fire pit. Thanks for all the little extras like hot cocoa, cookies, chocolates, beverages, and other snacks."
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We needed a break from caregiving. The fresh flowers, relaxing, music, and warm fireplace welcomed us in. Linda checked in with us and was concerned when the weather turned ugly. We enjoyed relaxing in the backyard. We lit the firepit and snuggled in soft throws. The decor was beautiful and we felt so comfortable. We would love to come back when all of the flowers are blooming! This gem is a jewel worth discovering! It would be fantastic for a girlfriend getaway too!"
2023-02-01,5,Group trip,"Great Airbnb, an experience all by itself! We came here for a graduation, and we were able to enjoy the place, very peaceful and comfortable. Every single room is well thought of."
2023-01-01,5,Group trip,The Gem was absolutely beautiful. Warm and welcoming from the moment we walked in. Darling curb appeal as well. We traveled to Oklahoma for my father’s funeral. Linda was so kind to leave home baked goods and a sympathy card for us upon our arrival. We enjoyed our time there so much we wanted to extend our stay. There are so many cozy places to relax…inside and out. The beds are very comfortable and the bedding was luxurious. It truly felt like home away from home. We can’t say enough about how blessed we were to stay here. We will definitely return.
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place was absolutely beautiful and pristine and clean… the decor was stunning and all the amenities of home… tons of essentials…pots ,pans,dishes,towels…ect!

2023-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,This is the first Airbnb I’ve ever rented and I was so pleasantly surprised! The hosts truly have a beautiful home and it was an honor to stay there. They are such genuinely kind people I don’t think we could have found a better place or a better host. The house has absolutely everything you could need or want. When I mentioned that my kids found malt glasses but no blender they dropped a new blender off so we could make shakes! It was such a kind thoughtful gesture and it was so appreciated. The backyard is beautiful and we got to enjoy it several days and evenings. The house is very clean and very comfortable. There’s plenty do like books games puzzles tv porch swing… the rooms are spacious and comfortable. My only issue is that I had to leave lol seriously I have zero complaints and was so happy with my stay
2022-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,great stay
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Beautifully decorated home inside and out. Linds was a great host. We would definitely stay here again and recommend to anyone traveling to Duncan. The Gem would be a great place for a girl’s weekend. I’d like to see the yard in spring/summer it was too cold for us to enjoy it.
2022-12-01,5,Group trip,"Linda’s house was immaculate. Super clean and decorated beautifully. Her attention to detail was amazing. She had a fire going, Christmas music playing, homemade cookies, snacks, and cups for hot cocoa all ready for us when we arrived. I highly recommend staying here if you are coming to Duncan. Thank you so much Linda!"
2022-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The entire stay was incredible. I couldn’t ask for a better experience, and I have never had such an incredible experience before. So thankful for them! I definitely plan on staying here every time I’m in Oklahoma."

I will always look for one of December’s listings when visiting Duncan, knowing I won’t be disappointed."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I brought my husband to Duncan to show him around my old hometown. This place was so great that it made it hard to want to leave the room! It’s like something out of a Southern Living magazine. We could tell that great care was taken to make it look and feel so comfy, with just the right amount of eccentric touches. I look forward to returning in the future!"

2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The Rose was beautifully appointed, had all the comforts of home, and it allowed us quick access to all the principal Duncan spots we needed. A much better value for the money over Duncan’s overpriced hotels, we’ll definitely stay here again. Heartily recommend thoroughly reading the notes from December about Duncan’s addresses when you book—your GPS can get confused. Other than that, it’s beautiful, cozy and homey. Wish we’d stayed longer. Next time!"

Apartment was beautifully furnished, quiet and tastefully updated with modern amenities respectful to the original building architecture.
One of our favorite touches was the converted closet office by the sitting area. It was a great spot for making a few calls and getting caught up on email.
Cannot say enough about this fun stay and really look forward to trying out the other three rooms."

I absolutely loved everything about how it was decorated but not only that it was immaculately clean, the bed was soo comfortable, it felt spacious to be more of a loft! My husband & one year old all stayed & felt like we had plenty of room! There was a perfect spot in the back to pop up his travel crib so it’s works for a small family, couples or just on your own!! They have the bathroom stocked with any & everything you could have forgotten.. you can tell they put a lot of thought & care into the place!! I’ll definitely be trying out the other rooms they have there when I make another trip back to Duncan bc they all look just as perfect as the Rose!!"

We enjoyed the patio out back both in the evening and the morning. We had our pets with us and they felt very much at home. It is an older home with its quirks as the listing states, but it was decorated with lovely furnishings, spacious and very comfortable. We love to cook, and the kitchen is well-equipped. We chose to sleep in the blue room, and the bed was very comfortable. This would be a great place to stay whether for a short trip or longer time. There is a desk, and washer and dryer in a room off of the kitchen. We wished we could have stayed longer, and would love to come back. The community seemed to have a number of restaurants and things to see. We did find a cute smoothie bar located inside a martial arts studio!"

We didn’t request anything from Susan but she did check on us and offered help if we needed anything. We will be back the next time we stay in Duncan!
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Everything about our stay was wonderful! Susan was amazing and communicative, especially when we had an issue with the hot tub. The home is beautiful and everything is as you see in the pictures. Lovely area, good restaurant across the road, and peaceful, beautiful evenings with a gorgeous sunset view over the golf course."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We enjoyed our stay. We had a great family Thanksgiving with enough room for all of us. Kids enjoyed playing pool and the poker table was a big hit. Hot tub was nice on the cold evenings. If you need a house to hold a big family in Duncan, this is your place."
2023-11-01,5,Group trip,"Great place to stay with plenty of room.

2023-10-01,5,Group trip,"We had a great stay. Beautiful home, wonderful amenities, and plenty of thoughtful extras were included. Great place."
2023-10-01,5,Group trip,was a great place
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Susan’s place was great, it worked perfect for my family and I. The next time we are in Duncan we will be staying here again."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Susan's House was a respite from the outside world for our large family during a stressful time--the passing of our family matriarch. We cried, laughed and played together under one roof. We celebrated a life well lived and toasted the next generation while sheltered in a beautiful home that provided everything we could possibly need. Thank you, Susan, for helping turn the unbearable into a cherished piece of family lore."
2023-08-01,4,Stayed with kids,"My family thoroughly enjoyed our stay. We traveled with a group of 11 ranging in age from 3 to 77. The multiple common areas were very accommodating allowing for different groups to do their own thing but still be in close proximity to each other. It provided the perfect togetherness without being on top of each other. We could relax on the side porch or in the back grill area. We enjoyed the ping pong as well as the pool table. We spent time in the dining/living room just hanging out with games, books and snacks. The kitchen was sufficient and the den was a favorite spot for movies. The kids enjoyed the bunk room being upstairs, giving them a space to be a little loud and rowdy away from parents and grandparents. We also had easy access to the pool across the street. The pool did have some debris but nothing too disruptive and obviously not in the host’s control. We would definitely book again. Susan communicated well and was reasonably available and accommodating."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,My sister and I have now stayed at Susan’s for the second year in a row- it works great for our families- plenty of space and great!
2023-07-01,5,Group trip,Wonderful place
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We had a pleasant stay and enjoyed all this home has to offer. The back door sticks but other than that everything was perfect. In addition, my grand baby forgot her comfort pillow when we checked out and Susan was quick to respond and ensure we were able to retrieve it. Thank you for offering such a lovely home to stay in."
2023-07-01,5,Group trip,"Susan’s place was an absolute beautiful and clean place to stay. We made some great memories in the hot tub, pool table, and ping pong tournaments. There was so many different options of entertainment in the house and a golf course right across the street. There were also many food options around the area. We all had a great vacation visiting family and we would love to stay there again the next time we visit!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"A beautiful home for a get away, the family and I enjoyed"
2023-06-01,5,Group trip,"Gorgeous home, very spacious, super comfy beds, the poker room was sick and the hottub was awesome. Made for a great stay"
2023-06-01,4,Stayed with kids,We loved the location and the ability to use the amenities at the golf course. The house was definitely large enough for our 8. The kids loved their room - they had the best bathroom. It was too warm for the hot tub but we tried anyway. Small plumbing issue - Susan responded immediately. Over all great - we will rent again.
2023-06-01,5,Group trip,"Awesome stay, just as it said and very spacious! Super fun place"

2023-04-01,4,Group trip,"Place is beautiful, clean and kitchen is well stocked. Wished there had been lighting on back porch for grilling. Host is very responsive, much appreciated. Not crazy about downstairs windows with no blinds or curtains. Was great to have plenty of parking and easy check in. Would consider staying again."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,Such a fun place to stay with a large group. Plenty of different things to do keeping all entertained.
2023-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We loved this place, and will definitely be back! It was perfect for our family as we had people of all ages, and there was something for everyone to do!"

2023-01-01,5,Group trip,.
2023-01-01,4,Stayed with kids,"This was a great house for our family New Year celebration! The pool table was a huge hit. We did buy chalk, there wasn’t any. My grandbabies enjoyed the hot tub! The kitchen does not have a small mixer or potato masher but we made do with what they have. My grown children brought bikes to ride with their children. They parked them in the back yard. (Only to be seen by the neighbors; chain link fence on that side) Two of the bikes were stolen, not the fault of the owner, just saying if you bring any bikes be sure to put them in the garage which we did after the bikes were stolen. Maybe a lock on that gate would deter this from happening.
There were mixed feeling about the beds…I slept fine.
Great weekend get a way!"
2022-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,Place was great. Recommend a way to watch sports without having to purchase an app or subscription. Other than that my family and I enjoyed our stay.

2022-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Beautiful, clean and comfortable house. Definitely will book again when i go back to Duncan."
2022-08-01,5,Group trip,It was a very lovely home! The sunset from the balcony was beautiful. Perfect for a weekend getaway.
2022-07-01,4,Stayed with kids,Very lovely home!
2022-06-01,4,Stayed with kids,"We had a great time here. House was located right across the street from the country club and we did use the pool at the club without any issues. The pool was a lot of fun and the kids had a blast! It was a great location for our family going on and out of town to various functions.
The house was spacious and able to sleep most of our family members. The bunk bed room allowed the kids to stay together, which they loved!
The only reason I didn’t give 5 stars was because the only bedroom that was connected to a bathroom was the kid’s room. It was the largest bathroom. The other bedrooms did not connect to a bathroom. It was hard to tell this on the listing. This turned off several older family members as 3 rooms share 1 upstairs bathroom.
However, the rooms were tastefully decorated and spacious. The beds and bedding were super comfortable! There were plenty of seating areas and entertaining things to do. We enjoyed drinking coffee in the morning on the balcony overlooking the golf course.
The best part of the house is the poker room where we spent nights talking and playing cards!
All-in-all, we had a great time and the house was a perfect meeting-up place for our family. We definitely enjoyed our stay there and would stay again!"
2022-06-01,5,Group trip,Perfect house to gather with friends for our 30th reunion. So spacious - really beautiful.
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Perfect house for a big family gathering! The only thing missing is a pool.
2022-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Great home in quiet neighborhood! Very clean and spacious, lots of room to gather and stretch out. You can definitely tell the owner put a lot of thought into the little details that really make for a comfortable stay."
2022-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Due to a death in our family, we needed a home to accommodate 11 people, and we needed it pretty fast. This house was the first one I saw in the area and I didn’t look beyond this listing.
It was very reasonably priced and had more than enough space for our family.
We played a lot of pool while we were waiting for other family to finish the responsibilities of preparing the actual funeral, which gave us a much needed distraction.
The hot tub was primed and ready to go, although we did not indulge. The poker room was awesome too.
Fantastic communication from the owner and we will definitely use this home again whenever we need to return to Duncan to visit our remaining family members."
2022-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This home is beautiful, it accommodated our entire family of 9. The amenities it has made it fun for the kids. They played pool the entire time and enjoyed listening to music on the tv. Also, the food next door at the Wishbone was delicious. We woke up to amazing sunrises and sunsets on the balcony. This place is a must stay, everything you need in a stay. Thank you again!!"
2022-02-01,5,Group trip,Beautiful home! So much room. the hot tub was amazing. We will most definitely stay here again
2022-02-01,5,Group trip,"Great place! Easy check-in and in a nice quite, peaceful neighborhood. The couches are a trap, do not smell them cause they will ensnare you to stay. Loved it!"
2021-12-01,5,Group trip,"Beautiful home, love the Hot-tub! Wish the fire places were functional though! Maybe next year!"
2021-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,This house is perfect! We had a group stay here for a wrestling tournament. It exceeded our expectations. I want to come back just to enjoy the house more. It is so well kept and clean. The design and details are an added bonus!
2021-11-01,4,Stayed with kids,"Our family really enjoyed our time at this house and there are plenty of things to do as a family and with friends! However, we did find cockroaches twice in the kitchen. Other than that, a big cozy house with pretty rooms!"

I would definitely stay here again and recommend it to my friends and family!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We absolutely loved this house! It was very spacious, clean, and comfortable. The location was so nice especially with the wonderful restraunt right across the road."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Second stay at Susan’s place and we really enjoyed the house. Used the nice outdoor grill and super nice stove. Would definitely stay again.
2024-02-01,5,Group trip,It was such a pleasure to have Susan as our Host. We were in town for a wedding. We arrived a little bit early for check-in. We were tired from the long drive and had rehearsal in a few hours. I called Susan and asked if we could check-in a little earlier and she didn’t hesitate to say yes! Susan was very professional and handled everything with ease. The location was perfect and close to everything. The house was very clean and welcoming. We had a wonderful experience and we would highly recommend this Airbnb to others. Thank you Susan for making our stay the best stay ever!
2024-02-01,5,Group trip,The pictures don’t do this location justice. Beautiful home so clean and very spacious.
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This home is wonderfully located across from a public golf club with a wonderful restaurant. The house is spacious, has a great kitchen and was very clean. The sunroom would be great for family fun, as would the pool and hot tub ( we were there in January). The 2 car carport was a nice bonus. We were very pleased."
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,House was very beautiful and large enough to have family over during my visit to my home town.

2023-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,All of my family really enjoyed the place. We will stay there again!
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was such a unique layout and perfect for our needs, although I could easily see how it would also be great for a larger group. It had everything we needed and even something we didn’t know we ‘needed’ - an ice machine! There were helpful baby items too. We didn’t get to take advantage of the beautiful unheated pool but the hot tub was wonderful. And what a cute patio with firepit. Thank you for a great stay."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We will definitely be back! We thoroughly enjoyed every part of our stay!
2023-11-01,5,Stayed over a week,"Everything was beyond expectations, great place and we look forward to come back!!!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Very clean, great location, & Susan was an awesome host! We enjoyed staying at this air bnb. There was so much to do at the house that you could get away with not leaving to do anything. Between the pool, hot tub, and fire pit - there is something for everyone in your family. You will not be disappointed renting this home! It was cozy and comfortable."
2023-10-01,5,Group trip,This place was a great location for us. We were near family and then relaxed in the hot tub at night after our wedding and events. Everything was clean and the beds were very comfortable. The bedrooms are very spacious. I really liked the fresh eucalyptus in the shower! The water pressure isn't the greatest in the master bathroom. The outside space was nice to talk with family and enjoy a meal together. We had family bring over food so we didn't use the kitchen but the stove looked awesome to cook on. We would like to have a girls weekend there next summer. The lock on the door is coded and that challenged the kids who thought it was like the old cell phone texting. Lol! Plenty of parking space in a quiet neighborhood.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Susan was a great host. Her home was clean and private, and very comfortable—exactly what we were looking for. We needed to add a night, last minute, and she was very accommodating."
2023-09-01,5,Group trip,"Placed parents, brother, sister and spouses here for a wedding layover. They were very pleased."
2023-08-01,5,Group trip,Great house. My friends and I stayed for the weekend. The house was very comfortable and cozy. The pool and back yard were great also. Plenty of space for the 5 of us. We would definitely recommend this house and would stay here again.

2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,We enjoyed our stay here. Was close to everything we need and our relatives.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,Great place to get away. Spacious and updated living area. The backyard pool area was a dream.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,Beautiful home. The pictures are very accurate. It's very spacious and cozy. The kitchen is well stocked and the stove is beautiful. Although we didn't use it because we didn't cook. Moms need a break too. 😂 It's a very quiet neighborhood. We loved the pool especially for our kids. The pool house also had a lot of pool floaties and a pump if needed. There is also a grill in the backyard. We didn't use it but it was great to have one if we wanted to. We loved that there was a bathroom and refrigerator by the pool. So we didn't have to track water in and out of the house. The only complaint was We couldn't get one side of the hot tub to work. Which wasn't a big deal. However PLEASE use caution when turning on the water anywhere in the house. It is extremely hot. There should be a warning because I mean burn yourself hot. I would definitely recommend this home and would stay here again. Spend the money. It's worth it.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,Had a wonderful stay! Definitely worth booking again. Backyard is fantastic!

2023-05-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Very comfortable accommodations. There was most everything we needed, including an iron and ironing board and board games. The spaces were thoughtfully furnished and equipped. We didn’t have an opportunity to use the kitchen but it did seem to have more than usual in terms of cookware, dishes and utensils. The host left coffee pods and a couple of bottles of water that was much appreciated. We would select this property again."

The pool area has two decks for sitting, one with a firepit. One area gets great shade all day. Half of the pool is shaded in the morning. The pool is quite large and there is also a hot tub. The owner has provided pool towels and toys.
The neighborhood is very safe. The house is just up the street from the Country Club and convenient to the main area of town and the grocery store. The owner is very responsive. We would book this property again!"

You will be so pleased with every amenity that is provided. Our family is already looking forward to our next stay."
2022-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This is a gem of a location! Our family of five and my parents enjoyed our time immensely!

2022-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,This property is a gem! We enjoyed the quiet neighborhood and sitting by the pool to relax. The beds are comfortable. The bathrooms and kitchen are well equipped. Plenty of room for a family. The tasks to do at checkout were reasonable (I’ve found the list of tasks to be excessive at some places we’ve stayed). We visit the Duncan area often because I have family there and this is the best place we’ve stayed so far! We will be back!
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Cute place awesome with the pool during these Texas summers! Host was very communicative, and just great overall. Will be staying here again!!!"
2022-05-01,5,Group trip,We loved the house on Westgate! The pictures on airbnb seriously do not the beautiful backyard oasis justice! We loved how much room there was to sit in in different areas of the house and in the backyard. I also loved the look of the house with all the updates they did. It was a mini vacation away from home and a beautiful setting to reunite with family. We had so much fun. We also appreciated how quickly Susan responded to a question we had. We will definitely stay there again the next time our family wants to meet up in Duncan!
2022-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,This is a great home in Duncan. It had everything we needed and more. Will plan to stay again when we return next year. Thanks Susan!

2022-02-01,4,Group trip,"Stayed in this rental over the weekend to attend a wedding. Picked it for its location and 2nd full bathroom. It just didn’t have any shampoo or soap as advertised, or any extra blankets that didn’t smell like feet. Walls are thin so sound echos throughout the house. Overall, the stay was adequate."
2022-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,My family loved getting to stay here! The house was so nice and clean! If we ever find ourselves back in Duncan we will be staying here!

2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This home is amazing and so welcoming. A real home away from home with everything you need to enjoy yourself. We will definitely be back to enjoy the pool during our summer vacation.
2021-11-01,4,Stayed with kids,"Our stay in Duncan was nice. ****If you are going for graduation from Fort Sill**** The home is outside their permitted travel area. They are permitted 20 miles and are told to stay within the Lawton area, this house is 30+ miles from base. The home was mostly as described. The pool is not heated, so I definitely feel this should be stated in the description. That way you know it is not usable except for in summer months. I also feel the price should reflect this. They definitely have drainage issues at the house. Our first night there we had to stand in 3 inches of water to shower. The property management was great and left us some drain crystals on the porch to use and they did help. The home was clean and furnishings we're nice. Loved their waffle towels!"
2021-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The house is fantastic, exactly what our family needed for a weekend getaway ♥️"

Thanks Madison, we will definitely be back to this Airbnb!"

Hopefully it will be an annual family tradition! Absolutely 10 stars!"

It was functional with kids (1&4), felt super safe (all the neighbors I saw smiled and said hello), immaculately clean, and as described in the listing and pictures. Gorgeous decor throughout - it could totally have been styled by Joanna Gaines. Everything was well thought out and very spa-like. Beds and linens were so luxurious and comfy, we had to get the names of brands! And the backyard was just dreamy. Would definitely rebook if I ever find myself back in that area.

Tim’s Place has the best biscuit Ive ever eaten!!! The breakfast is delicious I had the Cowboy Biscuit! “Duncan Donuts” has tasty donuts and I really enjoyed the jalapeño/cheese sausage roll. Duncan is near two wildlife refuges, both worth a visit, lots of bison and beautiful Longhorns at Wichita refuge. Also enjoyed floating on Lake Latonka and seeing a movie at the historic Vaska theater. This little town stole my heart."

I was lucky enough to make use of the claw foot bathtub on my last day, and highly recommend anyone staying to do the same.
It was so comfortable I booked an extra night. Don’t miss the opportunity to stay at this gem. I hope to stay again if I come back for work.

The kitchen was particularly filled with the little things that you need when throwing a breakfast or lunch together. My hosts were readily available and super helpful.

2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"December was a great Host, If I asked a question she was very prompt. The place was great. I wasn't sure where we were supposed to eat because a house rule was not to eat in the bedroom or on the sofa but the kitchen had one barstool and it was difficult to eat at the kitchen counter other than that everything was great. it was a last minute stay and we felt at home."

2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The Byrd Nest was a great place for me to relax after long working shifts. Everything was preserved new, clean, and functional. The decor was one of my favorite accents of the Nest. I definitely was thankful to have a full kitchen amenities and a washer and dryer. A few times there I would wake up in the night to car loud car engines going by, but other than that, the view from the stairway balcony was peaceful. Very clean, and comfortable and I felt very much at home. I am glad I brought my own blanket because the ones that were in their bins were a bit rough feeling. Eating dinner with the barstool and the kitchen counter was the only uncomfortable seating place for meals. Overall, I highly recommend the Byrd Nest, and would stay there again."

I liked how close the apt. was to town and most of the things that I wanted to do and places I wanted to be.
Having Wi-Fi allowed me to work from there as well at my convenience.
I liked the rope lighting on the outside. It made the place stand out and easy to find which place was mine at night.
When I had questions, they answered quickly.
Thank you for a very nice stay!"

2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,absolutely love this house. I am staying for 3 months while on contract as a travel nurse and it is such a warm and relaxing place to unwind after a long overnight shift (hello clawfoot tub 🥰😍). only suggestion would be to offer blackout shades in the guest bedroom. it is very light and airy (plus) but for me who sleeps during the day (or even anyone who wants to sleep later in the morning) it is difficult with the current shades. 10/10 though. very happy.
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"If you want to pretend you have an alternate life in a really adorable, wallpapered environment where nothing ever goes wrong and you have no responsibilities, then stay here. It is stinkin’ cute. It’s also comfortable. We enjoyed the little electric fireplace."

2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Any designer on HGTV would love this apartment. The convenience of having a state of the art washer and dryer was absolutely wonderful. The pillows and the bed and the sheets and blankets and the throws were sheer Heaven. The bathroom was a spa. I sent pictures of the place home to my sister-in-law and my daughter. It was just a delightful week there. So very comfortable. Snacks, drinks in the fridge, sonic ice! And also ice trays. Which were filled when I got there and frozen! Ha ha.

Cabin is spacious, beautifully decorated, and impeccably appointed. We felt right at home with lots of quilts and beautiful leather furniture to lounge away. There are lots of little amenities you wouldn’t even think of, but were much appreciated. One was a fresh bag of ice waiting for us, which I love since I drink a lot of iced tea. We brought along our 12 week old puppy and there was lots of nice grass for potty breaks. Five pretty doe came right up to the fence by the back door to greet me in the morning. The one thing I would say is hard to tell in the pictures is how spacious this place is. The bathroom and shower are quite large and the main room, with it’s open concept, is also large with a separate area for living room, bedroom, and kitchen.
We already plan to stay there when we go back to Duncan next year!"

2023-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,We were looking for a weekend getaway with our grandson and daughter with a pool. We had fun in the pool - it had steps that were shallow enough for our 3yr old to play on. He loved the antique tractors and the ducks on the property. The grounds are full of trees and flowers. The back deck was a beautiful setting for dinner. It's a nice place to enjoy some time away off the beaten path.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,This is our second stay and will definitely not be our last. Pam & Lois make you feel very welcome and communicate all the details you need for your stay.

rustic, and well-appointed. The salt water pool is a real plus - bask in the sun, swim or sit in the shade poolside.
Old School (Pam's place) is a real treasure."

She showed me all around, and where all the lights and amenities were. There was a storm during the evening and she made sure I felt safe. The house is very close to the barn, but I didn’t feel watched or that I was looked upon at all. The pool is excellent!! Very well kept. Beautiful! As is the whole property! And SO very clean! The only BNB I didn’t wear my slippers at! The cleanest bathroom I’ve stayed at! Again, I felt very safe and very comfortable. It was extremely relaxing and just what I needed. The patio was also perfect to relax. Thank you so very much! Your kindness and cleanliness is SO appreciated!!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Pam was very sweet. She had family visiting and she took time to make sure we had what we needed and showed us how to use her air conditioner.

Great warm pool , we were lucky with the weather too .
Lois was really chatty , great talking to her .

2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Adorable B&B Bardominium in a serene location just far enough from town to have a very country feel yet close enough to enjoy the Duncan surroundings. Internet was out the entire stay due to a recent storm but the lovely hostesses brought a box of DVDs for us to watch. We loved watching the deer out off the back patio, the leaves change color and the sound of the running fountain nearby. The inside of the barn is gorgeous and has a romantic feel with clear string lights on the ceiling. The place was spotless, tidy and felt comfy & cozy. I recently had a knee replacement and the walk-in shower was perfect! (Trying to get over a tub wall is torture.) The entire weekend was something we both needed, relaxing and stress-free! Would definitely book here for peace, relaxation & spending quiet time as a couple again. Thank you for allowing us to stay on your beautiful property!"

We had a great time."

My husband continues on every 6 hour IV antibiotics, a Wound Vac, as well as a home ventilator at night. Not only were we able to do all of his care in the cozy comfort of this beautiful place, but also even a couple treatments on the sunshiny outdoor patio area! We BBQ’d, had plenty of room, comfort, relaxing and romantic atmosphere to take us far from home, while only being 10 minutes away! The picturesque decor and country feel are spot on! We will definitely be back! 100% recommended! Lois, thank you for your kindness and hospitality!!

2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Second trip was even better than the first! We went in Autumn, so the pool was closed, but we had just as much fun enjoying the beautiful weather and picturesque scenery. Could not have asked for a more relaxing trip or more agreeable, friendly, and courteous hosts. If you love good folks and relaxing country living (with all the modern conveniences, of course), book a night or three with these wonderful people. You won’t be disappointed. Pam and Lois, and the beautiful retreat they’ve graciously made available on Airbnb, are perfect examples of what makes Oklahoma great. Already planning our next getaway!"
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The ""Old School"" was a really neat place, very comfortable, and full of interesting items. We really enjoyed the stay, but we were in town for my mother's funeral, so our reason for being in Duncan was not fun. Hopefully we can visit another time when we can actually relax and enjoy the beautiful setting."
2021-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"This barn was the best getaway from the city and into a relaxed setting.

2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My 2 nights at “Old School” was exactly what I needed, peace and quiet. Extremely clean, felt very comfortable and safe. Bed was very comfortable with plenty of extra blankets. There’s not many amenities in kitchen like stove to cook but I didn’t need it for this stay. There is a microwave and refrigerator which was perfect. Other amenities were great. Bathroom with wonderful shower head helped start off day. My dog Lola enjoyed property too with plenty space for her to walk around. Response time communicating with host was excellent.
Next time I’m in area I’ll definitely come back especially during warmer months to take advantage of pool. It looked very inviting.
Thank you again Pam for your hospitality."

2021-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Do you like peace and quiet? What about comfortable accommodations? Beautiful surroundings and people that make you feel completely at home? If so, do yourself a favor and book this spot now! The magic of this beautifully decorated barn is not just the rustic decor but also the obvious care, warmth, and charisma the owners bring to the space. The interior is absolutely exquisite with hand-finished reclaimed wood planks on the walls, black and white checkerboard tile in the bathroom, and exposed rafters strung with lights you can switch on that make it look like you are sleeping under a starry sky. The open floor plan boasts delightfully comfy sofas and an amazing old-fashioned leather recliner, a retro dining table, a vintage piano to plink around on, plus a flat-screen TV complete with DVD player and WiFi. The kitchen has a full-sized fridge and sink, toaster oven, microwave, and Keurig coffee maker with all the fixings. The farmhouse bed is comfy and has plenty of pillows. The walk-in shower has excellent water pressure, plenty of hot water, and a tiled bench. Out back there is a patio perfect for grilling, complete with a table and umbrella for meals or just hanging out, and a chimenea. The chimenea is fully stocked and ready to go; it only took one match to light (seriously, it was impressive!). The salt-water pool out front is beautifully maintained, ranges from around 3 to 10 feet deep (with a diving board at the deep end), and has plenty of places to lounge and relax. The covered patio is perfect for long conversations day or night. I could go on and on, but the best part is that these folks are some of the best people you could hope to meet! Lois and Pam are thoughtful, considerate, good-hearted people who genuinely enjoy sharing their excellent venue with others. Bottom line: if you like taking it easy in beautiful natural surroundings and rustic luxury provided by a couple of amazing people, book this spot today!"

We loved our stay, the only thing that I found that I didn't like was cell phone service, but was not their fault . I have T-Mobile and had no service but Lois offered to lend me their phone. They said there's a Verizon tower across the street so if you have Verizon cell should pick up fine. Lots of space outside for your pooch. I had no complaints with the inside of the cabin. All was great overall wonderful .stay"
