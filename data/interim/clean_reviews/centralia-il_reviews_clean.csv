Aside from the beautiful scenery, the pool, fire pit and deck areas all helped us relax and unwind. We had everything we needed, including enough real beds to get good sleep! (No fold out couches or bunkbeds here!)
The group is already planning on next year and is already suggesting it to others for their retreats.

2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This place was wonderful! It was just what we needed! The place is definitely more than is pictured! The pool is very big. The house seems larger inside than the pictures showed. The living room was plenty spacious for 8 of us to hang out and watch tv together. We definitely plan on returning!
The only thing I would say, is for a bigger family planning on staying in and cooking, more pans would be helpful. However, it would have been easy to bring our own. So just an FYI for others:) and this isn’t even a complaint at all!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This was our second stay at Bartt’s place, it has become our special meeting place for our annual family vacation.

And the property itself was so lovely - secluded with neat wildlife all around. We would definitely consider returning."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"It was an ideal spot for preteen and early teen grandchildren to enjoy their time together. Adults were comfortable outside and inside both. Furniture was plentiful on decks and for around fire. The pool was large to allow a lot of swimming and playing. The lake was low but 3 of the kids made fun in mud time -all over them. Kayaks were added fun. Some deer, waterfowl, an otter swimming, and even a Bald Eagle flying over entertained us. Thank you for a local -away-from-home- vacation/ family reunion."

2022-09-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This home is such a magical, peaceful place. It was so quiet on the cove, and we were able to observe so much wildlife while we were there. We had a great time kayaking, swimming in the pool, relaxing on the hammock, and roasting marshmallows over the fire pit. The home was very clean and well-maintained with so many fun extras, like a bag set, an outdoor saucer swing and lights strung up around the deck, as well as a dollhouse, which my youngest daughter adored. It was a relaxing and rejuvenating stay, and we couldn’t have asked for anything more."

2022-08-01,5,Group trip,"This place is amazing! We had so much fun. It was just a relaxing weekend getaway for our girls trip.

We are thinking we would love to come back next year for our getaway! Thanks for letting us use your home!"

We couldn't have asked for a better place. The house was clean and very spacious. We enjoyed every minute. The only downside, we wished we could have stayed longer. Thank you for sharing your beautiful home."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This was a beautiful place on the lake. The kids had so much fun and Bartt was always responsive. I wasn’t afraid of the kids going by the lake either because the water was very shallow. At night we did fireworks and s’mores. It was a perfect summer week. Thank you so much for sharing your slice of heaven with us. Best of luck!
Kareema & friends"

(Including some basic seasonings!) I can’t say enough good things about this great little SPACIOUS home! When I’m in the area again this will be my favorite booking! Thanks again Marla for your wonderful hospitality!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We enjoyed our stay at Marla's place. It was clean, comfortable, and relaxing. The parking space in the back was very handy for unloading and loading, and the fenced yard let our dogs get some exercise after a long drive.

2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"Marla went beyond what is expected. She greeted us when we arrived, showed us around, answered our questions about the area and made suggestions. Everything a person might need was provided, including some pizzas in the freezer. Which was great, because the area was under a tornado watch, and we did’t wish to go out. Her home was very, very clean."
2024-03-01,5,Group trip,"Marla's place was perfect for an overnight stay but would highly recommend for a long term stay.

Dishes and kitchen ware for any occasion. There was even milk and eggs in the fridge. Lots of space in the home and comfortable beds. It was very relaxing and a nice rest during our road trip.

Beautiful older home with very unique features such as built-in bookcases, window seats and cabinets in the room dividers. Marla’s place was nicely decorated and we felt very much at home. She was very quick to respond to our questions. Love the extras she included such as snacks and food in the fridge."
2023-09-01,4,Stayed one night,"Marla was one of the best communicators I've ever encountered for Airbnb. Older home, so allow for that."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This place was amazing. It is decorated to a good standard but retains the 1920's feel. Marla was responsive to any messages within 10 minutes no matter what the time and was an absolute pleasure. I will definitely look into staying here again when I'm in the area next!
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Very nice place, great host!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"It was a very nice location, very close to where I was going and very convenient for me.I recommend everyone to stay here."

2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Marla was great. The place served our needs perfectly. I’d stay again.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had an outstanding stay at the 1920 bungalow Airbnb! From the moment I walked through the front door, I felt like I had stepped back in time to a charming and elegant era. The attention to detail in preserving the historical elements of the house was truly remarkable.
The host was incredibly friendly and accommodating, going above and beyond to ensure that my stay was memorable. Their attention to detail and helpful tips for exploring the area made my experience even better.
Overall, my stay at the 1920 bungalow Airbnb was a delightful journey back in time. I highly recommend this unique, charming, and historic gem for anyone looking for a one-of-a-kind experience."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,Suited our needs perfectly! Much larger than expected.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great spot with easy access to everything. We had everything that we needed and more. Marla is very friendly and accommodating. We look forward to our return trip in December. It’s nice to have a place to stay when coming back to visit family and friends.
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"This house is so pretty inside with every amenity you can think of. No television, but I didn't miss it. The house has a small town neighborhood feel, and at night, you can hear trains in the distance as they go through town.
The location is about 11-13 minutes off the hwy. A previous review said she thought the house smelled dusty because it was old. I completely disagree. The house smelled fresh and clean.
Finding the alleyway behind the house was the most difficult thing about the house, but only because G maps takes you to the front door, and the streets are one way. I had to go around a few blocks before I figured it out. Also, if you have a group of people or a lot to unload, have one person get the key from the front door, then go unlock the side door so everyone can get in easier. I wish the lockbox was on the side door instead of the front. The neighborhood was quiet at night, and the house inside was quiet from any outside noise. I would stay here again if passing through!"
2023-04-01,3,Stayed a few nights,"There is plenty of space in the house and beautiful original woodwork. Wi-Fi was fast and convenient. The house was generously supplied in the kitchen and bathroom. Neighbors that were present were all friendly. They waved and talked, too.
The neighborhood has many abandoned and boarded up houses; it doesn’t feel safe. The porch is lit but the deadbolt is not illuminated because of the position of the door. I felt nervous when arriving after dark. The back yard is fenced but the back door does not enter into the fenced yard so I had to exit the house each time to put my dog outside. As a single female, this all was concerning."
2023-03-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Had the whole house to myself, and the owner was very communicative. Enjoyed my stay if you have allergies bring an air purifier as the house is old and dusty smelling."
2023-02-01,4,Stayed one night,Marla was a great host with many recommendations on restaurants in the area. The 1920’s house had character and was clean.
2023-01-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"I wish we would’ve been able to stay…but snow/ice weather and fatigue set us very far behind. Marla was an AMAZING communicator the entire time and was VERY flexible when I needed to change dates. She even kept me up to date on weather conditions from St. Louis to her area. Couldn’t ask for more from anyone!
Next time I’m traveling through the area, I will absolutely rent her place again, as this looked to be an amazing place, and Marla is an amazing host!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This place was perfect for the family to relax by the lake. From the decor, stocked kitchen, separate pool house and hospitality it had everything we needed. Since it was the eclipse, graham and Mallory even took my kids on their first boat ride. A memorable place to stay!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is a 1970s throwback. Themed rooms and collections of vintage art and kitsch. Very clean despite the cool displays and collections. We enjoyed the deck in the mornings and the hot tub was perfect for the crisp weather. Did a polar plunge as our hosts kindly left the pool open for us. Last dip of the season!
Each room was well stocked with extra blankets and towels in the bathrooms. We felt right at home! Thanks for hosting us! We are already planning a return trip."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The best place we have ever experienced with airbnb, great person to deal with"
2023-08-01,5,Group trip,"This home and property is absolutely stunning. Outdoor surroundings were exactly what we were looking for with the extra perks of the pool, outdoor bar and multiple grills. The indoor, layout and extras were a great surprise. Many nostalgic items that brought you back to the good old times. We truly enjoyed listening to old records while sitting in the hot tub. If you’re looking for a relaxing weekend. This is definitely the place to book. Me and my family of seven had an absolutely fabulous time. we did some fishing off the top and bottom decks and my son kept catching clams, a few caught a couple of fish, but it was entertaining to see a clam.
My only recommendation is to bring bug spray or citronella candles for the evening. We forgot, so stopped at the local gas station and picked up some incense sticks which worked just as well."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Graham's place was an awesome, versatile getaway for our families with young kids. There is something for everyone here. Play and lounge space for big and little kids. play and lounge space for adults -- the hot tub + vinyl collection combo really comes to life after bedtime. Clean (saltwater?) pool with an amazing view. A nice swim dock, Maui pad, and even neighbors who gave the kids a ride in their speedboat. The neighborhood dog, Tiki, a tiny package, greeted us and said goodbye to us on our way out. Beds were comfortable. plenty kitchen amenities, spices, condiments. Comfortable couches and hammocks. So many seating areas! Very helpful and responsive hosts who even suggested local attractions for our kids to check out. Would stay again, and maybe leave the kids behind next time."
2023-08-01,5,Group trip,Enjoyed Graham’s place with a large friend group for a weekend getaway. The place was a perfect way to entertain and have fun with a large group. Would come back!
2023-07-01,5,Group trip,The pictures don’t do this place justice! Our expectations were exceeded by far. The perfect lake getaway with all the cozy/fun amenities you can think of. Will absolutely be returning for another lake getaway!
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We had the best time here for a family get away weekend!! The best of both world for the whole family with the pool and the lake! The kitchen had everything you could want for cooking and grilling!! The retro vibe was so fun!! Will definitely recommend!!
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,Great place for our young grandchildren! Great pool and beach for thier ages!!
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"It was truly beautiful with great amenities. The pictures are great on the website, but hardly do the place justice. It was a great place for a family vacation and the fishing was off the hook (pardon the pun)! Something for everyone and I would highly recommend it!"
2023-06-01,5,Group trip,this was a homebase to get our family who is spread all over the place together....I have never had such a good time!tons of stuff to do ... location.. amenities...view... beds were great ... graham and Mallory were the best!Only hope I'm lucky enough to get to go again
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,A beautiful place with great neighbors
2023-04-01,5,Group trip,"A peaceful spring weekend at the lake was just what my family needed. The main house was big and cozy for us to gather in during the stormy weather, then we got to enjoy the docks and outdoor area once the sun came out the next day. The kids had so much fun running around, fishing, finding seashells, swimming in the lake and hot tub, etc. It’s apparent the hosts have given a considerable amount of attention to the aesthetic details of the homes - the decor is amazing! It was a great weekend, beautiful surroundings, comfortable home, and very accommodating hosts. Would visit this property again!"
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Such a wonderful place! Gorgeous location. Cute property with lots of fun activities. Very responsive hosts. Perfectly clean. Would stay again and again!

Our family had a wonderful time. Was a very nice escape from the real world. Even the neighbors were friendly :) House had everything we needed for a fun, relaxing weekend. Lake was amazing and fun! I would recommend this property to other families. :)"
2022-09-01,5,Group trip,Great view
2022-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"everything about the stay was as described, my family's stay was perfect! The kitchen had all the tools necessary for us to cook and bake as we pleased. The house was beautiful and the decor made it homey. plenty of space and bathrooms and exits for the 7 of us preventing us from stumbling over eachother. there were plenty of towels on hand for all the pool/hot tub time, but the washer/dryer were so convenient for us to just run the same towels overnight. at times We couldn't decide between paddle boarding/kayaking, spending time at the pool, hottub or playing Shuffle board. the view is spectacular and very blissful. there is a superstore less than 15min away which added to the convenience. The hosts and their family offered a direct line of communication. I would love to return to Graham's space!"
2022-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This is the perfect vacation spot, amazing location, great hosts. Thank you."
2022-07-01,5,Group trip,"Grahm's place was wonderful for our extended family visit. We loved Kayaking on the lake, swimming in the pool and the beautiful house and pool house. Grahm went out of his way to make sure our stay was pleasant and enjoyable."
2022-07-01,3,Group trip,It is a great place to have time with your family. Graham and Mallory communicated well with us and will do their best to accommodate you.
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I cannot recommend this place highly enough! Incredible location, lots of space, super clean, and wonderful, responsive hosts. Everyone in my party was thrilled. You can see the kids playing down on the beach from the poolside, which features a full-size bar and awesome clubhouse (great spot for games). The pictures simply don't do justice to the beautiful lake views. If you'd like, Captain Ronnie will take your crew out on the pontoon boat, and if you're lucky, his wife Bonnie will ride along. We can't wait to come back next year just to see them again! Do yourself a favor and book this place now."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"our family enjoyed are stay,and if available in the future I'll pay for the air bnb once again it was beautiful."

I searched Air BnBs on a whim in the area and glad I found Angie's cabin. She was a great host and the cabin had everything we needed. Very clean, comfortable stay. Will definitely look this place up again if we need to in the future!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,Excellent communication. Perfect house for our family needs. We have stayed here before and will definitely be back!
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Great stay in Carlyle! The house was VERY clean and had absolutely everything you could think of! My son forgot his toothbush, and sure enough there was some new ones available. The beds were very comfortable and had nice linens (Im a snob about that, lol) The house was in a great location, as we had family in Carlyle, Centralia and Vandalia that we were there to visit with. Angie allowed us to check-in early, which was a lifesaver since we arrived in town a little early after a 6 hour drive and were meeting family at the beach down the road. I would definately recommend this house to others. Thanks Angie for the hospitality."

2022-03-01,5,Stayed over a week,"We stayed in this AirBNB for 2.5 months while we were close by with the birth of a grandchild. The AirBNB is about one quarter of a larger machine shed, but we very rarely heard any noise at all from the shop (and people were only there once in a while) or the weather outside. Very clean and comfy. Tons of electrical outlets. One of the best equipped AirBNB kitchens that I have ever encountered! Great communication from the host, and they were very attentive when we had questions. Very close to the lake, with space for parking boats. We will definitely return when we need a place to stay near family again!"

2021-07-01,5,Stayed one night,Absolutely would recommend!
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This place is great! A wonderful location close to many spots on the lake. The cabin set up is awesome. With the bed rooms up stairs and closed off so you can’t hear other people in the morning. The hosts we great too. They are I. The property but we didn’t even know they were there. We did have one minor issue but they came out right away and fixed it. WiFi works great also. 10/10 would recommend.
2024-06-01,5,Group trip,A hidden gem amongst Centralia. My friends and I stayed here for a wedding and we absolutely loved the house. James was super helpful and responsive. He even noticed the air upstairs wasn’t functioning correctly and sent someone over right away to fix it. The house had everything you could need and was beautiful inside and out. I’d highly recommend a stay!
2024-05-01,5,Group trip,Great Experience!
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,Another great stay! We will be back!💕
2024-04-01,5,Group trip,A really great deal on such a large home with so much to offer!
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Copperfield is a gorgeous home with beautiful details from tile work, woodwork, and a big awesome front porch to hang out on. The yard was spacious and I felt safe letting my children run around and play without my constant watchful eye.
The beds were comfortable, the kitchen was sufficiently stocked, with plenty of space for us to settle in for a weekend of cooking meals and visiting around the large kitchen table.
Jamie was an excellent host. Responsive, helpful, and very kind.
Located within walking distance of PutPut golf, several ice cream places, and a dollar store.
Highly recommended Copperfield house!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,Awesome Host. would definitely stay again!
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This is a wonderful place in Centralia!
2024-01-01,5,Group trip,James’s place was great. Exactly what we needed for a large group and plenty of extra room too. Beautiful house.
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We celebrated our family Christmas here - what a perfect spot, and it was even decorated with trees, lights, etc.! The kids were so excited to put the gifts under a tree. The house is beautiful- we only wish we were there in warmer weather. There’s a really cool patio with fire pit and party lights we would love to have used. One suggestion to future guests - bring earplugs or white noise if you’re a light sleeper. The house is near train tracks, and the trains run all night.
Everything else was perfect."
2023-12-01,5,Group trip,"Incredible historic building with all the modern amenities. Gorgeous space.
Looking forward to an opportunity to stay again."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,We had another great stay! We will be back!❤️
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,The house was AWESOME!! One of the best places I’ve stayed. James is great.
2023-11-01,5,Group trip,"The house is absolutely beautiful and I am from Centralia and used to have dinner all the time there. James was very responsive, things can happen, and he always responded when I let him know. I would absolutely stay there again, it truly is one of the best places to stay in Centralia."
2023-10-01,5,Group trip,We loved the house. There were plenty of beds for our group of 7. The downstairs bathroom was amazing! James was super helpful with recommendations on where to eat and when I had to call him because we had a duh moment getting in the gate!
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,Absolutely amazing home.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We absolutely loved staying at the Copperfield. The home was beautiful, extremely clean, and had all the amenities our family needed. We greatly appreciated James' prompt response to our booking request and the follow up while we visited the home to make sure we were comfortable. We also loved the courtyard space to enjoy the perfect weather!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Oh my goodness, there are not enough words to express what a wonderful time we had at the Copperfield home. James is simply amazing. Not only does he check in on you to ensure you don’t have any questions or need anything, he also responds immediately when contacted for any reason.
I wanted a home big enough for my parents, siblings and their families and this home was just perfect with 5 bedrooms and 4 baths. It was nice to have the 1 bedroom downstairs for my parents so they did not need to climb any stairs. The courtyard was beautiful and we enjoyed the fire pit immensely. I think James must have ordered the great weather for us also. The kitchen was well stocked, we had plenty of towels, linens, blankets and pillows. The beds were comfortable. My family and I had a wonderful time and enjoyed every minute. Thank you James for allowing us to stay in your beautiful home! It was fantastic! I highly recommend staying here. You won’t have any regrets - I promise."
2023-09-01,5,Group trip,Perfect girls’ weekend!
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"My family and I had a great experience and are already planning our next trip. The house was large, clean, and had everything we needed. There was even a great outdoor space for the kids. Great location too."
2023-09-01,5,Group trip,Absolutely beautiful house and excellent host!
2023-08-01,5,Group trip,Great space for our family with several adults. Each room has direct access to a bathroom. Beautiful old home with just the right level of updates!
2023-07-01,4,Group trip,"For Centralia it’s pricey. The ambiance was incredibly wort it.
I would consider having a hallway installed between the restroom and lower level bedroom. We found the area useless for someone to sleep there and not be disturbed while sleeping."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Professionally run airbnb. Very clean and modern. 5 minutes drive to everywhere we need to be.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"There aren't enough words to describe how beautiful, spacious, clean and comfortable the Copperfield was for our July 6-11 stay. Everything was as described or BETTER! This home was one wonderful surprise after another. Our entire stay was enhanced by the well-supplied kitchen, bedrooms and bathrooms. The kitchen was nicely stocked with utensils, pans, etc. . but especially basic spices in ample supply. The bedrooms were all spacious and supplied with crisp, clean linens as were every bathroom. Thanks so much for the generous supply of shampoo and soap! This one-of-a-kind setting makes the Copperfield a true gem to stay in. You can find more economical BnB's but NONE that are this comfortable. The front porch is another wonderful surprise from a more gracious, romantic era. So glad we stayed here. Hope to stay here again when we return for another family reunion in the future. Thanks to the owner for providing such a meaningful stay! Highly recommend!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Copperfield exceeded our expectations!! We met friends here for a reunion and this was the perfect space. Jamie had everything we needed and nothing we didn’t. The home is beautifully updated yet has old school charm. The yard is well kept, private, and secure; perfect for little kids to play with the sprinkler. Everything was clean and tidy with very little clutter. The rooms are huge!! And each bedroom having a private bathroom was a huge plus. The listing said there wasn’t a washer/dryer but to our happy surprise there was one when we arrived! We also got to enjoy a new fire pit that wasn’t shown in the photos. We will definitely be coming back!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great location to town. Super comfortable beds and clean, with beautiful woodwork and old house feel. A great immersion to Centralia and a historic home. Couple blocks to Carnegie Library"
2023-05-01,5,Group trip,"We had a great stay at Copperfield, everyone in our group absolutely loved the house and property. It is old but very well maintained. Kids in the group had plenty of space to run around in the huge yard. They had a blast.
Jamie was very responsive and helpful."
2023-05-01,5,Group trip,The house was exactly as described and fit our group’s needs perfectly. Jamie gave great instructions for checking in and replied super quickly when we had questions.
2023-05-01,5,Group trip,"This beautifully restored home is elegant with modern comforts. Our family gathered here in Centralia for a memorial and reunion. Our Great x 2 Uncle Harry built this home for his bride, Aunt Allie. Many years later the woodwork, the stained and beveled glass windows shine along with the intricate tiles. We shared stories at the dining table and in the living room. We all slept well on very comfortable beds with plenty of towels. The internet was powerful enough for our group. Some used the streaming service. We loved the house and highly recommend staying there."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Copperfield is a beautiful and well-kept property. Great place to spread out and relax for a medium-size family.
2023-04-01,5,Group trip,Beautiful dwelling! Everything was perfect. Would stay again and would recommend to everyone.
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Not only is the Copperfield the best air bnb I have ever stayed in James is an amazing host. We had everything we needed and more. The home is older which made me nervous but is maintained wonderfully. It has historical charm, is walking distance to downtown and is beautiful inside and out. There is a large fenced in courtyard plus all the space indoors. 6 stars would be moe accurate!"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We had a wonderful stay with our family in this well-maintained and lovely, historical home! It was perfect for our needs and we are looking forward to another stay in the future!"
2023-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,James was great and kind. He was easy to talk to and accessible but left us to do our own thing. The place was beautiful and we didn't have to bring anything extra other than our own clothes.
2023-01-01,5,Group trip,We enjoyed our Stay! House was spotless and very roomy. James was very friendly and made sure we felt right at home! Will stay again. FYI Bonnie’s Restaurant had the best breakfast 😊
2022-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,Very very nice. Very good communication with owner. Only problem was an over abundance of crows that was like something out of an Alfred Hitchcock movie - but I think that only happens a couple of weeks a year. Will definitely use this Air BnB again.
2022-11-01,5,Group trip,Great place
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place is truly spectacular! Beautiful, CLEAN, comfortable, and in the center of everything. Dont look anywhere else, stay here, you will not regret it."
2022-10-01,5,Group trip,James was very accommodating and a good communicator.
2022-09-01,5,Group trip,Excellent location!!! Just 8 minutes from Castle Ridge venue!!! Perfect for large groups!!
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great stay
2022-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,The host is a great communicator and very accommodating! The home is gorgeous and very comfortable! Beautiful home!
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,This was a perfect stay for our multi family group over a long weekend. The bedrooms were comfortable and conveniently had many bathrooms. Jamie was available for any questions we had. The location was perfect for a walk to the shops on Broadway or a quick drive to the lake.
2022-05-01,5,Group trip,"Perfect- 2 families w/ 2 adult adult children ea…plenty of room, privacy for all. The kitchen & downstairs layout provided perfect space to host large gathering of friends for Sunday morning brunch."
2022-05-01,5,Group trip,"Don’t hesitate booking a stay at James’ place. It is a stunning house! My group and I had the best weekend. We cooked our meals in the fully stocked kitchen, and enjoyed a fire outside under the beautiful trees. James brought us firewood during the afternoon. He was very responsive if we had any questions or request, and even obliged our questions about the history of the house. I 100% recommend taking a vacation in Centralia so you can enjoy this property as much as my family/friends and I did!"
2022-04-01,5,Group trip,Great place to stay.
2022-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,Wonderful place to stay. Has everything you need and very clean. James makes sure you are comfortable and happy!
2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My family and I enjoyed our stay at Copperfield. It’s a real gem. A lovely house, with lots of modern day comforts. Our host, Jamie, was very helpful and attentive. Comfortable beds, well furnished kitchen, and several TVs to easily fit large groups. Heating was not an issue in such an old house, even on some brisk windy days. Location was great, being only an hour outside of St. Louis, and excellent roads. Centralia was an attractive, good size town with numerous businesses to meet every need."
2022-03-01,4,Stayed with kids,"A nice place to stop over. James connected with us prior to arrival and made starting our stay very easy. He provided additional details for our stay and about the area for dining as well as the coffee house up the street. While the weather didn’t cooperate for enjoying the porch or courtyard, it was still a great stay indoors for our quick stop over mid trip."
2022-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,Great for visiting with our friends and family.
2022-02-01,5,Group trip,Worth every penny and owner was great host.
2021-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,A neat place to stay at.
2021-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,Great accommodations! Beautifully decorated! Highly recommend it for anyone who needs a place to stay in the area!
2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,A beautiful home for large groups. Well maintained and one of the cleanest I’ve ever stayed in. Host is very hospitable and knowledgeable about the area. Lots of privacy but not very intimate. I would certainly recommend this home to anyone. You will love it’s classic feel.
2021-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We picked Centralia as a halfway point for meeting family from Missouri, not really being familiar with the area. We drove down from Chicago and could not have had a nicer time staying in this old house. As other reviews have said, it’s as comfortable and accommodating as a newly built home but still has so much charm and character that we spent a lot of time wondering about its history. It’s easy to find for out-of-towners, level walking distance from Broadway and a couple of parks, and comfy enough just to do what we did, which is sit around, play games, run around the yard, cook (and eat) some tasty meals, and sleep well."
2021-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,This place had everything we need for our large group. It was centrally located and very convenient. The check in process was great and the place was very clean and well suited for a large group. Host was quick to respond and even offered suggestions for things to do in the area. We will be staying here again next time we visit.
2021-10-01,5,Group trip,"Gorgeous, unique spot with loads of charm."
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Amazing house, perfect location. So much charm with modern conveniences!"
2021-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Beautiful, spacious, fire pit, chairs and grill for use, outdoor space as wonderful as inside. Old, classic, beautiful home with all updates and perks of a new home. Stayed for our daughters wedding and couldn't pass up opportunity for her and photographer to shoot at home with lighting, windows and gorgeous scenic opportunities! The memories and photohraphs will be treasured for years."
2021-10-01,5,Group trip,Beautiful home! Our host was wonderful and had great communication. Great stay! We were very comfortable and enjoyed our stay.
2021-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,This place is great! Private fenced yard with a great front porch and grilling area.The rooms are large and each one has access to a bathroom. Great kitchen and dining area. We enjoyed our stay and we could walk to downtown for coffee. We had three families with 5 children everyone enjoyed the stay. We would gladly recommend this place.
2021-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This home is absolutely, positively amazing. If you are looking at reviews and hedging on your choices, just book it. I promise you will be so happy you did! My husband and I grew up in Centralia and now have 3 boys. We like to come back and visit, but have a hard time cramming into grandma's house. This was our first house rental in the area and it was wonderful to have the space for visiting with family, hanging out with friends, and enjoying dinners together. It was also especially nice to stay in this historical property and to see how beautifully it has been restored. The woodwork throughout the house is breathtaking - the stairs, pocket doors, headboards, fireplace. The tin ceiling in the bathrooms, the chandeliers and light fixtures - every touch is so exceptionally well done and feels authentic to the era of the original home. And yet, all of the things you actually use are new, modern, and top quality (new beds, new furniture, new tvs in every room, new appliances, all new and in great condition). The main floor of the home has a master bedroom and large bathroom, living room with 2 large couches, dining room with a table that seats 6, and a well-stocked, modern kitchen with a counter that seats 2. Upstairs, there are 4 large bedrooms and 3 bathrooms. Outside, there is a giant courtyard for yard games and grilling (gas grill included), and plenty of parking. There is also a beautiful covered patio that was perfect for morning coffee (and evening wine). The owner was super easy to communicate with and is clearly invested in the property and in making sure that guests have the best experience. We very much enjoyed our stay at Copperfield and look forward to returning!"
2021-08-01,5,Group trip,"Beautiful old house! Excellent restoration work!
This is a great clean stay for anyone visiting Centralia, especially with a large group. The pricing and aesthetic of the place make it an easy choice over any hotel."
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We are so thankful for our extraordinary guest experience at Copperfield. The spacious, unblemished home was lovely! Immaculately clean it was. James communicated with us thoroughly. The check-in process was seamless. James was available whenever, if ever we needed. He also was also very approachable with a few of our requests. The home was well-appointed and well-stocked with everything we needed. The generous space was quiet, peaceful, and fostered relaxation. James is very knowledgeable of the area and offered many dining and activity suggestions. We have been spoiled. Thanks Copperfield. Hope you are available anytime we are in town."
2021-07-01,5,Group trip,This home was FABULOUS! We LOVED our stay here and hope it's available the next time we're in town! The home has been renovated and is beautiful (inside and out). Everything appeared to be brand new! Jamie was super - he responded promptly whenever we had questions and he made sure we had everything we needed (and more)! I can definitely recommend The Copperfield to anyone looking for accommodations in this area.
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,Very nice house. Spacious and comfortable.
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This is the second year in a row that we stayed at this location. We had a great time and enjoyed the pool table and darts and front deck. It was exactly what I was looking for.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,Enjoyed the stay and easy to communicate with host
2023-09-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"If you're looking for a quiet, peaceful weekend, this is the spot. The host is extremely nice and responsive."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We loved it so much had a great time and didn’t want to come home. Will definitely come back! Thanks so much!
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We booked this almost a year ago and it was fabulous! Great hosts, perfect setting. We loved the access to the pontoon rental, and we will definitely stay again! One of our best trips, yet!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Was very clean and a lot of game and lake options!
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"The place was exceptional. We were very delightfully surprised by the game room including a pool table, shuffleboard, air hockey, foosball table, and a dart board. Super fun, would return."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Photos of this place do not do it justice! The inside is incredibly cute, clean, and spacious! Had everything we needed and more! Awesome game room and jacuzzi bath tub! It’s directly on the lake with a wonderful dock to fish off of. The host was very helpful and prompt! We WILL be staying again 😁"
2023-02-01,5,Group trip,"Right when I walked through the door I immediately regret not staying longer. We had a blast. It was peaceful, and we did a fire both nights we were there. So much fun for a family or even a group of friends. Will defiantly have to come back."
2023-11-01,5,Group trip,good place to stay
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Perfect place to meet up with family from multiple states. Lots of room inside and out to hang out, relax and catch up. Lots of seating in living room and Huge table for big family gathering! Beautiful area surrounded by nature and quiet and peaceful. No noisy neighbors.
Would definitely stay again and recommend.
Thank you!!!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,The cabin/home was great and a beautiful view of the water/sunset. Peaceful getaway for a family to enjoy. I would return.
2023-08-01,2,Stayed with kids,"This could be a very nice place worth what they ask per night. However, the way it is right now is not. The pictures show a private cove( they do not show the camper 15 yards from the back porch and the other just a tad further). The sewer was leaking under the house, we had to unload the dishwasher from the previous renter, a toenail was found in one of the beds, the beach is covered in weeds. There is scrap material from construction shoved under the porch. There is a wheelchair ramp but it only has rails on one side! ( Dangerous you thinks) We asked for paper towels and trash bags two differ t times during our stay from the employees and never received them. And the owner never responded to any messages. The $200-300 per night is insane for what we walked into. I am usually not one to complain and know things happen but with this place also being for sale I feel they really don’t have much dedication to it or those who rent it."
2023-06-01,3,Stayed a few nights,"Pros: The place was large enough to comfortably accommodate 5 adults and 3 kids. AC worked well even in the near 95deg temps we had throughout our stay. Large beach area with 4 kayaks and a paddle boat to use although there was only 1 paddle for the kayaks. Friendly neighbors and was pretty quiet/relaxing atmosphere.
Cons: Upon arrival we were confronted by thousands of black wasps. The entire exterior of the home, property and even the beach area is crawling with them. Owner is aware of this issue as there is a small wasp catcher hanging up but it is not doing anything. We ended up buying wasp killer the first night to try to reduce the population a little as we were worried one of our kids would get stung. There was no basic essentials like garbage bags, toilet paper, paper towels, cleaning supplies, etc. There was even only a tiny broom to sweep that looked like a child size play broom. We messaged the host asking about the lack of toilet paper etc and received no response."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,Loved staying here. Plenty of room and enjoyed the toy closet.
2023-06-01,5,Group trip,jay is awesome
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,Beautiful place to stay. Would 100% percent recommend it. Would love to go back when the weather gets better and enjoy the outdoors.
2022-11-01,4,Stayed with kids,"i wouldn’t recommend a winter stay. the master bathroom is cold due to holes in the interior wood siding that cover an uninsulated section of exterior wall. these are holes a child could stick their hand through. shining my phone’s flashlight in the lower hole, with the strongest breeze coming through it, i could see the unmistakable back side of the exterior siding. Starlink, ideal for rural properties, would also be nice. no cell reception and the internet they provided was down 50% of the time. other than those issues, the property has a gorgeous view and the host was nice and responsive."
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,It was awesome and a beautiful view to look at both day and night
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We rented the two lakes house together and they worked our great for several couples. We were in town for the weekend for a wedding. Beautiful houses with wonderful lake view.
2022-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,The BlueGill Cove was a great stay for my family for celbrating my dads 50th birthday. We will definitely make an effort to be back!
2022-09-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Quiet and comfortable. Family totally enjoyed the disconnect and took advantage the time away from everyday life. The beds were one of the most comfortable we have slept on.
2022-08-01,2,Stayed with kids,This is a beautiful cabin but there is still construction going on outside. Our host unfortunately had very poor communication with us. The beach is the only access to the lake without trespassing on other’s property.
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,We really enjoyed the large cabin for our family event. The beach was great and we enjoyed the kayaks. Thank you!
2022-06-01,5,Group trip,"We rented both of their houses for my 50th birthday party and it was really great. Enough space for everyone to spread out and do their own thing. Swimming, kayaking, BBQing, puzzles, croquet, and running amok. The beds were very comfortable and the kitchen has everything you'll need. We were very impressed."
2022-05-01,4,Stayed with a pet,It met our needs as we needed last minute accommodations while traveling with our dogs. They were very responsive and accommodating.
2022-05-01,3,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful area however property is undergoing some renovation. We cancelled our reservation and the host promptly issued a full refund.
2021-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,Great place to stay. Especially if you have kids !
2021-11-01,5,Group trip,Beautiful view
2021-10-01,4,Stayed about a week,Good location plenty of room
2021-10-01,5,Group trip,Gayla is a wonderful host and very accommodating.
2021-08-01,4,Stayed with kids,The location was great as we have family that owns a house close by. The house had plenty of space for our group.
2021-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Owner is very responsive and kind. Wife, children and grandchildren had fun swimming, fishing and boating in the lake. Nice public boat ramp just across the lake - short commute on the water, 2 or 3 miles by land - from the property. On the quiet end of the lake, very relaxing."
2021-05-01,5,Group trip,"Such a beautiful place! Gayla is great with communication. The house is spacious and feels like you’re on your own little island. Having multiple places to relax (porch, back yard, beach, dock, fire pit) was great for when our group felt like splitting up. There is plenty of space and lots to do for everyone. The renovated beach was great, we spent a good portion of the weekend in or near the water. Can’t wait to come back."
2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This was a great stay at the lake. I would definitely recommend stopping by. Great for families
2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great communication with the owner. The beach behind the house is being redone, when it is completed it will be very nice."
2021-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We had such a great time while visiting, the home is beautiful and peaceful. If you're looking to relax and enjoy a peaceful time, you have come to the right place. Their hospitality was down to earth, before we forget, the waffles,eggs and bacon was a special thing. Thank you again and we'll see y'all soon."
2021-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,Couldn’t have asked for a better experience. The communication couldn’t have been better and the sweet hosts even provided breakfast foods for us. This was hands down one of our best stays through Airbnb .
2020-11-01,4,Group trip,"location is great, spacious room, communication with host is good. Beds big and comfortable, bathrooms are nice as well. Will stay again."
2020-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Nice place to stay with a view of Lake Centralia. There are three bedrooms and 5 beds, so lots of room for a whole family to stay. We made use of the kitchen (two refrigerators, a gas stove, coffee maker) as well the the charcoal grill. There is plenty of space to build a campfire along the lake front.
Unfortunately, during our stay the lake was closed for swimming and boating due to algae. It would have been better to get on the water, as there is not much else to do in the immediate area. We went for some walks along the road, but the lake front itself has no trail and is all private property."
2020-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Great house on the lake, plenty of room to hang out inside and out."
2019-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,"I decided to review this house on the experience I know families will have there instead of our personal experience which was still lovely. We were some of the first people to stay in the newly purchased house and came across some hiccups. I am still giving 5 stars because I believe after our stay, a 5 star experience is what guests can expect. The home is spacious and the hosts have really great taste in decor. The furniture is comfortable and a nice quality. We arrived around Christmas and the seasonal decorations were impressive.
When a few (and minute) things went wrong, Gayla was solution oriented and not only righted everything, but she added special touches along the way. We were needier guests than we anticipated and changed arrival times, guest counts, etc. Gayla got back to me quickly and she was lovely and accommodating every step of the way. It was clear the entire visit that she was there to create a wonderful experience for my family.
The only note I would leave is if you have very small children, they will need an adult with at all times on the deck as it is open. My 1 year old dashed for the edge many times. I highly recommend not only this home but this host who has other properties in the area. We look forward to coming back to stay at one of her properties next year."
2019-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,It was wonderful having a location close to family for our holiday weekend right on the lake. The home offered tons of comfortable space for us to relax and play. The beds were also very comfortable and having toys and a bunkbed for the kids was awesome! Many thanks to our gracious hosts.
2024-06-01,5,Stayed about a week,"The camper is comfortable and comfortable. The sunset you admire is to be left speechless. Those who like animals like my daughter will surely feel good, there are chickens, goats, pigs, dogs, and cats. At night it was full of fireflies, wonderful!"
2024-04-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Had a nice relaxing stay at the RV.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,my trip was cut short due to an emergency but the camper is as described. The host is very responsive and great to work with. I highly recommend!
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,Cheri was very helpful with any questions I had and made the checking in and out process easy. Great location and peaceful location!
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,it was amazing go stay here! One of the best hosts I've stayed with... She has beautiful land and is very easy to connect to
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,nice stay in the country just out of town.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,Cheri was very accommodating and a great host of her farm and animals.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,I only stayed one night but it was just wanted I needed to clear my mind.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Cheri was a fantastic host. We came in so late and it was such a hot night and Cheri had everything ready with handwritten instructions and the AC on and ready. She was so sweet to my kids, who were so thrilled to wake up and check out the goats and chickens. The only difficult part of our stay was leaving because my kids wanted to stay all day!!! It was a wonderful experience."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,Wonderful place to stop on our drive across the country! The kids had a great time stretching their legs and petting the goats. Very good host!
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Cheri was an excellent host with a beautiful place! She made it feel like a home away from home. She communicated to ensure I remained safe and comfortable even during bad weather. I recommend her place to anyone and can't wait to stay again!
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,The camper was very comfortable and Cheri was very hospitable. We would stay again.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This place was clean. The host was warm welcoming she was very sweet. They didn’t bother us. Very quiet and peaceful. Animals were very cute as well. The view was amazing. Definitely recommend to others and hope they enjoy it as much as we did. :)
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great stay in our first RV! Clean and spacious with a very responsive host! She also showed us the animals and our windows had a nice view of the farm. We also grilled steaks on the pop out flat top. Highly recommend!
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"I loved it it was great and she was very nice and friendly also very helpful with whatever we needed, I will definitely be back again."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Cheri was such a great, generous, welcoming host. She walked us through the RV and demonstrated how to use it. My kids had a great time with the farm animals and enjoyed the books and toys in the RV and their first camping experience. Everything was perfect for my family. Thank you, Cheri, for your hospitality and great heart!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,Cheri was very nice and easy to work with and gave us lots of information about the local road work and made our trip nice and easy.Plus the location was peaceful and was very clean and nice.
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"Cheri’s place is private, relaxing, and peaceful. I highly recommend staying here in the future."
2023-05-01,2,Stayed a few nights,"Camper is modern with simple layout. Easy to maneuver, although a larger person would feel cramped in the bathroom, both toileting & showering. Full sized mattress is super thin & not comfortable. You’re sure to find convenience here, if that’s what you’re looking for. One week, however, I did not have heat. In a camper, below freezing temps were miserable. Host was apologetic, but I wasn’t thrilled when they discovered it was a mishap with their tanks running out. I also tried using the portable heater by 4 AM and it ALSO ran out of fuel. Host response was I should’ve woke her up. I received a message from her after checkout saying I should also be responsible for sweeping crumbs and hair strands off the floor. Host later informed me that her husband came into the unit without my knowledge x2 while I was not there. Unit is on their property (on the kiddy corner of a circle driveway), so there are house guests that visit location. There are no larger farm animals."
2023-05-01,3,Stayed a few nights,"Host is amenable but there are a few improvements that could be made. Since location is on host’s property, they have the opportunity to oversee it constantly. I’ve gotten texts & private messaging to ask when I would be back at the camper (unit of course was prepaid). I always arrived at a respectable time, but the inquiries seemed to cross some boundaries at times. As a returning guest (I made a month long reservation) there was a home baked treat always at the arrival of each week. Otherwise, towels were clean but had hair in them and hosts apologized for the excessive bugs (start of the camper season). Noticed by week 3 of returning that my cleaning was seemingly only done by me - ex sink still had water stains from when I cleaned it out the Friday before. Nice addition of a wall plug. But not thoroughly cleaned. Also have noticed upon each checkout, host is updating the listing description with newly added “rules”. This has been a learning curve and an interesting stay so far."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,Cheri was very hospitality and accommodating while staying at her place. If we are ever in the area we will definitely book with her again!
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was our first time ever using Air BNB and it definitely did not disappoint. Our host was very friendly and responsive. She stayed in constant contact via text, especially with weather updates, we had bad weather one night. The space was very clean and homey. Very pleased with the experience would definitely stay again when we are in the area again."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Responsive host
2023-04-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Cheri was very responsive and proactive. This is a nice, quiet place free from noise distractions. Privacy was well maintained on the shared property and host very respectful. Basic needs are certainly able to be met no matter what occasion brings you to the area."
2022-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"So much space for a camper trailer. I loved it. Kids had a great time too. Not the best for taller people. Husband is 6'3'' and he hit his head a few times. Besides that, it was great."
2022-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,We had a great time at Cheri’s camper. We were looking for something different than a regular hotel as we were passing through and it was a great experience. My kids loved the goats and chickens and sleeping in the bunks and we loved the outdoor kitchen and the space for the kids to roam when they wanted. Cheri gave us a tour on how things worked and was very responsive when we had questions and even had a few food items stocked for us when we got there. She was great with our kids and we felt safe in the location and had everything we needed to cook and stay for the night. Would recommend!
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We had a fun stay in Cheri’s camper on the farm! When we arrived, she was there to show us around and share the farm animals with us and our kids. She was so kind and giving with her time. The camper was just as the photo showed and we’ll stocked. We had been curious about camper life, so this was a great chance to test it out! Our kids enjoyed the bunk/loft beds, and all the accommodations were comfortable."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We will be back!
For the last 10 years over the Memorial Day weekend, my wife and I have been traveling with our great friends and their 5 year old son. And I think we have found our new favorite place. The house with beautiful inside and out and had a great view of the lake. We had a great time getting to go kayaking, swimming, and sitting around the fire pit. The sandy beach was so nice to be able to sit out on while the we enjoyed the beautiful weather. The dogs and our friends 5 year old had a blast swimming and building sand castles.
Needless to say, we had a wonderful time. Jake and Krista were very responsive and helpful when we had any questions.
Highly recommend!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful home, right on the lake. Perfect for taking our kayaks out. Great fire pit to sit around in the evening. Kitchen has everything you need and more. Highly recommend."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We cant say enough about our stay...Krista and Jake were amwzing, the housr was amazing
We were in Centralia to lay my husband's parents to rest and the house was so peaceful and the surroundings serene we cant THANK YOU ENOUGH"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This is the 3rd time we’ve stayed here and we still love to come back. It’s quiet and relaxing. Having a private beach is a big plus for us. Also, our dogs loved swimming."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We had a great time at the beach house! We came with our two kids, and we all enjoyed playing in the sand and swimming in the lake. House was clean, spacious and full of light. We appreciated the many toys, books and games for the kids. The beach area is very private and quiet. Hosts were very responsive and helpful when there was some algae in the water that needed to be dispersed. Overall a very enjoyable experience and we would highly recommend!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This was our family’s 3rd straight year staying here and we plan to be back again! Jake and Krista’s place has a beautiful view, easy lakefront access, great amenities, and a clean & fresh space. Our kids love the beach area and the dock provides easy fishing and boat tie offs. The location is set back enough to not have to worry about boat traffic while swimming and we also enjoyed the kayaks provided. We appreciate the many “basic essentials” provided in the pantry and all things were in working order. Definitely recommend!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Loved this air bnb! Hosts were super responsive and helpful. House was clean and super cute. The master bathroom is amazing and very spacious. They have everything you need!
The backyard space was great too. Very private with your own little beach and dock. I really enjoyed sitting out there and relaxing.
It’s great that the house was pet friendly. Would totally recommend this place to anyone!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Great place to stay. Secluded, but still close enough to grocery stores and other places. This was our 2nd time here, and we enjoyed it both times."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Everything was even better than we thought it would be. The space was clean & comfy! We had plenty of room to spread out, beds were comfy, the lake & view was gorgeous. We had a great time just hanging out with family and we loved the paddle boat. And, being dog friendly was a bonus! They even had a baby gate ready (which is probably for a baby) but helped us keep our dog on the first floor. Instructions were clear for the check in and check out process. When we first arrived, we didn't see the paddle boat but a quick message & response and we were off on the lake! Loved it!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This lake house was perfect! I would highly recommend it!
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Great stay, especially for Easter! We would enjoy staying again and especially enjoyed the peaceful lake-side view. Thank you for a great stay!"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We had a lovely stay!
2022-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Fantastic, cozy place for a weekend getaway. House had everything we needed, including a washing machine and dryer. We loved the beach and we were able to paddleboard (we brought our own) on a beautiful lake. Great communication. A place to come back."
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Really clean when we arrived. An amazing place, very quiet and enjoyable."
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,OMG if your looking for a nice place to say Id say this is the number one spot. Everything was so perfect.
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Lovely spot! We thoroughly enjoyed this location for a friend’s reunion. The setting was beautiful, the home was clean, and the hosts were so easy to work with. Definitely recommend!"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed with a pet,We had a super good time at the Barefoot Beach House. The place was clean and set up very well for our needs. We have stayed in Airbnb's across the country and this one was one of the best equipped ones. We would definitely recommend it. Thank you Jake & Krista for the great house!
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Looking forward to many more stays
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very wonderful stay. Great view across the lake plus a little seclusion. Very comfy beds and clean bathrooms. Would highly recommend the stay.
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful and a very spacious house with a sandy beach that’s perfect for families! So many amenities and the owners didn’t forget one single thing! There’s a crib, kids room, sunscreen, paddle boat and even kids toys and kids sized table and chairs! The area is quiet but close to a quaint town and good restaurants nearby. My kids had a blast swimming in the lake, playing in the sand and making s’mores. Highly recommend Castle Ridge restaurant nearby where they have outdoor summer concerts and great food. The owners are very responsive and even Fedexed my forgotten work IPad the following day. Cannot recommend this place highly enough, we will definitely be back!"
2022-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,Another wonderful trip! This was our second time staying here and we loved it. The hosts are prompt in their communication and their home provides all that you need to have a great getaway. We love the beach area and the privacy of the location. Home is well kept and clean. Planning to come for a third time!
2022-06-01,4,Group trip,Family friendly home and lake. Beautiful home with amazing views!
2022-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,It was such a wonderful house and a relaxing and awesome place to stay for a family trip we would definitely love to go back again!
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Awesome place to stay.
2022-05-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Awesome home with everything you could need for a multi generation stay. This house is probably the best stocked vacation home we have ever stayed in. The kitchen is so well stocked and there are plenty of towels, blankets, board games, toys. The dock is awesome, the paddle boat was fun, and the beach and fire pit were perfect for s’mores. The beds were very comfortable (super big king) with fluffy pillows. We used the charcoal grill for steaks and burgers. We had a great time in the amazing space."
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a perfect stay at your home! Thanks so much for having us. Having moved to Saint Louis a little over a year ago from Charleston SC, I really needed a play to let my 8 year old lab mix swim and play in the sand. Thank you so much! Hope you will have us again!"
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This was our second stay at this house! I have nothing but great things to say about this place and Jake as well! House and outdoor space are amazing! Jake is easy to communicate with and always responds quickly. We will be returning for a third visit!
2022-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"The Barefoot Beach House was exactly what we needed for a weekend getaway! The house was small and unassuming when you pull up, but as soon as you open the front door…WOW! The house was stunning! Everything you could possibly need was provided. Towels, kitchen equipment, games, paddle boat, etcetera. Our dogs were in heaven running around the large yard and swimming in the lake. We made great memories and hope to return soon!"
2022-04-01,5,Group trip,"This lakehouse is beautiful and stocked with everything you need for a restful weekend. Abundant towels, extra blankets, and tons of board games. The lake is quiet and we enjoyed the outdoors, even though it rained during much of our stay. I definitely recommend to folks looking for a getaway from the hustle and bustle of everyday life!"
2022-04-01,5,Group trip,"This home is amazing!!! Wonderful both inside and out. Went for a friends weekend close to home and we had a blast. The views of the lake are beautiful, from the backyard/beach as well as from inside with the large windows. Highly recommend kayaking if able! Home has great gathering spots, plenty of outdoor seating and the indoor seating is great for dinner and games. The indoor/outdoor speaker system was one of my favorite amenities not to mention the amazing downstairs shower. I can’t recommend this place enough, they have everything you need from games, books, kitchen supplies, spices, charcoal grill, etc. great comforts of home. We will definitely be back!!!"
2022-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"The Barefoot Beach House is absolutely perfect for a beach/lake lover! From the moment you walk in, the views are breathtakingly beautiful! The private beach was the reason I wanted to stay in this stunning beach house. I will let you know, the beach did not disappoint even with the colder weather. The weather is always up and down at this time of year. However, the fire pit on the beach provided the options to still sit outside after dark even if it's cold. What I particularly loved about this home is its location. I live in Centralia and wanted to have a weekend getaway while not going to far away from my daughter. This beach house met that exact criteria. We were only about 6 minutes from home. But it felt like we were on a far away retreat! There is also everything you could possible need and then some! We fell in love with this beach house and I plan on making it a yearly getaway!"
2022-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"If you’re looking for the perfect staycation, or a nice to place to stay while you’re in town, this is the spot! The house was so clean and cute, with great views of the lake! We really appreciated all the amenities and felt right at home! Jake and Krista are also great at communicating all the information you need for an easy check in and check out."
2022-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Beautiful home stocked with anything you could need. Lots of natural sunlight and the scenery is beautiful. I would love to return. Host was responsive and helpful when contacted for a minor issue.
2022-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We really enjoyed our stay. Jake provided abundant information and a really well-marked path to the spot in a rural area. We were particularly impressed with how many little “extras” came with the place, including games, basic (and some not so basic) kitchen/cooking supplies, ample media devices and options, etc. We would definitely stay again."
2022-02-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Wonderful property that was spotless and has everything you need to enjoy your stay.
2021-12-01,5,Group trip,none
2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great place, great views!"
2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay!!! Everything was exactly as described!! We will be back again for sure!
2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great location - beautiful lake house.
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The beach house is just as described with a great view of the lake. It had the latest appliances and was very comfortable. It's secluded but not too far away from the winery and shops and park that we visited. Would definitely stay again!
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful house and clean. Top notch
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This house has everything! It was such a fun and relaxing weekend. The beds are super comfortable and we couldn’t have asked for more amenities. We hope to stay there again soon!
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place. First class
2021-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The barefoot beach house was a very pleasant surprise. It was one of the best lake houses we have stayed at due to location, private beach, and water access. The house is perfectly set up for two families and all the kids stuff there was fantastic. You do not need to bring anything for kids as it was there already. Absolutely spectacular time and we will be back next year."
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We love coming here almost every year. Our dogs love the access to the lake and it has everything you need.
2021-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,The Barefoot beach house was my favorite place I stayed this summer! My entire family loved it. Lots of toys and entertainment for the kids and easy to walk around for the grandparents. We will pack a lot less next year when we go because they have everything! Absolutely beautiful and perfect Lakehouse.
2021-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"“WOW” is what we said when we walked in the door! The pictures do not do this place justice. Beautifully decorated with a Lake theme. Nice view. A heads up- you enter through the front door onto the second story and then walk down a flight of stairs to the main living area. However, if stairs are difficult for any of your family members, it is an easy walk (not steep) around the side to the back entrance.
Lots of extras in the pantry and shampoo and body wash was provided in all bathrooms. Nice quality and supply of towels.
The beach was well maintained and tons of beach toys provided.
My kids loved the toy box of toys!
Laundry was easy to use and stocked with laundry detergent.
We enjoyed the lake and using the dock to dock our boat.
Great fishing for the kids off the dock.
We had a delicious meal at Mamma Antonia’s Trattoria - the house salad was delicious along with the pizza.
We also enjoyed music in The Yard at Crooked Creek Winery Downtown. And ice cream at Dairy Mart.
We enjoyed our stay very much and hope to return if they aren’t fully booked!"
2021-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Barefoot Beach House was the perfect getaway for mom, dad, and our toddler. The kitchen was a fantastic area for cooking and gathering. Roku TVs provided easy access to Elmo, Grover, and Cookie Monster. And the cement floor meant guilt free sandy feet and juice spills. The beach area and dock were excellent for playing in the sand, sunbathing, and fishing. The provided paddle boat was fun to take out for a new perspective and offered us a way to get out of the cove and see the lake at large. Plenty of firewood and a huge fire pit meant we got to get fully tribal after the kid went down. Try the jetted tub, it was a ton of fun for the kid to have a proper huge bubble bath. AC was COLD and we will definitely be returning."
2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The house is AWESOME! Love the layout and the kitchen was fully stocked with spices and baking essentials. Couch and beds were very comfortable. They had plenty of linens, towels and blankets and the everything was sparkling clean. The property is quiet and secluded with a great beach & firepit.

2021-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This place is awesome! Clean, bright, and spacious cabin right on the lake. It was well stocked and the hosts were helpful and easy to communicate with. It was our first trip with our new baby girl and we had a great time! :)"
2021-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We loved our stay at the Barefoot Beach House! Jake was an amazing host, went above and beyond to make sure everything went smoothly. This house was everything we were looking for in an escape from the city! Not sure who enjoyed it more us or our dog!
From the extra amenities to the beautiful lake views from all over the house, everything was perfect! I also enjoyed soaking in the jet tub at the end of the day...My only regret is that I didn’t book it for longer, we weren’t ready to leave! Defiantly coming back again!"

2021-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We really enjoyed our time at Barefoot Beach House. This is a perfect spot for some quiet relaxation away from the city, and the home itself is gorgeous. I suggest checking in before stocking up with groceries, as the place is very well stocked with spices, coffee, etc. Jake was very quick to respond to any questions, including facilitating kayak rentals. Would definitely recommend!"

2020-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great host!!
2020-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We wanted one last getaway before the end of summer and the barefoot beach house was the perfect place. The house was spacious, clean, and well stocked with essentials (and more!). We really enjoyed fishing on the dock, making pudgy pies in the fire pit, and best of all, our dogs loved the beach and swimming in the lake. Jake and Krista were great to work with and Jake’s brother even stopped off firewood for us to use. We’d definitely recommend the barefoot beach house to anyone looking to relax at the lake."
2020-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,We had a very enjoyable and relaxing time together as a family during our stay at the Barefoot House. The place was very clean and had a lot to offer for small children. The house was also well stocked with anything we needed right there within reach. We will definitely book this place again if we are in the area.
2020-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We had a great time at the Barefoot Beach House! Everything was clean and in excellent shape, there were lots and lots of supplies available - all we had to buy was food to cook! We swam, we went out in the kayaks to explore the lake, we cooked hot dogs and marshmallows over the fire, and relaxed in the house! A perfect vacation, and we hope to return as soon as we can!"
2020-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This house was great. Very nice layout and had all sorts of things that I normally bring or would need to run to the store for. Very thoughtful and considerate hosts. We really enjoyed our stay. The sound system was nice in that you could listen to it inside, outside or both. We really enjoyed our stay."
2020-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,Beautiful home on the lake with a lot of room and great amenities.
2020-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We loved this adorable house, and we had a blast! Lots of toys, games and extras on hand that were so nice. We kayaked, tooled around in the paddle boat, and played and made smores on the adorable beach.
Our two-year-old daughter really enjoyed the trip. So did my 92-year-old Gran. It's a wonderful place for a family getaway."
2020-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a great, quick weekend, family vacation. The house was perfect, full of amenities, and so easy to access the lake with little ones. Great stay and a great time!"
2020-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This house is great. We really enjoyed sitting outside by the lake, building a bonfire in the fire pit, cooking in the big kitchen, grilling on the charcoal grill, playing games at the tables outside and inside, walking around the area, and more. The beds are comfortable, the house has plenty of towels and linens, and the kitchen is decently well stocked. If you need specific items to cook meals, just ask Jake if he has them — he’s very responsive. Perfect location for a relatively secluded getaway."
2020-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"A heavenly retreat! Exactly as pictured, Jake's place was just right for the relaxing getaway that my family needed. Child and dog friendly, you can't go wrong!"
2020-04-01,5,Group trip,"We love Jake's place, its right on the water and you can spend your days relaxing watching animals. The house has everything you need and more, super happy with the small things available to us like salt and pepper and shampoo. Plus a nice spot for walking on country roads and or biking on country roads. We love it here and would return!"
2019-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Clean, open, and spacious. Great stay as advertised."
2019-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Loved this house, only stayed a couple days over thanksgiving and enjoyed every second. Loved being able to get away and enjoy a nice breath of fresh air!"
2019-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Truly a wonderful surprise, and easy drive from west county STL. We will be back for sure! Everything was there, where it made sense to be which eliminated us having to go back out for the necessities. The game room was also a hit. Perfect getaway- we rented kayaks (and he ensured we had the right size life jackets) used the paddle boat, and fished off the dock. Our city-girls and city-dogs has a blast!"
2019-09-01,5,Group trip,"Fantastic. Don’t pass it up, totally worth it!"
2019-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We enjoyed our stay at the Barefoot Beach house. The dogs loved the access to the water as well as the adults. We were happy that we had rented kayaks from a local. This was a hit by everyone and defiantly on the list to revisit in the future.
2019-08-01,4,Group trip,"The Barefoot Beach House is in a lovely, private spot. It is clean and comfortable and spacious. The kitchen was very well equipped with coffee, paper towels, Reynolds wrap, etc on hand. We really enjoyed the proximity to the water and the paddle boat. The hvac seemed fine during the day but overnight it would mysteriously get hot. The power went out while we were there. We were unable to get hold of the hosts when this happened. They did not respond to my texts and the phone went right to voicemail. I did not leave a phone message because there was another number listed. When we called the second number, it was incorrect. It was not the host’s number and the person was irritated because she says she gets frequent calls from the beach house. We did not expect the hosts to fix the power outage but we didn’t know who to report the outage to and if there were candles or flashlights anywhere in the house since it was dark."
2019-08-01,5,Stayed about a week,The lake views were beautiful. Jake had arranged for kayaks to be delivered and picked up 24 hours later. The house was clean and had everything we needed.
2019-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Great place. Very family friendly. We absolutely loved fishing, swimming, grilling and playing all kinds of games. Highly recommended."
2019-06-01,5,Group trip,Great place to get away and unwind for a few days
2019-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,You will not be disappointed. This place has everything and more. It’s great for kids of all ages.
2019-06-01,5,Group trip,"A beautiful house and a perfect view of the lake is what you can expect when you stay here at Jakes.
Comfortable beds for sleeping and plenty of games for daily and evening activity. You couldn’t ask for a more perfect setting! Many wonderful memories are waiting to be had here! Loved it!!!!!"
2019-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The lake house was very clean and well stocked, making our stay very comfortable. The kids loved the paddle boat and enjoyed catching many fish right off the dock. Any questions I had were answered right away from the host. Cant wait to come back in the summer time to utilize lake swimming."
2019-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Jake was an outstanding host - very responsive, very helpful, great communication. The house was comfortable and clean, and overall it worked very well for our family. There was an ample supply of towels, pillows, dishware, paper towels, toilet paper and other basics. We appreciated the welcome basket of goodies which was very thoughtful. Nice kitchen, great shower in the master bedroom, and we loved the loft sitting area."
2018-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,"It may be off the beaten path, but well worth it. We had 6 adults stay for a thanksgiving / Christmas combo with family from Iowa and Kentucky. It is soo nice and the master bathroom is ridiculously nice. Well worth every penny. And jake the owner is stellar at communicating."
2018-11-01,5,Group trip,"The Barefoot Beach House was the perfect place for a weekend getaway. Our group consisted of old high school friends who wanted a mini reunion. The house had everything we needed and had an awesome view of the lake. 2 bedrooms upstairs and 1 bedroom downstairs with really comfortable beds. The kitchen had a big table that was perfect for eating together, playing games, drinking coffee, and having long gab sessions. Large refrigerator was perfect to handle all of our food items and had an ice/water dispenser. The pantry was stock with so many basics. The upstairs & downstairs bathrooms were really clean and convenient. Loved the downstairs shower. There is a good size laundry room. Since it was cold out, we took advantage of the wood that was provided for the fire pit and cooked s’mores. Great place for star gazing. Inside was warm and cozy too. The furnace works really well. This place is stocked with about every game imaginable. We took full advantage of the air hockey game and foosball table. Tons of fun. The hosts were very pleasant and very responsive. We had a couple of questions during our short stay and our questions were answered very quickly.

I would highly recommend this place. Worth every penny. Our group has already planned a returned trip."
2018-10-01,5,Group trip,"This place is fantastic. We stayed with friends for a long weekend. The house is bigger than expected and the open layout is wonderful for socializing. The House was clean and well stocked with everything you could want for a weekend away (beach towels, plenty of extra linens and pillows, kitchen items, fire wood, water toys, and even a paddle boat). The bedrooms are very large which ensured that everyone was accommodated very comfortably. The down stairs shower with dual heads was wonderful and the water pressure is perfect. The jet tub was so relaxing after fun day of games, swimming, and hanging out. We had a great time using the fooseball and ping pong tables and the large island counter and large dining nook could not have been better for our group! It was the perfect weekend and we would not hesitate to come back! Jake was very quick with responses during the book process and during our stay. Excellent hosts and an excellent property! Thank you!"
2018-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great view, very clean with lots of space master bath and shower were very nice, quiet and a very nice fire pit. Internet TV service was in and out."
2018-08-01,5,Group trip,Amazing place. Great Amenities. Beautiful home.
2018-06-01,5,Group trip,"This home is absolutely lovely! There were so many extras that made our stay relaxing and easy. From the kids toys down to the bug spray and sun screen, we wanted for nothing! We came for our sons wedding, but now hope to come again just to enjoy some down time with family. I would highly recommend this home and host!"
2018-06-01,5,Group trip,"What a wonderful experience. Our entire family (including dogs) thoroughly enjoyed our stay. Everyone is still buzzing and talking about our next get together. The lake house is very secluded and peaceful. The house was just perfect for us, our kids (grown), and their spouses - and oh yea, our 7 month old granddaughter. And our 2 Shelties had a blast as well."
2018-05-01,4,Group trip,The Barefoot Beach House was incredible! We loved the open floor plan and the concrete flooring on the main level for all the sand/dirt carried in by us and our pets. And the pet friendly policy is amazing! Our pooches loved hanging out with us on the patio and the dock. It was so nice to take our fur babies with us instead of boarding them or trying to find a sitter. We really enjoyed the foosball and ping pong tables and the kitchen and grill features were beyond what we expected! I just wish we could have stayed longer!
2018-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place is one of a kind- a really special location for a quiet, fun getaway. We enjoyed all the games and entertainment that the house had to offer while also loving the privacy of the property for outdoor fun! Jake was very helpful and quick to answer all questions. The house had everything you would need. We will for sure be back!"
2018-04-01,5,Group trip,Wonderful stay with excellent amenities. Loved the fire pit and wood burning stove as well as the surround sound. We played more board games and had more laughs than we ever could have imagined.

2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My partner and I stayed here for our anniversary celebration, and it did not disappoint! The space was very clean, nicely decorated (especially for Xmas!), and spacious. I felt like the pictures didn’t do it justice because there were so many extra activities and details! Providing hot chocolate, games, popcorn, etc. made the space feel like a home away from home. We had no complaints! Host is very responsive and friendly, even giving us recommendations for restaurants and trails. We would love to visit again!"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,We had a great time! The house had lots of great perks like the sauna and hot tub. The house was very spacious with lots of living space. It was in a very peaceful area and was easy to find. The hosts were great and very quick to answer any questions I had leading up to the visit.
2023-11-01,5,Group trip,Exceptional host!
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place was absolutely amazing!! Will definitely stay again when I am in town! Peaceful, home feeling beautiful area! William was very responsive when I had questions and left a binder with local things to do and restaurants. Stocked wine for purchase if I wanted that as well!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place is a phenomenal space to go when you just want to get away and relax! it's great for a couple, a few friends or a whole family. It is very comfortable. There is plenty of space, the surroundings are very beautiful and it has everything you need for a great stay! William is super responsive and helpful. He made sure we were comfortable and checked in with us to see if we needed anything. I highly recommend staying here if you're just passing through or needing a place to go to reset! ❤️"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,A wonderful and quiet place. You can forget how many stars there are when you live in the city so sitting in the hot tub stargazing is such a refresher.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"This was a perfect stay for us. He was very helpful and responsive. The hot tub was great. The snacks they provided were great. Overall, very nice stay."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"A must stay! The place is beautiful, the hosts are wonderful, and the town is great to explore!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"This was a wonderful home away from home during our road trip. Peaceful, quiet location and great value. Hosts were very friendly and helpful. Loved the hot tub!"
2024-06-01,5,Group trip,"This is our second visit to Turtle Cove. We appreciate the opportunity to get away and relax. It’s great to fish and kayak directly from the property. The decor is dated, but the home is very clean and well-maintained. 6 adults and a dog fit comfortably. Dena communicates well, sharing tips about the area and quick responses to questions or needs. I recommend this property for an off-the-beaten-path place to unplug."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,Such a relaxing place! The house was exceptionally clean and well-furnished with comfy furniture. The view from the back porch overlooking the lake was so peaceful and tranquil with lots of wildlife to watch. Amazing stay at a great value!
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,The location was perfect for relaxing and unwinding.
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,Beautiful place and great host! We will stay again if the place is available!
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a great stay at Turtle Cove. My husband and I were just looking for a little weekend getaway where we could relax and recharge. This was perfect! We spent most our time on the covered deck watching the lake, listening to music, and relaxing. Turtle Cove had everything we needed. We would definitely go back!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,love every min of it but I would just always charge people as if 8 people is coming or not then charge for the extra my first and second time was great but me new to this is confusing to me how the extra people charge is cause it say leave 12 bucks if any extra so what is extra me and 1person or after 8 people.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"Nice place, would recommend!!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We made this our home base during our Solar Eclipse trip!!! Very relaxing to come home to after our day hikes at Shawnee National Forest and Giant City State Park. Dena was very helpful with recommendations for dining spots. As for watching the eclipse we spent the day grilling up brats and enjoying a sunny day on the patio!!! A very very relaxing weekend at Turtle Cove, much thanks to Dena!!!!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Very clean, well stocked, and peaceful home. This is the 3rd time we rented an airbnb in the area as we have family to visit . With 6 of us we dont want to take over our families living space, so we have been getting our own space and this is a much better option than having to stay in 2 small hotel rooms. This place was perfect, lots of room and seating to spread out. We were able to invite our family and host the holiday with plenty of room and all the equipment needed to serve everyone. We had beautiful weather and the views were spectacular. Loved waking up and upon entering the living room to look outside and see the lake, great views! Only downside to the house were the wasp. I was suprised to see so many so early in the season. Definately made me and the kids feel uneasy about being outside. I can only imagine in the summer months that it would be even worse. We will definitely consider staying in the future if the home isnt already booked. This house is frequently booked."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"We needed a place to stop halfway to Memphis and figured we'd find a nice house on a lake. This house was gorgeous, cozy, and had a private dock. There was plenty more we could have done there, but since it was only one night we did fishing and made a fire in the fire pit. We will consider this house when we are looking for a place to stay this summer. Thanks for a wonderful place to stay!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,words can't describe it it was beautiful
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Cozy, peaceful setting, plenty of firewood."
2024-03-01,5,Group trip,"Dena was a great host, her place it’s amazing our group of 6 girls were looking for a relaxing week, we picked the right place. (quiet, clean, great Lake view and beautiful sunrise and sunset )
Recommendation 100%"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,very clean and well kept. Hosts instructions were detailed and accurate. Host was proactive in ensuring check in and check out was easy and smooth.
2024-02-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Dena was wonderful to work with - very helpful and quick to respond. Her place is spotless and the surrounding area is beautiful. It was relaxing and private.
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We always look forward to staying here, we feel like we’re at home
Highly recommend this place"
2024-02-01,5,Group trip,Everything was clean and the place was great! Owner did an excellent job of communicating. I recommend for all.
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is our third time at Turtle Cove, and it won’t be our last. Beautiful location, perfect setting! We love coming here, and highly recommend it to anyone that loves the lake! We came for a little getaway and saw a lot of deer, and even a fox that trotted all over the frozen lake. Just a wonderful place, all around!"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We had a great stay at Turtle Cove, and look forward to doing it again sometime in the future. Dena was a great host! Highly recommend for a peaceful getaway retreat."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,We were surprised it was warm enough to take the little boat out in December! The covered deck was a great spot for tea and lunch. Our bedroom was a little tight with the pack-n-play but we enjoyed having plenty of space to gather in the living room and used the sunroom as a staging area. My 5yr loved the Legos and beach toys...he collected a couple hundred hickory nuts and then scattered them again and had a blast!
2023-12-01,5,Group trip,Dena was an amazing host she was very responsive. The home was warm and cozy. It was very well stocked with everything you would need. If you forgot something she probably had it there. We will definitely be back there. The view was amazing.
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Thank you!
2023-12-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Comfortable , was all that was expected . Will return in the spring or summer ."

2023-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,alot of room!
2023-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"Dena was a total pro.
Detailed and informative.
The lake house is clean,comfortable, nicely setup and relaxing. Pets are welcome and the cost is very reasonable.
Sunday morning ,sitting outside for breakfast looking at the lake and the surroundings was simply wonderful.
Hoping to be back."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great cottage! Lots of room. Comfortable, homelike feel. Would be great for family weekend getaway - especially in summer with water activities available."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Dena's place was awesome! It was immaculate and so comfy. I loved all the nice places to sit and enjoy every aspect of their little piece of paradise. I just wish we could've been there when it was warm. Thanks for sharing:)
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"I've had my fair share of AirBnB rentals and I can honestly say Turtle Cove is one of my favorite places. It's peaceful, right on the lake with tons of things to do. It truly felt like a home away from home. There was plenty of space for my family to not be on top of each other, my grandchildren LOVED the Legos, my adult children loved the kayaks and the fire pit. I can see us going back there for another weekend getaway. I have a feeling this place is going to be hard to book in the future because once you've stayed there, you're going to want to go back. Dena IS a Superhost, she was quick to respond, even gave us recommendations for the surrounding area which came in handy. There are hidden gems all around the house and properties (how many turtles can you find?).
I highly recommend Turtle Cove, to my folks on Scott AFB...want a weekend on the lake, this is the place!!"
2023-10-01,5,Group trip,A wonderful place to stay. The house has everything you need. Dena is a great host. Having a boat dock is a plus. We’ve already booked for next year. We are always happy to return to Turtle Cove.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,awesome time beautiful home
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This is our favorite place to stay. It’s feels like home and is super clean
2023-10-01,5,Group trip,It was lovely relaxing at Turtle Cove after a long day of traveling. The kayaks got used and we even cooked our supper outside. Would stay here again!
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with a pet,wonderful place to stay.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Enjoyed the stay at Turtle Cove.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"We enjoyed our quick stay at Turtle Cove. It was beautiful, very clean, and included everything we needed. We spent a few hours fishing from the dock and caught a bunch of fish. Thank you so much for sharing this amazing place!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Perfect place to stay during our time we stayed for our wedding. Nice and peaceful but also not to far from town. Dena was super responsive anytime we had a question and she was super nice. We will definitely be back and we highly recommend!
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Loved it beautiful home
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Turtle Cove was perfect for our family. So much adventure in one location, we didn't want to leave the property! We used the fire pit at night and loved the lighting. We utilized the provided kayaks, swam, and floated in the lake. We are mushroom hunters and really enjoyed walking in the field in front of the house and exploring all the varieties of mushrooms. It got up to 100 degrees during our stay, we played games and watched movies when it was too hot for outside.
The beds were very comfortable, and the house was very clean. All the windows were great to let in light and look out onto the lake. The house was fully stocked with any appliances, pots/pans, dishes or spices you may need.
Dena was extremely helpful, giving us restaurant recommendations and area attractions. Very responsive. I would recommend this to anyone, and we hope to say here again in the future!"
2023-08-01,3,Stayed with a pet,"The house was very cozy and clean and Dena was a great host with great communication - except for not disclosing the lake is toxic.
Was very disappointed with the “beach” that is advertised. The small sand area has all weeds growing out of it. When swimming with our dog, the water was disgusting and we had green colored yuck all over us that looked like paint. With research we found it is contaminated with very toxic blue-green algae that was not disclosed to us and we then spent the rest of our vacation worrying our dog was going to get very sick or die. We are still worried as symptoms can start showing several days later.
There are also many wasps/hornets on the back deck flying around so we could not enjoy the deck at all in fear of being stung."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay, the outdoor patio area and Webber gas grill were great, along with the seating on the covered deck. We had a thunderstorm come through and watching it from the deck was a fun memory for the kids. The lake was very quiet during the week and the kayaks were nice. Inside was nice, cool air conditioning, beds were comfortable plenty of seating in living room. The kitchen was well stocked with pots and pans as well as basics like oil, sugar, flour, salt, pepper, condiments, etc. The wifi was fast and responsive we brought our firestick, but it looked like it was a smart TV. The property was private and had a lot of yard space for yard games. Unlike many lake houses that are on top of each other, you couldn't see your neighbors. Appliances were modern and worked well. Shed was stocked with fishing gear, and paddle boat was fun. Due to warm weather and algae, swimming wasn't a great option, but small sandy beach might be nice earlier in the year."
2023-08-01,5,Group trip,We loved Turtle Cove! We all wished we could have stayed more than one night. It will be gorgeous in the fall!! Dena was fantastic to work with. Zero complaints from all six of us.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Turtle Cove is a perfect family getaway! We had a relaxing time enjoying the views, the pedal boat and the fire pit! The house had everything we needed plus more. Dena is a very accessible, communicative and gracious host. We’d love to come back soon! Thank you!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This was my family’s second time staying at Turtle Cove and it was just as wonderful as our first visit! The house is clean, comfortable, and well stocked with essentials. Similarly, there is a shed full of water toys, floats, life jackets, and more for playing on the small beach or in the lake. We also took advantage of the kayaks and paddle boat to explore the lake. We spent most of our time fishing (and caught three small fish!), playing in the sand, swimming, and relaxing around the campfire. Dena is always available, but we didn’t have to bother her because we had everything we needed. I highly recommend Turtle Cove and will definitely be back again!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Our family was looking for a last minute lake house getaway.
We are so happy that we chose Turtle Cove. Turtle Cove provided the beautiful, peaceful lake house setting we needed.

We absolutely LOVED everything about Turtle Cove. There is wonderful privacy on the property and the lake it not too busy.
The lake house offers so many places to relax and enjoy the GORGEOUS views of the lake and trees. We IMMENSELY ENJOYED each viewing area...the comfortable and homey living room, the stylish sun room, the modern covered deck, perfect patio area or the lovely and fun bench swing.
Turtle Cove had all the amenities needed for a getaway. This was hands down the BEST stocked Airbnd we have visited.
Dena was so wonderful with clear and super helpful recommendations. She always promptly responded to any of our questions.
We absolutely LOVED our stay at Turtle Cove and would HIGHLY RECOMMEND it."

2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Can’t say enough good things about our stay at Turtle cove ! The yard is huge and private, the views are beautiful. I loved sipping my coffee on the back deck in the mornings and seeing the turtles relaxing on the logs near the shore. My 2 kiddos had a blast playing in the sand on the little beach area and they had an entire shed full of sand toys, lake floats etc. It was very hot during our stay so swimming and floating in the lake was perfect. The house comes well stocked ! We had one rain day and so we enjoyed playing games as a family from their game closet.
Definitely recommend this place for a relaxing and fun family getaway."

2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Dena is a great host. The house is in great shape. It was incredibly clean and well stocked with all the cooking instruments you could need. She also keeps a lot of cleaning supplies handy for guests. The location is amazing. I was in town for work, but it was great being able to paddle around in one of their kayaks after work. I caught a lot of crappie and some blue gill in the limited time I had on the water. I travel a lot for work, and this is now one of my favorite stays. I'm even thinking about coming back for a nice, quiet family vacation."
2023-05-01,5,Group trip,Our stay at Dena’s place was wonderful. It’s a beautiful spot on a great little lake. The home was very well maintained and had everything we could possibly need. Dena was always quick to respond and helpful with any and all needs. Highly recommend. Hope to go back!

We had everything to cook with, fish,play games and just relax. So very private and right on the lake. Home was clean and wonderfully accommodating. I loved the gessse with their babies that came right along the shore line, and their are all species of birds. Lake is so serene, and relaxing. Definitely plan to return whenever possible."

2023-04-01,5,Group trip,"Hi Dena, my group and I go to turtle cove at least 3 times a year to fish we have a saying about your place .You will always catch a fish at turtle cove big or small"
2023-04-01,4,Stayed with a pet,"We enjoyed our lakeside time at Turtle Cove! The weather was perfect for a week at the lake, and we loved having the opportunity to kayak — what a bonus!
Downsides for us: spring at the lake means wasps — lots of them. Even with working traps and wasp spray, we still had many in the house, and were grateful for the fly swatter. Also, the beds didn’t work for us — they didn’t support us and we rolled into the middle.
Dena is a fantastic host — quick to respond and generous with the “extras.” We didn’t need to make a run to town for anything other than food. She also provided great suggestions for area restaurants and shopping!"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,This lakeside property was amazing. With so much outdoor activities we didn’t leave the property.
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Nice, large, open space around the home for enjoying the outdoors. Spending time on the patio overlooking the water was a very peaceful experience."

2023-03-01,4,Stayed one night,"Nice lakeside house with amenities included to enjoy the stay. It was unseasonably cold when we were there so weren't able to enjoy the large enclosed porch, firepit, boat dock, or beach area. House was warm & inviting. The moonlit & sunrise lake views were lovely."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,The house was very nice. View of the lake was amazing. Very comfortable furnishings. Hosts communicated well.

Dena is an amazing host!! The house is charming."
2023-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"Turtle Cove is an awesome space!

2022-09-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We had a great time at Turtle Cove and highly recommend it to all! It was VERY clean and well-stocked. Plenty of kitchen space and supplies! Ceiling fans and portable fans in each bedroom were appreciated. Living room furniture was quite comfy. Outdoors was great too! There was an amazing sun porch that's bright and airy, but it was too cool out for us to enjoy it this time around. So many fun seating areas outdoors with quality furniture. Even a picnic table near the water. My favorite thing to do was to sit with refreshments and read on the covered porch! We also enjoyed campfires with the colorful globe lights lit! If it were warmer outdoors, there were lots of water activities available. There was shopping available in both nearby towns. Our favorite for groceries was IGA Plus in Salem. Dena was super-kind and a great communicator! Self check-in was easy and checkout expectations were very reasonable. Turtle Cove is definitely a do-over!!!"
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Turtle Cove is a wonderful place to stay. The host is extremely nice and accommodating. The house has everything you need!!!!! So very clean inside the home and the property. Great fishing. Great views of lake.

2022-08-01,5,Group trip,"Our staying at this place was perfect. Everything was on point, we had everything we needed at the house including things we didn’t know like games and extra bed.
Our host gave us clear instructions for our check in and check out and literally didn’t need anything extra.
We would definitely come back soon and recommend this to our friends. What an amazing gateway!"
2022-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"I've stayed at this property twice now and will be back for a third time! The house is amazingly clean and well-stocked, and there's plenty to do: kayaks, pedal boats, fire pit, board games and puzzles if it rains, etc. My kids had a great time playing in the water, running around in the HUGE yard, and making s'mores. It's in a rural area but you can order both Instacart and DoorDash to the house, which is great because we didn't want to leave."
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had another fabulous stay at Turtle Cove! Dena is a fabulous host, and the place is always so well prepared. We had a special event, and we were able to share some beautiful memories with out of state family and friends."

2022-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,Turtle Cove was lovely. I wish we would have spent more time at the cottage. It was a nice area to relax at after a day of hiking at Shawnee National Forest. The kitchen had everything we needed to cook our meals there. The beds are comfortable. The outside area had plently of places to relax.
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"July 29-30
The stay at Turtle Cove was great! Dena is a great host. Everything was very clean and everything we needed for cooking, showering, swimming, and outdoor relaxation was provided. Beautiful place to stay on the lake!!! We would definitely recommend staying here and we will for sure be back!!
Monica and Terry"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Dena is a great. It seems that we always pack more than we need to because we don't want to take the chance of not having something. Not that you need to travel far to get something that you may have forgotten or is not there, this place is well stocked and very clean. Great set up for a family. This is our second time staying here and we will be returning."

2022-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Dena is a great host and her property is absolutely beautiful. We went for a peaceful relaxing getaway and that's exactly what we had. I highly recommend a stay at 🐢Turtle Cove🐢 if you are looking for a beautiful low key lake front property! I also want to mention something I've never seen being reviewed when I'm searching rental properties but to me it's as important as beds....Dena has some of the most comfortable furniture I've ever seen in any of my travels! Total thumbs up 👍😊
2022-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Me and my family couldn't be happier with the experience we had here. From fishing (caught some nice size catfish), swimming, kayaking and the fire pit, all around great time. Everything about this place was relaxing and comfortable, the light set up around the fire pit just made for an even better experience. We are looking forward to returning in the future."
2022-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Dena was very responsive & helpful before & during our stay.
Turtle cove is absolutely beautiful and we would love to come back!"

Kayaks and paddle boats, life jackets, fishing polls, tackle, etc there if you need it. Dena and family are great host. Very easy to be in contact with. They have a closet with many games for families. Kitchen has everything you need to cook. Plenty of dishes, pots, pans, utensils. Wi-Fi available. BBq grill, firepit. Very nice covered deck with seating. We caught lots of fish off the dock which was great and caught bass off of our fishing boat."

2022-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"Wow! What a gem!
Dena was super responsive whenever I had a question and provided us with a great list of recommendations before arrival!
My parents and I used the kayaks as sunrise and it was absolutely stunning. Highly recommend!"
2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Where do I start? Turtle Cove was a beautiful, serene place and the Moores thought of everything! The view and surrounding outside deck and patio areas were just the best and the house was SO clean and well-appointed. It's so great that the deck has a canopy so we could even be out there watching the couple of rain showers that passed through. We did have a couple of minor questions that Dena responded to right away. Most of the week, it was just the two of us (my husband and I), but we enjoyed having family members come visit on a couple of different days for a cookout, fishing, paddle-boating, playing Washers, and relaxing - everyone loved Turtle Cove! It was mostly quiet around the lake and cool out, so not a lot of hot weather activities going on at the end of April...and that was fine with us. It was interesting watching the wildlife all around - geese, ducks, cranes, birds, fish, and even a turtle! There were a few buzzing things to watch out for, but hey, it's that time of year. WiFi was a challenge like some have mentioned, but not an impossible situation at all. Dena provided LOTS of information beforehand that covered all the bases. We stayed almost a week and still weren't quite ready to come home. If we could give more than 5 stars, we sure would! Can't wait to go back!"
2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is a great home. It has a large yard, grill, and firewood for a fire pit. There is a swing near the water and the place has a few kayaks for use. It has lots of outdoor seating, which we enjoy. The home is very clean and has everything you need to make you feel at home."

2022-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"A great spot to gather and relax. I was there on a cold, rainy weekend and didn't go out on the lake but still had a great time. There is so much space...much larger than the pictures suggest. Very clean and well stocked. I'll be back!"
2022-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"We so enjoyed our time at Turtle Cove. VERY VERY PEACEFUL and beautiful views. I could stay there for weeks. Extraordinarily clean, and neat. Host truly seems to want to think of everything you might need to know and does just that. Very quiet and private."
2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very pleasant cottage at the edge of a lake with all the necessities for an enjoyable stay.

2022-02-01,4,Stayed a few nights,This house and lake and accommodations are everything we wanted. The surrounding town was pretty sad. Go out early in the day and late in the week...
2022-02-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Great getaway spot with outdoor amenities for warm weather and a fire place for indoor treat.
View is gorgeous:) place is clean and has everything available for a home cooked meal.

2022-01-01,5,Stayed one night,Great atmosphere!

2022-01-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"What an exceptional stay! Turtle Cove was clean, cozy, and beautiful. We especially enjoyed the lake view from the living room and the comfortable bed rooms."
2022-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,Dena's Turtle Cove has a very homey and relaxed feel to it. The view of the lake is beautiful (even in the winter). The beds are comfortable. Supplies are well stocked. It's a great place to relax and get away. We hope to bring our paddle boards and return in the summer!
2022-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place to rest and relax
2022-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Very private, beautiful setting, in the cove of a small lake. We went in Winter so we missed out on some of the amenities with a lake vacation. However, we watched the lake freeze over one morning on the couch under one of a generous supply of blankets they provide sipping hot coffee, watching the sun come up. Best part? We were visiting family in the area and left something accidentally in the cabin when we headed home. Without hesitation, Dena offered to take it by my local relative’s house! Thanks again, Dena!!"
2021-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Nice lake house just as described. WiFi was a little spotty, but we weren’t trying to do work, just vacation. All the outdoor amenities are great."
2021-12-01,5,Group trip,The pictures don’t do justice! Turtle Cove was peaceful and relaxing. Everything was clean and organized. My friends and I had a great time catching up by the fire and enjoying meals together and it felt like home. We have already planned our next visit and hope to visit again and again.
2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Turtle Cove is an absolute gem! We loved everything about it. It’s well stocked, quiet and immaculate. Our fur babies enjoyed all the sights and sounds of the lake. Dena and Preston are outstanding with communication, and when we had a couple of hiccups (neither their fault) with our stay, they were both on top of it. We’ve stayed in many rentals and this one just shot up to the top of our favorites list. Great value and by far the cleanest place! One suggestion for folks coming in to the area - follow Dena’s instructions to the letter. GPS tried to route us both coming in and going home to take a shorter route and cut through by way of a gravel road -Elm Ln. DO NOT GO TO ELM LN! We got stuck in a muddy pothole and needed a tow out. Thank God for the kind locals who pulled us out and told us it happens on that road almost every day. Lol
If you follow the county paved roads /directions given, you will go right to it with no problems.
We can’t wait to come back in warmer months to enjoy the lake. Thanks Dena and Preston!"
2021-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,"lovely home! perfect for either one night or a longer vacation destination. very clean, well laid out. great views of the lake. lots of space for kids and dogs to run around outside. well equipped with boats and lake toys. great find!"
2021-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"What a hidden gem!! We were only here for one night on our way to OK. A lovely cottage! Beautiful location on a small, quiet lake with a little beach, docks, kayaks and a huge expansive property which was great for the dog to run around after a long drive. Would love to come back and enjoy all the outdoor activities! Dena wa super. We arrived after dark so she had the outdoor globe lights on so we could see the beautiful lake. Highly recommend!"
2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This place is awesome – very private and very roomy! Great place to have a family reunion and for kids and dogs. Or if you just wanna be romantic like us and just go with your spouse that works too!
2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place was just what I was looking for. I came for a quiet place to stay to read and relax, and it was perfect. Dena’s place was clean and had everything I would ever need. Can’t wait to come back!"
2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Our stay could not have been better! We had an amazing time and everything was exactly as described. We will absolutely be back!!
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Cozy home on a beautiful lake lot with stunning views. We really enjoyed the fire pit and the outdoor lighting. Plus Dena provided firewood! Amazing hospitality!!!
2021-10-01,4,Stayed with kids,"This house is really nice and at a great location. It has all the accommodations one would need but also feels really homey and comfortable. I really appreciated the nice touches with good towels and linen/blankets. There is a lot of outside seating too. We enjoyed the swings by the lake and the firepit. It was very peaceful and quiet.
While we definitely recommend this place, here's just a few things to be aware. While they have internet, it is slow/get low bars, which was fine with us because we went to disconnect and unwind. We also found the master/primary bed to be quite uncomfortable and probably very old. Two of the toilets are low but the en-suite isn't, just FYI for those with back/joint issues."
2021-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"What a great host and autumn getaway experience! The cabin was surprisingly roomy and charming for four of us, and we immediately felt comfortable there. Everything we needed was available, and Dena was very thorough in instructions and communications. There was a firepit all prepared for us and we really enjoyed it and the pretty colorful lights by the beautiful lake. This is the perfect place for a quick, peaceful vacay if you live in the St. Louis region! The ability to book for one night was much appreciated, but trust me, you will want to stay longer."
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,A perfect place to get away. Very comfortable and clean. We hope to return!
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Dena place is the best and she's a 5 star host..

2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Absolutely one of the best places we have rented. Host was the best at supplies, info and contact response. Clean and organized to a tee. We will be back. A quiet and relaxing stay."
2021-09-01,5,Stayed over a week,We had a great two weeks at Turtle Cove. Appreciated the cleanliness. We will be back next year. The only negative is the internet speed. The TV has Netflex but can’t watch because of buffering. I understand there is nothing they can do.
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Perfect lake house and very relaxing. Had everything we needed. Highly recommend!
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Turtle Cove is in a beautiful area with great outdoor space. It has kayaks, a firepit, a grill, and several outdoor tables and swings. The living room has a lake view. We saw hummingbirds, an owl, deer, and lots of squirrels. We had some family and friends over to visit with us and the large yard and outdoor space made it easy to social distance. Dena is an excellent host and I highly recommend this place for your next visit to the Centralia area. You feel like you are at home while making new memories. Stop by Castle Ridge for a great meal on Racoon Lake. We will be back to stay at Turtle Cove - thank you Dena."
2021-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,Dena's property is a true gem. She has anything you need from life jackets and beach toys to cooking utensils and board games. Very clean property with lots of fun to be had+

2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We had an amazing time. The house was clean and Dena was very quick to reply and was so helpful. This is a great place for anyone wanting to spend time by the lake.
2021-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,We had such a great family vacation here. Wonderful outdoor setup with a great beach area. The kids absolutely loved the beach and the kayaks. Dena was also so very helpful with providing information about the surrounding area and recommending food options. Highly recommend this place for a nice quiet lakefront vacation.
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Very private surroundings with amazing views of the water right out the windows and deck. Easy water access. Perfect place for a quiet getaway. Host thought of everything - perfect directions, great suggestions for local places, household instructions and stocking Turtle Cove with everything we ever could have needed. Absolutely wonderful experience with a great host!"
2021-07-01,5,Group trip,"Very comfortable place to stay. It's as nice as the pictures look. I almost don't want to give it a good review because if too many people want to go there, it'll be harder to book next time!"
2021-07-01,4,Stayed with kids,"Being on the lake was a great time. Everything was as described and Dena was easy to communicate with. The home is spacious with several tables and areas for sitting, making it ideal for large families. We’d stay here again!"
2021-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We booked Turtle Cove for a long weekend to get out of town and celebrate my son’s 5th birthday. We were so impressed with Turtle Cove: it’s clean, stocked with just about anything you could need, in a perfect location with a private dock and little beach area, and the beds were really comfy! We spent nearly all our time enjoying the outdoors, using the paddle boats, kayaks, beach toys, and more provided at the house. When it was rainy, we played games inside and relaxed. Dena was a communicative and friendly host. I couldn’t have asked for a better lake getaway; we are definitely planning a return trip next summer. Thank you!"
2021-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Lovely, quiet house. So much space to relax."
2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Turtle Cove is such a wonderful, relaxing place. The location is great and Dena provides everything you could need and more (first aid supplies, cooking utensils, toiletries, kayaks, toys etc). She also has great communication. I would definitely recommend staying at Turtle Cove!"
2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Wonderful getaway. Home very clean has everything you need Great location. Right on water and they have a dock you can use. Lots of room for families. You will enjoy Turtle Cove!!!
2021-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Beautiful place, nice accommodations. Highly recommend."
2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Turtle cove is everything stated and more! Great view and peaceful location. The lake temp was perfect and we cooked all of our meals with ease. We loved the deck the most. Dena is a great host and communicator♥️
2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great space right on the lake with all the amenities, we were there for two days and really enjoyed the peace and quiet less than 100 miles from St. Louis."
2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Turtle Cove was just as pictured! The views were wonderful and the house sparkling clean. Everything we needed for our stay was provided. Dena was a great host who gave us tips on everything!
It was very relaxing and peaceful and just what we needed!"
2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Dena's beach cottage is amazing. It was spotless and inviting. The kitchen was well stocked for all cooking and serving needs. Everything is provided for a great time on the lake as well as games for inside fun if it rains. Dena gives lots of information about the area and is quick to respond to any messages. Unbeatable value can't wait to go back
2021-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"Even better than the photos - tons of space inside and out, with a lovely, secluded lakefront area to relax. And possibly the cleanest Airbnb I’ve ever stayed in - it was super well equipped and immaculate!"
2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The cabin/lake house is as described. Very Clean! Everything was easy and it is the perfect close to town getaway.
2021-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Where do begin? Dena's place is the ULTIMATE place for a relaxing vacation! We couldn't be more pleased with the location, right on the water, with gorgeous views. We saw lots of squirrels, cranes, deer, and some sort of raptor. They have EVERYTHING you could possibly need: life jackets, sand toys, games, fishing poles, etc. The cottage is older yet so cozy, but there's also so much space between the sun room, deck, yard, and house! And it was basically *sparkling*, it was SO clean! Dena is a wonderful host, always responding quickly to questions. My kids caught LOTS of fish off the dock, even a few turtles. Make sure to try the Lemon ice cream in Salem at Dairy Mart, one of Dena's wonderful recommendations. We love this place SO much, we have already booked a return trip and plan to make it an annual getaway!"
2021-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Clean, cozy and so many things to list. Great Wi-Fi, washer and dryer, kitchen with everything you need, quiet, beautiful lake, outside fire pit with a ton of wood, quick jaunt into town for dinner or pick up food to cook, plenty of parking, safe and keyless entry so you never have to worry about keys, wonderful covered deck with plenty of seating and also a patio to bask in the sun, plenty of wildlife to enjoy watching and beautiful sunrises and sunsets to watch either from the living room or from the deck. I loved this cabin and would stay again in a minute!"
2021-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Wonderful place to stay. Everything was clean and just easy to make yourself feel at home. Full of all the amenities you could need for a smooth vacation.
2021-04-01,5,Group trip,This was a perfect place for a weekend getaway. Right on the lake and very quite.
2021-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Cute comfortable clean cottage with a great setting away from neighbors and with a nice lake view. The covered deck overlooking the lake is a great place to kickback have a drink, eat dinner of whatever. Well equipped kitchen, nice sunroom but the deck and patio are the place to be. For those working remotely the internet is rather sluggish."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Jay was very responsive to questions and kind. I've stayed here 4 other times for retreats and family gatherings, always relaxing with sublime sunsets."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Excellent location on the lake. The cabin is everything described and more. Great host
2024-03-01,4,Group trip,"The lake is gorgeous! From the cabin and fire pit you can see the water. It’s very peaceful.
The bedrooms were clean. Wifi worked. We were very comfortable.
The house itself is big as advertised. Though the plumbing was leaky in the bathrooms. I guess it’s been that way for a while since there are water stains on the walls and in one bedroom. Not all the amenities were available.
There was a cool record collection and turn table."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,We had a great stay at Jay’s charming Lakehouse. Created many wonderful memories with my family. Jay was a communicative host. The house was very unique and cozy. Would definitely stay again!
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The house was as described. The bathrooms are unbelievably beautiful, high-end, updated bathrooms. House has rustic charm. Kitchen was adequately equipped. We came for a winter family weekend getaway, but hope to come back during the summer months to enjoy the lake. The large table with chairs and benches was perfect for everyone to sit down to dinner and also for conversation and board games. The upstairs children’s play area was a hit with the seven grandchildren children.
Stairways to the upper bedroom loft and to the lower basement bedrooms. For our family they were not steep or difficult to climb. But if some of your family would be challenged by climbing stairs, I would not recommend this property."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The house was beautiful with lots of sleeping options and large bathrooms. The lake is beautiful, would love to go back in the summer and take advantage of the kayaks. There is a lot of seating throughout to for groups to sit and talk. Make sure you have an online map program because finding it in the dark can be tricky. The kitchen could use some newer pots and pans. It was great for our get together and we would definitely go back."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place for a relaxing weekend.
2023-10-01,4,Group trip,"This is our annual girl's trip, 3 years at this cabin. The cabin is so spacious, the owner is very nice. The sunset views are the best ever!!! There were a couple of things the cleaning crew missed but was resolved through communication with Jay. We will be back. We absolutely love it here."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is a beautiful home, with tons of room. Fishing right from a lakeside patio, as well as a little beach to make swimming really easy. People in the area are really friendly too. Several boats stopped to chat while we were on the the fishing patio. We had a lovely time at this beautiful location"
2023-09-01,3,Stayed with kids,It was a very nice place and beautiful on the lake but it wasn’t very private. My family also felt like it was unequipped for a big group with very little towels and other things like that. A washer and dryer would be nice too but they never advertised one so I can’t complain to much about it.
2023-09-01,5,Group trip,"Jay,
Just like to say, this place exceeded our expectations, each of the members had an exceptional time and enjoyed their visit.
Hopefully we can do it again next year."
2023-08-01,5,Group trip,We enjoyed our stay and had a very relaxing weekend
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,Absolutely amazing place to stay! This is our 3rd year staying at this lake house. It fits the needs for us and the 2 other families we travel with. The beach and lake is a perfect spot for all ages. The house accommodates a large group perfectly. (We love the extra big table that we can gather around at meal times)
2023-06-01,5,Group trip,"Nice place,peaceful, would love to have had another tv downstairs cause there was not a lot of seating in living room but understand people are probably outside but we got rained on so got stuck inside and we couldn't find the washer and dryer but other than that we loved it the cabin was beautiful the drinking coffee on the deck in the mornings was great and fishing was great it was a great get away andy doggy loved it too he was outside the whole time and enjoyed also."
2023-01-01,4,Group trip,Great overall stay
2022-11-01,5,Group trip,"This is a beautiful location! We loved the lake, fire pit out in front and home. The house is large and well kept. We had just a few little hiccups but the host team took care of them right away."
2022-11-01,3,Group trip,The house needs more lights. It’s very dark inside. Many of the outlets don’t work. It’s good for a hunting camp. But needs more lighting.
2022-11-01,5,Group trip,Beautiful wood work and nice water access.
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Nice place to get away for a few days for some peace and quiet time to just relax
2022-10-01,5,Group trip,This cabin is so beautiful and well furnished. The host is great to work with. We’ve stayed here multiple times and it never disappoints!
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is such a wonderful cabin. we use it for a girls weekend. The sunsets are unbelievable. great beds, great kitchen, amazing bathrooms. it's very peaceful!"
2022-10-01,5,Group trip,Two beautiful properties on Lake Centralia. We were in town for a wedding and had several couples so the two houses together worked out great! We spent most of the time hanging out by the lake and fire pit.
2022-08-01,5,Group trip,Very accommodating! House and view were stunning and the whole family enjoyed the private beach area. Highly recommend to anyone on the edge from clicking the book now button. We will be coming back in the future!!
2022-08-01,4,Stayed with kids,"The house was beautiful and comfortably fit ten of us. Fishing and the deck was the best part! Only downfall was the amazing shower didn’t drain while you were in it and not all jets worked properly. The beach area to swim wasn’t the best, but if you have a boat the lake looked beautiful further out! Only other complaint was the bbq pit, pots pans, dishes were left dirty."
2022-08-01,4,Stayed with kids,This is our 2nd year visiting this lake house! It fits our needs perfectly! Adequate space for a large group. We love the pantry area which helps keep everything organized! The beach is perfect but this year we were disappointed to see so much grass and weeds covering most of the area. There is also still the sewer smell coming from the basement (especially the front bedroom) Overall this is the perfect location and space for a large group! We can't wait for next year!
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We loved our stay. Perfect for family time. We loved the porch, the deck, and the beach. Blackstone was great for some fun meals. Beds were comfortable and all 3 showers are great. Great open concept to have the family all together but still have their own space if they needed to have quiet time. Communication with host was great. No issues at all."
2022-07-01,3,Stayed with kids,"We stayed a long weekend with our friends! 10 of us total, 4 adults and 6 kids ranging from 8-13 - and we had plenty of room! It was a great weekend swimming, kayaking, and s’mores by the fire!
If you plan to cook, bring your own pots and pans, just about all available were broken/damaged and should be thrown away.
The stairs/deck for the beach area were under construction, nothing was blocked off, and there were no railings present, just wish we would have had a heads up about this, especially because we had 6 kids with us.
I had notified the property owner/manager through Airbnb of a bad odor in the house in the morning, owner/management reached out later that evening and said the owner was coming by to check it out, but no one showed up. We opened all the windows and aired out the house, the smell seemed to get better, but later that evening it began to get stronger again, a sewage smell that seemed to come from lower level. Grease trap under sink stunk at times as well, and the pull out cabinet for the garbage was pretty gross.
Linens were clean, and the house was in good condition, however there were air fresheners/odor eliminators all over throughout the house, which makes me feel we were not the only ones to complain about the bad odor.
Overall our families had a great time, we made the best of the issues and spent most of our time outside, it was a nice spot to vacation for a weekend."
2022-07-01,3,Stayed with kids,Beautiful home and located right on the lake.
2022-06-01,3,Stayed with kids,"Great house for the money!! Rent a boat at a nearby marina, bring floats for the lake or rent the kayaks. Beds are great. House is clean."
2022-06-01,4,Group trip,"The lake house itself was beautiful! The space it provided for my family was perfect. We ran into a few issues. When we arrived the air conditioning was not working. Jay was able to get a HVAC company there the next day to discover that the Freon had leaked out, so they were able to temporarily fix and would replace unit later. For the remainder of our time the air conditioning worked well. We stayed at this AirBnB for our sons wedding, so it was very important to have air conditioning along with the fact it was 100 degrees over our time there.
We then experienced a more severe problem. When returning from the wedding on Saturday, it was very late and noticed a sewer gas smell in the basement bedroom that my husband, granddaughter and I were sleeping. My husband attempted to cover the vent where the gas was leaking. The next morning we contacted Jay to let him know and he came that day to check it out. Told us to keep the air purifiers on and that the smell would go away. First of all an air purifier was not the issue, the issue was much more! Our last evening stay, my granddaughter and I woke to the gas getting stronger so at 2:00 a.m. we moved to the third floor and slept. By the next morning at 7:00 a.m. I woke my parents and husband whom were staying in the other basement bedrooms because the gas was overwhelmingly strong to the point it was like gasoline! We quickly packed everything up and left the lake house.
Our over all experience was good, but did not appreciate the lack of concern of the sewer gas. It was very toxic and could have caused severe health issues. When there are issues such as no air conditioning (with temps in the 90s and heat index in the 100s) plus the toxic sewer gases (of which we felt were not taken serious) these were BIG issues and should've been addressed in a better manner.
Jay did reimburse my family $300 for the final evening of issues, but we would've been satisfied with just taking our concerns seriously and fixing them instead of acting like we were the problem due to an air purifier not being turned on (of which was never on to begin with)."
2022-06-01,5,Group trip,What a great space! We rented both houses for my 50th birthday party with family and it was lovely. More than enough space to spread out. The beach and outside setting were perfect for swimming and kayaking. The kitchen is loaded with lots of tools and is well thought out. Folks sleeping upstairs in the loft may get warm in the summer time but that is to be expected. There are fans to use and they also left sleeping masks and ear plugs. So thoughtful!
2022-06-01,5,Group trip,Beautiful lake and the house is perfect!
2022-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,great time. very relaxing weekend.
2022-04-01,5,Group trip,"Our son was getting married at The Wedding Barn in Iuka, IL. & we had quite a few out of town family & friends attending. It was also almost a 2 hour drive from our home. Staying at the local Holiday Inn Express just didn’t sound conducive for our weekend gathering of festivities. In our down time, we all wanted to be together, visiting & making memories! 🤗 Finding the O’Brist Lake House, nestled in the wooded area on Lake Centraila, was the perfect answer to our weekend gathering of all ages from 9-80. It allowed me to be a Hostess away from my home. We were able to prepare breakfast in the fully equipped modern kitchen, both Saturday & Sunday - no rushing around looking for some place in the neighboring small town to dine.
After decorating the wedding venue in Iuka & the rehearsal dinner in Salem, Friday night, our entourage headed back for a relaxing evening gathered at the large dining table for a game of “Farkle”, while I finished icing the wedding cake 🎂. ( Bet that was a first for the O’Brist Lakehouse) The 3 large bathrooms also were accommodating to our group getting ready to attend the Saturday afternoon wedding. It also allowed for us to invite other close friends, that were making the 2 hour drive to the wedding, to come a bit early, stop by the Lake House & change into their wedding attire.
The O’Brist Lake House was the perfect answer to make our family’s wedding getaway wedding weekend perfect! I highly recommend this lovely home 🏡. We made more family memories there!"
2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place
2022-03-01,5,Group trip,We loved staying here! Definitely recommended
2022-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"There are a number great things about the Lake House: the proximity to the lake, the view, fairly short distance from St. Louis, and of course the cabin itself. We loved the open layout and the tasteful decor. The beds were comfy, kitchen well stocked, and just overall a very cozy place. Photos didn’t give it justice. Cathy, the manager, was phenomenal, provided great recommendations and was super responsive and pleasure to work with. We are already planning another trip to the Lake House in a few months… can’t wait! :)"
2022-01-01,5,Group trip,"Place was great, had a lot of room, and enjoyed our stay. The lake view was also very nice. Definitely would recommend!"
2021-12-01,5,Group trip,It was a very nice stay. I would recommend it.
2021-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This cabin was the perfect place for us to connect with family and celebrate our Christmas together! Lots of space, comfortable, full-size kitchen and everyone fought over soaking time in the tubs lol! The play area for the little was a nice treat too. We fully enjoyed our stay and would love to come back in the Summer to take advantage of the lake too. We highly recommend this cabin!"
2021-11-01,5,Group trip,"This cabin is beautiful and so peaceful. The amenities are top of the line. The hosts are so great to work with, they respond very quickly to communications. I will definitely stay at this cabin again!"
2021-10-01,4,Group trip,"My friends and I had a great time — a truly charming cabin getaway! We enjoyed having camp fires by the lake, fishing off the doc, lounging on the porch swing, and having meals together at the big dining table.
The bedding and bathrooms were very clean, but I was disappointed in the cleanliness of the rest of the space. That said, I’d still recommend this cabin, as long as you’re okay with some grime and/or don’t mind doing some extra cleaning."
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful views, large beautiful cabin. We Would definitely go back!"
2021-09-01,5,Group trip,"We had an amazing visit with family. Plenty of space and a cozy environment. Fire pit, dock, and porch allow for great space to be outdoors."
2021-08-01,4,Group trip,"This home saw awesome jay was super easy to contact and the location is beautiful. The pictures of the basement are not fully showing the unfinished parts of the home. I’m may of 2020 they had a comment about the complaints and nothing had been fixed, they said it was going to be fixed in the off season but who knows. Definitely had a lot of dust and fruit flies on the kitchen lights and under the beds, for the extra cleaning fee I would have expected more. The upstairs bathroom is out of order and had been for some time with no mention of it plus the only fully functional bathroom was the basement. Overall I can’t wait to say here again the architecture is beautiful and everyone is super friendly they even had a flat top grill. I’m from cape cod so maybe I’m a snob about my water but it’s definitely not the cleanest but they got some big fish!"
2021-08-01,4,Group trip,"The home was very beatuful and very clean. Designer bathrooms were a plus and the decor was inviting, peaceful,
and welcoming. Location is right on the water which was very nice. I did have a few suggestions for the host and he said he would be sure to address them. Communication was exceptional and host always responded quickly and graciously. Thank you for hosting my family on a fun little getaway!"
2021-08-01,4,Stayed a few nights,beautiful home. only complaint...which was more of an annoyance is they charge a cleaning fee....but then also leave a very detailed list of cleaning at end of trip....
2021-08-01,4,Stayed with kids,Great place to go with friends and the family. We did not need to leave to go do anything as we had plenty to do there. Views are incredible morning and night. Amazing breeze all the time so we were always comfortable outside.
2021-08-01,5,Group trip,"House is very clean with plenty of space. Private beach was great, and fishing from the dock was awesome. Caught bass, catfish, blue gill. Great place and atmosphere."
2021-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This house is perfect from the inside to the outside! Beautiful view of the lake from the wrap around porch, deck and loft area inside. House accommodates large groups without feeling closed in! Private beach allows for plenty of fun for all ages! Sand castles, seating, fishing and swimming all in one day! Griddle on porch was perfect for making quick breakfasts."
2021-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Thr cabin was beautiful, the private beach was welcoming, and the setting gorgeous."
2021-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Loved the house - super clean, bathroom showers were great and the playroom area upstairs was too cute! My 3 year old loved it! Walked out and the lake is surrounding which is beautiful. The kids loved the beach and finding shells as well as fishing off the deck!"
2021-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The house is so beautiful, well-kept, and clean. We had an amazing family weekend trip here! 6 adults and 5 children went on the trip and we had plenty of space. Great amenities. Outside deck is super comfortable. Bring your own charcoal for the charcoal grill there is no gas grill but the charcoal grills work great! The private beach is perfect to swim in. I recommend beach shoes to fully enjoy the lake. Whenever we reached out to the owner she messaged us back quickly and even came to the property when we need assistance with the Kayaks. The property is secluded but with a 10 minute drive there’s a lot of establishments close by. Overall, great experience!"
2021-06-01,5,Group trip,It was great!
2021-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Peaceful, beautiful, great location/accommodations & lots of fun!"
2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,A wonderful little place to relax and re-energize.
2021-06-01,5,Group trip,Gayla’s place was exactly what we were looking for as a Memorial Day gathering place. Thanks so much!
2021-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,Great place for a relaxing time with the family.
2021-05-01,5,Group trip,Gayla's place was excellent. It fit our needs perfectly. We loved the few days we stayed there and would definitely recommend it.
2021-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The view of the lake from the deck was stunning. We enjoyed watching the birdseed the sunsets!! We loved the big kitchen table, it was great for card playing. We had a fun stay. Gayla was a wonderful host."
2021-04-01,5,Group trip,The pictures don't do it justice. It was so much more than we expected!
2021-04-01,4,Stayed with kids,"Great stay for adults, cabin is nice, and the lake view is beautiful!"
2021-04-01,4,Group trip,Bring your kayak & fishing pole and get ready for some beautiful sunsets from a beautiful home.
2021-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great location and host is very responsive - typically messaged back within 30 minutes. Breakfast items were a nice bonus. Great place for fishing :)
2021-03-01,4,Stayed with kids,"The location is spectacular and the view is beautiful! We met family friends for the weekend and the kids loved the loft! We spent a lot of time fishing and enjoying the deck and fire pit. The neighbors were also very friendly, which was a bonus, made us feel very welcome! Gayla responded quickly to any questions, provided items for breakfast, which was much appreciated. Check in was super simple. We had a great time and will definitely stay here again if we get the opportunity."
2021-03-01,5,Group trip,"The cabin was an awesome experience for a group of friends looking to get away for the weekend. The location was remote, but the cabin had all the amenities required for a relaxing and comfortable trip. We utilized the onsite grill and loved the fire pit. All of the beds were very clean and comfortable. Thanks!"
2021-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,The location was like a tucked away piece of paradise. My family couldn’t get over how beautiful the cabin/loft was! I already have several friends interested in booking. The pictures do not do it justice. Very quiet and peaceful neighborhood. I do recommend staying here! You won’t want to leave.
2021-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is a beautiful home right off of Lake Centralia. There is plenty of space for families of two or more, or large groups needing more of a community living experience, as to the openness of the living arrangement. Do not expect a traditional master bedroom setting. Overall the experience was good and I’m sure the lake is wonderful during the summer months."
2021-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,"I recommend this place for a girls stay at home spa retreat the bathrooms are absolutely AMAZING!!!! Jacuzzi tub and spa showers, it is also a great space for family your family to just chill a bit. There is a little bit of a drive for some complete seclusion and walking trails and such but the deck off the lake behind the house is peaceful and absolutely beautiful. Lots and lots of space in the house for to enjoy to yourself or to enjoy with your group. And there’s even a cute little play area with toys for the kiddos my daughter LOVED that!!!"
2020-12-01,5,Group trip,"Wonderful place to stay. We had a great, relaxing weekend. Definitely will be back!"
2020-11-01,4,Stayed with kids,"Cute place, lots of space, a great play nook for the kids, bathrooms are amazing. A little pricey but enjoyed it."
2020-11-01,5,Group trip,Beautiful view!!
2020-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is a beautiful cabin. Excellent touches, plenty of space. The deck on the lake is amazing. Fire pit was great too! I plan to stay again on my next business trip to the area."
2020-11-01,5,Group trip,"Originally booked for a small wedding, our plans were changed due to the pandemic.
Still this house provided just what we needed: a quiet and relaxed getaway from all the recent craziness. The paddle boat provided fun on the water during the day. The lakeside fire pit was perfect for unwinding and recharging with some Smores in the evening. And the house was furnished and outfitted comfortably for preparing meals and enjoying some family card games.
Oh... And that shower on the main floor was simply divine."
2020-11-01,5,Group trip,Our stay exceeded all expectations. The property and home is huge as well as beautiful. It was perfect for a small weekend getaway.
2020-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The lakehouse was much more spacious than I expected. Gayla was the most hospitable host I’ve ever had the pleasure of renting from. Communication before our visit was fast and easy. She assisted with last minute wedding deco requests and even left a sweet wedding message and gift for the bride. Everything you could need. More than enough linens, all kitchen essentials and all sorts of sweet thoughtful touches. There was even a play area for the little ones!"
2020-10-01,5,Group trip,"We just did a girls weekend at the cabin. Plenty of space, the best sheets, refreshing showers and tubs.. outside is so relaxing, we were outdoors quite a bit! Make sure you catch the sunsets!!"
2020-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The house is very spacious. The kitchen is well equipped and easy to navigate. The showers are as good as advertised. The lake is gorgeous. We loved spending our mornings on the swing on the porch. Great vacation.
2020-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Nice place for a fall respite with friends. Very peaceful and quiet.
2020-09-01,5,Group trip,"Gayla is a wonderful host, very easy to work with. Her home is so beautiful with very unique touches. The setting is also very beautiful. Very serene! I would definitely stay here again!"
2020-09-01,5,Group trip,Great place to stay.
2020-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,The most beautiful house a property I’ve ever stayed at. My teenage kids loved the lake and stylish design!
2020-08-01,5,Group trip,"The place was beautiful! The sliding bathroom door was something to be aware of as it would occasionally get off track and get stuck, and there was no hot tub (as mentioned in the amenities), however despite those minor inconveniences I would definitely stay here again. Everything was clean and the host was very great at responding to messages on time. I plan on coming back annually :)"
2020-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,A unique and beautiful home with an incredible Lakeview. We so enjoyed our stay.
2020-07-01,3,Stayed with kids,"Our stay at O’Brist
Beautiful views, great fishing, warm lake (swim shoes helpful), spa bathrooms, unfinished and odd house
Pros:
Quick responses from the owners helped leading up to stay and while we were there. The house is beautiful with great sunset views. Fishing from the dock was great for me and my kids. We caught tons of pan fish and even a bass and a catfish. The water was the warmest I’ve ever had while vacationing. The bathrooms on each floor were high-end, spa like. A play area in the loft was a nice place for fun on rainy days.
Cons:
There is no master bedroom since no bathroom is attached to any bedroom. There are only 2 bedrooms that are in the basement but there is a loft that has 3 beds. There are no drapes or blinds or window coverings of any sort in the loft. The handrails for the stairs have finishing nails sticking out slightly that hurt your hand as you run your hand along it (Probably will be fixed but the next person’s stay). The sliding doors for the main floor bathroom look neat but are heavy and came off easily, nearly falling on my wife once trying to open it. There was no basement ceiling. The exposed wires and duct work was unattractive but the loose hanging light fixtures seemed a bit dangerous. The swimming area had some sand but a ton of rocks. Swim shoes are a must. There were 8-12 rusted old poles of a former dock sticking out of the water next to the swim/beach area. I also painfully found a sunken pole in the middle of the swimming area with my foot.
Overall, we enjoyed our stay but a few extra details and finished construction would make this place magical."
2020-07-01,5,Group trip,This is a nice place to go and get away from it all. My favorite part was the beautiful home/cabin atmosphere with all the great showers and nice appliances (even a washing machine and dryer). I also very much enjoyed sitting on the back porch and watching all the boats in the lake. I packed a lot of food but now I know that there is a Walmart in Salem just about 15 minutes away to where you could get all your needs. Gayla and her husband were great hosts and could be reached all times!
2020-07-01,4,Stayed with kids,Perfect location to get away for a few days. It was quiet and relaxing. Plenty of room for our family of 8.
2020-07-01,5,Group trip,Great place to stay and watch sunsets
2020-07-01,5,Group trip,"Gayla was there to greet us at the door as we arrived. From the moment we walked through the door, we were met by the site of fresh flowers on the counter and an adorable welcome sign. The wooden banisters, beautiful bourbon barrel sinks, the wonderful view from the dock. Truly an experience that can not be compared. My friends and I felt that every need was met. The cloud-like beds ensured a good night’s rest. Don’t even get us started on the lake. The water was more than fine. We had an exceptional time floating and tanning on the lake. All of the neighbors were warm and friendly. It’s as if we had lived there for years. If Gayla wasn’t booked up until October, we would definitely be back this summer. We truly appreciate the hospitality and beautiful property. We highly recommend this air bnb and hope that your group can have an much fun as we did!"
2020-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This was by far one the the best places we have stayed through Air bnb. We had the most incredible time with our family. The house is just gorgeous and it sits right on the lake. We enjoyed fishing, swimming, grilling, paddle boating, and just a relaxing time with our family. Gayla and her family and wonderful hosts. I couldn’t recommend this place highly enough."
2020-06-01,5,Group trip,The house was clean and Gayla was extremely helpful! Very quick response times and was a lot of help. Everything was as described. We loved our stay and would recommend this to anyone looking to get away for a nice long weekend at the lake.
2020-06-01,5,Group trip,Beautiful Lake front property! Only wish we would have stayed longer!
2020-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay!
2020-05-01,5,Group trip,"Beautiful, clean cabin in the most serene atmosphere on the lake. It was truly a getaway and the whole family had a great time!"
2020-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful lake house! We enjoyed fishing and nightly fires by the lake. The kitchen was stocked with all the utensils need. The bathrooms are what really make this place, especially the one in the main floor! We were blessed with a beautiful weekend and we took full advantage of the nice outdoor space. Thanks for a wonderful stay!"
2020-04-01,5,Group trip,"What an awesome property!
Thanks Gayla, the guys loved it!"
2020-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,Wonderful and peaceful place to stay with a beautiful lake view. A great place for families to unplug.
2020-01-01,5,Stayed about a week,The cabin was so amazing we booked a second week.
2020-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The place is amazing!! Along with the fantastic rustic wood features and floor to ceiling fireplace, the house is very roomy and I love the upstairs loft. If you like fishing, bring your poles. This is a great fishing spot!!"
2019-11-01,5,Group trip,Gorgeous space with a great host! We will be coming back in no time!
2019-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great cabin for a relaxing weekend. Sunset over the water from the back porch was amazing. Super clean and spacious
2019-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We had a lovely stay at Gayla's lake house! Everything was cozy & clean. We would happily stay there again.
2019-09-01,5,Group trip,"We rented this cabin for my 45th birthday weekend get away! Great location! The lake veiw and access is amazing. The fish were biting!
The whole family was able to enjoy themselves.. From toddlers to grandparents.
Gayla is an amazing host!
The updared spa showers are the BEST!
WE WILL BE BACK!"
2019-09-01,5,Group trip,we were in town for a wedding and we stayed here. They atmosphere is great and very relaxing. The house seems to be under some renovations but would choose to stay here again! Gayla was a great hostess and she always responded quickly to any questions we may have had. Lake view is incredible.
2019-09-01,5,Group trip,"This was by far one of the best lake houses I have ever stayed at. Gayla was super nice and kept in constant contact with us to make sure we were doing fine. The view to the lake is amazing and the house is to die for! The pictures do not do it justice. The decorations are so cute and homey. By far the best feature is the bathroom on the first floor. You will without a doubt take the best shower ever! Overall, amazing house with amazing features. 10/10 recommend."
2019-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,Gayla was an amazing host and their house is beautiful! We had a wonderful weekend family get away and with 7 of us and 2 little ones we never felt crowded. There was something there for everyone to enjoy!
2019-08-01,5,Group trip,The O'Brist is fantastic. Went for a fishing trip and bachelor party. Lake was great and the house was everything we could have hoped for.
2019-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This house is quite large, and well kept. The bathrooms are roomy and comfortable. We had a lovely time, thank you!"
2019-07-01,5,Group trip,"A wonderful place to sit back and relax with family in the well appointed open design post and beam home or on the large deck overlooking the lake. We enjoyed our early morning coffee while watching activity on the lake.
The bathrooms are high tech and amazing.
Gayla’s hospitality was so welcoming. We would highly recommend this beautiful home."
2019-07-01,5,Group trip,The lakehouse is beautiful. Gayla was a wonderful host.
2019-06-01,5,Group trip,Best weekend ever!
2019-06-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"This place is pretty amazing. The location on the lake perfect, nestled right on the lake. We do a family guys' trip with my two sons and grandson every year, and chose Gayla's place this year. We will be back next year. It was exactly what we were looking for. The house is new to the airbnb world, so there are some MINOR things to work out, but nothing that stopped us from having a ball.
Gayla is an amazing host who greeted us upon arrival, showed us around, and was available any time we needed anything.
The bathrooms are almost worth it in themselves. One of the best showers you will ever take.
The space is a loft-style arrangement with three beds upstairs, and a bedroom in the basement. As mentioned above, the space is new so this could have been a temporary situation. There was also a bed in the living room, which will probably end up in the very recently finished basement. Couples looking for privacy might want to keep that in mind or inquire further. That being said, the beds were very comfortable and we all four got great sleep every night.
The place itself is a marvel of carpentry. The beams, and steps, and rails, and floors and supports are quite the sight. Very homey.
The porch is just wonderful overlooking the lake. And the fire pit is a great place to spend an evening. Just beyond that is the dock where we kind of got sick of catching fish. We had such a good time swimming and fishing there. They also have a paddle boat you can take out. The kitchen is fully functional with modern appliances, garbage disposal, convection oven, stainless steel fridge and dishwasher.
All in all, we had a wonderful time and are looking forward to next year."
2018-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,You will love it. You will love Gayle. Please don’t take all available spots.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Our family needed the perfect space to gather and to have time together,a place that encompassed all we enjoy,listening to music,relaxing,outdoor time,fishing,cooking,all with a palette of such beauty in the background that is Tadpole Point… we could not have found a more perfect place to call home for a moment in time…"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We stayed for the 2024 Eclipse and the location was exactly perfect to witness the event. The kids had a great time fishing off the dock and even found a Skink sun bathing. We played records from the collection on hand the entire stay. The location on the lake is great and the many boaters passing by all waved so it seemed like a very friendly area. We didn't have much time to interact with the locals or see the town this trip but I'm sure we'll stay again. Given the location we did not expect much in the way of connectivity, however Starlink was setup and working so we had a good enough connection to upload videos, pictures, and watch online streaming when we were not out enjoying the lake."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,Perfect family vacation. Kids caught over 400 fish in four days and all from the dock and deck at the house. Felt very safe to have the kids outside all day with the whole peninsula to ourselves. Weather worked out great too!
2024-03-01,5,Group trip,Better than the pictures! unbelievably beautiful! The decor was very cool. House was clean!
2024-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,The pictures didn’t do this place justice! Absolutely beautiful. Being from the city I loved that you were able to see stars. Would definitely stay here again!
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I almost can’t put this AIRBNB into words. It’s an adult playground. Hot tub, paddle boards, beautiful views, fire pit with lake views all around, amazing interior decorating, and so much more. I tried to hang out in different parts of the property, and I still didn’t get to hang out in all of them! This is 100% the place to stay if you are looking for a nature getaway."
2023-10-01,5,Group trip,The place was great! We had a great time.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We had the best weekend at Mallory’s lake house, this is a magical place to stay. We loved it. 10 out of 10 would rent again! Thanks Mallory!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Mallory's place was a great place to get away and unwind. Will be telling folks about this place for sure.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This place is the perfect lake house! Besides the breathtaking views, you can do it all. Swim, boat, have a campfire, swing, nap in a hammock…it’s perfection. My family had the most amazing time and made lasting memories. The house was very clean and the kitchen was completely stocked with everything we needed and more."
2023-06-01,5,Group trip,Mallory's place was absolutely beautiful. We loved all the eclectic decor and the set up at the point was perfect for watching both sunrise and sunset. We loved our stay!
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Beautiful views. Spotless home. Super private. Lots of wine glasses. So many little spots to sit, think, read, drink, socialize."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Honestly, the pictures undersell it! The house itself is fantastic — tons of space considering the relatively small footprint — and the views just can't be beat. If I could dream up the perfect little lake house, this would pretty much be it. A place I will long to come back to.
Our family of 5 (6, if you count the dog) had an amazing time over the course of our 5-day stay: we swam in the lake and soaked in the hot tub; used the paddle boards to explore the quiet inlet; caught fish from the dock; played games on the sun porch, including countless rounds of foosball; cooked cozy meals and roasted s'mores; enjoyed family movie nights on the living room TV; and put together a Star Wars puzzle on the dining room table that we left behind for others to enjoy.
There's not a ton to do in the surrounding area, but on our last full day, we did leave the property for a while to explore Centralia, where we played disc golf at Foundation Park, grabbed some ice cream and drove by the Carillon."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,Awesome location! Beautiful view of the lake. Great setup with multiple sitting areas outside right on the main point in the middle of the lake. Hot tub worked great. The inside of the house was well maintained and decorated. Lots of amenities. And Mallory was very friendly and responsive. We would definitely stay here again!
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The views from every window, the peace, the lake, the furniture and beds… everything was absolutely perfect! Will definitely book again when we are in the area!"
2023-03-01,5,Group trip,Relaxing weekend away at a beautiful and relaxing location. Super cozy house and great amenities. I can’t wait to come back one day!

2022-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,We loved this house and are planning another trip hopefully this summer
2022-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Our stay at Tadpole Point was incredible! We ended up being there for the first snow of the season and the snowy views of the lake were so beautiful. The wood burning fireplace made it extra cozy and we love that we could enjoy being outside in the snow with the hot tub. The amenities and extra touches throughout this cabin were amazing. We especially loved the fully stocked kitchen and fresh squeezed juice option for mimosas. Mallory and her Mom were excellent hosts. We will definitely be back!
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Amazing view!!!
2022-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Absolutely breathtaking! The photos don’t even do it justice!

2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"After a bad start of our end of summer vacation at another property (it was dirty and not maintained well) and a last minute booking thanks to Mallory, we were very excited to end up at this beautiful lakehouse. It lived up to its listing description and exceeded our expectations. The house was clean and very inviting, the decor beautiful but still very comfortable. Our kids loved jumping in the lake from the private dock and we loved watching them from the hot tub overlooking the dock - paddleboard was a hit too!"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We really enjoyed staying at Tadpole Point! The home is beautiful and the amenities were perfect. The inclusion of multiple decks overlooking the water, paddle boards for guest use, and the fire pit made it a desirable rental. Highly recommend!"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had the most amazing time at Mallory’s home! We were truly able to unwind, have fun & make memories to last a lifetime. We spent hours floating in the lake and relaxing on the hammock. We also had a lot of fun in the hot tub, playing foosball & watching movies. We also just really enjoyed being in Mallory’s gorgeous and beautifully decorated home. A few days away from our busy lives was just what my family needed & we really hope to return!"
2022-07-01,5,Group trip,Mallory’s place is awesome. Very charming and has incredible lake views on 3 sides. It was perfect for our family gathering.

The attention to detail was exceptional in every sense, especially with regard to the aesthetic and amenities. Our kids will always remember your very special piece of heaven, so thank you. We would absolutely love to visit again to experience the winter and fall! --Sally, Kevin, Sandy, Zoe, Will, Lucia and Mundo"
2022-06-01,5,Group trip,Wonderful experience! My family and I were very comfortable here and the panoramic view is amazing!

2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Amazing rental! We enjoyed the beautiful lake views from the hot tub and hammock. The house was spotless and we had everything we needed. Mallory was professional and helpful.
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What an absolutely gorgeous spot on the lake! It’s on its own little peninsula for privacy, you can hop in the lake for a swim or a paddle right there, and the house is impeccably furnished and kitchen well stocked. The cherry on the sundae is Mallory is a wonderful host. Can’t wait to go back!"
2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a very relaxing time in this beautifully comfortable home. Mallory, the host, was very accommodating and friendly, and made our stay that much more enjoyable. My teenage son loved the loft bedroom as his own hang out space. The views at sunrise and sunset are so peaceful. The home is decorated beautifully and has everything you need to enjoy your stay. We loved our few days there, but would have loved to have stayed longer. We will definitely be back in the warmer months!"
2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Wonderful place to stay! Relaxing, cozy and had everything we would ever need."
2022-02-01,5,Stayed one night,It was a nice place.
2022-01-01,5,Group trip,"Great place! We loved it! Stayed with a few guys to hang out, play some board games and just get away for the weekend. We loved the hot tub and the wood burning fire place. If it was a little warmer we would have spent some time outside on all of the decks or on the water. What a view! Mallory was very flexible offering to work with us when a few of our group got Covid and had to back out but we were glad we could still make it work.
Would not hesitate to stay again and plan to!"
2022-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,"There is so much to be thankful for about our experience at the lovely accommodating lake house these past few days. I’m pleased to say it was very comfortable, clean, and welcoming. Seeing the calm perfect view of the lake all throughout the home was breath taking and incredible to watch everyday. We had a great time using the hot tub that’s literally located close to the lake. It was simply peaceful and relaxing while enjoying the fresh air of the outdoors. We were very grateful for the other amenities such as the use of the full kitchen with some nice surprises that came along with it. Also providing us the use of the laundry room, sun room with games, and best of all starting the wood-burning fireplace. It’s nothing like sitting around a warm tranquil fireplace on a cold winter night. Having it going while watching a movie with the family near the beautiful tall Christmas tree that was also up. I can go on and on about the wonderful time my family and I had during our stay at this gorgeous home. Thank you for opening up your vacation lake house to my family and many others. It’s a perfect place for a family to spend quality time together. Also for doing everything you could to make us feel right at home. We look forward to staying again maybe sometime in the summer. Thanks again for making us feel so welcome!"
2021-12-01,5,Group trip,"My family and I took a different spin on how to spend our holiday’s this year. For the first time ever we spent it away from home and as an immediate family. We couldn’t have been any happier choosing Mallory’s lake house. The scenery was incredible, the house was comfortable and clean. We will definitely be coming back to enjoy different season here!"
2021-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Great place! Even in the winter time, this lake house is beautiful and so cozy. And the view is gorgeous. We would definitely stay here again!"

And if you feel like just relaxing, there are many options for that too. From the hammocks to the hot tub, you get nice views all around. The hosts were so helpful and very nice, answered all our questions without a problem. Definitely will return!"
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Mallory's place was as pictured and portrayed. Every one of my friends who stayed here loved the details and the openess and private tranquility of the space and area. We made full use of the lake a hot tub during our stay and would defintely come back again!
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place is absolutely amazing!! The views alone are worth the trip. If the outdoor space and lake recreation were not so perfect for me and my son, I would have never left the comfort of this beautiful home. Mallory’s impeccable sense of style and care to detail are obvious throughout. The furnishings are eclectic and above all, very relaxing, and the house is well maintained and super clean. With so much to do and see outside, I will have to book my return trip in the cooler months to enjoy all the indoors had to offer (including a fire in the wood burning fireplace)!!
Outside we enjoyed fishing off the dock, napping in the hammocks and of course a bonfire and s’mores after dark. Mallory’s mother and cohost Sherryl lives next door and was a delight as well. She was so friendly and welcoming, and she even showed my son how to find worms in her garden so that we didn’t have to drive to town to get more bait.
We checked out Centralia and found it to be charming, especially the historic downtown area where we stumbled upon a fun winery (Crooked Creek) with live outdoor music. Overall, I can’t say enough about this place and the community. It was just what my son and I needed before school started, and we can’t wait to return very soon."
2021-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Mallory was a wonderful host, she was very responsive and kind. Her her lake home is beautiful and perfectly positioned for enjoying the outdoors or relaxing inside with stellar views. We had a lovely time and would definitely come again."
2021-08-01,5,Group trip,"This house was perfect! My family of 11 stayed here for a long weekend and it could not have been more perfect. We enjoyed swimming in the lake, relaxing in the hot tub, napping in the hammocks, and star gazing near the perfectly placed firepit. The house was clean and offered all of the essentials we needed for our stay. The outdoor area was large and provided us with so many things to do! Mallory and her mom Sherryl were wonderful hosts and helped us with anything we needed. This place is a must-stay and we all cannot wait to stay here again!"
2021-08-01,5,Group trip,"A very relaxing lake house. We enjoying the beautiful views, all the hammocks, peaceful atmosphere, bonfire, and fishing. The house was clean and ready for us on short notice since we booked last minute. I would recommend."
2021-07-01,5,Group trip,"Awesome stay at Tadpole Point! The property has stunning lake views with modern upgrades and amenities. Super clean, organized, and comfortable for our party of 12. Mallory and Sherryl were responsive and kind. Unparalleled hospitality. Can't wait to go back for longer than 2 days for some boating and lake activities."
2021-07-01,5,Group trip,"This lake house is all that and more! With carefully curated vignettes of style scattered throughout the inside to the gorgeous potted hibiscus on the dock, the tiny birdhouse in the tree, and the antique horse statue nestled at the point, our time spent at this beautiful home on the lake was a delight to behold inside as well as out. Watching the sunset from the hot tub and hearing the laughter of kids tubing by, relaxing in the shade as the fisherman in the boat off the point beams and chuckles at catching his “biggest fish at this lake ever” and taking an after dinner stroll along the driveway where the kind neighbor waves hello and asks “where y’all from”, it was clear this was the perfect spot for our family to safely relax and unwind. Paddle boarding on the lake, fishing off the dock, playing games around the table, cooking together in the well stocked kitchen and roasting marshmallows over the bonfire was just what our family needed to reconnect with each other after so many months spent apart! Mallory and Sherryl were very welcoming and responsive to any and all questions posed in spite of unexpected medical issues that arose in their family sphere. We love, love, loved our stay and hope to be able to return again sometime soon!"
2021-07-01,5,Group trip,"Mallory’s place was lovely for our group trip over the Fourth of July! There was plenty of space inside and outside for a ton of different activities, and the location really can’t be beat. Mallory was super responsive to all of our questions throughout the stay. I would definitely recommend her house for any family or group trip!"
2021-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Walking into this lake house from 100 degree weather was like heaven, the central air never felt so good ! And it was so nicely decorated and thoughtfully put together . But being outside grilling and being by the lake with the kids was everything, We wanted to enjoy our summer with our family and kids in a beautiful private area in a safe place and that’s just what we did . This space was the perfect size ,very clean & had everything you could think of and more . Don’t hesitate to book!"
2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Wonderful stay at this absolutely stunning lake house. On every dimension, the stay was 10/10. Nice for relaxation/holiday, but also a good setup and network for getting some work done."
