A few good restaurants in town as well. We hunted which was also great. Would definitely stay again and recommend over and over."
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Really awesome place, very homey and clean. I did have a few things to mention but didn’t feel like they affected the rating. There’s a house or apartments directly behind the air bnb, I think they share the same lot but a few times people walked from the street through the driveway to the back and we were a bit cautious because they walked by our vehicle to do so. Definitely not the end of the world but some people don’t always have the best intentions so we did try to keep an eye out for our vehicle more than if we were to have a private driveway. Also the water heater is maybe turned up a bit high my daughters burned (nothing serious) their hands a few times not paying attention. Last thing the bed closest to the living room is so LOUD. Lol anytime you turn it creaks and groans. These things arent anything that would keep me from staying again but just thought they’d be worth mentioning. Anyways very clean, kitchen has anything you’d need. Loved the breakfast nook and games. Thanks!"

2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"If a SUPER DUPER HOST level existed, Justin and Reba would definitely have earned it! The house is simply amazing! Justin and Reba have thought of everything, and I do mean EVERYTHING, to ensure an enjoyable stay. My cousin and I rented it for a 2 night stay, and we will DEFINITELY be reserving this same place again. The home has been beautifully redone, is very nicely furnished, and Justin and Reba are fantastic communicators. This is a place to return to time and again. Before coming, bring a copy of your favorite recipe to copy to a furnished recipe card for the home's recipe box. Nice touches everywhere! SIMPLY WONDERFUL!!!"

2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"I want to start off by saying I read others reviews. I grew up in Ponca my whole life till I recently moved to Texas. Where this house was located was certainly not in the “ghetto” or “hood”. It was in a very nice neighborhood considering the side of town it is in. The back yard was perfect for our two dogs and the house itself was a nice size for the 4 of us total (2 adults and 2 dogs). I can understand others review on the noise but that’s just normal staying in a city. There is kids next door that play outside when school is out who were super sweet and friendly which would be great for those who stay with kids. The house has everything you could need while you are there and Suzanne was very responsive if you need her. This was my first time staying in an Airbnb and by far the best decision I made. I will no longer stay in a hotel when I visit and make Suzanne my first call in the future. Ps. It’s sooooo cutely decorated and LOVED the shower. Plus, loved the snacks and water."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,The house is pretty nice and very clean. Yard was small but my dog still loved it.

2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I made a last minute trip and Suzanne was very easy to work with. Because it was a hasty booking, I didn't read carefully and didn't realize there wasn't any stovetop/oven. There is an electric cooktop available. Suzanne had coffee and snacks and that was a lifesaver! And a huge Brita for filtered water, which I really appreciated.
The road was a little busy even late at night but my white noise app helped with that. Definitely worth the cost."

Suzanne was extremely responsive and nice. The one tissue on the living room floor was the only negative when it came to cleanliness. But, that’s not bad at all. It was a bit noisy at night. We heard lots of loud cars/motorcycles and the train, along with talking from the street. But, Suzanne can’t control those things. We enjoyed our stay."

2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Matthew was attentive caring and on top of it. This was a great space and we will stay here again next time in town!!! After explaining we had a kiddo with allergies, and inquiring about animal stays. He made sure to check the previous breeds out for us and changed air filters before we got there. The kitchen was well stocked with all the things I needed to make a big yummy dinner including the use of the grill on the back porch. If we were forced to do both pro and cons. . Our cons all would be out of Matthews control. ( barking dogs all night) and I believe there may have been an inconsiderate guest or two that may have smoked in the home previously. Our nose was sensitive to the smell around the sectional. Overall, so glad to have this option in the PC area when we stay in town."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,The first thing I noticed when I walked in the house was how clean it was. The house was so cute and cozy. It was big enough for my family and the dogs. All beds and couches were very comfy. Quick drive to the lake and the local shops. The backyard was so relaxing. The house has absolutely everything you could need and then some! My family loved all the games. And the fully equipped kitchen made it easy to cook at home so we didn’t have to eat out every meal. I would absolutely stay again! Matthew was a great host and answered every question I had so fast! The only thing was the neighbor had their dogs out all the time and they bark a lot. They are sweet dogs but it really scared my dogs at first and it took a bit for them to all become friends.
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Wonderful stay! Me and my siblings stayed here as a reunion and it was a wonderful experience.

We did most of the cooking during our stay and found everything we needed already in the kitchen. The hot tub was an added bonus that was perfect in the evenings.

It felt much larger than you would expect. The host of the cottage was exceptionally thoughtful and accommodating, making sure that everything was taken care of and that our stay was comfortable. The house was stocked with anything one would need to feel at home, and I was impressed with the attention to detail that the host had put in. If you forgot something from the medicine cabinet, there was no problem as it was stocked. Get stuck on a Sunday when the liquor store is closed? Not a problem as there were plenty of option stocked along with coffee for Monday morning. The kitchen cabinets were loaded up with anything you may need. Everything was just extremely well organized. No elaborate check-out routines. Highly recommend and hope to return!"

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"This is the third or fourth time I’ve rented here and it continues to be the best choice in the Ponca City area! Don’t delay on booking because they stay pretty fully, but the location is perfect, the house is always clean and well cared for, and the quietness and setting is beautiful. I’d give 10 stars if I could."
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"With a lot of options in Ponca City, I chose this one because of its location. It was undoubtedly the best choice! The location is on the edge of town so you’re minutes from everything but it’s quiet and in a relaxing setting. The home is extremely well kept and very clean. The owners were exceptional to work with and made things very easy. After my initial stay, I ended up needing to extend my stay and fortunately they were able to accommodate the request. They’ve added an enclosed carport which will be wonderful to protect your vehicle too. Truly, you won’t find another Airbnb that is nicer in the area! It’s perfect."

There was a storm that blew part of a tree down in the front yard, when we got back late that afternoon, the was already removed.
The home is away from all the noises of the city, but only 5-10 minutes from anything would want. Also, if you asked Shelley for something specific, I’m sure she would do her best to accommodate.
Shelley and Eric were available at anytime without imposing on our trip.
The home is a single level with easy access for anyone who has trouble navigating steps.
The view is very relaxing, especially out back.
If you are coming to just get away and relax or for a special event, this is perfect. Shelley strives to make your visit perfect.
I have stayed in quite a few homes and I can say this visit exceeds the rest by miles. I would highly recommend this stay."

2022-04-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"I first just want to say the house is beautiful and looks just like the pictures. The host was wonderful and very communicative, willing to help, and a fast responder. The only downfall was the location. It wasn’t located in the best neighborhood and there is a train track right behind the house with a train that runs all night long. There is a sound machine located in one bedroom but I’m a very light sleeper and unfortunately didn’t get much sleep during my stay. Overall, we had a great time."

2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We had a great stay! The house was very clean, nicely furnished, and cutely decorated. Suzanne was easy to communicate with and very responsive.
The street/neighborhood location wasn’t the nicest, but we didn’t feel unsafe and would come back again. The window in the living room did not have blinds and only very sheer curtains, so we hung a blanket from the curtain rod to give more privacy at night.
One other note—there are train tracks right behind the house with multiple trains day and night. We were traveling with our toddlers and had white noise machines that helped drown out the trains at night so it didn’t bother us, but would recommend white noise or ear plugs.
Overall the house had everything we needed and was a very comfortable place to stay!"

2024-01-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,"Nice small house with a garage and backyard. Definitely an older home thats been worked on and to good success. The house is cozy and well laid out with everything in reach and comfortable furniture.
I usually stay at AirBnBs when I bring my dog, a German Shepherd, with me and he was very comfortable in the home. The only real concern I had was the low fence that lined the backyard and borders the neighbors who also had a large dog. The unhappy posture from my dog and theirs, paired with a fence that ends a few inches of each of their heads meant I always kept my boy on a leash while I was back there.
But beyond that, the neighborhood is quiet in the mornings and easy to walk and I always felt relaxed when I called it a night."
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Quaint and just the right size for my mother in law, me and my new baby! Kitchen was clean and the beds were very comfortable.

The neighborhood was a little rundown but we felt perfectly safe with the locks and security system that was in place.We had a couple of small needs (i.e. light bulb & battery needed) and James was prompt to fix those items. We so enjoyed our stay. As older adults, the two bedrooms were just what we needed. Thanks James & Victoria."

If that was not enough, Jim and Cheryl were the kindest hosts. They knew that my husband and I were newlyweds, and when we arrived at the cabin, they had set up the sweetest gift of champagne, chocolate-covered strawberries, a card, and a personalized picture frame.

2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Our little family stayed in the cabin for a small weekend vacation to see the lake and it was everything we wanted and more! The host was incredibly helpful and friendly not only greeting us but giving recommendations to places nearby. Everything was peaceful and the lake was close by and incredible. If ever you want to just get away for the weekend to enjoy nature and silence, or you need a beach day, this is the perfect place to go! We look forward to being back again soon! Additionally, being able to bring both of our pets made the vacation that much more relaxing. (:"

2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We had a lovely stay at this cute studio cabin in Kaw City. We came for a family wedding in nearby Ponca City and loved the peaceful stay here in Kaw City. we enjoyed a morning on the beach and had plenty of time to get back to the cabin and rest for the wedding.
The cabin was well stocked and the hosts went above and beyond to accommodate our family. 🕊️"

And if I would rent it a nice and comfortable place again"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"The pictures didn't do this house justice. At almost 100 years old, it's a beauty! It is also exceptionally family friendly and has little surprises all throughout that I found charming and unique."
2024-06-01,5.0,Group trip,Great spot to stay!
2024-05-01,5.0,Group trip,Shelley was an outstanding host. She was above and beyond making our stay comfortable and even left some delicious cake to welcome us. The house was very nice and we loved the games and things to do everywhere. There was even a closet of things you can have if you need it. Would definitely stay again.
2024-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"What a great time was had by one and all in this beautiful home. My Children, Grandchildren and I really enjoyed all the little extras; there is so much to do on property we rarely wanted to leave. We just stocked the fridge, cranked on the BBQ and had a wonderful week of fun. The swing, hammock and games were a hit! My 4 year Granddaughter loved having her own play room. I really enjoyed the fact that the master bedroom is large and tucked away, so when Grandpa got tired, I would go and relax while everyone else kept having a great time. We really enjoyed our time and hope to return next year. Thanks again Shelley, the kids ate all the cookies!"

The house is fantastic!! We slept 7 adults (3 couples and a single) with 2 small children very comfortably. Shelley has taken great care to decorate the home beautifully with nice furniture and antiques, comfortable beds with well stocked bathrooms and kitchen. The gaming systems, arcade game and other entertainment is a nice touch.
The big backyard was a huge bonus, my oldest granddaughter loved the swings and we made good use of the fire pit.
I hope to stay here again!!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This place is a gem. We had a fantastic time staying there with our children and grandparents. There were toys for the kids, lots of space, beautiful backyard.

I would definitely recommend this place (or Shelley) to anyone!"

2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This place was just want was needed for a fun and pleasant stay. When we arrived there was a cake sitting there for us. By far the best stay.
2024-03-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"Shelley was a very gracious host. She made sure we were well taken care of. She had a little welcome cake sitting out for us which we thought was very sweet. The house was lovely and the back yard - amazing. It was too cold and windy for us to enjoy but it would be spectacular in the summers - or even just warmer - less windy weather :) . My only problem was the flight of stairs to the amazing upstairs bedrooms was very steep. A little too much for this older lady with knee probs. However, there was a nice little bedroom with a TV downstairs and so it all worked out perfectly. I highly recommend this property. Great for a family gathering. We came to welcome our new Grandson to this world and being so comfortable was very nice. Thank you, Shelley!"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This host went above and beyond. We booked it for a fun night for my daughter’s birthday and arrived to find a bouquet of birthday balloons waiting. Really nice extra thought and it was so clean and cozy

2024-02-01,5.0,Group trip,"We literally cannot write enough nice things about this Airbnb. We came to town for a family emergency and as soon as we messaged with Shelley, even before we got to the house, we felt right at home. The house itself was clean, had all amenities we could need, and had so much space. Shelley even left us a little cake at arrival. The house was easy to find, fun, and we started calling it ""home"" almost immediately. Shelley left very clear instructions and check in / check out was a breeze. The house is also very close to amenities and has a nice big backyard with a firepit. We can't recommend this place more and hopefully we will be back!!"

This host was the best I have seen! The house was old and quirky and dripping with character and charm. There were notes with instructional info on everything! It was so helpful. There were games for us to play in our very little down time, mini golf, basketball, a giant swing, and a ps4 all ready to go. Drinks were in the fridge and monkey bread was on the table when we got there………..so cool! At night we relaxed on the deck out back by the fire pit.
I hope there is another tattoo convention in Ponca Next year so I can come back to this house!!!!"

We were greeted with fresh homemade pumpkin/chocolate chip bread and friendly notes and instructions. The home had games and things for my kids to do.

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"Katherine was an awesome host. She is quick to respond to requests usually within a hour. This location is downtown which made it easy to find activities, restaurants and entertainment. This location is exactly like the pictures and description. The washer and dryer was a plus. Plenty of board games and reading material are available. Kitchen was well stocked with pots, pans, utensils and as a pleasant surprise was stocked with various snack items. We will definately stay here again.
Stan & Linda"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"I have stayed in a lot of Air B and B properties and I really thought this was one of the best. They had thought of everything that one might need if they were at home. There were even spices in the cabinet, shampoo and conditioner, laundry soap, extra pillows and blankets, and coffee. The location was great for me as it was downtown and close to my family’s location. I feel that the hosts were very responsive, helpful, and went above and beyond to make our stay comfortable. I highly recommend this place as the price is super reasonable and the place was amazing."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Katherine’s place was such a beautiful place to stay. It felt vintage in a way because she had some awesome things in her place that were dated to the 50-60’s. Everything was there and available. The check out instructions were clear. The only issue we had was the living room tv remote was not working. We used a remote from one of the rooms and it worked just fine and we also downloaded the app and that worked just fine as well. Overall a beautiful stay and I would recommend it and stay there again!
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Great place, just as described. Really enjoyed the outside area."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"What a great stay! The host is amazing, responsive, and had great recommendations. The place felt like a cozy home. There are a few steps to get into the place, but well worth it. We would definitely check this place out again in the future."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Lovely space. Quiet and peaceful. Train runs by twice a day but not at awkward times and the noise was never an issue. Everything was clean and organized. Cute decor. Easy walk to the coffee shop. So glad this historic building is seeing new life. Parking was free and right in front of the door
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This was a great place to stay! Easy check in and out. Great location in downtown that felt safe. The place was clean and cozy! Great for a weekend get-a-way or to stay for an extended amount of time with amenities.
2023-05-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"The space was lovely - clean, nicely decorated and comfortable for 4 people. We were in town for a wedding, so didn't spend a lot of time in the apartment, but the location was very convenient for us and had nice shops / restaurants within walking distance. The beds were comfortable and it was quiet. My adult son stayed with us one night and the sofa bed wasn't too comfortable for a 6' guy, but guess that's to be expected - probably better for younger kids.
Owner was very responsive - the only issue that I made her aware of was moths kept getting in at night and she was going to have taken care of."
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,great place to stay in ponca!
2023-02-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"The lack of mentioning the 28 steps one must scale before getting to the unit’s door was very much not appreciated. If I had known that before reserving, I would, without any uncertainty at all, have chosen a different place to stay. I was actually fairly angry when I opened the building’s door. Navigating the stairs with a large stabilizer boot and luggage was ridiculously hard. By not mentioning the 28 steps, I felt liked I had been ‘lied to’ in a sense. Other than the unmentioned 28 steps in and out each time, this was exactly as depicted."
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great little place and Katherine was a gracious host!
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay. Worked great for our weekend trip.

2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We loved the apartment. it was a clean and an inviting environment. There's a lot of thoughtfulness and little things to make the apartment feel so welcoming, like the k-cups and snacks. We would stay again."

2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,very clean and comfortable!
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is a very tidy, cozy and cutely-decorated apartment!! If you have trouble climbing stairs, it may not be for you, but it is a wonderful place to stay!! Katherine and Aaron went above and beyond to fix the garage door so that we could park our motorcycle safely and out of the weather. They definitely didn't need to do that, but it was very much appreciated! If we head to Ponca City again, we will definitely include this place in our potential rentals!!"
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Very clean, comfortable, and accommodating!!"
2022-05-01,2.0,Stayed a few nights,"You have to go up a lot of stairs to get to apt.
Convenient location
Could have been cleaner"

2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Love this place so much! Feels like home! Tons of thoughtful touches! I would live here if I could!
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Needed a place to stay and work remote for a week. The apartment was very clean, well stocked with kitchen utensils, and quiet. We did not use them other than checkout, but the washer and dryer are newer than the checkout. Excellent value for the money. Note-there is one flight of stairs, so you will need to be able to go up those. Also, we found it added to the experience, but there are several trains that go by several times a day (and night) two blocks over, so keep that in mind if that will bother you. Plenty of free parking."
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Excellent carefree and delightful “apartment up the stairs.” Perfect location for downtown Ponca City. We’ll return.
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place!

2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Great place to stay. Super clean, easy check-in. Will certainly keep an eye out for availability next time I am in town."
2021-11-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Overall, very nice. I thought it was a little pricey but the location was where I needed to be. Fully stocked, clean. There were a couple of lights were out, 1 in the stairwell (kinda important) and another in the master bath shower. Didn’t feel critical enough to notify or request immediate maintenance. Showers showed age and appeared dirty but smelled clean. There was a constant drip from the hall bathroom sink. The master bed was not up to par for the price paid. When laying on the mattress, you roll to the center. The comfort of the bed is a big deal for me."
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Really neat apartment and beautifully decorated. Very clean and has a nice kitchen if cooking is your thing. I needed a last minute place to stay after a change of plans for work and I'm so glad this place was available. I checked in around 11 at night, but Katherine's instructions were very clear and I had no issues finding the place and getting in. It's right in the hub of downtown, about a block from a good cafe and two from a nice brewery. The train tracks are nearby, but i sleep like a rock and was never awoken by them. Nice place!"

Had to get ahold of host and it was super easy and all went well.
Highly recommend!!"

2021-09-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"The apartment was clean and furnished nicely. The 28 stairs were somewhat of a challenge for the other person in our party bc of physical constraints—she managed though. Being on the second floor kept traffic noise to a minimum. Overall, we enjoyed our time there."

,,,"We were not made aware of the mouse droppings she said we’re found “that morning” while they were cleaning, yet we found them in the bedroom windows, a ton on top of the fridge and in the drawers. The trash can was broke when we arrived, the cabinets don’t stay shut, there was sticky stuff on the floors and the handle you use to Open the window in the kitchen. We found Gerber baby yogurt melt packages, candies, crayons and misc other trash under the ottoman and in the couch. The neighborhood is awful, our friends said we were in the hood. Loud dogs next door tied to the clothes line. Loud local traffic on road in front of house. No fans in the house and it smelled like dog inside. Suzanne was very nice and accommodating until we decided to cancel because we have a 23 month old and a 5 month old we did not want staying in those conditions. Then she tried saying the broken trash can was our fault and attempted charging us for another nights stay even though she said don’t rush out, I want to make sure you have some where to go and we said we are staying tonight but will check out first thing the next day. She even messaged the next day and asked us to let her know when we checked out in which we had already left and followed check out procedures correctly. Make sure to take pictures of everything when you stay somewhere so you don’t get the blame and it would have been nice to be made aware mouse droppings were found before our check in time so we could have decided for ourselves if we wanted to cancel prior to arriving."
