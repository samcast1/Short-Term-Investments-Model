2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We stayed in Room #1 which was beautifully decorated, spacious, and spotless. Eryka keeps the kitchen and bathrooms well stocked with essentials needed to comfortably stay several days. Couches and bed were very comfortable, and backyard seating area was beautiful! I wanted to use the gym (love Peloton!) but we were so busy visiting family, sightseeing, and shopping. I will absolutely book this same location the next time I’m in town to visit family."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,My family enjoyed staying two evenings here. Our dogs loved the spacious backyard. It was a pleasant place for us to sleep.
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We enjoyed our stay. Eryka was responsive and helpful. Would stay here again if I’m in the area 🙂
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Very clean and lots of nice thoughtful touches. Very comfortable bed. Gorgeous back yard oasis with comfortable furniture under a large gazebo, beautiful lawn, a gas BBQ and fully fenced secure yard for the dog. Quiet neighborhood near the college. Will definitely stay here again."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Arrived and the instructions to enter made it super simple. The place is immaculate, not to mention the privacy of the backyard that I spent hours in just enjoying the yoga section. The morning of my departure I woke up and used the washer and dryer included and enjoyed the beautiful backyard while my cloths finished. To be priced so low this place is a hidden gem. Overall I am definitely adding this to my favorites to stay when in the area!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"I loved staying in this pristine, beautifully redone apartment. Apparently the Jungalow is one of three apartments in this remodeled home, but it was hard to tell anyone else was there. It's very private and quiet, and the backyard is huge! I really wanted to have more time to hang out there--there's a gorgeous pergola with comfy seating, as well as a porch swing hanging from a tree. You can tell the landscaping has also been redone, and it's gorgeous. The interior is tasteful and comfortable, with a subtle travel/jungle theme. The bed is great! The kitchen is compact and very well equipped--I was only there for one night, but if I'd had time, I could have cooked an amazing feast. Appliances were all new and the ones I used worked well. There are laundry facilities too. Since I have family in the area, I will definitely book here again--I think a longer stay would work really well in this sweet, centrally located place. Such a great find!"
2024-06-01,4,Stayed with a pet,"Very clean and beautiful space , Eryka is very responsive,nice backyard for dogs to play , I liked"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"We needed a place for visiting family and Michelle's place was perfect! Michelle is professional, caring and kind. She handles the administration efficiently, and she takes care to ensure her guests feel a warm welcome. The studio is cozy and inviting, very clean with thoughtful details such as electric car charging and laundry. We won't hesitate book again or to recommend this property."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Although I didn't directly speak with her, Michelle's instructions were clear. I was met by a pleasant lady who let me into the unit and was helpful in answering any questions I had. The area is very quiet and well maintained. The interior of the apartment has everything you need."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Michelle is super friendly and easy to work with. Her space was exactly as described. She had nice amenities like cereal, milk, juice, snacks, coffee, tea. We really appreciated plenty of clean towels. It's a nice home feel in a quiet and beautiful neighborhood. We'll happily stay here again."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Wonderfully comfy and convenient, especially appreciated the EV charger!"

2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This was her second time staying with Michelle. Always a great place to stay. Would recommend.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Michelle’s place is clean, quiet, and in a very beautiful location! The bathroom and kitchen were stocked and the washer/dryer in the suite was a great addition! Michelle is a kind, responsive host. There is EV charging, we did not use it but another great feature! The proximity to the vineyards is unbeatable and Michelle’s recommendations for local food was appreciated. The town does close earlier (8-9pm) as stated in the description but we never felt rushed or like we did not get the chance to see a vineyard or grab food. Overall, a fabulous stay!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"The house is in a village and it takes a look to drive past at night, the landlord has a special light on and is easy to find according to the house number.
The house has everything and is fully furnished and great for a family foot.
We arrived in the middle of the night before, the next day the clothes were drying in the washer, half an hour late, leaving at 11:30, and the host came by specifically to remind them to leave because the hygienic staff had arrived, so it was important to stay on time to leave."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed about a week,Exactly as described!! Clean and well supplied with amenities. It was a quiet and very comfortable place!
2024-04-01,5,Stayed over a week,Michelle and Lee were quick to respond to any of our needs. They were gracious hosts and we were happy to stay for an extended time.
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Room was quiet and comfortable…a perfect combination when traveling. Small touches like milk in the fridge for our coffee was so appreciated. When traveling to the beautiful central coast, this room will make your stay great. Be sure to see the views of the Santa Maria Valley at night on Telephone Rd. The nearby vineyards and well groomed produce fields are beautiful to see."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place! Michelle was a great host.
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We felt comfortable in this lovely above garage studio apartment. We got to utilize the car charger with our rental, and the neighborhood was SO quiet, outside of the town of orcutt next to farms. I really appreciated the snacks and blackout curtains being available. I think something I was not expecting was to enter through a portion of their house (just a hall of closed doors), but we felt bad because the dogs would bark when we entered. It must not bother the host! We plan to move to the area, and were happy to interact if we had gotten the opportunity. Nice little spot to get some rest. :)"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"Absolutely excellent, highly recommend! Great value and an amazingly hospitable host!"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place would stay again

2024-02-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Michelle's place is great. It had everything I needed and there was even a LG washer/dryer in the unit (a first for me on Airbnb). The place is charming and in a quiet residential neighborhood just outside of Orcutt. Michelle is very responsive and it was truly wonderful staying there. My dog loved it too!

2023-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Michelle's place was a great place to stay.
Having a small kitchen, full bath, and a loveseat to relax on was just right!
Also, it is near Orcutt, which has some great eateries and places to try some wine or grab some local brew.
Michelle was great and easy to communicate with. I definitely suggest this airbnb."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,Such an amazing place to stay at and had absolutely everything that was needed. Felt right at home.
2023-10-01,3,Stayed a few nights,The studio was cute and cozy but was noisy with people coming and going thru same entrance. Also couldn’t get the stove to work.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Very cute, cozy, beautiful. Unfortunately a car hit a power line and all the power went out. Luckily we had flashlights and lamps. My toddler was having too much fun playing with the flashlights in the dark."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"I loved my stay; thank you!! As a college student waiting around all day, it was a great spot to study and do remote work!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Michelle's guest suite was a great place to stay! It is tucked away in a picturesque neighborhood with mature trees and open space. It was really nice being able to bring my dog. He and I enjoyed a couple of neighborhood walks going exploring. Michelle gave very helpful directions for checking in. Parking is ok but challenging with more than one car. Just fyi, the stairs you take to go up are wooden, steep, and narrow. The suite was cozy and comfortable. The bed matress was nice; not too soft or firm. The shower and bathroom were clean and worked well. The kitchen was very nicely stocked, it would be easy to make any number of simple meals with the electric stovetop and microwave. Michelle also included some snacks and breakfast items! I would be glad to stay here again."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed over a week,Our stay had all he comforts of home. We had the amenities we needed and very convenient getting to highway and local restaurants and shopping in Santa Maria. We visit family in Orcutt CA every year so we will be booking here again.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a great stay at Michelle's place. The space is well equipped and comfy. Neighborhood is quiet. As mentioned in the description, it's best to get here by car as the location is not particularly close to the main area attractions. Recommended!"

It was nice to explore quaint Old Orcutt and take in the beautiful views overlooking the Santa Maria valley."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,Great stay; would recommend.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"Michelle and Lee are wonderfully gracious Airbnb hosts! The instructions were thorough and helpful, the room truly lovely and inviting, the amenities divine and the EV charger was a godsend to us after a day of driving up from San Diego to escape Hurricane Hillary--as was Michelle, who couldn't have greeted us with more kindness nor spoken more welcoming words when she told us to ""take our time, enjoy your meal together in Santa Barbara--it's self-check in and we're very relaxed folks around here"". They've earned our 5-star review. The only issue was that the bed is a bit soft and tilted us downward at the head. That said, we would absolutely book with Michelle and Lee again in the future. These are lovely people in a truly peaceful and lovely location!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Michelle’s place is heavenly! I needed a place to just be in peace. Michelle’s place gave me that. During my whole time I slept like a baby! Thank you!
Also, I was able to work in the morning and visit the region on the afternoons. So, not only wonderful for visiting wine region but also for some WFH."

2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Always love staying here. It is perfect for my travel needs.
2023-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"It’s the little things that make a fantastic AirBnb stand out … like finding milk, fruit juice, breakfast cereal and snacks waiting for us so we didn’t have to grocery shop as soon as we arrived. Located in a beautiful, peaceful neighborhood yet conveniently close to everything, I’d highly recommend this stay for anyone visiting the Santa Barbara county winelands, stopping by the Santa Maria area, or on your way north or south. Excellent value for money with everything you need for a short or longer stay."

2022-12-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"I enjoyed 2 days at Michelle's Studio above the garage. A good, quiet place to relax, cook simple meals, do laundry and chill in front of big screen TV with Apple TV and Xfinity cable & WiFi.
Mattress could be firmer, there was some noise from the main house and garage but quieted down at night.
Enough space for 1 or 2 people, electric induction stove top (no oven), kettle, microwave, toaster oven and toaster. Washer/Dryer and provided detergent worked great to catch up on laundry after being on the road.
Nights were cold in Dec but Michelle provided extra blankets and the gas heater in the unit worked well.
Quiet with large trees around property. Upscale neighborhood on a hill overlooking the Santa Maria valley; Trader Joe's, Walmart and lots of restaurants less than 15 minutes away by car in Santa Maria. You need a car."
2022-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We stayed for 6weeks and enjoyed it a lot. Michelle is very quick to respond to any messages and to help out with any questions you might have. The apartment was very clean and even got professionally cleaned once a week, we appreciated that a lot.

Definitely hope to return."
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was by far one of the best AirBnB stays I’ve ever experienced. Michelle thought of everything! She sent a note beforehand with detailed instructions for arriving and accessing the lockbox. There was a basket of snacks, tons of cereals, coffees and teas, and the fridge even had milk, yogurt and more snacks! There were full sized toiletries in the bathroom, and tons of towels and washcloths. The bed was super comfy with nice pillows and a nice fluffy comforter. Michelle gave us her personal cell phone number in case we needed anything, and also provided dining recommendations! She was literally the best host you could ever ask for. I would 10000% stay here again!"
2022-08-01,5,Stayed one night,Easy and pleasant stay'
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a great time staying at Michelle's Airbnb. The Airbnb is a guest room by the main house. It is more than spacious for two people, with a mini-kitchen and bathroom. The Airbnb was also perfect for doing work. It was also extremely well-equipped with snacks, filtered water, coffee, etc. We stayed in Santa Maria due to the proximity to locations such as Solvang, SLO, Pismo Beach, etc., and we definitely had a great time here."

The host also had the kitchen stocked with snacks, yogurts, juice, milk and cereal, which is such a thoughtful touch.

2022-06-01,5,Stayed one night,One of the best airbnb experiences I have had! I travel on business and need peace and quiet as well as being comfortable. Decorated and treated with care! This was the perfect place for me! And close to stores and restaurants and the freeway.

2022-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Perfect place to get a great rest.
2022-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"We were in California to celebrate our 20th wedding anniversary, and Michelle's place was a blessing to find, especially at last minute. We had been staying at a chain hotel, and it turned out to be less than we had expected - so we left after the first night. Needing only one night, I never thought I'd find anything on AirBNB, but tried my luck and found their place. It is above the garage, so perfectly secluded. The bed was lovely, and Michelle adds many personal touches that delighted us. Snacks, breakfast items, milk in the fridge to go with the coffee, OJ for my hubby, toiletries, and very soft bedding! I did not take advantage of the combo washer/dryer, but that was a perk for sure. The stay was quiet, and fuss free. Directions were clear and easy to understand. We were so much happier to stay here than the hotel."

2022-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,Really great place with all of the essentials. The door is a little challenging to lock but not really anything that can be done about it. Super friendly hosts and very quiet location not far from anything you’d need. Central to Orcutt and Los Alamos.
2022-05-01,5,Stayed one night,Had a wonderful time at Michelle’s place. We had left our cheese picnic knife in the kitchen and Michelle was so kind to allow us to come back after check-out to retrieve it.

2022-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"Located in a nice and quiet neighborhood with great parking. Nice room with bathroom, kitchen and dinner table. The bed and pillows were comfortable. We slept well and enjoyed the cool breeze coming thru the windows at night."
2022-04-01,5,Stayed one night,Hard to find reasonably priced lodgings in Los Olivos or Solvang but about 30 mins up the road we enjoyed this roomy above-garage suite for the same $ we would’ve paid for a crappy hotel in Solvang. Our stay was brief and we didn’t need much but Michelle made us feel like she was available for anything we may have needed.
2022-04-01,5,Stayed one night,Great private room with great amenities

My husband & I were so incredibly grateful to have such an wonderful, comfortable, & warm space to retreat to after a stressful move! Michelle made check-in so effortless that even our completely stupefied brains were able to access the property & park with ease. haha
My husband greatly enjoyed the rest of his stay there on his own for work, appreciating how attentive Michelle was when necessary while still providing privacy. The amenities Michelle provided were a blessing, the studio was well stocked, everything was extra clean, & the bed was comfortable. Michelle even warmed the room for us prior to arrival, what an Angel! 🥰❤️"
2021-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"Michelle’s place is very clean and easy to find. Before we arrived, Michelle sent us very detailed instructions. We arrived a little bit late but no issue with self checkin. They have a big light turned on automatically when we arrive, which made it easy to find the entrance and self checkin. She is also kind and thoughtful to prepare snacks and beverage. They even have Apple TV in the room! We’ll definitely visit again in the future"

2021-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"Perfect guest suite for our overnight stay. The space was very clean, which is something I’m usually pretty critical about. Parking and check-in were easy and the property was just a short drive to Los Alamos which had some nice places to eat and shop. We didn’t utilize the kitchen at all, but it seemed to have enough amenities to make a light meal if needed. Thanks so much!"
2021-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"Unexpected gem! Southern charm in every way. We really appreciated the thoughtful light breakfast accommodations.

2021-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Our little family had a wonderful stay at Michelle's guest suite!
Located in a beautiful hillside, southern-style estate, the suite contained all the right accommodations for our stay. There were lots of thoughtful touches and it was even equipped with a washer/dryer combo that was also very helpful for our travels.

2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place is a find! We stayed here for a weekend of wine tasting in Santa Maria and Los Olivos and enjoyed the freeway proximity, without the traffic noise. Michelle had a house filled with extras in the refrigerator and food pantry and included shampoo/conditioners. The bed was comfortable and the ceiling fan was perfect that the AC did not need to be put on, although that worked quite well."
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Michelle is an Excellent host. The unit was in an excellent location - convenient to many things to do in the area. I would definitely stay again !

2021-08-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"We enjoyed our stay at Michelle's place. The check-in and check-out was really easy. The snack basket was an appreciated touch. There were lots of towels, pillows, etc. However, the WiFi was spotty, the place was pretty loud (someone in the house seems to start working at 5 AM), it smells very strongly of the dog, and the kitchen was only stocked for two, when there are four of us trying to eat a simple breakfast. It wasn't too bad for us, since we didn't spend too much time, and it was overall a good place to clean up and rest for the night between our day trips to Santa Barbara and San Luis Obispo."
2021-08-01,5,Stayed one night,Great place to stay! Great service and wonderful accommodations. Very comfortable and homey.
2021-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"Beautiful neighborhood, they were great with our pet, super clean."

2021-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,I would stay here any time. Somehow every amenity or even small thing you need is all right there. The pictures just can't capture how well thought out this place is. I highly recommend staying here if you ever get the opportunity!

2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Michelle's room is very comfortable and well-priced for your stay in the beautiful Santa Maria area. I traveled with two other girlfriends and the room was plenty large, beds comfortable, clean, quiet, with easy access to the things we wanted to visit in the area. Michelle's touches of snacks and light breakfast was unexpected and nice, and I would definitely recommend her place and the easy check-in process."
2021-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"Place was great, exactly what you see online. Michelle was great with communication and we had no trouble finding the apartment. I was only there with one other person but there could easily have housed more people. Everything in the studio was for our use like spices, toiletries, even laundry stuff. Great, clean place and I would definitely come back."
2021-07-01,4,Stayed one night,"dope house, gave us a goodie basket and made us feel at home 10/10"
2021-07-01,5,Stayed one night,The location was great. The space was perfect and the hosts went above and beyond!
2021-07-01,2,Stayed with kids,"This place is pricey for what it offers. I understand place is pet friendly, but I expected the cleanliness to be good as they charge steep cleaning fee. Surface looks clean but the curtains were dusty and we found bunch of dog hair under the bed. We had to clean the floors ourselves after checkin. I got really bad sinus allergy after staying here. Bed was not at all comfortable. My husband and I got bad back after sleeping 2 nights on that bed. The kitchen has very minimal supply. Would recommend bringing necessary pot, pan, laddle. AC doesn't work effectively,had to keep the windows open at night to help cool down the room."
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Want an affordable, quiet and relaxing place to stay within driving distance of all the Central Valley has to offer? This place has it all! The place is the cutest studio with everything you’d need to have a great trip-a true home away from home. Very clean, nicely decorated and quiet. We really enjoyed the town, too. I highly recommend this little apartment and plan on returning again!"
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great studio apartment with everything you need, even a washer/dryer! Plenty of towels, too. Very quiet location but not close to anything. Stores and restaurants in Orcutt are a ten minute drive away. The hosts are awesome, they go out of their way to be helpful!"
2021-07-01,4,Stayed with kids,Michelle and Lee are very nice and responsive hosts. The place was perfect for us as we needed to just stay for the night. Our kids enjoyed playing with their cats. They also had a well stocked kitchen and made the most of the space with all kitchen items one would need for their stay.

2021-07-01,5,Stayed one night,Great place to stay!
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great upstairs unit, exactly as pictured, super clean, host is very responsive and checks in regularly. There was most noise than I expected with the door rattling when there were doors closing downstairs, but something I got used to quickly and probably something you wouldn’t notice if you were with a bigger group/had music or TV on. Town is small but very close to wineries, close to highway exit, cute house and very quiet neighborhood."
2021-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"Clean and comfortable condo with everything you need. Michelle prepared some snacks and drinks, which is very thoughtful. Would love to visit again!"

2021-06-01,5,Stayed one night,We were just passing through. This was a good clean place to rest our heads.
2021-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Our only complaint is we didn’t stay longer! This little place was so cute and had just the right amount of space for myself, my boyfriend and our dog. The property was beautiful and they had a parking space right outside the entrance. We really appreciated the heads up about places in town closing up a bit early, and the front yard was okay for our pup to take bathroom breaks which was a huge plus. The room was clean and had little snacks and coffee/cereal if we wanted it, and the fact that there was a little stove and fridge (and basic essential things like cups, utensils etc) was so so great. Thank you so much for having us!"
2021-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"This place is amazingly! They have a lot of perks: snacks, small kitchen, towels, etc. The room was clean and well organized. I would most definitely stay here again!"

2021-05-01,2,Stayed one night,The place was clean and well appointed. The queen bed was too soft for my liking. The biggest issue was the noise of people coming and going until 1:30 am. Not a restful stay.
2021-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"A nice couple rooms with a pretty modern kitchen and bathroom.
Kitchen has a large fridge which we were pleased to find some goodies provided to us for free. Stove top and pots/pans made cooking meals easy.
Host was attentive very quick to respond and let us borrow something that we had forgotten to bring with us. Wifi was fast and reliable.
I'll certainly stay here again if I find myself in the area once more."
2021-04-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Nice place with everything you need & more. Boisterous household below, booming voices and slamming doors; Shared entry. However, the middle of night is peaceful."
2021-04-01,4,Stayed one night,"We enjoyed our stay, this place is very tidy and has anything you could need. The little things in the fridge (orange juice, etc) were really appreciated. The bed was also very comfortable. The only odd thing was that in the middle of the night someone downstairs decided this would be the time to open and shut every single door over and over again and it was very loud...but this could have possibly just been another renter of the downstairs unit, which wouldn't be the host's fault. We would definitely stay here again if we are in the area, it is a great deal for what you are getting."
2021-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great location and great value.

I didn't have a lot of time to sit down and conversate with them, but what little conversation we had was nice, and I would stay with them again."

2023-09-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Tina and Carlos are very friendly and helpful. They allowed me to check in earlier and were always available.
The room used as a gym is currently a bit crowded, may be due to the construction work that is currently taking place in the annex. However, you won't be bothered by them.
Great place to grab in the driveway!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,Tina and Carlos had a very nice place in a quiet residential community on a cul-de-sac. We arrived late at night and were able to let ourselves in. We only met Tina the next morning. She was very friendly. Our stay was brief but comfortable.

2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I had a month-long stay in their peaceful neighborhood and abode. Although my daily route from Santa Maria to Lompoc was quite a bit of a drive but the it doesn't matter as long as it's safe and affordable. I was able to bring packed lunches, stored it in their fridge for a couple of days, and heat it up at dinner, quite a saving. ;-) You can use their kitchen and dining area as well."

2023-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Tina & Carlos’ place was very clean and everything was exactly as described. Our room was right next to the kitchen and living room so if you’re a light sleeper (like us), I would recommend getting one of their other rooms further down the hall. Overall, the family’s very friendly and the home is great so definitely come check this place out."

2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,great comfortable stay! just what i needed and was looking for!
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I got to meet them, they are wonderful loving folks. There place was wonderful, and quiet, out in the country, judging from the location it would be a perfect place to catch a Vandenburg Space Launch. I have caught many launches when working near the base, Tina and Carlos's place would be marvelous, as a crow flies maybe 10 miles away.
Would stay there again! If available, it's a great place, security door, own room key, shared bathroom tub and shower, and it looks like they are adding a bigger section to the home. I hope it's for Air B and B use! Thanks again Tina and Carlos!

2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,It was great staying there. It did feel like home very clean comfortable and quiet
2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"Airbnb was extremely clean and well-organized. The space was spotless when I arrived, and everything was in its place, making it easy to find whatever I needed.
One of the things that really stood out to me was the space heater. I visited Santa Maria during the winter, and it can get quite chilly at night. However, the space heater provided made my stay incredibly comfortable.
Overall, I would highly recommend Carlos and Tina's Airbnb in Santa Maria. Their attention to detail in keeping the space clean and organized, coupled with its convenient location made our stay great."

I would definitely stay here again while traveling, thank you!"
2023-02-01,4,Stayed about a week,Linens and towels in good shape. Nice people. Can't beat it for the price

It was a chilly night in the area, but I was perfectly content/warm in the bed. The neighborhood is secluded and safe, and not far from the main town at all. I felt much more at ease staying here than at a random motel and would recommend it for anyone else traveling alone to the bay or back."

Between the arcade, games, the pool table and the super comfortable living room there was so much to do that. I didn’t want to leave the house. ￼A few questions I had for Max were answered within 30 minutes of my emails and he was very thoughtful and friendly. I will definitely try to stay here again next time I’m on the central Coast. ￼ between the arcade, games, the pool table and the super comfortable living room there was so much to do that.

It was obvious that everything has been done with lots of love and passion. We would say, that Mark and Christine are setting the standards for what Airbnb should look like. Next morning we had a breakfast prepared by Mark and we ate everything as it was so delicious.
All in all, we were sorry that on our way from SF to LA we can only stay for one night.
It is needless to say but we have to, we highly recommend Mark and Christine place!"

2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great place in a quiet location with a beautiful backyard.
Mark’s company made the difference, we had a great chat which resulted in us breakfast with the 3 of us (love these pancakes which were an added bonus, also it was Natasha’s bday and exactly what she wanted 😊).
Before leaving Mark came back with a bottle of wine for Natasha bday!
I forgot my coat which he will now mail back, I must have felt at home as I have a reputation for leaving things with family and friends after staying!
This is the perfect example why we prefer private stays over hotels.
Hope to see Mark and his wife when passing through the Bay Area later this year!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,Everything was perfect during my stay. Thank you for having us. The place is just PERFECT

Centrally located to so many cool places. Mark’s signature breakfasts are delicious and the perfect way to start your day. Super comfortable, clean, and safe. We loved being able to relax in the beautiful patio area. This is third stay and we will be back again !"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Mark’s casita is one of the finest airbnbs that we have stayed at. This is our third visit and I believe that that says a lot. Mark is one of the rare host that actually follows the original theme of the Airbnb and provides a very nice breakfast. The bed which is critical to a successful stay anywhere is top-notch. Super comfortable and more importantly, very quiet. (You can get up without disturbing your sleeping partner).
The Casita is in a very safe and secure, quiet neighborhood. And I mean, quiet! You can literally hear a pin drop during the night. The shared yard is very comfortable and inviting with lots of beautiful plants surrounding you."

2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"First off, I want to say that this is absolutely not of the standard. Everything was great reviews that has become the norm on Airbnb. This is an honest, “cross your heart and hope to die”, review of a stay that was truly fantastic.
Mark has checked off all the blocks on the list of things that most travelers want to have in their Airbnb stay. A super comfortable bed with premium linens, premium amenities in the wonderful bathroom, which has a deep soak bathtub to comfort those weary from too many miles on the road.
There is a large closet with plenty of room for suitcases and clothing. Also a nice little table and chairs perfect for enjoying the wonderful breakfast that Mark includes with the stay. Keep in mind that his breakfast is not a handful of prepackaged stuff from Costco. Mark provides thoughtful culinary creations that change from day-to-day.
The beautiful yard that is available for guests is quiet and comfortable, and a perfect extension of this comfy cozy cottage."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,The casita was very comfortable and we felt right at home. The breakfast was delicious and memorable. This was a perfect place for our anniversary and our only regret is that we couldn’t stay longer.
2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"Overall just one of the best stays we have had on Airbnb. Nice, cozy room with a clean bathroom. The bed was also extremely comfortable and we simply slept well.
Mark was also very responsive throughout the stay. We had a little incident where we locked ourselves out at night but Mark was there to assist right away.
Breakfast was amazing as well - We got some extremely delicious omelettes - simply one of tne of the best we've ever had.
A stay we highly recommend."

We booked fairly last minute, and you cannot imagine our delight in staying at such a gem! Better than most of the hotel rooms we stayed in through Hilton at half the price. We will definitely be looking to visit again when the weather is better and the beautiful backyard space can be enjoyed! You can tell this host loves doing what they do! And I am a host myself. Really impressed. Thank you, Mark!"

2024-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"This is a total gem — the place is a separate house priced as a room. Inside it's small but comfortable, with very comfy bed.

2023-06-01,5,Stayed about a week,Nice and quiet. We were concerned about a party one of the nights but they quieted down by 11. A few times we didn’t have parking right out front and had to park in his business next door so we had to get up by 8 to move our car. We had a nice stay. Would stay again
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a perfect stay, I appreciate the extras in the pantry and condiments in the fridge. Very clean place. I slept well, it was quiet and comfortable.

2023-05-01,2,Stayed a few nights,"Old house with old furniture, as described. Lovingly decorated in the style of the last century, very nice garden at the entrance and quiet backyard.

2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay for a few days
2023-04-01,4,Stayed with kids,"Overall I would recommend this Airbnb, the hosts were friendly, helpful and responsive. The house is very cozy and has everything you need, even for a 6 week stay like we had. The landscaping and flowers are beautiful, and the home is well appointed with linens, kitchen items, etc. As the home is older the heater does clank and is quite noisy as are the creaky doors etc. The location was my biggest issue, being located in a mixed industrial/business and residential area, this house sits next to an auto body shop and also near an alley. Because it is close to the main areas of town, people would walk in front of the home on the sidewalk, which sometimes brought people yelling etc. and didn’t feel as safe. Unfortunately there was a loud party next door that took place during our stay. It was likely a one-off situation but made for a night of no sleep. One of the neighbors also has a rooster which would crow loudly every morning."
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The place is in a quiet street. The front and back yards are very nice. The rooms are cozy and functional. Host is very proactive in communications. Overall we had a really nice stay.

Home is well stocked ,clean, and they were available when need ."
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Good place to stay quietly neighborhood and felt safe at alll time
2022-12-01,5,Group trip,"The place was great. I would highly recommend the place. The washroom does not have a venting system, so you will need to open the window, also, there is no dishwasher, other than that everything else was great. Would recommend this place."
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great central location - close to everything in Santa Maria, Orcutt and a short drive to Santa Ynez, Los Olivos, and other wine country locations.

2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"You simply can’t get nicer hosts or a more charming cottage. The place is surrounded by a professionally landscaped back and front yard, which offers you a sunny resting spot among all the singing birds. Donna and Herb load the cottage up with all the essentials you’ll ever need, and then some. Everything is homey and clean and just so incredibly charming right down to the claw foot tub to take a long lavender soak in. It’s almost like you’re at the spa! And it’s so helpful that they also offer their washing machine / dryer to clean your clothes after long days spent at the beach! Overall, best place to rent, and you’re in great hands with the hosts too!
Ps- beautiful flowers are sold for $10 along the side of the road leading up to the highway. You should enjoy some!"

The clawfoot Bathtub is super cute however be careful getting in and out and don’t grab a hold of the curtain for any reason.
it is mentioned in the little instruction book that the host has put out... just worth another mention from me only because we found out the hard way LOL.

2019-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Herb and Donna’s bungalow was the perfect retreat for me and my daughter. This was one of my favorite AirBNB stays and I will definitely try to stay here on future trips. The bungalow was very clean and well organized. There was an abundance of linens, kitchen, bathroom, and laundry tools available. So many special touches including a vase of fresh Hydrangeas in the master bedroom and a sprig of fresh lavender in the bathroom. There was even a small cooler and ice packs available for a beach trip and a bbq with everything you need to do some grilling. We didn’t use those this trip, maybe next time. The landscaping provided a nice back drop for relaxing on the front porch and the back patio. I could go on and on about how wonderful of s experience we had at the bungalow! I definitely recommend Herb and Donnas Bungalow retreat!!!"

All you need to bring are the meat, vegetables and all the ingredients you need for cooking. No need to bring cooking oil. He has olive oil, vegetable oil, all the different spices. Coffee and tea. If you will be traveling to Santa Maria or around San Luis Obispo, I highly recommend Herb’s bungalow."
2019-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Herb’s place is just as cute as the pictures & incredibly well stocked. The cottage was so clean & furnished to a really high standard. Being able to bbq out the back was a great touch & despite the heat ample fans were provided. Santa Maria itself isn’t what you would call a tourist destination but we travelled to San Luis Obispo & Santa Barbara no dramas. Thanks for a great stay!
2019-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Cute and homey feeling bungalow... close to freeway, shopping, and restaurants. There's no A/C but a nice cool breeze comes in every night so the house can be opened up to cool off and there are plenty of fans provided. Kitchen has all the amenities needed. Love the outdoor space in the backyard. Herb and Donna were so gracious and made sure I had everything I needed for my stay."
2019-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I hesitate to write the glowing review that I want to write, because I fear it will affect availability next time I want to stay there! 😜
I contacted Herb in the middle of the night telling him that I was driving up from LA for the birth of my first grandson. He answered promptly and was very accommodating both with an early check-in, readying the house for our arrival, and flexibility on my dates.
The cottage itself is charming! It is clean and a really nice space to come home to every night. While it seemed a little odd at first to have a bed in the dining room, lol, it worked out perfectly as my 6'4"" took the bedroom with the bigger bed, and I took the ""dining room"" with the smaller bed. It worked out perfectly! And we each had our own private space!
I was even able to make a dessert for baby's homecoming party as the kitchen is well equipped.
Herb was also very flexible and accommodating when I wanted to change my dates and stay longer to spend time with my new grandson.
This is a fantastic value, and a great place."
2019-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"A very neat and tidy home. Beautiful yards front and back. The location is great for eating and shopping, being very close to the center of town.

It’s a great value and I would highly recommend Herb’s place to anyone looking to stay in Santa Maria.
2018-09-01,5,Group trip,Safe place in Santa Maria and nice host. We enjoyed the back patio and their kitchen. The place is perfect for small group. There are towels and bed sheets available everyone. Good for 6 people. Hope to be back again.
2018-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Herb and Donna's Craftsman Bungalow is a lovely California bungalow located in downtown Santa Maria with super easy access to anywhere you want to go in Santa Maria or the Central Coast. The house is spotlessly clean, completely comfortable in every way, and supplied with everything one will need to make themselves right at home. Check in and out couldn't be easier, and we experienced nothing but welcoming friendliness during the entirety of our stay. Thank you Herb and Donna!"
2018-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Stay here!!! Herb went above and beyond in making us feel comfortable and welcome in Santa Maria from the very beginning. I’ll be staying here again! 5 stars!
2018-09-01,5,Stayed over a week,Herb’s place was perfect for our business trip. Great value. Exactly what we expected and Herb is a very friendly host. Would book again!
2018-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful spacious home and friendly host. Great back patio and front porch for relaxing. We hope to be back!
2018-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Herb's house is perfect for a small family. We were a family of 4 and wouldn't have wanted any more or less space.
Donna met us when we got there and Herb was there later in the evening. The house is an older craftsman home as the post says and it is actually very neat and well-sized. Doesn't even creek when you walk around ;)
The porch is nice to hang out as is the backyard in the evening. Herb is very generous with towels, pillows, soap, etc. More than most airbnb houses we've stayed in.
He also provides a wide selection of DVD's, which we took advantage!
Again, the house was not only perfect for all of us but it is centrally located from most central coast attractions that you want to partake.
Would definitely stay here again!"
2018-08-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Adorable Craftsman house! We felt very much at home. Herb was readily accessible for any needs.
2018-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,Great host friendly and available for help if needed. Very fast on communication. Herb even came by with oranges and mangoes for our family. Cute craftsman home with a claw foot bathtub. Central to everything in the area. Great place !
2018-08-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"This is a very romantic, lovely and old house in Santa Maria. We rented it for 2 persons and we had plenty of room. You can use it with up to 5 people. All the necessities were there. Just be careful with food, becaise there are some ants. The book they provided was very helpful with local tips. The house is central in Santa Maria en everything is their. We enjoyed kayaking at pismo, drinking wine and biking in solvang. We had a nice time and would definitly recommend this place!"
2018-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This quaint craftsman style cottage is perfect for a smaller grouping of guests (we were four - though you might fit a couple more). We enjoyed the location being so close to local amenities and to the pool where our daughter & her teammate swam in the Junior Olympics. The home itself has great storage, original windows, a claw foot tub, a laundry room and a little backyard. While the kitchen does not have a dishwasher (it didn't bother us), it does have a full size refrigerator, a microwave, coffee maker, a regular sized gas stove and a basic supply of kitchen stuffs. Being able to cook and store our groceries was really helpful. You will not have to buy coffee (unless you choose to do so), detergent, shampoos, cleaning supplies, or even charcoal for the outdoor grill - Herb provides it all. You will not experience a shortage of towels, paper towels or toilet paper either. Previous guests even leave unused items to be enjoyed by the next visitors. We thought the lack of air conditioning would be an issue but it was not... Herb provides vertical fans in every room and opening some windows to allow the cooler Santa Maria weather to flow through almost made it too chilly. We found the neighborhood to be quiet at night and peaceful. We would choose to stay here again. You would enjoy it too."
2018-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Herb and Donna's cottage was perfect for the 4 of us - my mom, sister, brother n law and myself. We LOVED it there. The cottage is super cute with thoughtful touches, and has a warm, inviting energy. The single bed I slept on was extremely comfortable (I wanted to take it home with me), and my mom said the queen size pull out couch was fantastic as well as the queen size bed in the bedroom. The single bed can really be treated as it's own room as well since there are doors that can be closed to where it is. We found it plenty big enough for the 4 of us, and highly recommend a stay here. I've stayed in a lot of airbnb places and this is one of my favorites, if not the top! Also, Herb is super friendly and very helpful with checking in."
2018-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This cottage is in a great location near the main downtown hub of Santa Maria. Many restaurants are within walking distance. The cottage is stacked with extra towels and linens (good for long haired guests such as myself), a comprehensive collection of toiletries, and even a hair dryer. The hosts are very friendly and informative. I appreciated the binder they put together as a local guide. I hope to stay here again in the future."
2018-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place was perfect for our lil family getaway. Close to everything, shopping restaurants, grocery stores... Herb was very hospitable, he came over to meet us to make sure we were comfortable. The house was very clean and plenty of linens, towels, toiletries, etc.,., we will definitely be back..."

Bringing baby blankets for the baby was such a heart warming gesture. Communication was outstanding and responses from Herb was quick. Location was perfect as Its located near many restaurants, mall and grocery store. Definitely will stay there again when I’m in town."

2018-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I love the small town feel to Santa Maria. Staying at Herb's airbnb 1920's Craftsman bungalow enhanced that vibe. When I was in elementary school I had friends who lived in classic Craftsman houses and I wanted to live in one ever since. There is a sense of history living in a structure that has been standing for over 70 years. Looking around the home you can see the quality construction. I particularly liked the big tub you could take a bath in. It's deeper than the current day shower/tub enclosures. You can lay back and relax in the old school tub.
I loved the location. It's on a quiet street in a quiet neighborhood. I bought fancy laminated glass dual pane windows and heavy sound deadening drapes but this place is much quieter than mine. I wake up in the mornings to the faint sound of birds in the distance. Another plus is this place is blocks away from one of my fav bbq's The Swiss."
2018-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Herb was very friend mase it a point to introduce himself and for us to hava a comfortable stay. He also shared aome history on the craftsman home and the the next one to it. I definitely wouldn't mind staying here again.
2018-05-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Good location.
2018-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Loved the house! Great location and it was quiet and clean. We’ll be staying again! Thank you, Herb/Donna."
2018-05-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Herb is a great host. Truly cares about his guests. Also is an amazing house with a great central location. Not too far from the beach and for an affordable price. I highly recommend staying here.
2018-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We had a great stay in this charming small house. It was perfect for our little boy to crawl around and everything was provided for our comfort, including the pack and play all set up with some blankets and soft toys for the baby! Herb made us feel very welcome by giving us some great advice on restaurants and activities in the area, and even by including us in some activities of his own. It truly was a pleasure to meet him and to stay in his cottage. I highly recommend!"
2018-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Really nice place, perfect size and super comfy !"

I would definitely recommend this place to anyone looking for a place to stay while visiting the Central Coast."
2018-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,B
2018-02-01,5,Stayed over a week,"Herb & Donna's cottage is a delight. It is charming, with original features & added homely touches. We loved its peaceful, quiet atmosphere, enjoying breakfast & lunch in the garden, and being able to easily walk to shops & restaurants.
Herb & Donna were the perfect hosts, rapidly sorting out a small plumbing issue, & sharing their recommendations & extensive knowledge of the locality.
Santa Maria itself is not beautiful, but the surrounding areas are, and it is a great location as a base for exploring.
We loved staying at the cottage & would definitely return."
2018-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Herb was amazing! He was incredibly kind and organized with keeping in touch with us and making sure we were doing okay. Would 10/10 recommend.
2018-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Thank you very much for all! It was very nice to visit you!
2018-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The house is a stand alone single story bungalow . Furnishings are comfortable rather than modern. Clean and nicely laid out. I really was happy coming back after a day of driving around. In a nice quiet street. Some traffic noise from an adjacent road which dies down completely at night.
Herb and Donna are wonderful hosts and where we had a couple of minor problems went over the top trying to resolve the issues even going so far as offering a full refund which was not accepted or needed. Even then they generously offered another day for free which was accepted albeit rather guiltily as the minor issues hardly warranted such generosity.
Would I stay again. Certainly."

Herb provided real local knowledge and perspective on the food & entertainment. He brought us into the inner sanctum of Santa Maria."
2017-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Our family had to evacuate due to dangerous air pollution in Santa Barbara from the Thomas Fire. Herb was very kind, attentive, and generous during our stay. The neighbors were a little loud two of the days with music but otherwise it was a great stay!"
2017-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Herb's place worked out perfectly for my daughter's stay during her home search in Santa Maria. The place is clean, quiet, comfortable and equipped with everything you need. Extra blankets in the closet and an equipped kitchen were much appreciated...Everything she needed was there. Herb was quick to respond and his hospitality was appreciated!"
2017-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is a very comfortable abode in a nice location. It is near the mall, supermarket and other shopping with easy freeway access (1 mile from ramp). Herb is an outstanding host; responsive, thorough and professional. We look forward to staying here again."

2023-07-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"This home is a great place to stay for the price. Quiet and peaceful home. I would o let suggest have keypad locks on all room doors. I stayed in room #2 and My room could have been accessed by anyone including other guests when I was not present at the home. Door had a standard door lock that could be locked only from the inside or with a key from the outside. The key was not provided to me. Other than that, it was very convenient and met my needs for my stay."
2023-06-01,4,Stayed about a week,"Grace is a great host. His son was there to meet and show us the place. He is also very friendly. Not only is her place incredibly affordable, but it is also a quiet and tidy place to stay. The backyard is nice and adorned with beautiful plants and flowers
It provided the perfect tranquil setting for savoring a delightful breakfast. Additionally, the neighborhood is home to three charming feline companions whose presence brought immense joy to my heart. Witnessing those adorable kitties was an absolute delight."

2022-06-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"The house is quite large,located in a quiet area, the only thing I didn't like is that the doors of each room don't have a key so anyone can enter your room when you're not there, the host told me that they're working on it to improve it, I hope they do it because for me that's essential"
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Very nice quiet neighborhood, excellent central location too! Bed comfortable, TV has a multitude of channels!, I parked in the driveway, off the street.Thank you!"
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Perfect little stay on the way, just what we needed. quiet house, comfy bed, friendly host."
2021-12-01,5,Stayed one night,Great host. Very communicative and kind.
2021-12-01,5,Stayed about a week,"I enjoyed my stay, and the hosts were very accommodating."
2021-11-01,4,Stayed one night,"Exactly as described, and I was able to reserve the room on the same day for a late check-in. I got the clean bed and shower that I desired. Recommended."
2021-08-01,5,Stayed one night,Awesome stay!

2021-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"Super clean, quiet and comfy bed..."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place in a nice location on Highway 1 at a good price!
2024-06-01,3,Stayed with kids,"Very beautiful home, small & perfect for a small family, very cozy and well furnished. There were a few downsides to the home which were; The noise of the rooster at 3:am, the dogs around the neighborhood and not much to do around the area."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,Beautiful place! Comfortable and clean. Loved having baby toys and board games available. The only complaint I had there are no fans in the rooms so it got rather hot. Also the street numbers are chipped off the sidewalk and the numbers on the fence are hard to see from the street at night . Other than that it was an amazing stay.
2024-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Everything was top notch.
There were snacks and coffee waiting for us at home.
There was a big TV with Netflix, board games, and fast internet. Fully equipped kitchen. Everything new, clean, and fragrant. I would definitely use it again. I recommend it to everyone. Great communication with the host. Fully satisfied."
2024-04-01,5,Group trip,At first view thought the rental was too small but once I walked in it was perfect size and everything flowed so nicely. Would definitely recommend this place to anyone looking for a nice clean and private stay. She was very responsive and I enjoyed all the wonderful and comfortable furniture and beds. Great spot don’t miss out on this amazing find!!
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,my GF and I loved the place. definitely coming back again.
2024-03-01,3,Stayed a few nights,"While this house is clean, it is very noisy! There were dogs barking in the middle of the night and a rooster lives next door. You will hear both dogs and the rooster throughout the day. What bothered us the most was this house is part of the backyard of the owner's home, and during our stay they played very loud music in the backyard throughout the day. It was so loud the windows were shaking in the house. My first communication with Ruth was asking about the WiFi as my husband would be working from the home, so she was aware we'd be there during the day. While I understand she cannot be responsible for the noise her neighbors make, she certainly can take care of her noise level knowing she has guests working from home. Additionally, there is no dishwasher in the unit (which was not in the listing when I reserved) and there are NOT enough dishes (enough for 4, not 8). If you want a clean place to sleep, this is great, but if you want to spend any time in the house, I'd look elsewhere."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Very pleased there was parking on driveway, place was amazingly clean, and felt very peaceful."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,Very beautiful place. Very quiet and calm. Place was clean and the rooms looked gorgeous!!
2024-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,Great little place. Rained the whole time we were there so didn’t get to use the outside area.
2024-02-01,5,Group trip,"All good with Amy.
Thx a lot"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Ruth’s place was beautiful and clean! It had many amenities and I would definitely stay here again!
2023-12-01,5,Group trip,"Ruth was a great host that was very responsive to any concerns or questions that we had! The house had ample amenities including enough dinnerware and cookware for the family, lots of extra towels, and board games. The backyard area was simple, but cozy with seats, a fire pit, and cornhole game. Loved the decor of the home. Would stay again"
2023-12-01,5,Group trip,Ruth’s place was immaculate. My daughters were able to watch their fav Hulu / Netflix stations on the large TV when we returned in the evening. Good central location as we enjoyed a day trip to Solvang and got some beach time in at Pismo Beach.
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Excellent stay ,well kept place ,fully satisfied !"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,Very nice and clean host very friendly prompt response
2023-11-01,4,Stayed about a week,This place is lovely and matches the pictures you see. The place is new & the kitchen is nice and equipped. The beds are memory foam and fine but a little hard. Please know that it is a very nice place but neighbors have several large dogs that woke us up in the middle of the nights several nights we stayed there.
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Ruth was fantastic as a host! The house was spectacular and looked exactly what the
images showed. Super clean and had everything we needed. Would definitely recommend"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed about a week,"The place was very clean and comfortable. It was by far the cleanest place I've ever been to Air BnB. The bedding was clean and cozy, and there were enough towels. There were enough utensils and cooking utensils, they were all clean, detergent were prepared, and the sponge was new. There were plenty of toilet paper and paper towels, and the bathroom was clean. It was very clean and comfortable for the price."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We have stayed here many many times and always consistent with the home, glad we found it."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,great place. highly recommend.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We stayed at Ruth’s place on a visit to Pismo beach and Solvang. It is around 20 mins drive from Pismo Beach. House was easy to find, clean and comfortable. Me, my wife, 2 kids and my parents stayed and were very comfortable. Ruth was great with accommodating our requests."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"stayed here before and always feel at home. Private entrance, easy access. Well decorated."
2023-10-01,5,Group trip,Wonderful place! Ruth was very responsive to our questions and needs. Felt like a home away from home.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,Lovely back house with own private porch. Very cozy inside and has everything you need to enjoy your stay ! In a great location near the beach ! Will recommend !
2023-09-01,5,Group trip,"It was a great experience to stay at Ruth's place. She is a great host, asking us how everything was, and if we needed anything. It is a beautiful brand new guest house. Very close to Pismo beach, the pier, the dunes, the dinosaours caves. It was a great experience. Thank you Ruth!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"For the price you honestly can’t beat it. It was only about 10 minutes from downtown Santa María yet far enough away that it was a peaceful & quite neighborhood. While we only stayed in the actual AirBnb for about 3 hours or so everyday (apart from sleeping) I don’t doubt you could be there all day. There was a great variety of channels on the tv to keep you entertained & all the amenities necessary to keep one busy. The outside patio was a nice touch after a long day where you just want to relax with friends near a fire place for a bit or even play some corn hole games with them to pass the time.
Apart from initial check in, check out & some useful information I didn’t talk with Ruth, the host, much which if you’re anything like me is a HUGE PLUS.
Overall it was a great place to stay & a very pleasant experience."
2024-06-01,3,Stayed one night,I slept well the bed was comfy.

Everything was clean, there was plenty of parking (we parked in front of the house).

2023-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"Awesome stay — the place smelled so fresh and welcoming! It smelled like fall and a hint of pumpkin spice. Like a retail store that you walk into that you think “oh it smells nice!” The bed was very comfy (which we needed to rest for the spartan race the next day!), the shared bathroom was immaculate, with great water pressure from the shower. The Lego builds throughout the home were really cool!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"After another booking fell through, we were extremely thankful to be able to book with Christian at the last moment. His home was spotless, and very comfortable, and the neighborhood was perfect for a long walk before bed. We will definitely be staying there again, when in the area!"

2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Christian's place was great. Clean and looks just like the pictures. Felt at home because there no was no uptightness in the atmosphere. Environment was safe , not too far from bus stops or too far away from food and transportation deliverables. I have no complaints at all about the the comfort and wellness of my stay. I do wish they had a microwave. There is a micro convection oven on the kitchen counter which is a healthier alternative. But a microwave for guest would be nice as well. Other than that, my stay was great I'd book again and again."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"We were on our way to Hwy1, here is a perfect and beautiful place to stop by. The location is really quiet!

The location from Solveng was an easy drive and the house is located on a quiet street with parking. The check-in instructions were easy and communication with the host was fast and reliable. The room was exactly as described and the bathroom is down the hall. There was someone else there when we were staying but not sure if it was the host or another guest, so we had to share a bathroom. The room was clean and comfortable and we had no problem using the shower in the morning before we hit the road. Only suggest extra towels as we couldnt find them as mentioned in the check-in instructions but we made do with a towel I had in my suitcase. Again, this is a fabulous stay, comfortable, safe, and reliable. Thank you for hosting us, we would stay again."
