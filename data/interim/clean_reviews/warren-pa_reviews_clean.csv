2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"This private cottage was one of the most beautiful units we have been to, with smooth and clear instructions and amazing view around. Very close to Allegheny National Forest as well. Dean and Ashley were both very responsive to our inquiries and friendly. 10/10"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"I recently stayed at this lovely Airbnb and had a fantastic experience. The house was clean, cozy, and very peaceful, making it the perfect getaway. My son absolutely loved the pull-out couch and found it very comfortable. Our dog enjoyed the great yard, which was a perfect space for her to play. We also really enjoyed spending time on the porches, soaking in the serene atmosphere. Highly recommend this place for a relaxing stay!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Had a blast. Host was attentive and friendly.
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Loved this cottage. It was comfortable and had so many thoughtful, unique touches. Will definitely stay again when traveling for work."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Cozy, clean, and very nice hosts üëç"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"They had everything you could possibly have forgotten or needed while away from home, so cozy and prepared! Would love to come back, great movie and book collection."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"This was my first air b&b experience, and it did not disappoint. The cabin was charming, clean, and I slept really well. Would definitely recommend if this location fits your needs."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,Dean‚Äôs cozy cottage was the perfect place to stay after viewing the eclipse! It was very welcoming and inviting! We had a great conversation with our host about the history of the cabin and things to do in the area! We would give it 10 stars if that was possible! We will definitely stay here again and highly recommend it!
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"We enjoyed our time in the cabin very much. One night was not enough to use all of the amenities. The cabin felt very welcoming, homey ,and had a nice atmosphere. Some properties are bare bones inside, but this had very nice decor, linens, books, and even a record player with a selection of records. The variety of kitchen and bath supplies was impressive and appreciated. We would have enjoyed the fire pit and back porch if we had time. It‚Äôs too bad we didn‚Äôt get a chance to meet the hosts as they seemed nice and generous based on our messaging interactions. We are strongly considering a trip back there when the weather is warmer."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,I‚Äôve stayed at a lot of Airbnb‚Äôs and this has been my favorite so far. The cottage was spotless. I felt right at home and you could tell they had thought about their guests. It was close to all things Allegheny. Loved my stay!!
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Definitely cozy, quit, and peaceful."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed over a week,"My husband booked Dean's as he was working an outtage at United Refinery. He typically stays in a motel, but since the job was at least 2 weeks, he found Dean's Cozy Cottage. He was very comfortable there and had everything he needed to shower ad make meals. Dean is local and stopped by a couple times. He really liked how neat and tidy everything was and the high quality blankets on the bed. He was able to extend his stay easily which saved him from moving half way through a job. He also loved the peaceful setting. He would definitely stay here again."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great stay coming back for our 2nd visit. Would recommend if you are looking for something in the area
2024-02-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Great for a weekend getaway! Close to everything Warren has to offer. Really felt like a home away from home and will absolutely stay here again when we are back in the area!
2024-01-01,5,Stayed one night,Great place while traveling for work
2024-01-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This little cottage is fabulous. We needed a place close to Warren that we could bring our pet with us, Dean and Ashley accommodated us without hesitation. They were very prompt with a response to messages. The cottage was so cute and cozy, I loved the decor. It has two sitting (living) rooms, I kind of took it as a ""His and Hers"". That was perfect. The cottage is sort of at the edge of town. It sits on the corner with a little grove of trees behind it, virtually no neighbors on those two sides, perfect for the dog aspect. The place was stocked with any utensil or dish you need to prepare and serve a meal. Keurig for morning coffee, very convenient. This cottage is only about 20 min. from Wolf Run Marina/Docksiders Restaurant and Kinzua reservoir. Planning on booking another stay in the spring to ready our boat for the summer. This place is a definite 5 STAR rating!"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"Absolutely loved the house, met Dean, super guy, will definitely stay again!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This awesome house was the perfect home base for our quick Allegheny Adventure. I wish we had more time and better weather to enjoy the cool outdoor space around it. We'll definitely be back in the region and this house will most likely be our refuge again.
2024-06-01,3,Stayed with kids,"The home is conveniently located with a lovely yard space. Although advertised as family friendly and suitable for young children, I would argue it‚Äôs not suitable for kids under 2, decorations and toys throughout the home are choking hazards and made for a stressful stay.
As for the specifics of our stay, we were very disappointed in the hosts response to the emergency that occurred. On the 2nd night of our 7 night stay, a pipe burst in the bathroom at 1:30am flooding the bathroom and hallway. We reacted immediately, getting the water shut off, floors soaked up with towels and getting fans on the floor. The host did answer our call and arranged for a plumber the next day but it still required us to do multiple loads of laundry to prevent mold and mildew from growing, as well as spending hours cleaning up the home and constantly refreshing the airflow.
We requested a refund of our cleaning fee as compensation but was denied stating she wasn‚Äôt going to make a profit otherwise."

2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Cassandra‚Äôs house was bright and comfortable. The house has great energy. It is fully stocked with everything you need in her ‚Äúhome away from home‚Äù. There is so much lovely outdoor space to spread out. She provides lots of extras in case you have forgotten something and large soft bath linens are a bonus! The bed I slept in was very comfortable and linens were soft. Our little family cooked meals in the kitchen and even used the fire pit out back for making ‚Äúmountain pies and pizzas‚Äù. You can chill out on the back porch or in lovely gardens wrapped around the house. The yard has lots of privacy but is very spacious. Zen is located just out of downtown with super easy access to every part of Warren and lovely surrounding adventure areas. The garage was great for storing our bikes and yard games during our stay. I can‚Äôt say enough good things about this place. It really made us comfortable in the middle of our 4000 mile road trip from AZ to ‚ÄúBack Home‚Äù, MY home, Warren, PA. It‚Äôs a gem!!!"

2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I was in a pinch and needed a place last minute. Cassandra's place was perfect. I was concerned I wouldnt be reserved in time becasue it says owner has 24 hours to confirm. Cassandra was lightning fast and assured me no problems. Then followed up to make certain we were happy. This was my first time using AirBnB and Cassandra made it so easy. The place was immaculate and perfect for anyone looking to stay in the area. The neighborhood is peaceful and offers a perfect outdoor sitting area to enjoy with the family.
Thank you so much!
Highly recommend Cassandra and this location!"

The neighborhood is really quiet and peaceful. The location is perfect, nearby historic downtown by car and nearby a lot of places of interest.

2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Had a great visit to NW Pennsylvania. The Cozy Eco Zen Home was all that we could have hoped for. Great communication, clean, easy check-in, and as described.

Short walk to downtown and short driving distance to anything else in the area. When I check available dates, visiting Warren, I check Alexxis‚Äô place first. I had a family emergency and needed to extend my stay. Alexxis was very prompt with my inquiry and opened the booking to accommodate my needs so I could stay a few extra days. Thanks again, Alexxis, everything was great and I look forward to staying there in the future.

The firepit out back by the water was a nice touch as well as the TV's in the apartment to unwind before going to bed. We needed to ask for some instructions upon checking out but Alexxis responded within mins to guide us on what to do. The apartment was super clean which was nice. The deck over looking the creek/river (not sure which body of water we were looking at) was awesome too.

There was even a neighborhood cat that stopped by for a visit while we were enjoying the fire. As animal lovers, we enjoyed that. The location was perfect. The neighborhood was quiet after dark. We were within walking distance to several grocery stores, a small park, and various restaurants. My family would absolutely stay here again."

Although you feel like you're ""away from it all"" it actually takes just ten minutes to be in the center of town. We would not hesitate to stay here again."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place by the river
2024-03-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Very easy to check in and hosts were very easy to contact. I was thinking we were going to be more rural, but the location is only minutes from Warren with several good restaurants."

2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Cute place, thought it would be a little more remote but it was very clean and they communicated well. Overall it was worth the price. The location isn't bad, just didn't realize it was so close to other houses. It was a quiet neighborhood though, so no complaints there."
2023-11-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Overall we enjoyed our stay at the Eddy with Paul and Christine, they were very kind and helpful and I would recommend staying with them. I saw in another review of this property someone said ""what you see is what you get"" and this is accurate. While everything was clean (with the exception of a few greasy dishes and an old worn out sponge) the house could use a few upgrades. Outlets are very finicky and trying to charge a phone is nearly impossible, the sofa is broken and the beds are uncomfortable. Again the hosts, are incredibly kind but be aware that ""what you see is what you get"" here. If you're looking for a basic getaway this is your spot, if you want something a little more like home, this location isn't for you."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Very quiet and restful.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Luv this place...will be returning again.

2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place!
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a great stay at Paul and Christine's place. It matched the description well and was clean and comfortable. We enjoyed the short walk down to the river and sitting on the front porch. Paul was around if needed, but gave us our space too."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Fantastic stay. Paul and Christine‚Äôs place is very clean, not a spec of dust. The A/C kept us cool and beds were comfortable. Hosts were close by and responsive. Location is right on the river. We hiked trails in the national forest, did a kayaking day trip, sat around a fire and watched the moon reflection on the river at night. Lovely spot. Thank you so much!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Our hosts were quick to respond when we had a question, gave helpful advice on local attractions , and were good communicators. The property is peaceful and scenic. I really enjoyed my morning coffee along the cute pathway down to the river. The poor weather cut our stay unfortunately short; but I would love to return back to Paul and Christine‚Äôs cottage for another stay."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Great get away place! Just as described, the river was pretty easy access and the place was full of all essentials!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Perfect place to stay and get ready for our cousins wedding! The home was clean and accommodating! Peaceful and serene is an understatement! Most of all, the clear starry sky was breathtaking!"
2023-08-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"We were in Warren to spend a few days kayaking, so Paul and Christine‚Äôs place was perfectly located to explore both the Allegheny Reservoir and the river. We were within minutes of downtown Warren and Allegheny Outfitters who provided shuttle service for our river trip. We thoroughly enjoyed the microbreweries in Warren as well! But it was nice to return to our place to rest and relax and do our own cooking. Everything was very clean and the kitchen was well supplied."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Loved it at Paul and Christine s place!!! Seriously felt like home. *Immaculate* Peaceful. Right in the front and back yard, saw deer, lots of bunnies and a couple otters! Fast wifi. Super cool path, leading to the waterfront, to include a fire pit and chairs! Can't wait to return ü§ò."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Wonderful place, great scenery, awesome host!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed over a week,"It is a wonderful place. Easy to get to, wildlife to view from the porch (which we spent lots of time on). We stayed 2 years ago and hope to stay again next near. Beautiful area. If you re a nature lover there are lots of places to hike and kayak rentals. The town is quaint and welcoming with some great places to at and a few breweries. Not far from Kinzua Dam and Chautauqua Lake area."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,A great place in an amazing location.
2023-07-01,5,Group trip,"My cousins, her dog and I had a wonderful experience! It's in a beautiful location with a fire pit in the yard and a very small walk down to the peaceful eddy on the Allegheny River which had another fire pit. The location is a short drive from town to enjoy the various restaurants and shops. I enjoyed looking out the window each morning watching the rabbits, groundhogs, birds and deer. Paul was a very accommodating host who helped us with anything we needed including getting a full length mirror for our place and building us a fire. I highly recommend Paul & Christine's place!"
2023-07-01,5,Group trip,A cozy cottage in peaceful surroundings. The home was so clean and well stocked as listed. Paul and Christine were very responsive and friendly. A great place to stay !

2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"THE EDDY is a very clean and great space with beautiful scenery. We loved hiking in the mountains and had fun skipping stones down by the river. Paul instantly made us feel welcome again, as this was our second stay here. We will always choose THE EDDY when coming to Warren!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I went for a quiet place to relax and got exactly that. It was an easy check-in and the place met exceeded my expectations.

2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Definitely a great start beautiful area and surroundings great fire pit perfect stay
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The property is like a cabin nestled between the woods and gives off great rustic vibes. The best part is that it is just a few minutes away from downtown Warren but is also hidden away from the busy streets of the city. It also has great proximity to the Alleghany National Forest and other state parks around it. There is so much greenery around with the Alleghany river flowing right behind the property, we were truly refreshed and went back with calmer minds and souls."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,Loved this cozy clean space! The perfect stay to unwind and have some down time. My toddler loved the outdoor bench swing and frolicking in the yard haha
2023-05-01,3,Stayed with a pet,"Ok little house for a short stay. It is right next to the owners property and down the river from a large factory, which comes with the occasional smell."
2023-05-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Hosts were accommodating to our needs.
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Just as advertised. Very clean. Very quiet and peaceful location. Close to everything. Easiest check in I‚Äôve ever had with an Airbnb.
Absolutely no complaints."
2023-04-01,5,Group trip,We love THE EDDY and had a great time. Nice quiet little place.
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"it was a great place, perfectly located and had beautiful views with outdoor fireplaces and so much space inside to host family. truly loved it."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Paul and Christine were friendly and responsive. We had a great time!
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,We enjoyed our time there. Good location for the local park and trail sites.
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The Eddy was as described! Cozy, peaceful setting. Paul and Christine were very helpful and check in/out was easy! We enjoyed our stay very much!"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Wonderful place to stay in Warren! Very close to the town and some great hiking trials. We will be back!

2023-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,A wonderful place to stay! Close to all the family! Can't wait to come back!
2023-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,beautiful view country setting
2023-03-01,5,Stayed about a week,"The place was as described and exactly what we needed to spend time with family. It was clean and stocked with extra pillows, sheets, and blankets. The biggest drawback is the wifi. They have an extender, but it didn't help. I used my cell phone as a hot spot because the wifi wasn't reliable at all. But the place itself is great if you want some peace and quiet, but not far from shopping and local activities."
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The Eddy was comfortable, convenient, and clean! We would stay there again!"
2023-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,We definitely plan on coming back for a spring and fall trip!
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Awesome place to stay at if your looking to get out of town for a couple days
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Paul and Christine have a great place. Very relaxing setup. Close to a lot of outdoor adventures and good places to eat. They make it easy to enjoy your vacation.
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Perfect for my wife and I and two college kids, the house was well stocked with appliances, kitchen items, and various condiments left from other renters. We lost water in one bathroom because it got to -6 a couple of nights and despite leaving the sink on a slight drip, the pipes froze but we kind of expected that. I guess it wasn‚Äôt enough water running, but that was through no fault of Paul and Christine. The house was warm and cozy and the hot air in the house was good enough probably to keep the water going in the bathroom in the center of the house and kitchen so we were fine. Was just a five minute drive to downtown Warren. Nice place, private despite being fairly close to the other houses on the property and the owners communicated quickly."
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great location close to beautiful trails. The home was well stocked with all kitchen needs. Every room was very clean and homey.
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This property was the perfect getaway for quality time with my friends. The property is cozy but has sufficient room for everybody, and is in a quiet spot right by the river. I would definitely stay here again if I wanted a quiet getaway!"
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We had an absolute incredible stay. Paul was very friendly and accomidating. Our stay couldnt of gone better!
2022-11-01,4,Stayed with a pet,Perfect location for our family visiting for a holiday gathering
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Had a wonderful stay at The Eddy - and appreciated the flexibility of Paul and Christine - as we had to come a day early to avoid the crazy snowstorm heading our way to Buffalo. (We came home to 4 feet of snow - we SO appreciated the ability to come a bit early). We got some hiking in at Kinzua State Park, and the trip was just what we needed to unwind.
The cabin had many of the amenities of home so we could cook our own meals; beds were comfortable and we enjoyed the beautiful views. Thanks so much!"
2022-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"The place was clean, comfy, and spacious. Great value in a quiet area by the river, though not isolated (owners are on same lot, a couple houses nearby). We saw some great stars and planets even being fairly close to Warren. Easy check-in and no 10-page exit procedure. Awesome lil getaway!"
2022-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"A perfect getaway! Very quiet, but close enough to any amenities that you might want. The hosts are great, and we look forward to coming back again!"
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"A nice, clean accommodation centrally located for exploring the Warren area."
2022-10-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"great place, just outside of warren.."
2022-10-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Wonderful experience with a great host. Not only did he allow us to drop off a car there a little early so we can explore, but he allowed us to have a fire in the pit in the backyard. He was so helpful from day one to the last night. So kind to our dog and super clean home. I‚Äôll be coming back if it‚Äôs available"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This is a very nice place to stay! Pictures are accurate, the couches & bed very comfortable. Greatly enjoyed using the outdoor griddle. Very clean. Would definitely return."
2022-10-01,5,Stayed over a week,Beautiful place! Very relaxing. Paul is super nice and made our stay very comfortable.
2022-10-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Paul and Christine‚Äôs stay is conveniently located just minutes from town and less than a half hour from the activities we were planning on doing near the Kinzua Dam. It‚Äôs the perfect little spot for exploring the area. The pictures reflect it exactly and the hosts are super friendly.
2022-09-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Cozy home, quiet locale, and easiest check in ever!! Location close to the park but also close to town."
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Had a great time! Very clean and so many things to do and places to hike in the area. The dogs loved walking to the river and exploring. Would love to come back and have a fire overlooking the river!
2022-09-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Great place and owners. Made everything easy.
2022-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Paul and Christine were absolutely phenomenal hosts. We ran into a few bumps that were beyond their control, but communication was as timely as you could need. The property and amenities were exactly what we needed for our family of 4 plus 2 pups.
If you are looking for hosts that are responsive and clean place to rest your head and cook a few meals, look no further than The Eddy. Looking forward to returning next year."
2022-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,We had a great week! Great location.
2022-08-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Great place in beautiful location. Lovely host
2022-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Very clean cabin, always makes a huge difference with a great stay! We met Paul, he was super friendly with us and our dogs. You hear some highway noise during the day when sitting outside but didnt bother us. The house is in a convenient location for exploring Warren, ANF, and Kinzua area."
2022-08-01,4,Stayed with a pet,"The house was clean and well maintained (albeit lacking in sufficient utensils). But I was very disappointed in the location, as photos suggested that the river was clearly visible from the property. It was not. The promised babbling brook wasn't visible through the overgrowth. There is a lovely clearing by the river - but be prepared for a small (not particularly scenic) hike to get there.
It was fine for comfortable place to rest your head at night, but not what we had hoped in terms of a family getaway."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This place is great! Close to town but very quiet... not as accessible to the river as I had hoped, but we made it work. Paul & Christine were attentive & kind. We would definitely stay here again!"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,Excellent!
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This place is the perfect retreat with a mix of nature and modern amenities. We've stayed here twice so far and definitely plan on coming back. Relaxing by the fire pit by the river is much needed after a day of hiking.
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,Beautiful property. The kids absolutely had a blast!
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The location was perfect for the Allegheney National Forest activities and really close to downtown Warren. We really enjoyed this ""home base"" for our first visit to this area."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,Gorgeous location on the river! Peaceful and quietüòä
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Cute and cozy, and sparkling clean! We enjoyed our stay very much!"
2022-06-01,5,Stayed about a week,It was an awesome place and they are fantastic hosts. Very clean with great communication!
2022-05-01,5,Stayed with a pet,The place was just as described! Perfect! Clean snd convenient to what we had planned. Great hosts !
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Everything was absolutely great! From an easy entry and clean home to everything we may have needed in the kitchen, our stay was everything we could have asked for. Besides a little bit of storming to prevent more outdoor relaxing, we were able to make the most of our trip with a great location and a comfortable home to return to!"
2022-05-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"You can walk out the front door to a babbling brook that takes you away from the outside world and transports you to a peaceful, relaxing place that feels like home."
2022-05-01,4,Stayed about a week,"nice and comfortable accommodations. The location of the house is not as private as you'd think , there are two other residents on the property. The smell of oil others mentioned was not an issue. We didn'tnotice it at all. The host was very nice. Our phones worked almost everywhere. We enjoyed the river behind the house as well as the creek right out front. Seen 2 eagles and a lot of deer at the hatchery. Its a pretty place to unwind."
2022-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We had a great time! Fishing access, campfire and a super clean house!"
2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I loved it super natural living with nature, you breathe a lot of peace I recommend it %100 I'm sure I'll come back."
2022-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"It is a nice place to stay if you plan to visit Kinzua Dam and ANF places.
Kinzua Dam is about 18 mins away.
There is a refinery about a mile away so sometimes you can smell gas. Please be advised if you are sensitive on smell.
Overall, it was great experience!!!"
2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place! Thank you!!
2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The Eddy was AMAZING. It was everything and then some. Fully stocked, comfortable, homey, relaxing...You felt right at home!"
2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great experience and place especially for the cost. Thank you to the hosts.
2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Fantastic little spot for a home base while exploring the northern sections of ANF.
This was our second stay here.
We‚Äôll be back!"
2022-03-01,4,Stayed with a pet,"Great space -- impressive that the house has three bedrooms AND two bathrooms, with a living room perfect for board games and relaxing. Stove is really nice! A nice blanket of March snow made everything look even more magical outside.
We were surprised by the gas odor in Warren, so prepare for that. It doesn't linger but it does waft by every so often."
2022-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,We loved our stayed! Place was beautiful very relaxing and peaceful! We will be back this summer! Polechko‚Äôs
2022-02-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Very small town but the prefect place to get away for a weekend. House was extremely clean and exactly what we were expecting!
2022-02-01,5,Stayed with a pet,We were super happy with the place easy to get to nice restaurants around yet you‚Äôre still out of the city the river was right there a nice little bridge with a place for a campfire we enjoyed our stay
2022-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We met our relatives halfway between Cincinnati and MA and this was a perfect spot! It was cozy and comfortable, a fabulous bargain, and in the midst of beautiful parks with great hiking and snowshoeing. We hope to meet up again here!"
2022-02-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Awesome place, beautiful clean and very cozy. The view was breathtaking!
Paul and Christine are very are very good people and really knows how to make a perfect Airbnb gateway!
Look forward to come back in the future!"
2022-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,we had an amazing time. thank you so much for letting us stay at your little get away. it was so nice and comfortable. easy to find too.
2022-01-01,5,Stayed with a pet,River in the back yard! Lots of space for outdoor exploring.
2022-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Wonderful place to stay peaceful and quiet
2022-01-01,5,Stayed with a pet,The cabin is very cute with tons of room! The hosts are super communicative and kind! Highly recommend!
2022-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"A nice affordable getaway! Good amount of yard outside if the weather is nice! Pet friendly is very helpful too! Not as secluded as I had anticipated, but quiet!"
2021-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Over all great experience at the Eddy. would definitely recommend for a relaxing, uninterrupted stay."
2021-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay!
2021-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,A great place to stay if you love hiking! The house was well stocked with the essentials for cooking and basic living. It was also clean and very homey. Would definitely stay again!
2021-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,The place was as advertised. The place was more than adequate for our needs. Worked out great for us. Would definitely stay here again.
2021-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The place was exactly what we were looking for. Everything was provided that we needed and it was clean and very cozy. It was also quiet and relaxing. Paul and Christine were quick to respond to any questions and I would definitely visit again!
2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Wonderful place to stay! We stayed almost a week and loved it! Highly recommend. Only downside was, they should include more pics of the property so you can see that there are 2 other houses right next to the rental on the same driveway‚Ä¶ pics do not show that at all. We were pretty annoyed when we pulled up and saw there were multiple houses on the property right on top of each other when the pics made it seem like it was alone. HOWEVER, the stay was amazing and you CAN NOT hear or see the neighbors at all unless you‚Äôre out front. Even then we didn‚Äôt hear or see anyone. Paul and Christine answer very quickly any time you need to message them. Sent someone to us 9am when we messaged asking if they had a battery for the smoke detector! Really appreciate how on top of things they are and we hope to come back to visit again! The place is great and it snowed while we were there so we had a lot of fun playing in the snow like children. The home is extremely comfortable, reminds me of a cabin, and we were able to bring both of our cats."
2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great place - very clean and accommodating. From the pictures, we thought it was closer to the river than it actually was. Overall, great stay. Couldn‚Äôt have asked for a better weekend getaway. Thank you so much!"
2021-11-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Decent place, based on pictures I thought the place would be more private."
2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Nice location. Clean place.
2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great location!
Fantastic accommodations.
Perfect for a group of hiking friends to enjoy the Allegheny National Forest for the weekend."
2021-10-01,3,Stayed a few nights,"It is a okay place really close to other homes. Not what I was expecting, but we did have a great time. The area is beautiful in the fall."
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Clean, comfortable and in a very scenic area. No problems with check in, quiet area and well equipped."
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great location near plenty of nature and hiking trails. The place was clean and ready for us when we got in. The only surprise was the oil refinery fumes that occasionally blow by while outside. Indoors, fortunately, there was no odor. All in all worth it!"
2021-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Great location and easy to find! The home is clean and well laid out! Other than having a rainy weekend, we enjoyed our time at the cabin."
2021-10-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Comfortable and clean
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The Eddy is a comfortable cottage, very clean and conveniently located to enjoy both the Allegheny National Forest, and several nearby historic towns. The owners have thoughtfully provided just about everything you need for your stay. There are several outdoor areas to enjoy, including 2 fire pits. The location is close to the town of Warren for restaurants, shopping and walking in the historic district."
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"There are two fire pits, but one is way closer to the house. We used that one and had a nice fire. Easy check in and out, nicely decorated and homey. Clean and near Warren and the Mountains, which is exactly what we wanted. Kitchen amenities made it easy to cook for ourselves."
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Peaceful place and great location! Very clean indoors and extra accommodations! Loved the fire pits and outdoor furnishings also!
Hosts were wonderful! Hope to book another vacation there in the future! Thank you Paul and Christine!!"
2021-09-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"My husband, myself and our dog enjoyed a brief stay. We were looking to explore a different part of PA, and some quiet time near water. This place was very cozy and enjoyable We used one fire pit that was at the bottom of the property. It was very private, although you can hear neighbors. Overall, the location was great, but we lost gps connection, and were not prepared with a map. Needless to say, be prepared to not have cell service when getting to this location."
2021-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This was our second summer staying at the Eddy. It was just as clean and welcoming this year. Everything was meticulous and neat. House is well stocked and comfortable. Check in is easy. House is convenient to the dam, hiking, kayaking, and downtown Warren. It‚Äôs nice and quiet. Communication is always quick. Thank you again!"
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was my second Air BnB experience . The house was all one floor, and was very cute and cozy. The main room felt a little more like a cabin to me because of the wall paneling, but I really liked that about the place. The bedrooms had more of the cottage vibe, so I felt it was the best of both worlds. I had a little bit of a hard time getting in contact with the hosts on the way up, but they were in an area with no cell service, which is a reality of the Allegheny National Forest. I met Paul and he was friendly and easygoing. The first day I didn't go up because of severe storms the whole way up, and he offered to let me stay the following night as it just so happned to be free. I definitely appreciated that!
The house was located on the same road that drives down to the dam and the fish hatchery. I recommend taking a tour of the hatchery. It only takes a few minutes of your time to learn about the awesome work they do there."
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Very nice, close to town if you forgot something."
2021-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Paul and Christine have set up a lovely place with plenty of room, very clean and full of everything you could need for a trip away. Two big, well maintained fire pits (one right next close to the house and one a short walk down next to the river. It's a lovely place to access so many hiking trails nearby and enjoy some campfire dinners and smores."
2021-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,Loved having the amenities of town so close yet were minutes away from the park an hiking trails. Our son is already asking when we can go back.
2021-08-01,4,Stayed with kids,"We enjoyed our stay and appreciated a lot of the little things in place such as toiletries just in case, a stocked kitchen, puzzles etc."
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place has it all! From a spacious living room, to a fire pit, to views of the Allegheny River, to a short 5 minute drive to everything the town has to offer. I would stay again and recommend it to others looking for a quiet and relaxing getaway in the Allegheny national forest"
2021-08-01,5,Stayed over a week,"A great place to stay! Lots of room and nice and clean. Nice fire ring area in the yard and another down a path next to the River.
Convenient to the Kinzua Dam which is beautiful and has a very nice hiking trail from the Swim beach area to Rim Rock. Warren area is nice with a nice brewery (Bent Run) down town and next door to it is Allegheny Outfitters Outdoor Store if you want to rent a Kayak to go down the river."
2021-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,Great house to stay in that served as a great starting spot for various day trips.
2021-07-01,5,Stayed about a week,Awesome place and great host!
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,great place for a quiet get away
2021-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Though rainy, it was a beautiful home away from home. Huge state parks close by. Very clean with gorgeous views."
2021-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Great, relaxing little place! I really enjoyed my stay"
2021-07-01,3,Stayed a few nights,"Paul was very nice and accommodating.
While the property was conveniently located close to town and the other wonderful parts of Warren County, it was not the ""cottage in the woods"" suggested in the description. Multiple other houses in view, with noise coming continuously from two of them. The river was not visible from the home, though it was from the firepit at the end of the steep path.
The layout of the home was good with two bedrooms on one side and another on the other. It would really be nice to have a fully outfitted kitchen with a full set of adult sized utensils (only five forks available - some salad size, four knives etc ...), a full set of glasses, juice glasses, etc ...
Everyone was very nice, but I stay in many Airbnb properties, and this property did not match the description."
2021-07-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"The Eddy was a good home base while doing day hikes in the Allegheny Forest. It really is a good location (within 30 min drive) from some of the best hiking trails. The place is not fancy; but is quite comfortable- perfect for our needs. Our only issue was that we could not get the tv to work, and apparently the folks who stayed there prior to us had the same issue. It would have been nice if the owners would have fixed this prior to our arrival; but it certainly was not a deal breaker. We would definitely stay there again."
2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Such a wonderful place!! ‚ÄúTHE EDDY‚Äù was my first ever Air BnB and it set the bar very high for any others I may stay at. Very clean, stocked very well with necessities. Extra blankets and pillows, the access to the water was great! We loved the place. At first the pictures make it look secluded I wasn‚Äôt expecting there to be other houses right next to it but it ended up being okay and not a problem‚Ä¶ the next time I decide to take a kayaking trip I would definitely love to stay here again. The hosts are also very quick to reply as well. They answered any questions I had.
Great place!!!"
2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This listing is an oasis in the forest. It's close to a lot of great hikes and features some of the amenities not many in the area offer (AC, kitchenette, showers). It's fire pit by the river is pretty great to come and relax after a long day of hiking or being outdoors. We loved it and will definitely stay here again if we visit the area in the future."
2021-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Great place to stay! Close to everything. Paul is a wonderful host. Our 4 year old Grandson loved his single bed bedroom; was perfect for him!!! If you have never been to the area take a trip, you will not be disappointed. The Allegheny National Forest is beautiful!"

2021-05-01,3,Stayed with kids,"We enjoyed our weekend, regardless of the cold, rainy weather. The Allegheny River is a small walk from the home. We would have enjoyed the campfire by the river, but due to the walk with children at night, we enjoyed the campfire near our home."

2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We loved our stay! The cabin was nice and clean and maintained and in a perfect location for what we wanted to do over a long weekend. Paul is great and he offered up some good tips on the area. We were able to kayak a lot from this location and we really enjoyed our time spent down by the river and relaxing on the front porch. Lots of great wildlife and bird watching! We would definitely stay here again.
2021-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We had a great stay! We enjoyed the fire rings, outdoor seating, and sounds of the nearby water."
2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Paul and Christine were very quick to respond to messages, the place was clean and well stocked. would definitely stay again!"

2021-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Loved this place! Very conveniently located to Warren‚Äôs downtown area; but great views of the river and a woodsy area. We saw a black squirrel running around!
Some great micro brews (Wicked Warren and Bent Run) in the area, hiking, and fishing. Great spot to get back to nature and relax. Super comfy beds too."
2021-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great location! Cabin was nice and clean. Perfect spot to return to after a day of hiking. We were so happy to find a place that welcomed our pup, too. Paul was very responsive."

2021-02-01,5,Group trip,"amazing veiw, cozy, clean, comfty and 2 outside fire pits. one is facing n right next to water"
2021-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,Comfy spot along Allegheny river close to a bunch of cool stuff. It was snowy and icy so we weren't able to do as much hiking as planned. Had an awesome time at Kinzue Bridge State park which is a short drive. River spot is beautiful. The Eddy was good for getting cozy after exploring. Will be back when warmer!
2021-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The coffee!! I love coffee and they had some. I've stayed at a few bnb's and this is the first one that had coffee. And don't get me started on the view. With all the fresh snow, it was beautiful. The house was a home, my adult children and I felt comfortable and relaxed being there. Paul shoveled while we were out and made it safe for us coming back from our outing. Due to the reason of us being up there, we didn't get time to enjoy to much but Paul was kind with his condolences. My daughter said as we were leaving, ""We need to save this one to the favorites, so when we have time, we can stay again"""
2021-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Perfect quiet space very clean and welcoming
2021-02-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Clean, cozy stay"
2021-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,We really enjoyed our stay. The house was very clean and the beds were very comfortable. It‚Äôs a great location and had nice amenities. I would definitely stay here again!! You can see the river from the house.
2021-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Cozy place to come home to after hiking trails in the Allegheny National Forest. Loved watching the snow fall through the large picture window in the living room. It was a winter wonderland!
2021-01-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Spacious house with comfortable beds and a full kitchen. Unfortunately too cold and snowy to use the firepit and grill, but both were available. The house is down a short road (driveway) with two other properties on it. We had a relaxing weekend and appreciated that the TV had netflix since the windy cold days kept us inside more than we planned!"
2021-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We loved staying at The Eddy! Such a charming, comfortable home away from home. We visited family, went tubing at Peek n Peak, lounged around the house and enjoyed the scenic view of the snow and the river. We plan on returning in the Summer!"
2021-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Thank you for the lovely stay :)
2021-01-01,5,Stayed about a week,Very much enjoyed our stay. Would stay again! Responses were very timely and the accommodations very comfortable. Would highly recommend this property!
2020-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The Eddy is everything you‚Äôd expect and more! A secluded spot that feels homey, cozy, and is full of all the things you probably neglected to pack from ground cinnamon to giant checkers. My stay was during a very strong snowstorm, and I couldn‚Äôt have been in a better spot to watch the large flakes trickle down, dusting the treetops and covering the ground. My dog and I enjoyed the views, hiked in a nearby trail in Allegheny National Forest, and felt very at peace at The Eddy. Thanks for the awesome trip."
2020-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The home is beautiful, clean, and very close to hiking trails! I had a wonderful time here. They had everything we needed."
2020-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Everything was just as described and we had no issues of any sort - we got to spend a lovely weekend away in nature without any worries - it was perfect!
2020-12-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Very clean place! Everything as described. Close to the city
2020-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Great Quiet Cottage to spend a hunkered Down Thanksgiving. My Wife, Two Teenage Boys and two small dogs had a great time hitting local hiking and checking out the Kinzua Dam. Close Enough to Town for a quick jaunt to pick up dinner but far enough out to feel like your in the woods. There is real value in this clean cozy cottage for the price with all the ""free"" nature activities nearby. The area down to the Allegheny river looked to be not maintained and I didn't see the firepit on the river. (We never asked and it rained so didn't spend a lot of time outside on the property). In the winter you can see the neighbors houses and some of the oil well equipment so if your looking for pristine views of the river you will need to hike down to get them. (This is nitpicking and for the price can be overlooked!) No problems with check in or check out and everything in the other good reviews is spot on. Wi-Fi was strong enough for all the surfing and streaming we did when not out hiking!
Overall would rent again for a quiet value packed getaway!"
2020-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Clean and private place to stay. There are a couple other properties and residences near by but not an issue. Location is just far enough away from Warren to feel out of town but close enough to run for some groceries or grab a bite to eat.
2020-11-01,5,Group trip,Very clean and roomy. Pictures do not do it justice. We had five women in our group and were all very comfortable with the space. Nice common area for games and gethering. Had everything we needed and close to great trails.
2020-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay! Amazing hiking trails near by. We had an amazing time with the dogs at ‚ÄúThe eddy‚Äù deff looking forward to coming back for more hiking in the future.
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great little place for my weekend stay. Very clean and cozy. Location is close to local restaurants and walkable to some local sightseeing. I felt very safe and like at home. Thank you, Pamela!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Stayed here again for our second time in Warren. We love the space and love
the small city. There are great breweries and shops, and Pamela's place is in close proximity to many hiking trails and places to kayak and fish. The town is very walkable from the apartment, and we will absolutely stay here for a 3rd time."

Thank you, Pamela, for all your assistance accommodating our instructor!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"What a great place! Right in the heart of quaint downtown Warren is this great apt. The bed is comfortable, the kitchen has all the amenities you need, the wifi is great and the off street parking is ideal. Pamela was responsive to all the questions I had and made sure the space has everything you need. The bed is comfy, the bathroom is clean and you are central to all the places you would want to go downtown or near by. I definitely recommend staying at Pamela's space."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"We really enjoyed this space. It was clean, charming, and had a great location. It‚Äôs even close to the river for spectacular views. :-)"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Everything you need in a space to use as a base for exploring the Allegheny National Forest. When not exploring the outdoors, easy to enjoy the nearby businesses in Warren itself."

It is located in a charming part of town. So that‚Äôs a plus, too.
It is clean, uncluttered, and comfortable. There are restaurants within walking distance, but you can eat your meals in if you want. We‚Äôve done both.
It is an exceptional value!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"Pamela‚Äôs place is so convenient and comfortable, and was the perfect way to start off Thanksgiving. We were thankful that we could bring our dog and he was right at home, as were we. This was our 2nd time staying and it was as welcoming as the first! Thanks Pamela!!"

2023-11-01,5,Stayed one night,Fantastic little apartment in a perfect location for exploring Warren. Really cosy place with all of the amenities that you could wish for. Parking right outside. Lots of eating and drinking options within very easy walking distance. Pamela was a great host with excellent communication throughout. She was also very flexible and accommodating with my request. I‚Äôd definitely return in I ever find myself passing through again. Highly recommended!
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,We booked Pamela's place after a long day of travel and it was well worth it! Parking was a little hard to find but otherwise the stay was smooth and ejouable experience.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"I was traveling with my mom and found Pam‚Äôs place fit our needs perfectly! Street level entry with parking right by door.

Fluffy towels in the bathroom were much appreciated!
Highly recommend this gem of a place!"

2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very nice place!
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"I stayed with my sister for a wedding we both attended and this was just what we needed. The directions were a bit weird b/c the green awning is gone but once we found the place it was beautiful and we had a great time and all the furniture was comfy and I just can‚Äôt stress how beautiful the house was but also the area, This was my first time in PA but I absolutely plan on returning üíï"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"Pamela‚Äôs place was the perfect place for us as we broke up a 10 hour drive and found it at the very last minute. It was a cute apartment on the first floor of a renovated industrial building, and was very conveniently located to restaurants and views of the Allegheny river, a block or so away. What made it really great for us was that our golden doodle felt right at home, and the place did not feel at all like it had housed other animals in the past. Very clean. Also, Pamela was kind enough to offer us a second room that was adjoining in case we wanted a little extra space for our dog. Definitely did not expect to be in Warren, Pennsylvania, but really glad we were able to discover Pamela‚Äòs place."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"This is the second time I‚Äôve stayed here and it was as good as the first. The unit was clean, comfortable and has all desired amenities. Pamela quickly communicates and is very pleasant to deal with.

2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,Would definitely stay again!
2023-07-01,4,Stayed over a week,"I stayed at Pam's last year and loved the location and accommodations, so booked again. This year I had a problem with some workers who showed up at 8:00 am on 7/5 playing loud music and wanting to replace the front door that leads into apartment. WTH? Being unaware of this in advance, it really threw off my day (plus I was still on a 3 hour earlier timeframe since I had come from Calif) I got ahold of Pam right away, and she indicated that she didn't expect them to come until Aug or Sept. Again I'm thinking WTH? The next morning they were outside again at 8:00 a.m. music playing wanting to finish the job so they could paint, saying they were there all week to paint the building on that side too...Ugh! It took me 2 days & I finally lost it and expressed my feelings to Pam. The next days got better then. They arrived a little later and they didn't play their music, so I survived it. Pam and I were on good terms when I left, and I've booked again now for next year."

Thank you for the hospitality!!"

The plus side is you can easily walk to restaurants, groceries, and other amenities!"

Clean and simple.
Loved it"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We rented this unit for our daughter while she's doing an internship at Warren General Hospital. She loves this apartment! It is always clean, well-stocked, has easy parking and is in a great location. She said the bed is very comfortable and she's enjoyed all of the premium TV channels that are available. Pam has been wonderful to work with, she is very responsive and helpful. Thank you!"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"Pamela‚Äôs place made for a wonderful overnight stay in Warren. I booked at the last minute due to having lost electricity and water at another place because of a microburst. Pamela was very accommodating and understanding.
The studio was welcoming with the coordinated decor and how the space was utilized. Most everything looked new and shiny. Loved the comfortable bed and spa- like shower! Although the studio is street level, the outside noises were not interfering at all. Warren was very walkable and felt very safe. There seemed to be quite a few restaurants in the area.
Although I regrettably didn‚Äôt have the chance to meet Paula, her friendliness came through on all of her communications. She was very personable.
Definitely recommend this studio, and would extend this recommendation to her other listings based on my stay at the studio"

The Studio's cleanliness was prestine (with a beautiful shower, I will note). Pamela was unobtrusive, as she does reside in the building, while responsive to messages- This is importantto us as we are ones that prefer privacy. We would definitely book again if in the area.
Thank you, Pamela!"

2022-06-01,4,Stayed one night,"Very nice little space. In a great neighborhood too. Easy check in.
We forgot to buy creamer at the store so I had to drink my coffee black but it has other staples such as oil and spices. We're able to make dinner and have breakfast purchased at the Tops which is within walking distance.
My only negative(s) are that it was really cold and there was no hair dryer so it was that much colder after we showered. There also was a TV on upstairs and someone walking around as well until at least 1:30am. Didn't keep my boyfriend up and it was just a mild annoyance. Nothing too bad.
Also I have previously stayed with Pam last year and this is a new space in the same building. Very modern and has all the basics like a toaster, Keurig, microwave, fridge, stove and cooking supplies."
2022-06-01,5,Stayed over a week,I stayed here for two weeks while on a work trip. This cozy studio apartment definitely beats staying in a hotel. Having a full kitchen is better than a hotel microwave! Pamela was always quick to return my messages and I had zero issues with checking in/out or anything with the apartment. Thanks Pamela!

2021-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The space was lovely! The perfect mixture of modern and vintage furniture. The pictures don't do it justice.
The check in was simple and Pamela was accommodating with our last minute travel plans.
The only downside was the walls seemed very thin and we could clearly hear guests in other units so I assume they could hear us talking and moving around.
Parking is simple and near the entrance.
I would stay here again!"

It was about a 20 drive to the great hiking & biking trails at Jakes Rocks. The apartment does not have a washer, dryer or dishwasher, which was fine for us for our 5 day stay. We were able to park one vehicle on the street in front of the apartment & the street had plenty of other free parking. Lacey lives nearby & was great at communication.

We watched playful ducks ride the creek‚Äôs current and fly back and do it again and again. Ideal meditation spot and perfect for just relaxing with morning coffee or afternoon glass of wine. The home is nicely appointed and spotless. We loved sitting in the kitchen where there is a center island stovetop and looking out toward the flowing creek. In short-magical!

Be careful when you first come in, the curtain is covering an open staircase to the basement! I would also say that this is one of the drier homes I've stayed in, but it was very warm, especially upstairs."

She even had a little Christmas tree set up, which was perfect to do our gift exchange! The beds were comfortable and the bedrooms were spacious. There was ample room to relax and connect with our family.
We would definitely recommend this place to anyone visiting Warren- I imagine it only gets better in the warmer weather!"

The bathroom was beautiful just wish there was at least another bathroom since we shared it with another couple. We made it work. Our friends said the master bedroom bed was comfy.

2023-09-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"This place was clean, perfect for a quick getaway for our anniversary. The house is very close to neighbors, but they were friendly and helpful with suggestions for routes since we had never been to the area and were riding our motorcycle. However the outdoor space was perfect and they equipped us with enough wood for a fire by the creek every evening. we heard porcupines, saw deer and duck on the creek and even had chipmunks running around us. we would definitely stay here again. I could not find the guest book or the recommendations for the area. We would definitely stay here again but we would want a vehicle and not just our bike. üòÅüòÅ"

The living room nicely set up for three with a sofa and a comfortable chair opposite the TV. Cozy at night, could use an addition floor or table lamp for reading.
The main bedroom was spacious with a great office area, the sliding modern barn door is lovely so long as you know your friends! Both beds super comfortable. We could not figure out how to use the AC in the bedroom which was not an issue because the neighborhood is super quiet so we slept with the windows open.
Lovely bathroom with a large two person sized shower and a view of the canopy shading the outdoor seating and fire ring, so bring some logs!
Five minutes to downtown, the brewery, 8 minutes to the new, fabulous pickleball courts.
Jaclyn was super helpful with our arrival and departure time.
Would we stay again, five hour drive: yes!"

Thanks again for the amazing hospitality and friendly communication to Jaclyn and family!"

2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We stayed at Jaclyn's house for a week-end to enjoy the area and do a few unique things. Walking into the kitchen and downstairs area all is well done very cute decor and you get a great breeze thru the house with windows open. The bed was very comfy and great pillows, there is also a TV in the main upstairs bedroom as well as a wall fireplace for ambiance
It's a quiet neighborhood with nice neighbors, however they were a bit closer than we thought they would be. The back patio is super relaxing watching the water roll by and all the sounds of nature birds, ducks, chipmunks etc but they also start chirping about 3:45 a.m. so if you are a light sleeper they may wake you up as there are many different birds singing all at once.
Jaclyn gave us great suggestions the home is close to town bars, restaurants, a grocery store etc.
We enjoyed our stay and she was great to communicate with everything went very smoothly we were happy with our stay."

It‚Äôd also be awesome for a longer stay since the kitchen is top notch!"

When I called Jaclyn about my situation she was incredibly empathetic and understanding. She was able to refund the trip.

It is wonderfully decorated with thoughtful touches like lush towels, fresh eggs, a lit Christmas tree, and the most charming outdoor space. I thought the bed was super comfortable and really enjoyed cooking meals in the fabulously appointed kitchen. The location was great for getting to work and the downtown area for groceries or shopping. It's situated in a darling neighborhood that I enjoyed taking walks in.

2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Our stay at this beautiful, serene cabin was exceptional and exceeded all our expectations. The charming chickens added a delightful touch, and the stunning bridge leading to the cabin was simply breathtaking. The hosts were extremely friendly and helpful, enhancing our experience even more. The cabin was so beautiful that I could have stayed there and done nothing else. We explored Allegheny and took a stunning hike through Hearts Content. We enjoyed breakfast at ida Mae‚Äôs and enjoyed some in town festivities. The only thing that could make it better would have been an icecream shop."

2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This cabin was the perfect romantic getaway for my anniversary! Being surrounded by nature was the perfect way to start summer and I really enjoyed the provided fire pit and relaxing Adirondack chairs. The cabin itself had charming furniture/decor and I especially loved the large windows in the sun room. The host even left us a couple gift cards for some shops nearby! There is a stream that provides the perfect white noise for napping with the windows open and a photo worthy footbridge to cross it. The chickens were fun to watch roam around and overall the scenery was very calming. Other than a step onto the porch and into the sunroom, the cabin is all one level making it great for guests with more limited mobility, and the walk from the driveway to the cabin is fairly short. I could see this place being beautiful during any season! All around great vibes!"
2024-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We wanted a nice relaxing getaway for our anniversary and we found it at the cabin! The hosts were very friendly and responsive in conversation.

2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This cabin is by far our favorite place - tucked in a secluded, private spot, surrounded by the beauty of nature (and prime for stargazing, which we actually saw the Starlink satellite train) and creatures (we miss watching Bonita, Flora and Sharon), and notedly clean with well-thought and functional intricacies and craftsmanship inside and outside. If you are aiming to feel grounded, disconnect, and recharge even just for a bit, this is the perfect cabin for you! I also cannot say enough about how awesome the hosts are; they went above and beyond in preparation to and during our stay, ensuring we had what we needed and had a wonderful stay! Book now!!"

2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Incredible place at an incredible price. The setting is top tier. Beautiful scenery, with no loud distractions; just chirping birds, rustling leaves, and the soft sound of a flowing stream. We were in search of an affordable weekend trip, to simply read a book and mentally reset. I can say with confidence there is no better place, especially for this price, than this location here. On top of the incredible setting, the hosts go above and beyond to provide you with anything thing you need‚Ä¶ and even surprise you on some mornings with some fresh eggs, courtesy of the 3 resident hens that roam the grounds. They‚Äôre not just great hosts here, they‚Äôre great people with a level of hospitality that is unrivaled. 10/10. One of our best Air BnB experiences we will likely have. Thank you Scott, Grace, and everyone else behind this property. You are truly appreciated."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We went for 5 days and had such an amazing stay! Grace was always responsive which made the stay even better.

2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We stayed here for two nights and it was incredibly peaceful and relaxing. I would recommend this place to anyone looking for a nice get away weekend. It was perfect for me because it was secluded enough that you had privacy, but if you needed anything from a store it didn‚Äôt take that long to get there. This was the most comfortable and functional AirBnB I‚Äôve stayed in so far. Hosts are very friendly and responsive! Highly recommend this place."
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Amazing place to stay quiet area. Walking outside to hear the water was amazing. Best place my fianc√© and I have stayed so far! 100% will be back

2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a superb time at this couple's romantic getaway. The location is quite perfect--it is sufficiently private and isolated but a short drive to Warren (a cute little town at the entrance to the National Forest) and Jamestown, NY (about 25 minutes away). The place itself was very, really perfect for two. Streaming shows is not an option but Grace provides a DVD player and a collection of solid DVDs. We did manage to stream spotify just fine.
Also many little touches--a nice selection of Keurig coffee, creamers, hot cocoa, and even some popcorn. Essential oils to add some nice smells, electric candles to help add soft lighting, etc. Good outdoor lighting to light the way at night, including lights on the bridge and outside by a fire pit. The bed and comforter was very soft and comfortable.
In sum, we had an amazing time and will return. One of our new favorites!
PS Consider bringing a Bluetooth speaker, DVDs, condiments, spices, and wine glasses."

It was so peaceful eating dinner outside and listening to the sounds of the creek. Luckily, we had an exceptionally warm day for the end of October and our son enjoy dipping his feet and throwing rocks in the water.

I came across this place and fell in love instantly, the pictures do not do this place justice. It was absolutely secluded and peaceful. My husband is not one to leave our house but he did not want to leave this morning when it was time to come back home. The chickens were very friendly and welcoming and Scott was a very nice gentleman. All of the host are very efficient with responding. We are already planning our next trip back to stay!

Grace and co-hosts were so responsive and helpful before and during our stay! Great communication. Scott came to check on the chickens and put them to bed/let them out in the morning.

The decor is charming and cozy, and in fact all the thoughtful details made us feel so welcomed. The kitchen is well equipped complete with coffee and treats. One of my favorite features of the property are the various outdoor spaces to enjoy the spectacular views. We enjoyed the porch, the covered patio and the deck on the water. Phyllis is a talented gardener and her extravagant floral displays were surely speaking my love language. Phyllis and Derek are friendly and accommodating and we can't wait to return to this magical place!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What a wonderful stay. The River House was immaculate, fully-equipped and homey. Comfortable for us and our 2 teenagers.

Phyllis and Derek were super friendly and helpful with suggestions for food and activities. So sweet that they had cupcakes ready upon arrival for celebrating a birthday.

Like cupcakes for his birthday and personal message on our arrival. You can canoe, kayak or just relax under the tin covered outdoor living area. It was even peaceful in the rain. The ‚Äútownhome/condo-isque‚Äù apartment is decorated eclectic minimal modern mixed with a little vintage. We felt welcomed and will definitely be back!"

It‚Äôs far away from any city noise so it was like a piece of heaven for us New York City foke. We‚Äôre so glad we did New Years here, we‚Äôre definitely coming in the fall to see the fall colors. (Since the whole town is surrounded with mountains of trees and wildlife it should be breathtaking so we can‚Äôt wait)"
2021-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Great property ! Close to a lot of attractions ! Close to shopping and down town Warren. Also close to Jamestown NY.
2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The cabin is very comfortable and relaxing. The stream running through the back is very tranquil.
2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Second stay at Hatch Haven. Very well stocked kitchen, I'll only note that the compact microwave takes a little more time than our nuclear reactor level micro at home. If you're visiting Warren, Hatch Haven is only 10 minutes to town, easy roads. HH is close to a lot of things, but nicely isolated from noisy roads and next to a nice creek. The fire pit is a nice addition."
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This place had everything I needed to enjoy my stay!
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Very well-equipped kitchen, everything you need. Very cozy house, with a spacious addition that makes the living room. If you're from out of the area, you might think the house is a long way from Warren (where we were visiting family), but it's a quick and easy drive into town. The fire pit is a nice feature. Cell reception at the house is pretty sketchy, but the wi-fi is plenty strong and fast. A 1-minute trip down the road brings you to the DMV office, where reception is fine. Very nice place for a couple, with enough space to open the provided single cot and a large fold-out couch in the living room."
2021-09-01,4,Stayed with kids,I was absolutely in love with the location. I wish the amenities worked a tad better (bedroom TV didn‚Äôt work at all. Living room worked sort of . But there was a DVD player and tons and tons of movies!!!) just for the kids sakes but then again.... it‚Äôs a cabin ahah! Lisa and co we‚Äôre absolutely amazing . Communication was excellent. We will return regularly!!!! Beautiful home ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What a WONDERFUL place to spend pur 1st Anniversary!! EVERYTHING exceeded our expectations by far! We'll definitely recommend to any of our friends who are looking for somewhere to stay just far enough away from Niagra Falls to be so comfortably back in a country setting with LOTS to do onsite & lovely towns to see. This was our first AirBnB experience & WOW we will definitely travel this way again! Thanks so much, Lori!!!"
2021-09-01,4,Stayed about a week,"Lisa is easy to communicate with, nice property, well water to get used too."
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The Hatch Haven was a fantastic stay in a great area. The host was punctual, ensured an easy check-in, and had everything prepared for us. I would highly recommend staying here."
2021-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Spacious little house with a huge yard and all the amenities to make it a home away from home. It's very secluded and woodsy, but the full-time neighbors (bugs) seem to stay outside, even in bad weather. It rained almost our entire stay, but it was beautiful from the little back porch and sounded amazing on the roof in the living room. If you bring small children, be aware of the Sharpie markers in the Yardzee bucket. My daughter found them first, but disaster was quickly averted, thank goodness!"
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great rental private & peaceful, & minutes away from everything"
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This house is in a convenient location for anybody with a boat wishing to launch at Webb's Ferry at the Allegheny Reservoir. The kitchen and bathroom were well equipped/stocked. The host provided plenty of games and movies for entertainment. The back yard was relaxing with the fire and horse shoe pits. Would definitely recommend and stay again.
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"You will find everything you need here, outside and in. Awesome night sky watching around the fire pit. Inside, Wi-Fi and TV worked great, comfortable furniture."
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Very nice place to stay, private but close to everything, fantastic yard, the bathroom is a little small but all in all a great place"

2021-07-01,5,Stayed about a week,"A lovely little cottage with a babbling stream. Having a washer/dryer was great. The place was warm and inviting. We loved the convienece of being near family. Will definately make this my little ""Haven"" when visiting family."
