We really enjoyed sitting out on the deck later in the evening, it was a perfect night for it! Our host provided info on local running trails and the breakfast was great! Plenty of tables were available to ensure social distancing was possible. Everything was clean. My only critique was that the shower could have had a better head or pressure, or something - it was fine, but not great for washing my thick hair."

We spent three days listening to nature and watching the river run by. He has a beautiful spot and Darren is very responsive, doing everything he can to be sure guests are comfortable."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We had the MOST wonderful time at The River @ Newcastle and we’re so pleased to have met Darren. He has an exceptionally beautiful spot, was so responsive and accommodating, and his place was so well appointed. He was such a pleasure to speak with and we had the best time camping, fishing, looking at the stars, and spending time with family. Could NOT have been any better. Will 100% stay again. Thank you, Darren!"
2024-05-01,4,Stayed with kids,"Beautiful view of the river and bridge from the nice deck. Camper was ok and adequate for what we needed. Driveway is steep, so 4x4 vehicle is almost a necessity, especially after a rain. Darren is a great host!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful setting right on the river. Clean RV. Lots to do around the area but also very peaceful to just hang out at the RV. Wish we had brought our fishing poles!

2023-09-01,5,Stayed about a week,"From the momentof booking, Darren was attentive and took action for any of my concerns. He went out of his way to make me feel comfortable. The property was so beautiful with the river view and pristine 5th wheel and it was obvious at how much work he had been trying to improve it. I would call him a SUPER Super Host. His property manager was on top of a plumbing issue and it was taken care of within the hour they were notified. I couldn't have asked for a nicer, peaceful place to stay for 10 days."
2023-09-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful area! Darren was very responsive and answered all of my questions. Very friendly host.

2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We couldn't have found a better place for our vacation than the River at Newcastle! It had everything we were looking for and more: total privacy, spectacular river views, clean and comfortable accommodations, and a huge deck complete with outdoor kitchen. Best of all was Darren - he is the ultimate host, without exception! He is so welcoming, helpful, and cheerful and made us feel right at home. Thank you, Darren for the River and Newcastle. It's beyond five stars - we will be back!"

2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was incredible weekend for all of us! I speak for everyone, we absolutely loved this camp on the river!
Highly recommend this place to anyone that enjoys a secluded place with water right next to it. I don’t have anything bad to say about this place.
Darren was an amazing host, he got back to me within minutes with any questions I had, and was just an amazing host overall. I can’t say enough good things about this place. Definitely will be coming back."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The view was awesome! Peaceful! Darren was a great host. Made sure everything was taken care of.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Our stay at The River was nothing short of amazing. The 5th wheel was very clean & comfortable. The deck was massive and was situated just right to have an unobstructed view of the river - we were even able to set up Darren’s tent & air mattress for our kids to have an outdoor camping experience. Not to mention, the Blackstone grill was a huge perk! The dock was also a huge plus - our kids enjoyed some time with their fishing poles out there and had a blast. Darren provided a wonderful & quiet little getaway, and his communication was unmatched."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Peaceful retreat, quiet and safe. The place is in a beautiful location with a great view of the Missouri River. My family loves the location, and my kids had a great time fishing on the dock.
Darren was extremely helpful throughout our stay. We can't wait to come back."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Peaceful retreat, clean , quiet and safe. Exceeded description. Globetrotter recharging my batteries…beautiful location and place for that. Plenty of places, activities and food within a reasonable drive. Really enjoyed hearing the birds and watching the fish jump while on the dock.
Paddle boarding, kayaking at a small lake without any power watercraft at Lake Yankton was a blast. Picked up South Dakota’s best pizza and enjoyed it immensely on the new deck.
Huge selection of trails…hiking, biking and walking."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Darren was extremely helpful throughout our time booking all the way through check-out, it was the perfect weekend getaway to disconnect and recharge in a beautiful location! Can’t wait to comeback!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"This was a lovely oasis ~ unexpected, and above and beyond, from the furnishings (cozy, well decorated, special touches), to the home cooked breakfast delivered to our door. Even the books were well curated (I did not even know Alice Walker wrote a book about raising chickens until I saw it in your collection). Many thanks!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"If you could mix time travel with hospitality, you may be nearby. Add in genuine warmth and a connection to the land and a sprinkle of cooking your grandma used to make, and you are now at kate's. Thanks for the lasting inspiration."
2024-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"Kate’s Cottage is truly a hidden gem. We always love our time there! It’s so beautiful, quaint & peaceful. Gale is such a wonderful host. Each of her little touches is done with so much thought & love. Her breakfasts are delicious too. Can’t wait to stay again!"
2024-05-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Gale was so warm and friendly and the Cottage couldn't have been more adorable.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This is our third visit with Gale. We have previously stayed at her place, during Christmas and New Year’s. And she had decorated them to create the winter wonderland at that time!
This time, we went in spring, with our little son. And it was a perfect weekend get away.
The place is as always very clean, neat, comfortable, cozy. She even had board books out for our baby!! Even though it was raining, and she had prior engagements, she came specially to show the goats to us. And her breakfast is always was delicious.
She’s an amazing host. Very responsive.
You don’t need to think twice before booking this place!"
2024-04-01,4,Stayed one night,"Nice country cottage in a quiet peaceful setting. Gale served a made from scratch breakfast that was delicious. Enjoyed seeing goats, chickens and Flo the black lab on the property, but watch out for Batcat, the not so friendly black cat."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Staying at kate’s cottage never disappoints, it’s beautiful, cozy and so so peaceful, Gale is absolutely amazing and the breakfast is so delicious. Being surrounded by nature and the calmness of the farm is the best way to spend a gateway. As always we loved to come back."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Gale is a phenomenal host and the cottage is absolutely perfect! We love our unplugged time at the cottage!!
2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"Gale's place is beautiful, quiet and peaceful - that much is obvious. But she didn't have to provide a delicious homeade breakfast, seasonally decorate, provide high quality linens, towels and a robe, light a candle and turn the lights low upon my arrival, provide snacks and cream/honey to go with my tea or any of the other little touches...yet, she did. This place was like going home to my Mama's- and I'm blessed with the BEST one. ♡ Thank you, Gale."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at the cottage. It was a cozy getaway before our long haul home. Gale was a lovely host, and her breakfast was delicious!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,Such a sweet cottage and Gale couldn’t have been more helpful and accommodating! Our 9-month old loved the animals. Gale recommend Kava Rose for dinner and we loved it. Just a lovely stay overall. Thank you Gale!
2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,this was an amazing beautiful cabin. I truly wish I could have stayed for much longer. truly set a new standard for airbnbs!
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We loved our stay at Kate’s Cottage. It was homey and comfortable and Gale is an excellent host. She was very responsive and friendly, and the breakfast she prepared for us was amazing! I would highly recommend staying here."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Gale’s is never a disappointment. 2nd time here and we were blown away by the comfort of the bed. And of course the breakfast and the details she has put in make this a home away from home.
We will keep returning when traveling in this part of the world. 10 stars"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"If I could give this place 100 stars I would! Gale could not be better a host! The cottage is immaculate and feels like home the second you pull in the driveway. Upon arrival we were greeted by the chickens, kitty and even the goats came out to say hello. All the little extras far surpassed any expectations I’ve ever had of an airbnb host!
The included breakfast was delicious topped with a cherry on top of a handwritten note by the host and baked goodies!
We will be back!"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Kate's Cottage came recommended to us when our original stay changed. We were able to make a last minute reservation with Gale when we saw the cottage was open for our time in the area. We have stayed at lots of airbnb's and VRBO'S in the U.S. and one in Paris. This stay was by far our FAVORITE and it is because of Gale's ability to go above and beyond with every little detail. The cottage and property are delightful and so comfortable feeling. The beds are amazing and the surroundings so quiet. Gale adds the extra touches such as homemade breakfast, bread, chocolate chip cookies, coffee, cocoa to tie everything together in a beautiful bow. We cannot wait to book our next stay at Kate's Cottage!! Thank you again for everything!"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed one night,We had a great time at this spot! Secluded and quiet and a perfect place to rest for the night. Gale is a great communicator and makes a great breakfast!

2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"If I could give Katie’s Cottage 10 stars I would. Such a cute place; all the details in decorating. Clean, cozy; and breakfast both mornings pushed it over the top! Exactly as pictured and described."
2024-01-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Gale was the most amazing host ever. The cottage was perfect for us while we waited for our apartment to be ready. The breakfast each day was phenomenal and I wish we could live there permanently! I can’t wait to go back to Kate’s cottage.

2023-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"I am from St. Louis and lived in North Dakota, so Gale‘s spot was a good halfway point. We’ve been coming here for over half a decade and it is honestly something we look forward to every time we make the drive. Not only is her place ridiculously inexpensive for what you get, she is an awesome person, great hostess But genuinely a good human being. The first time we went there it was like a home away from home. She remembers my kids names and is the most sincere person you will ever meet. I cannot recommend this place enough. It has been nothing but great memories, good vibes, And a feeling of your home away from home. This place is a national treasure."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"I figured it would be difficult for Gale and her cottage to exceed expectations based on her reviews, considering we knew it was going to be amazing. But Gale did it. Gale obviously loves to host her guests and makes the experience unique and unforgettable. My family loved our stay and will be back. Thanks Gale!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Such a cute little cottage. Gale goes above and beyond for her guests
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"There are not enough words to describe this wonderful little slice of heaven. The cottage itself was beautiful and full of surprises. I had everything I needed and more. The breakfast Gale made was beyond amazing and the little touches were just so adorable. I felt so spoiled. Especially since I booked late and Gale still asked if I wanted some cookies when she came to feed the goats!!! The cookies were warm and freshly baked and just a nice little hug before bed!
Meeting Gale and Flo were my highlights. Gale is such a nice upbeat wonderful person and you can tell they put a lot of work into this Beauty! And flo was so loving and sweet! What a good watchdog! This was my favorite place I’ve ever stayed through air bnb!!!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"Ever been somewhere and it was BETTER than the pictures and description? That is Gale’s Place! So relaxing and peaceful and just beautiful! Gale is such amazing woman and her attention to detail to making you feel at home is felt from the moment you reach out to inquire. The homemade breakfast was just delicious and such a wonderful treat. The beauty that surrounds the cottage is breathtaking (makes a wonderful sunrise coffee walk)! Extremely personalized stay and incredibly cozy. Finn makes a great surprise in the morning and comes to say hello. We were passing through and were incredibly lucky to have found this gorgeous gem. Do yourself a favor and go ahead and book, you’ll thank me later and forever want to come back. Thank you Gale for everything, it was just perfect and we felt so loved staying at your cottage on the farm ❤️"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This is one of the cutest cottages ever. You have to see it!
I could have stayed here and never left. This truly feels like a home away from home. It is so well maintained and decorated. You can tell that there is a very caring and loving couple behind the scenes of this place. And someone with an eye for home decor.
The breakfast delivery in the morning is a bonus and such a sweet start to the day. We spent a night in the early winter here and it was beautiful but we can imagine this place being even more magical in the summer.
We highly recommend this place to everyone who travels by here!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"If you like great breakfast’s and hospitality, cute little cabin in the country side of South Dakota then this is a wonderful place to be!"

2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,The cottage was cozy and Gale’s hosting skills surpassed any other place we have stayed. Highly recommend it for a quiet stay.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Kate’s Cottage is the reason you stay with an air bnb rather than a hotel. A unique and homey space, surrounded by beautiful farm country, with unmatched hospitality from the host. If you are visiting Sioux Falls, Kate’s cottage is worth the short drive. One of our favorite stays ever."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,Kate's cottage is very beautiful! The cottage is exquisitely decorated for fall and the breakfast and snacks are delicious. Gale is extremely welcoming! Highly recommend.

Gale provides an actual breakfast that arrives hot and ready to eat. She's amazingly generous and what a wonderful bonus for your stay!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Cute, very clean cottage that was peaceful and the perfect size for my husband and me and our 10 month old. Gale reached out to coordinate details of our stay and had so many nice touches in place including the perfect light breakfast before our early morning departure. We wish our stay hadn’t been so quick and hope to stay again when we travel to Vermillion!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Kate's Cottage is such a beautiful respite in South Dakota!
This is an Airbnb we enjoy and return to because we enjoy it that much.
Be careful; Gale will cook and deliver a delicious breakfast for your visit the following morning. Why careful? It's so delicious and filling that you might be tempted to take a little snooze afterwards before your departure.
Lovely place and a well deserved 5 star rating."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Gale is a fantastic, thoughtful host. The cottage is immaculate, and the surroundings are very peaceful. Gale also makes really yummy cookies!!!"

I can’t say enough about how sweet and special this place is."

Her communications with us were succinct and clear. . All amenities were readily available. The furnishings were lovely and the bed was exceptionally comfortable. Gale’s breakfast was wonderful!! We loved our stay and found her spot superb in every way possible. Her guests will be pleasantly surprised upon arrival at how nice she is and how lovely her cottage is."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,Gale was a great hostess! Very accommodating with late arrival. Very quiet and peaceful!
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Best Airbnb gem! Such a peaceful and unplugged retreat. We love Kate’s Cottage and Gale is simply the best host!! Breakfast is amazing, also. Gale was so sweet to help us with some forgotten items too- a toothbrush and also a ball/mitt for us to play catch (our 8 year old was so happy, after he forgot his at home and Gale came to the rescue!). We played in the yard, did puzzles, fed the goats and enjoyed our time as a fam! Thank you Gale for this sweet retreat!!!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"Beautiful, relaxing, peaceful…lovely home. We were there for a short night and up early and back on the road. Gale is wonderful. She usually prepares a breakfast for you but since we were leaving extra early she spent her evening baking scones for us. She brought scones, orange juice and fruit so that we would have something in the morning. We highly recommend Kate’s Cottage!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Our favorite Airbnb! We choose to stay here each time we pass through. Gale is a gracious, thoughtful and caring host. She is incredible.

Cannot say too many good things about Gale and the cottage."

2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"Gale responded quickly while we were on the road and was able to accommodate us with only hours notice. There were so many welcoming, thoughtful touches- we feel blessed to have stopped and experienced the farm on our travels. It was such a serene and peaceful stay. We will be making this an annual stop as long as the cottage, and Gale- are still around! 👌"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Kate’s cottage was the perfect stay for our cross country trip! Gale allowed us to let our dogs off leash and run free which they appreciated very much after being in a car for 8 hours that day. It was so peaceful & clean, I loved staying here!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We had an amazing time at Kates cottage, it was beautiful and peaceful, gales breakfast was delicious. Would love to come back."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Would recommend this place to anyone. From the homemade cookies waiting for us and breakfast delivered in the morning this place is nothing short of amazing. So peaceful and private yet within a short drive of lots to do. We definitely plan on coming back!!
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"I think it would be hard to build on what others have already said about Gale’s wonderful place at Kate’s Cottage. It is such a beautiful & tranquil spot just away from the hustle and bustle of interstate travel but far enough that you could be staying on any secluded country property. We wished we had more days there and will be looking forward to being able to plan another, longer trip there in the near future. Highly recommend!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"One of the best places I’ve stayed! I loved the location and history of the home. Very comfortable, clean and peaceful. I would definitely visit again!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"Gale's little cottage is a lovely place! It was charming, clean, and in a quiet country setting. Lots of thoughtful little touches that show she cares for her guests. And a delicious homemade breakfast delivered to our door was the cherry on top. We would highly recommend this place to anyone traveling through the area!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"If you’re looking for an unplugged, peaceful escape into farm country, Kate’s Cottage is for you. Rich in tradition and history, the small house is lovely and comfortable. Gale provides a beautiful breakfast delivered to your door and she is also very responsive before and during your stay. She and her pets are most friendly but also respectful of your privacy and seclusion. Nearby small towns provide local fare. If Beresford area is on your route, or even if it’s out of your way, this is a gem."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"Amazing! Our stay at Kate’s Cottage was wonderful. Gale is an outstanding host and makes you feel right at home. She leaves you a great breakfast in the morning, such a personal touch. It was the best AirBnB we have ever stayed in. If we are ever back in the area we will defiantly stay again!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Kate's Cottage was great! Having a cup of coffee on the porch in the morning was really peaceful. Gale was a tremendous host and the breakfast was delicious. The goats, Flo and Batcat were all entertaining and made us smile. We definitely recommend staying at Kate's Cottage."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"Gale's property is absolutely beautiful and peaceful. my husband and I truly felt welcomed and at home. Gale went above and beyond, making us a wonderful homecooked meal with fresh berries the morning we left. We definitely will be back one day!!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We enjoyed the quiet little cottage, it was more than we expected. She delivered our wonderful breakfast at our door every morning, the cottage was very clean and had lots of character. We plan to stay again when back in this area, and will encourage people to stay at Kates Cottage.

2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"This was our second time staying at Kate's Cottage. It is very quiet and peaceful. We enjoyed going for a long walk down the road without a single vehicle passing us. The cottage is very neat and clean, and breakfast was absolutely delicious. We can't recommend Kate's Cottage enough!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"My husband and I stopped at Kate’s Cottage as our first stop on our long cross country journey—we were honestly blown away by our experience. The instructions were easy to follow, the cottage was just as described, but most of all Gale was the most amazing host. The cottage was so cozy and it was the perfect place to rest after a long drive. She prepared the most delicious breakfast that was far more than we expected. It was exactly what we needed to start a long day of driving. We wish we could have stayed longer!!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,It was the perfect chill honeymoon place💕
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This may be one of our favorite Airbnb's we've stayed at. The cottage is so charming and well decorated - the property is beautiful and peaceful - the animals were fun to interact with - we loved this place! However the best part of this Airbnb is the host, Gale. We were greeted by delicious cookies and had breakfast delivered at whatever time we requested each morning (AND she cooked all items gluten free when I notified her that I had celiac disease!) Their home is on the property but we felt we had great privacy and the space to ourselves. It was the getaway we needed to unplug and our dog to have space to play."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,Great place. Very quiet and kind of secluded. Gale was a great host. House was exactly as described. Communication was great
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Most beautiful Airbnb I’ve ever stayed at! I appreciate Gale so much for her handwritten kind notes, the delicious and adorable freshly cooked breakfast in the morning, and so many extra sweet touches that made this place a pure joy! I would definitely come back and highly recommend to my friends to visit! The cottage is even more adorable than the photos in person!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Gale was a most gracious host. Friendly, helpful & accessible but not intrusive.
Breakfast was delicious and way beyond our expectations.
We wished we stayed longer."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"This is my family’s 4th stay at Kate’s cottage and as always, is amazing. The property is quiet, private & serene. The cottage itself is immaculate, comforting, home-like feel and way too good of a deal for why you are paying for. Did I mention she cooks you a home cooked breakfast and leaves it at your doorstep l? Kate’s cottage is a favorite of my family’s and we will be sure to visit again."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Probably our favorite Airbnb! Gale is so hospitable and the cottage is just lovely. We hope to return!
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,Exactly what the description says. Awesome cottage and Gale is an incredible host. Would love to stay here again in the future!
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Gale was a wonderful host. Her cottage was comfortable and clean with a surprising amount of amenities for the price. She has a lovely farm with a cool back story that is interesting to read about in a binder. She had cookies on the counter and made a wonderful breakfast. Her small farm is perfect if you're looking to get away from the city and don't care about not having internet or tv, which I wanted to get away from."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Awesome place to stay. Relaxing and peaceful. Delicious breakfast. Loved the welcome greeting from Flo the dog. Look forward to staying there again when we’re in the area. This was our first AirBNB experience and Gale has set the bar high. Could not have had a better stay and perfect for what we needed after a long day on the road.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"We enjoyed our stay in the cottage! The location is great, it is private, peaceful and a great distance from the city of Sioux Falls. The bed was super comfortable and we enjoyed the breakfast the following morning!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"I cannot recommend Gale’s cottage enough!
The location was so serene and peaceful - like a cozy little oasis away from all of the hustle and bustle. Gale was a kind and responsive host, but was also very respectful of privacy, and her cooking was amazing!
As a solo female traveler, I felt completely safe at the cottage and in the surrounding towns, and would highly recommend to all!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"A lovely and quite secluded spot - Gale has managed to cram quite a lot of useful stuff, both decorative and functional, into a relatively small space - felt quite at home very quickly! The surrounding countryside is beautiful, peaceful and quiet. Really enjoyed our stay."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,From the moment you drive up to Kate’s Cottage you feel a sense of serenity. The cottage provided us a calm resting place in a move across country. We were able to sit on the front porch feeling the breeze gently brush our face as we chatted about the rest of our journey. There was ample space for our dog to walk and stretch. The breakfast delivered right to the Cottage was delivered and very much appreciated.
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Gale's beautiful farm was exactly what we needed for a weekend getaway. The land was both private but somehow alive, the animals loved our puppy, and we got some much needed rest and refreshment. The reviews citing Gale's cooking CANNOT be overstated, we were never once wanting. Charming, fun, and above all else, Gale did everything possible to make it feel like home."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Gale's place was absolutely perfect. It's an ideal getaway: a cute cottage surrounded by friendly goats, cats, and the world's sweetest, happiest dog. The breakfast every morning is delicious and homemade (and honestly, enough to cover lunch as well). Would definitely stay there again."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Gale was an awesome host. Our stay was peaceful and relaxing. The breakfast and treats were great! We would definitely stay again when we're in the area.
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We were so happy to return to Gale's wonderful cottage- it was a bit like coming home. Wonderful breakfasts, gracious and flexible host, and charming setting. It was good to see you again Gale, and we hope to be back in the fall."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,Gale is a great host. The area is quiet and peaceful. Breakfast was delicious way way above and beyond what we expected. She makes it feel like home.
2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,Awesome stay. Great cottage and gale provided a lovely breakfast. Would recommend for a nice retreat!
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I was so curious to how gale had 575 satisfied customers with 5 stars. I honestly now know. She brought us the most delicious breakfast everyday of our stay. Her cooking was unbelievable. We had a great time with the cats they were so funny. The special notes throughout the house uplifting, warm , and funny. Kates place felt just like home. Truly one of a kind host I can’t tell you enough . You have to experience this if ever in the area."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,The cottage was a relaxing getaway for the weekend.
2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,I wish I could have stayed longer. It’s the most wonderful place. I highly recommend staying here and bring spoiled by Gale. Her son Alex is also an incredible person and creative spirit. He invited me to see his shop and work. Impressive. The entire family worked to renovate this cottage. It’s perfection.
2023-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We had a great stay at Gale’s cottage.
It has lovely charm!
Gale is very responsive and helped us get in without any problems. Our pups were very happy to be able to have the space to stretch their legs.
We got the best chocolate chip cookies and an amazing breakfast to start our long day driving off right :)
Would definitely recommend!"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"Exactly as described. Very kind , responsive ,hospitable hosts that go the extra mile and it just kinda reminded me of how we as people are supposed to treat each other . She reminded me by making cookies and a delicious breakfast for me . Offered to let me use there lab top if i wanted to watch movies. And by giving me the option to come into the home they live in if i wanted or needed internet. They didnt have to offer or do any of those things but it sure was nice! people forget we are all gods children and are here in this together and we should always be kind to one another. Thanks Gale for an awesome stay!!!"
2023-02-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Gale is an excellent host who has put so much thought and care into every detail of her guests' experience. We would stay here again in a heartbeat!
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Gale was a great host. She left us with scrumptious cookies, kind notes, and delicious breakfasts which were ready for our time of choice. She has goats and chickens on the property but we couldn't see them this time of the year due to all of the wind and snow. She was nice enough to let our 3 dogs stay with us at no extra charge and they played with Flo. The home was cozy and vastly decorated, if you want to learn the history of the Gale's forefathers, there is a book on the chest in the living room. We hope to stop by when the weather is better. We highly recommend staying here to get that farm and country feel."
2023-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"We had another delightful stay at Gale’s place! It’s a hidden gem. So quaint, cozy & relaxing. The perfect getaway. We enjoyed a beautiful winter sunset & sunrise. And Gale also treated us to a delicious breakfast in the morning. It was perfect. Can’t wait to come back again!!"
2022-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We love Kate’s Cottage! Simply the best and one of our favorites!! Unplugged and cozy, Gale had the cottage all ready for us to stay just before Christmas! It was decorated so adorable and she had Christmas treats out! She also made sure we’d be warm enough (we stayed on a night with -10 degree weather not including wind. I’m here to report that we were warm - almost hot!) It was great in the attic also. Gale was so great to check on us to make sure as the kids were upstairs. The new attic section is adorable and was perfect for our two kids. Breakfast was also amazing. We had such a nice time just reading, playing games and doing puzzles. Thank you Gale!"
2022-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Gale was very responsive and asked when we wanted breakfast and if we had any dietary restrictions but I was unable to stay at Gales due to whiteout blizzard conditions. Gale was very responsive as the weather conditions were changing quickly but told me not to worry and that she would refund me.
If I am able to stay when the conditions are better, I would gladly do so. You can really tell that she is a great host and even better person"
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Our third stay… and we’ll keep coming back! The perfect retreat for us from busy city lives. Gale’s hospitality and the peaceful location are incredible, every single time!!"
2022-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,We are on our way down south for the holidays and had stayed here for one night. I honestly wish we could have stayed a few more nights! It was so peaceful and cozy. Everything was very clean and the host was so friendly. The cottage was decorated with Christmas things and I loved it. Hot breakfast was served and it was delicious! Their dog Flo also greeted us the night we came in. She was so nice :) I definitely want to come back if we drive through the area again.
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Kate's Cottage was exactly what I needed for a personal retreat. It was welcoming and cozy inside and a beautiful place to walk with lots of peace outside. Along with a beautiful place to stay, a warm breakfast each morning was above and beyond. Thank you, Gale, for your hospitality and sharing your cottage. I look forward to staying again soon."
2022-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"There are not enough words to say how fabulous Gale’s cottage is. We were in the process of moving to a new home and stayed here on our way. We will be back! The peace and comfort provided allowed us to rest and recover. Oh , the scrumptious breakfast, wow what a treat. If you need peaceful relaxation, this is the place to stay! She allowed us to have our pets travel with us stress free. Our boys were so at ease, truly a blessing."
2022-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"If your looking for a peaceful, cozy country home to rest after a long day traveling or to escape the hustle and bustle of life - Kate’s Cottage is your place. Well worth the short drive from the interstate.
The cottage is lovingly decorated with period pieces as well as seasonal items- that make you feel right at home. The finishing touch was the AMAZING breakfast delivered to the back door.
Gale truly is a Super host!"
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Gale was such a kind and gracious hostess! We arrived to a very welcoming atmosphere with personal touches. The breakfast was well presented and so very good! It was so relaxing being there! Grateful for her beautiful cottage! Look forward to visiting again!
2022-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Fantastic, Comfortable, Historic Cottage decorated with detail. The sunset on the farm was perfect and the grounds of which you can walk about feel like you are in a movie. There is an attic upstairs that is fully finished with an extra bed for an extra charge and totally worth it. Gale is super sweet and will make sure you have everything you need. Plenty of space for you to walk around with beautiful grounds. I would recommend this place for anyone who wants to avoid the burden of staying in the city and who wants a peaceful, comfortable and quiet stay."
2022-11-01,5,Stayed one night,Great place with a great host.
2022-10-01,5,Stayed one night,The cottage is picture -perfect! My husband and I absolutely loved our stay here. It was relaxing and rejuvenating and Gale went above and beyond as a host!
2022-10-01,5,Stayed one night,Kate's Cottage is a great place to stay. We are repeat visitors. We love the quiet country setting and Gale's hospitality.
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Kate’s Cottage is a magical destination. Our oldest son attends USD, which is a 15-20 minute drive from the cottage. It’s the perfect place to stay while visiting your student! Gale’s attention to detail is unmatched and her breakfast is fantastic. We will continue to try to stay at the cottage when we visit our son."
2022-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"The cottage is on a beautiful farm and is super easy to get into. The cottage is super cute and decorated for the season by Gale. Gale seems to have a sense of humor that made the stay sweet and fun. And to top it all off, she cooked us breakfast and left it at our door in the morning. It was delicious and so sweet."
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The cottage was great and we loved the farm. The fact that it was pet friendly meant we could share our wonderful experience with our dog. He even got to “meet” the goats. My wife has dietary restrictions and Gale asked beforehand and adjusted the breakfast food to meet her needs. Overall an amazing experience.
2022-10-01,5,Stayed one night,Beautiful experience at Kate's Cottage & Gale was delightful!
2022-10-01,5,Stayed one night,Absolutely wonderful stay at Kate's cottage! Gale is a superb host that makes you feel right at home. you simply must stay if you're passing through!
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Kate’s Cottage is fantastic! The cottage is amazingly cute, cozy and a joy to experience. The breakfast is beyond expectations. Gale has poured her love into this place and it shows. We could not have been more pleased. You will not be disappointed whether just passing through or staying a few days. It’s one of our top Airbnb experiences."
2022-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"This is such a special place. It was an honor to be part of the history here, and the attention to hospitality is unmatched. I wish I lived near by so I could come visit on the regular! Thanks so much!"
2022-09-01,5,Stayed with a pet,The ultimate escape!
2022-09-01,5,Stayed one night,My only true regret was not truly having enough time to enjoy this little slice of heaven. I recommend anyone staying spend a decent amount of time star gazing. The chickens are really friendly and sweet as is the cat! I was greeted by so much warmth. And I'm truly looking forward to staying here again in the near future!
2022-09-01,5,Stayed with a pet,A great overnight stay at Kate’s Cottage was all that it lived up to be in farm living. Loved the animals and so did our dog meeting her first chicken. Amazing place!
2022-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"I wanted to treat my mom to a special getaway for her birthday, and this couldn't have been any more perfect. My mom is still talking about it! We loved every moment there. The cottage is so cozy and quaint, and the setting is absolutely beautiful. We enjoyed sitting on the front porch in the evening watching the full moon and again in the morning drinking coffee in our robes. It is just so peaceful there. In the morning, Gale delivered a delicious breakfast to our door too. Everything is done so thoughtfully. We will definitely be back to stay again and plan on bringing others to experience it too!"
2022-09-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Definitely a great getaway location, Gale was awesome and very communicative! It's an adorable place."
2022-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Gale's listing is wonderful, as a host she's wonderful, very friendly, very welcoming. I was excited also to have the chance to meet Flo her dog.
Everything involving the host, the property and the experience of sharing a slice of life with Gale was wonderful. There was a big negative though, me.
I've stayed at many Airbnbs in the past, we almost always bring our dogs. Up until recently we've always traveled with our big popup kennel. A few months ago I decided that our dogs never showed any destructive traits so it was a waste of space in our tight little jeep setup. As we were leaving my girlfriend said ""are you sure you don't want to bring the kennel"" I said ""nope, they're all good, we trust them"".
In hindsight that was very dumb, but also against the rules. While not mentioned in Gale's house rules page in the description it does clearly state that dogs aren't to be left alone in the cottage unless in a kennel. I missed that completely. The first night was fine, the second day, wasn't. I'm guessing they were startled by something outside, what it was doesn't really matter but our pups (I think I know which one) damaged the blinds inside of the cottage. We got the call as we were heading into Sioux Falls, Gale reminded me of the kennel policy (again which I completely overlooked). She showed lenience on us though as she allowed them to stay in the mud room, which wasn't ideal for any of us but it was an option that excused me from finding another place to stay or a new kennel. Everything else went well and as far as I can say no other hitches. My own hubris caused a dark cloud over the trip though. Sometimes we need to stop, and listen to our partners and do a reality check. I won't forget this one. Thanks Gale, I hope we're able to stay with you again sometime, kennel in tow."
2022-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This stay was so much more than we could have imagined. The place was exactly what we needed! Quiet, comfortable great setting and the best place out Aussie could have hoped for. Gale was a super host and very welcoming."
2022-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"What a charming and welcoming home! From the lovely farm setting to the homemade breakfast delivered to your door, this place is perfect! It is also very nice that Gale allows pets. The house was also equipped with everything you need - from good coffee to toiletries! Highly recommend!"
2022-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Our stay at Kate’s cottage was the much needed little oasis in South Dakota that during our cross country road trip. We appreciated all of the little things that made our stay so comfortable— cookies waiting for us, breakfast in the morning, a welcome sign and notes, toiletries, etc. Rarely on AirBnb do you find a true BnB. Gale thought of it all. The price was great and the location was worth the extra drive to be on the most charming farm. Couldn’t recommend this stay enough— it’s a must go. The only thing that would have made this stay better was if we could have spent another night."
2022-08-01,5,Stayed one night,Wonderful place to stay! We have stayed here several times and love it. The cottage is beautiful and peaceful. Breakfast is amazing. Highly recommended!
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Gale was the sweetest and most caring host. The breakfasts were fantastic, the cabin was clean and the perfect spot to relax!"
2022-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Perfect embrace back into the midwest. The cottage is beyond tranquil--so much personality and warmth. The bed is bliss. The only Airbnb to date I've stayed where a full breakfast was brought to the door (in a picnic basket). The cottage stands out most of all due to Gale's gorgeous attention to everything--she's on site (though my quick stay didn't facilitate meeting her) and tends to every detail first-hand. The first thing I saw upon arrival was a sign hung on the front door welcoming me and my pup by name. I loved that the cottage is disconnected. (I did have an emergency phone call that I was able to take--two bars of cell service were strong in the cottage).
2022-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"We loved our time at Kate's Cottage! From the amazing country views, to the comfy bed, to the friendly pets, to the delicious breakfast! If we ever pass through the area again, we definitely will stop by and stay! Gale left notes and information and made the stay very nice!"
2022-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Folks, GO OUT OF YOUR WAY to stay here, but only if you love and value things like beauty, history, nature, and wholesomeness. If the idea of barn swallows and petunias with your morning coffee and frittata doesn't appeal to you, look elsewhere (but reconsider your life choices!)"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,just perfect
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Everything was perfect, check in was smooth, everything was clean, bed was comfortable, and the history of the cottage was fascinating. Breakfast in the morning was the perfect way to start the day before a long drive west. We also loved meeting all the animals, Olive loved Flo and meeting the herd!"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Lovely space! The cottage is decorated with a touch of yesterday and is perfect for unplugging from the outside world and refreshing your inner person. Gale was a wonderful communicator, and we loved greeting her four-legged friends every morning."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Looking for a great place to stretch out and relax after being cooped up in the car for many hours? That’s exactly what we found at Kate’s cottage!
Gale was very hospitable and accommodated our travel schedule buy adjusting her routine so we can still enjoy the breakfast with homemade baked goods. We will absolutely choose to stay here if we drive cross country again.
Flo is also the most adorable greeter there ever was."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Kate’s Cottage is a charming and cozy place on a lovely little farm. We greatly enjoyed our stay there, and Gale is a simply wonderful host. We loved her delicious breakfast, too!"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"500+ 5 star reviews should inspire confidence, I'll add mine anyway. The place is delightful, the breakfast was great... but it's knowing someone is doing all this when it's not necessary- but from a sense of (I'm guessing) pride of place, a love of a job well done, and care for others that is so restorative. Thank you Gale!"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"Last stop on our 3wk camping trip toward home….felt even better to crawl into a real bed, and know that in the morning someone special was going to leave breakfast at the door. That someone special is the host of this little gem! She sure knows how to appreciate her family’s heritage farm and share with others! From the greeting of her kitty and pup, to the soft lighting of the sun setting through the windows, the coolness of the a/c on a muggy night, to the thoughtfulness of Gale’s French toast sitting in the kitchen, it was all so perfect. This cottage is perfect. A lovely stopping point to rest and breathe in the beautiful surroundings. Thank you for that Gale. 🌸"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed one night,We had a great time! Our 2nd visit!
2022-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"A gorgeous place, delicious breakfast, a perfect place to stay."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Gale was a great hostess. We enjoyed the quiet and all the personal touches. A great gluten free breakfast, clean, cozy and comfortable. A great value. We will be back."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed one night,Echoing what other reviewers have said about this beautiful cabin. It was the perfect night’s respite for a cross-country road trip. Hospitable host & friendly animals - I would definitely stay here again!
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Kate's Cottage is an extraordinary Airbnb experience! Hosts Gale and Galen truly have created a work-of-art 1930's style cottage, with the conveniences of running water, indoor plumbing and AC.
Safe, quiet, and delightful stay. We've added this to one of our top stays!"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We love Kate’s Cottage so very much! Gale is simply the best host! She is so welcoming and hospitable. Our whole family loves the cottage, even our dog who got to go back to his roots and helped Gale herd the goats back into their pen! The kids love it and so do we. Also Gale is a great cook/baker, we enjoyed the breakfast and appreciated the gluten free accommodations! Thank you Gale!"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This was the most unique and cute Airbnb!!
The cottage was super comfy and quiet. We were traveling with our 2 labs and they were able to roam the farm and check out the chickens and goats!
Gale greeted us upon arrival (and made some great recommendations for the rest of our road trip), but gave us free reign of the farm to explore (plenty of privacy). We also had fresh cookies in the kitchen upon arrival (yum)!
Gale quietly dropped breakfast off the next morning at the door (at the time we specified). It was the cutest setup but was also an AMAZING breakfast.
We only stayed one night, but this was the perfect stop on our long road trip. Beds were comfortable and we had all amenities needed; full kitchen with fridge and microwave, shower with toiletries, etc.
There is no tv, but we didn’t need it. Exploring the farm was fun and the cottage also has puzzles/cards if you are traveling with kids.
I would absolutely recommend Gale’s cottage and will be staying again when we road trip through there in the future!"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Just stop looking and book this place...it really is that great. There isn't wifi or a tv, but for an unplugged, cozy stay you can't ask for anything better. The host (Gale) is amazing--she's kind and welcoming (and is super cool with letting you chill at her dining room table if you have to get on the internet). The goats and chickens are steps away, the area is incredibly quiet, and the space is incredibly comfortable. No fenced yard but I'd guess they'd be okay with off-leash pets if you asked (mine are runners so didn't try). Memory foam mattress that is medium firm, A/C worked on a pretty hot SD weekend. The fact that breakfast is included in your stay (and the breakfast is superb) is amazing. Definitely recommend, definitely would stay again."
2022-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This place was exactly what I was looking for. Remote, adorable, and away from everything where my dog and I could enjoy some solitude.
Gale was so communicative. The cottage was adorable. There were cookies upon arrival which was much appreciated after a long drive.
We explored the property and saw the goats and chickens. We took a walk down a dirt road. There is just acre upon acre of farmland. It’s breathtaking!!!
Breakfast in the morning was so nice and perfect before our journey back home. We had to get one more walk in before we left. There are barely any cars on the road.
What a beautiful place to relax and unwind away from all the nuisances of the world!
Highly recommend. I’ll definitely be back."
2022-06-01,5,Stayed one night,This place is a gem. Has everything you could need. Bed was super comfortable and breakfast was fantastic.
2022-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,We felt so welcomed at this cottage! Gale is friendly and accomodating and the cottage is the perfect getaway. Our toddlers also felt right at home and enjoyed feeding the goats and meeting Flo the dog!
2022-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"What a GEM! This cottage is so quaint, comfortable and relaxing. A lovely drive out, and a step back into a peaceful time. The kitchen is equipped with all you need to cook a meal. (Just add food) In the bedroom you’ll find a comfortable memory foam bed with crisp linens. Outdoors, the setting is so peaceful as you watch the goats play or have a visit from Flo. We had the pleasure of meeting Gale and enjoyed some great conversation. The best part, as many others have mentioned and definitely worth the stay is the true B-n-B experience Gale provides, a divine breakfast delivered hot and fresh at your door. If you’re in the area, do yourself a favor and stay."
2022-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Gale's cottage is so charming! She is an excellent host. We had a great stay on the most idyllic farm.
2022-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We are repeat visitors to Gale's and love staying there. The cottage is very clean, cute, and comfortable. Gale is a welcoming and inviting host. Her setting is picture perfect and her cottage is a wonderful place to stay. The breakfast is truly 5 star. It is by far the best breakfast we've ever had during any stay (including B&B's, etc.). We couldn't give this Airbnb a stronger recommendation - it is well worth the visit."
2022-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This cottage is wonderful! Not only is it quiet and comfortable, but Gale is an excellent host who was accommodating of my food allergens and thought ahead about my dogs’ needs. For others traveling with dogs, the Airbnb is on a hard road with little traffic so it’s easy to walk your dogs. I can’t recommend this Airbnb enough. If you’re looking to spend the night around Beresford, look no further!"
2022-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Kate’s Cottage was absolutely wonderful and Gale the perfect host. The cottage itself is full of charm and history. It was comfortable and well supplied with everything we needed and wanted. Gale’s breakfast was delicious. We had a wonderful chat with Gale and took a few walks along the country roads accompanied by Flo, the friendly dog. It was relaxing, peaceful and a great place to stay."
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,BEST Airbnb I’ve ever stayed at. Everything was perfect from start to finish. Gale is a TRUE ‘super host’. Will definitely stay again and recommend to anyone I come into contact with! Well worth it!
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,What an amazing incredible gem! If I could give it 10 🌟 I would! I rally is a Bed and Breakfast Plus!!!! Gale is amazing and her fur and feather friends are precious! What a beautiful place to unplug from this not so nice world right now! Gales detail to her touches in the cottage make you feel like you are in a story book! Could not have been happier with our stay! Thank you Gale!♥️
2022-05-01,5,Stayed one night,Gale does absolutely fantastic at adding personal touches throughout the cottage to make it your home away from home. The animals even take you in as their own! We had such a great time unplugging and enjoying the space. There truly is so much rest and beauty to experience here. We look forward to being back and experiencing other seasons at the cottage!
2022-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Stop looking for a place to stay and book this place if you can. Gale is an A+ host who has created a little slice of heaven that can be yours for the night (or two or three or four…). The cottage has been lovingly restored to a charming sanctuary in the perfect setting to unplug, unwind, and recharge. We loved the peace, quiet, delicious homemade breakfast (and cookies!) and comfortable bed, while our 18-month-old son loved feeding the goats and chasing Flo (the friendliest pup ever). Truly a remarkable experience that we will always cherish. We’re already looking at dates to return!"
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We cannot say enough good things about Kate’s Cottage. Gale was an incredible host. Breakfast was absolutely amazing! It’s worth the money just for breakfast. It’s an easy drive in to Sioux Falls. It’s actually perfect to remove yourself from city life and relax on the peaceful farm. It felt secluded and comfortable. The cottage itself is cute and well kept. Communication was wonderful. The easiest 5 stars I’ve ever given.
2022-05-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Wow! Wow! Wow! This place was perfect the breakfast was perfect. We are traveling across the country and needed a home away from home. 10/10 recommend great for dogs! We loved it
2022-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"This is an incredible little place to stay. A wonderful little 30s cottage on a farm. Super clean, homey, and the hosts are responsive and accommodating. The host made the best breakfast I've ever experienced at an air bnb. The place also has the nicest dog you will meet at an air bnb. The lack of TV and wifi is a nice break. Unplug and enjoy this wonderful little spot in southern SD."
2022-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"This was the best stay of our entire cross country road trip! Gale was extremely sweet, making breakfast and having it delivered to the cottage warm for you whenever you request it! Feeding the goats on the farm was an awesome activity to do as well before heading out. Happy to be a part if the history of Kate’s Cottage!"
2022-05-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Gale’s place is absolutely perfect. My sister and I stayed for only one night on our trip from Washington to Illinois, but we wish that we could have stayed longer. Gale is a wonderful human being and her existence gives me hope for humanity. The homemade breakfast that she made for us was phenomenal, and paired with toppings, fresh strawberries, and love. I can only hope to get the chance to stay here again sometime. If you have the chance, this is a MUST STAY! Thank you Gale for everything. We will think of you always!"
2022-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"To start my review of Kate’s Cottage, I will say that I’ve been trying to think of a good excuse to go back there, hopefully as soon as possible. We are on a cross-country drive from Washington State to Ohio, feeling grateful for the opportunity to have stayed in Gale’s beautifully restored farm cottage as we made our way through South Dakota. Gale is the best of hosts – so friendly and helpful. We had a blissfully quiet night’s sleep and a delicious breakfast. The farm itself is a piece of history. Also in the area is an historic church (the pastor gave us a tour). Although Kate’s Cottage is out along a rural road, it is quite close to Beresford (excellent grocery store, Fiesta Foods), and not far from Vermillion. As I said, we’re hoping to find our way back there!"
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Gale is the greatest Airbnb host I have ever interacted with and Kate's Cottage is a little slice of Heaven. Upon arrival, I was greeted by the friendly farm dog, Flo, and a plate of homemade chocolate chip cookies and banana bread! Each morning, Gale delivered freshly-prepared breakfasts and even took my dietary restriction into consideration. The cottage itself was perfectly decorated and cleaned spotless. Not only that, but Gale was quick to communicate and very accommodating of our needs. If I could move-in to Kate's Cottage, I absolutely would!"
2022-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"This was one of our favorite Air B&Bs, ever! From the quaint and comfortable cottage, to the sweet animals, to the delicious breakfast, we can't rate this highly enough. We would highly recommend this cottage to anyone passing through the area. Thank you so much for the fantastic hospitality!!"
2022-04-01,5,Stayed one night,The stay at the cottage was absolutely perfect. Beautiful touches throughout made it feel like home away from home. Breakfast was amazing and Gale was a fantastic host!
2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Loved my stay at Kates Cottage. I’m current on a road trip with my dogs and the quiet nature of the cottage was everything we were looking for.
The little decorative touches that Gale did for Easter were so special. She asked about dietary preferences and was very accommodating. Breakfast was absolutely delicious. I would high recommend staying here"
2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This home is charming, clean, and comfortable. The breakfast is also delicious. For a comparable price, this is so much better than a hotel!"
2022-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Just what we needed.
2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at Kate's Cottage. From Flo the dog greeting us to the cozy comfort, to the unplugged quiet, to the delicious breakfasts--it was all perfect!"
2022-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"Cozy, quiet, and quaint. Kate’s Cottage is delightful if you’re looking to unplug and get away from it all. Gale and Flo were enthusiastic and gracious hostesses. The goats and chickens were more aloof and only mildly curious of us. Alas, we didn’t see Jack. The cottage is well-stocked and had so many historical, family, and personal touches from the furnishings to the pictures and even the deeds on the wall and the books in the book basket. The yummy welcome cookies were appreciated as was the hot, delivered right to your door with all of the fixings, breakfast. We wished that we could have stayed for several more days."
2022-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We really enjoyed our time at the cottage thanks to Gale! This cute little place is tucked away where there’s a stillness and simplicity you didn’t know you needed until you’ve experienced it. Communication and check-in was great and our unique needs were accommodated. Gale’s thoughtfulness really makes the stay a wonderful experience! Books for my little girl, pastries I had trouble sharing with the family, and let me emphasize a well-rounded breakfast in the morning to your liking! Seriously can’t rave enough. If you are passing through the area or just looking to get away for a bit, you won’t regret staying here. Thanks again!"
2022-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"This was the perfect get-away location! It was single digits when we visited but the home was nice and toasty. The snacks and breakfast that Gale brought made us feel like we were very loved and welcomed. It truly felt like home, and I hope you have the same experience too. Don't forget to check out the local towns for coffee and shopping!"
2022-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,If you have the chance to stay here DO IT! This is an absolute gem! So clean and beautifully decorated. It has everything you could need. Gale makes the best breakfast ever!
2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We chose Kate’s Cottage as the location for our wedding anniversary for many reasons and they all proved to be true and good. First, we wanted to “get away from it all.” The cottage is on an old farmstead in a rural area typical of what one would imagine South Dakota to be like, a cluster of buildings surrounded by a windbreak in a sea of acres and acres of farmland. Coyotes were howling at sundown on our first night and then the most wonderful quiet ever came with the darkness. There was a CD player with a little selection of music and we played the flute CD and had a glass of wine while relaxing and talking in a most comfortable living room. Sleep was undisturbed and the bed very comfortable. Breakfast brought to our door (the second reason we chose this location) was the best treat of all! Gale asked about dietary preferences and fashioned two lovely and very hearty breakfasts for us that filled us so much that we didn’t even need to eat lunch! We picked up a yummy Casey’s pizza the first night and brought our own food to be microwaved on the second night since we knew the weather was not going to be the best. The third reason we chose the cottage was because we wanted to bring our two little terriers with us. They just loved their little walks around the farm and snoozing near us in the warm cottage. We chose to visit a friend 35 minutes away in Sioux Falls for our outing on Saturday, but considered hiking in local state parks or visiting Vermillion. The quaintness of the cabin provided a setting that was super comfortable and private for a lovely weekend for us! Thanks, Gale, for being such a great host!"
2022-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Wow! This place is a gem. I was on road-trip with my dogs and the cottage provided the perfect spot to rest and relax. Gale makes everything feel so cozy and inviting. The breakfast in the morning was delicious! We had the best time and can't wait to stay again!
2022-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"A lovely cottage on the prairie.
Rich with history and finding new life as a peaceful resting place in this face paced world."
2022-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"If you love animals, vintage homes, delicious breakfasts, and are wanting to unplug and escape into another world, this is the place. We were greeted by a very friendly cat and dog, and enjoyed the goats and chickens nearby. Easy to find location, beautiful farm, and a comfortable little home! Thanks!"
2022-02-01,5,Stayed one night,We continue to love staying at this adorable cottage! Breakfast is amazing! We will always stay here whenever we are in the area!
2022-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"Kates Cottage was the perfect stay to unwind, relax and enjoy South Dakota’s beauty! The barn and goats were fun to see and Gale let us feed them with her! Jack the cat and Flo are amazing little pets and we greatly enjoyed them! I woke up early and saw the sunrise above the barn and it was breathtaking. We slept amazing and enjoyed every ounce of this sweet retreat!! Definitely want to come back!!!"
2022-02-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Loved our stay at Kates cottage. It was a home away from home. The lovely cottage was super clean, quiet and well-appointed. Breakfast was hot and delicious. A wonderful respite to break up a long drive. Loved reading about the history of the renovation."

2022-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"This was our 2nd time at Gale's, and we have loved every stay we have had at her. It is a little, quaint, quiet, secluded cabin cottage, that just gives you that necessary break from your mundane life! It is an offline cottage, with some board games, light reads options available. Gale provides breakfast in the morning and we are suckers for that. She is very quick in responding and always available. The place is always very clean, full of basic amenities, and always has magical decorations. We have gone to her cottage in Winter and now want to visit her in the Summer to enjoy her farm as well :)!"
2021-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Charming, comfortable, quiet and high-character historic cottage between Sioux City and Sioux Falls.

2021-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We were looking for a place to have a little weekend retreat away from the kids and all the other busyness. The cottage was the perfect spot. Decorated beautifully for the holidays, we felt warm and welcomed immediately—we had everything we needed and then some. The breakfast was amazing! We brought the pooch along and were able to give him some much-needed attention. If you are looking for a quiet spot to unwind, a place where you will feel a sense of care and comfort, the cottage is a great spot. We’ll be back!"
2021-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"Kate's Cottage is our favorite Air BNB in all the land!! As repeat visitors we have had only the BEST experiences. We highly recommend Kate's cottage for all the seasons, even winter! The cottage was warm, cozy, and just adorable with all of the Christmas decor. We had lots of fun out in the snow with our kids. Gale is a WONDERFUL host, with so many thoughtful touches and accommodations! And she is a wonderful baker/cook!"
2021-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This was hands down the best Airbnb I have ever stayed at. Gale was so lovely and helpful, the cottage was all decorated for Christmas and was so homey and warm.

2021-11-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Looking for somewhere quiet, beautiful & low key... well look no further! Kates cottage is EXACTLY that plus more! Between the pet visits and hospitality you’ll never want to stay anywhere else. The cottage was equipped with everything you could need from dish’s to bathroom products!
Beresford is also conveniently located between vermillion and Siox falls so the location is perfect."
2021-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"This place is stellar!! I wish I could have stayed longer! I was only passing through but feel like I found a true gem.

Only regret we had was that we only stayed one night as we were passing thru on our way home.
2023-08-01,5,Group trip,We enjoyed out stay at the Cozy Coyote Den. Kris was wonderful and accommodating.

This place provided enough sleeping accommodations, comfy seating, cute and functional little kitchen, and it was easy for my country children to ride their bikes to activities. If needing a place to stay with a larger family and want kitchen abilities, this place is a perfect fit. Also, with the available washer and dryer you can pack clean clothes to bring back home! Kris was also very responsive to any questions."

Kris has thought of everything. The couches, beds and pillows are SO comfortable. The location is amazing. There is a grill/bar about two blocks away with great burgers and cheap drinks. Walmart is about 3 minutes away and campus about 5 minutes away depending on the lights. Kris was also kind enough to drop off crockpots and make sure the grill was ready to go. We can’t wait to stay there again. I have never slept better! Thanks Kris!!"

Overall, really appreciate the stay!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We really enjoyed our stay at the Teeny Tiny House! Very peaceful and quiet, out in the country. The area is shared by a couple other Tiny homes but all still have their own areas and not disruptive at all! Stephanie was fantastic, definitely had everything we needed.

Though it rained for much of our stay, we did not feel cramped. It was very pleasant watching movies with the provided indoor projector and streaming services.
Stephanie is a wonderful host! She made sure we knew all the instructions for how to find and enter the house and felt comfortable with the check-out instructions.
One thing to note, is the neighboring family does live fairly close to the tiny house, and they are morning people, like me. They were very respectful of our space and privacy."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Our Son asked if he could come back sometime, so we see that as a sign of a great place and fun time! He enjoyed the unique experience and loved the hammock.

Stephanie was a phenomenal host, she checked in with us several times to make sure we checked in smoothly and had everything we needed. The surroundings were beautiful and the view at night from the skylight over the bed was breathtaking. I would highly recommend the teeny tiny house to anyone wanting a cozy, peaceful and unique place to stay."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I stayed here for a weekend getaway. Stephanie is friendly and responsive, and it's a beautiful house, full of clever uses of space like a tiny house should be. My goal was to just unplug and slow down, and the house and its surroundings definitely helped. I would absolutely stay here again."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed one night,Great place to stay! We only got to spend one night but the tiny house was very cozy and clean. Great experience!

2023-11-01,5,Stayed one night,This teeny tiny home was very peaceful and I love the location. Stephanie is friendly and has thought of everything!
2023-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"Stephanie was a wonderful host- proactive communication, wonderful guidebook with great local recommendations, made sure we were able to get all settled in with no issues, and checked in periodically throughout our stay to make sure we didn’t need anything or have any questions.
The tiny house was also amazing. It was clean, had all the amenities you could ask for and more (the heated floors were my personal favorite), and just adorable. We were a little nervous knowing there were other houses near the property but we didn’t see anyone the whole time and there was a partial privacy fence that covered the view between the tiny home and the house behind it. So that was a non-issue!
Per Stephanie’s recommendations we visited Ponca State Park (I highly recommend checking it out), ate at Outlaw Pizza and stopped at B&S Trading Post for groceries. All of it was wonderful and the people were very friendly.
All in all it was a great place to stay and a fun little place to visit!"

2023-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Stephanie was a great host! We have stayed in many Airbnb’s very few stand up to the photos, but her’s did! She was very prompt to take care of any questions and or concerns not that there were many considering how well she put together her guide book! Check in was a breeze, she had great directions to the location, check out was simple! Overall well worth the price of admission! 100% recommend staying in her tiny homes!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Loved this little home! Absolutely adorable! Loved the twinkley lights all around the home & the use of space was very impressive for the size! Will def stay again! So peaceful and made for a wonderful, relaxing, anniversary weekend!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,Peaceful retreat. Beautiful fall colors. I enjoyed walking the prayer trail and visiting Ponca State Park. The tiny house had so many interesting details!
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"This place is adorable and clean and exactly as described. Obviously you would only stay here if you are a tiny-house enthusiast (my 6'3"" husband is not, but he was not on this trip!). The star of the show is the gorgeous setting, and there is a beautiful large porch on the house to help you make the most of it."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This was a quiet and easy place to enjoy a peaceful weekend away from the city!

2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"I loved my stay. So quiet and peaceful. Big windows with sweet views. So many amenities. Like every detail was anticipated. Really enjoyed the skylight above the bed, the outdoor space for cooking and hanging out. Super communicative and accommodating.

2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place was 100% every bit of what I was looking for in a stress-free, mini-getaway - I can't say enough good things! The moment you step inside, it's obvious that Stephanie has given this little house so much love and attention! It's beautifully made and every inch feels like it was crafted for comfort. The compactness of it actually made it really easy to settle in and still keep clean while there. Everything from the large porch to the big living-area windows to the loft skylight (probably my favorite thing!) made it easy to feel surrounded by nature, whether outside or inside. And there are so many options for cooking and eating - honestly, makes you want to try a little bit of everything.
The property too has the kind of views you could just sit and enjoy again and again. And Stephanie herself was great - super friendly and it was obvious from the start that she really was as available as she promised and more than willing to make sure it was great experience. Thank you!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"For anyone who wishes to have a tiny-home-life experience, this is the REAL DEAL. Complete kitchen, and many creative DIY solutions to living with minimal space.

Check-in was a breeze, and the tiny house was even cuter in person (but she wasn't wrong, it is TINY!). Was a perfect little getaway spot for my dog and I. Quiet and comfy.

2023-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,I just returned from a weekend with my pups and just can’t say enough great things about Stephanie’s place. It had all the amenities we could want and the most peaceful outdoor space. There is plenty to do in the area and Stephanie provides a ton of recommendations. She was super communicative and willing to help with any questions or advice. You will not regret renting this property. We can’t wait for our next visit!
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Although this is a tiny home, it seemed to be roomier than what we had expected! The bed was comfortable, the skylight was dreamy, and the shower stayed hot! (We’ve had issues with previous tiny home stays and the hot water being less than hot.) I wish the weather would have been more cooperative for us to enjoy the outdoor amenities, but it also made for a cozy time spent inside. Note there is no TV, but we had no issues with WiFi and streaming on my iPad. Stephanie went over and beyond to meet (and surpass) our expectations. We would recommend to anyone staying in this area, and wouldn’t think twice about staying again in the future! (Also, the composting toilet is def one of the better setups we’ve used.)"

2023-03-01,5,Group trip,"A group of us rented Kary's home for a weekend snow goose hunt. The location was absolutely perfect as it ended up being ~15 miles from where we were hunting. Being out in the country, we were able to sit outside and watch thousands of birds during migration. The home was very comfortable, with enough room for our group to sit and visit in the evenings. Having access to the clean garage was extremely helpful with all of our gear! I slept in the downstairs Georgia room and it was one of the most comfortable beds I have slept on. There was enough space in the home to allow for our group to not feel crowded or rushed. Kary was very accommodating and between his messages and the notebook at the house with instructions, everything was very convenient. No complaints in the least bit and hope to stay here again in the future!"
2023-02-01,5,Stayed over a week,"Kary’s place was perfect for a two week long work trip, he was very responsive prior to and during our stay with and questions or comments we had.

I would highly recommend Kary’s place if visiting the area."

2019-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This was an amazing accommodation for our family of 6! If you're looking for a place where kids can run around, you can prepare some of your own food, and you can spend time bonding with loved ones, this is perfect! Spacious, clean, well-decorated living areas made us feel so comfortable and at home. Add in some kids games and puzzles and a great yard off a back country road, and we found ourselves wishing we had more time to take a real vacation at this place! Kary was a great communicator and SO flexible with us, we really appreciated it. We will definitely look for opportunities to return to this place, and stay longer!"

2019-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Ever wonder what it was like to live in a farmhouse…your neighbors not in sight? My mom, sisters, nieces and I love coming to “the farm”. It always feels like home. The home is spacious with plenty of room for family gatherings. It’s great for hiking (almost 4 miles if you go around the block). Not so remote that you can’t get to stores and restaurants in 15 minutes. It’s quiet, very clean, with plenty of towels. The host is very gracious. Can’t wait to come back again. Wish it was closer to Chicago."
2019-04-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Kary’s place is off the beaten path, but very close to Vermillion where my project was located.

The home was very comfortable, clean, and had lots of space for a family. Lots of towels (which are amazing btw), and comforts of home. Kary shared some cheese from a local dairy which was so thoughtful and amazing. I can't say enough about the ease of check in or our stay. Thanks for sharing your home!"
2018-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,Very nice ! There were even some board games available for the kids to play with.
2018-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,This farm is fantastic. Me and my three younger kids stayed here for one night on our way through on a long vacation and the farm was a very comfortable place to stay with a ton of amenities.

Thank you Kary!"
2018-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"To be fair I didn't actually end up staying the weekend I booked however, the communication with Kary was really good and he provided some good information for how to get to the farm. He seems friendly. I would book here again. And actually stay. Ha"

2018-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"It's a beautiful home, that has everything, in a beautiful farm area. It is a little out of town but well worth the drive. Quiet peaceful nights, and only a car or two passing in the day time. Sure better than a local motel."
2018-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,A well cared for quiet and comfortable retreat for families. Great attention to detail! All of the comforts of home and more. Would highly recommend!

2018-05-01,5,Group trip,"We were a party of 6 adults staying an entire week for a college and then high school graduation. Kary's place was perfect! We had enough space and privacy so that we weren't breathing down each others' necks.
Check in/out was a breeze. And the welcoming cheese/crackers/wine was a thoughtful touch.
The home is comfortable and clean with a well equipped kitchen. We cooked several meals to help save the money and tedium of eating out. The beds were comfortable, and extra blankets were nice to have in the basement rooms.
It was a nice ""home base"" for our trip, and we highly recommend Kary and his place for anyone thinking of visiting/staying in the area. You can't go wrong here."
2018-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The place was great. Everything you'd need and more. It's big, it's quiet and a very pleasant drive to anywhere we needed to go. We had 6 in our group so it was great bang for our buck, even with a weak Canadian dollar. Kary was great to deal with and everything went smooth as ""Golden"". ( A beer we used to drink. Very good)"
2018-03-01,5,Group trip,"Loved being able to just kick back and relax. It was cold and rainy time of year and it was nice and comfortable at the house. Had everything we needed. Great place to stay, we spent a lot of time in nearby Vermillion. Would be a great place for anyone coming to the area doing something at USD, say sporting event or parents weekend."
2018-03-01,5,Group trip,"This was my first airbnb experience and it worked out perfectly. Kary answered all questions quickly and was a pleasure to deal with. Very quiet place on a farm with plenty of room for 6 adults while we were in the area for a few days. All toiletries and cooking supplies are furnished for use just like at home. Great place, would stay again no question."

2017-12-01,5,Group trip,"Kary's place goes above and beyond to be a welcoming home-away-from-home. Other airbnb properties provide very little in the way of supplies, requiring the guest to purchase paper towels, toilet paper, dish soap, even salt and pepper. I can truly say that nearly everything we needed was there and available for our use, plus a few nice extras like wine and cheese to welcome us ""home."" What a great, quiet, comfortable place - 100% recommended!"

2017-07-01,5,Stayed over a week,"We both grew up in this area and we love to come back, but up to now we have had to stay in motels. Kary's farm will now be our favorite retreat and we will be checking his calendar to see when he has open dates. His home is spacious and he has paid attention to many details that make a stay enjoyable. Being surrounded by fields and sky lends a meditative quality to this farm. Having great laundry facilities is a plus, as is the fully equipped, spacious kitchen. Kary is a great host who communicates well."
2017-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"great space, lots of room for eating and family games. nice size kitchen, 2 car garage, quiet location, very clean."

2017-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The house is immaculate and like-new. Very quiet and comfortable. The photos don't do the interior justice. The beds are very comfortable as they have nice foam pads on them. There is a beautiful deck that overlooks a nice back yard with evergreens and deciduous trees. The AC is new is whisper-quiet - I slept in the master bedroom with the window open slightly and did not hear it. The laundry has new washing machines and dryer. Watched great thunderstorms from the deck. We hope to come back next summer.
2017-06-01,5,Stayed one night,What a wonderful place to stay!! Very clean and quiet. So much better than staying at a motel. A very family friendly home!! Will definitely stay there again!
2017-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Lovely split level home in quiet farming community. Close enough to Yankton and Sioux Falls if you need to go to town, but far enough out you can really unplug and get away! Highly recommend. Great host and great place! We plan to go back!"
2017-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"The place was an amazing place and our family loved every bit of the house. The atmosphere was very relaxing and the place made you feel at home. The amenities the home owner offered added that extra bit that made us feel even more comfortable. Being a mostly big city family, we LOVED the view of the stars and we even had Ana amazing view of the Milky Way. If you're ever this way, this is the place to stay!"
2017-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"Absolutely book your stay here. A little off the beaten path, but was a lovely farmhouse and it was refreshing to get off the highway for a bit. Kary was very accommodating and helpful."

2017-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What a gorgeous house! This place was amazingly beautiful, spacious and CLEAN! It's a little out of the way, but we loved the quiet solitude and the drive back and forth to Vermillion is beautiful and didn't seem long at all. The beds were very comfortable, the walk-in shower was awesome and the whole place felt like home from the beginning. Kary was a great host - he accommodated our weird schedule, and although we never had the privilege of meeting him in person, he seemed very accessible if we needed anything. If we are ever in the area again, we would love to stay again and would definitely recommend this listing to anyone!"
2017-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,A wonderfully comfortable home! Secluded and very quiet. The drive to Yankton is not a big deal at all-so worth it to have the amazing house and all of the comforts of home. Kary is a fabulous host!
2017-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The house is great! The bed are a bit stiff and it's out in the middle of nowhere but it's a huge house on land. It makes the perfect place to stay with kids so they can run around safely. We all would stay again and greatly recommend it!
2017-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My sisters and I had a wonderful time at Kary’s home. The accommodations were much more than we could have expected. The house was spacious, comfortable, and immaculate. The setting was perfect, an ideal spot for our girls-weekend-away! We loved the rural setting: quiet with plenty of wide open space to explore. The kitchen was well equipped too… in case you’re in the mood to make your own meals. We immediately felt at home and definitely enjoyed our stay.
We loved everything about the place and will definitely stay there again."

The kitchen was stocked with supplies for us to cook our own meals and even coffee! The bathrooms had plenty of towels, shampoo, conditioner, and body wash. It was so handy to have the washer and dryer there as well. Also, in the winter having a garage was ideal. My family and I definitely hope to stay again! We had a great experience and felt right at home! Alicia was very kind, understanding, flexible, and responsive! Couldn’t have asked for a better experience!"

2023-12-01,5,Group trip,"This is a great place to stay if you have a large family or group of individuals. We loved the many rooms with beds, not just pull-outs and sofa sleepers. The location was easy to find, and Alicia was great at communicating how to get in and giving suggestions about the community.
The place has everything you need to cook, so if you want to avoid eating out, that is possible. The location made it easy to access everything the town and the college had to offer.
My mom is in her mid-80s, and without this property, she would not have been able to come to see her granddaughter sing at the college."
2023-11-01,5,Group trip,"We loved staying in Vermillion. Everything at the duplex was perfect. The amenities were all we could ask for. The place accommodated our family well. Check in and check out were easy to follow, Alicia being a wonderful host. We would definitely stay again."

2023-08-01,5,Stayed over a week,I was installing a renovation at the National Music Museum on the University of North Dakota campus. Alicia's place was great and she was a great host. The two level floor plan made it feel like my coworker and I had separate apartments. We rented the townhouse from May to August and it became a home away from home. I would highly recommend Alicia's place.
2023-05-01,5,Stayed over a week,everything was as stated. It was a very nice place. It was a good fit to accommodate us for our job out here in Nebraska. I would recommend staying here if possible and hopefully working in the area so I can visit again
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The description and interior are spotless. Location is convenient. It is a duplex which should be noted as two bedrooms share a wall with the other unit. The neighbors were quiet. The space is smaller than expected but very comfortable. One nice experience is the morning coffee! The host provided a variety of coffees.

Definitely will book at this place again in the near future!
Highly recommended!"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great stay in Dexter's home! We could tell he has a lot of personality and really cares about the place.

2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great secluded place!

There was even a bit of staple items so that we had something to munch on in the morning before we left. Our stay was for only one night so the it was much appreciated. Dexter was also very responsive by phone when we ran into a ""hiccup“ during our trip down to his place."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Everything was great! Spacious, clean, stocked and convenient. Having a bathroom in every room was fantastic!

I have stayed at several rentals and this is one of the BEST places I have stayed. It is well thought out and the decor is tasteful and not cluttered. The bathrooms were beautiful and the kitchen had every thing we needed. The home was very clean and welcoming. It was easy to walk to downtown, and had a beautiful scenic view across the street. The space is perfect for a family. We had my elderly mother with her walker and she was able to get around so easily. This space is a win win for anyone looking to stay in the Vermilion area. I will definitely look at staying there again."

2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,We came from TN to visit Family. The place is luxurious. Loved the bathrooms like being in a spa. The wardrobes had great storage and hangers. It was very kid friendly I didn't have to worry about my 4 year old getting into things she shouldn't. The views out the front were gorgeous and we loved the private back patio. We cooked breakfast every morning and they had everything we needed and more. Would come and stay again in a heartbeat. Its in a great location to get downtown too.

2023-05-01,5,Group trip,"My husband, mother-in-law, brother-in-law, and I stayed together in order to attend a funeral in nearby Yankton. The host and home exceeded our expectations. The host was friendly and quick to answer emails, check in was a breeze, and the binder with restaurant menus, ammenities was helpful. The downtown area was only a couple of blocks away, easily within walking distance. The house was immaculate and showcased modern decor with a few eclectic pieces. There were board games to play, an ottoman filled with fuzzy blankets to snuggle up with on the couch and a huge TV, all of which gave a warm, comfortable, homey feel. We each had our own spacious bedroom with comfortable beds and pillows; the closets were huge with plenty of hangers provided; the biggest bonus was each of the three bedrooms having an ensuite. It allowed for all of us getting ready in the morning a breeze. The only downside was that we couldn't stay longer to enjoy this beautiful home. We hope to stay again!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Loved this place!! Would recommend and will stay again
2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"This house was beyond perfect for a large group like us. All of us had our own private spaces (with private bathrooms), plus spacious and modern common areas (kitchen and living room). Everything was clean and modern (with really great retro touches!) - even better than the pictures may lead you to believe. The house is nicely close to downtown and the university. We didn't stay long enough to take advantage of the deck but we may need to plan a longer stay next time to do just that."

2023-01-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"I confess to some hesitancy staying here due to the price and the strict cancellation policy. That said, it's a super comfy, clean, lovely place.

2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This house has been remodeled from top to bottom and is spectacular!

2024-04-01,5,Group trip,"A gem. Completely clean, charming, and well-designed. Quality furniture, bedding, linens, shower products, dinnerware, cookware. No short cuts taken just because it's a rental. They supplied coffee, creamer, spices, and delicious fresh cinnamon rolls to welcome us. The home is a couple blocks from Cedar Hills cafe, Outlaw pizza, and a nice small town grocery store. I cannot think of any way that they could have improved our stay in their home. Host is very kind and quick to respond to questions. Do yourself a favor and stay there. They are definitely in the right business."

We will definitely use again for family overflow."

The house was extremely clean, the beds were very comfortable and the AC worked perfectly for those extremely hot summer days. We met some of our extended family at the Cedar Hills Bar and Grill a few blocks away from the house for a delicious dinner. The front porch was lovely for sitting on and enjoying our morning coffee on a cooler morning. Britney was amazing to deal with and she graciously put for extra effort when some things were left at her house that belonged to a family member to make sure those items were returned. I think it is wonderful to have a great house like this in the area close to Ponca State Park."

2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,Fantastic place ! Nice secluded get away. Large yard and stocked fire pit for a relaxing time.
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Mary Ellen was very proactive, went above and beyond with directions to the cottage as well as local shops and restaurants. The cottage itself was such a pleasant stay, clean and offered more comfort than I expected. The peaceful nature of the whole property was exactly was I was looking for in a weekend getaway. I couldn’t have been happier with my stay. 10/10, I will definitely return."
2024-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Great farm house location to stay at. Was glad to receive instructions for an alternate, better road to the place due to recent rains. As someone who grew up on a farm, driving gravel roads, it was a good place. I might suggest mentioning the curves in the roads to get there, if it wasn't already in the description. House was small and cozy and well kept. Would stay again!"
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,House is really nice with perfect location .
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This idyllic old schoolhouse is wonderful. We loved this country setting and is very near city of NewCastle. Very clean & the representation from photos are spot on. We usually stay at the state park when we are in the area but will be coming back here each year!
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This is the cutest place and so relaxing. Highly recommend. A++
2022-10-01,5,Stayed about a week,"What an incredible find! I was looking for somewhere to stay while I was working in vermillion and Mary Ellen’s cottage was perfect! It was clean, comfortable, and she did everything she could to make my experience beyond wonderful. That says nothing for how peaceful it was on location. I was able to see the stars and relax. Do not there isn’t internet so this is definitely for those who want to unplug a bit! Every need I could’ve had was anticipated and I can’t wait to come back for a vacation here"
2022-09-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Very enjoyable stay.
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We had an amazing time. The peace and quiet was priceless.
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We really enjoyed Mary Ellen’s place. She responded very quickly to our messages and the cottage was so comfortable, peaceful and clean. We were looking for a quiet getaway, and found it. The nearby towns of Newcastle, Vermillion and the Ponca area were fun to explore, and the drives there were beautiful!"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,such a cute place. lots of considerate touches. can't wait to stay again!
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Loved our stay! Very private and comfortable.
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,Quiet little cottage perfect for a getaway. We visited Ponca State Park and it was about 20 min away by car. Mary Ellen’s place is clean and comfortable.
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Loved our time at the cottage! So peaceful and beautiful, perfect place to recharge and enjoy nature."
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Very quaint, comfortable, clean sanctuary in the country. We will definitely be back!"
2022-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We enjoyed our stay in the cottage in small town, Nebraska. The cottage had everything we needed to relax after a long day of travel and activities. And the surrounding area is beautiful! We’ll definitely stay here again! Our only regret is not having more time to stay and truly enjoy all the area has to offer. Thank you!"
2022-06-01,4,Stayed a few nights,We enjoyed our stay. Also enjoyed the wild turkeys parading through the yard.
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We unplugging and staying in this remote cottage down an unpaved road.
The birdsong was wonderful and a short walk took us to a Missouri River overlook.
The cottage was lovely and had everything we needed. Mary Ellen gave detailed directions and suggestions of items to bring.
We also used her suggestions for a visit to Ponca State Park and eateries.
Would have liked to stay longer. Thank you Mary Ellen."
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The cottage was just right for our get away weekend. Very clean, great communication, easy check in. It is a bit of a drive into the country, but that made it great for us. Mary Ellen was a terrific hostess."
2022-05-01,4,Stayed with kids,"A weekend at the cottage was just what the doctor ordered to decompress from the busyness of life. We enjoyed the silence of the surrounding area that let us enjoy the song of the birds more. There was a cardinal, a Baltimore oriole, a hummingbird and others. We also saw a deer, rabbits, squirrels, possums, a raccoon.
The cottage was quaint, clean, and well stocked with anticipated needed items.
We visited near by Ponca State park which was lovely to visit.
Although the tap water was not ok for drinking, Mary Ellen made sure there was water available to meet the needs of the guests.
Communication with the Mary Ellen was prompt, easy, and informative."
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Originally booked after unable to get a cabin at any Nebraska or Iowa State Park. Turns out to be a better option after all. Location, location, location can not say it enough. Hosts guide book and advice very helpful."
2022-05-01,5,Stayed one night,If you want a wonderful cottage in the country...look no further. Everything was idyllic her...from the furnishings...to the comfort...to the quiet and the big yard for sitting and relaxing. this is the perfect getaway.. We spent one night but it is a night we will always remember.
2022-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,"If you are looking for a peaceful place to stay in this area, look no further! Communication was great and it was wonderful to have our own space, versus a hotel or houses close together. We loved being in the country for our stay, but you do need to be prepared for the remote location and dirt roads. There are a couple of towns pretty close by, so not too inconveinent. We were in town to attend graduation in Vermillion, the drive was fairly easy back and forth from Vermillion. The cabin has everything you need, very thoughful hosts. The shower is very small and would not be comfortable for very large people. We are average height and weight, so we had no trouble. The beds may also not be preferred by large/tall people. I'm 5'6 and my husband is 5'10, we have no trouble. If you need a peaceful place to stay while in this area, we receommend this cottage and would certainly stay again!"
2021-11-01,5,Stayed about a week,Very nice
2021-11-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Quiet place that is ""off the beaten path"", but worth it. Cozy home for the 4 of us. Plenty of DVD's to choose from. Comfortable living room furniture. Beds are soft double beds that are older, and thus very tall folks might have a little trouble with them. Responsive host who answered requests in a timely manner."
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"If you want peace & quiet, far from the madding crowd, consider Mary Ellen's cottage. It is rural, on a dirt road with almost no traffic and rests in a beautiful setting, making the ideal place to get away from it all.
In spite of its secluded location, the cottage lies within a short drive of groceries, restaurants & tourist-type activities."
2021-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Wonder get-away in a peaceful, country setting. Great place to disconnect and relax. The schoolhouse is very charming and has everything you need. Lots of space and the full kitchen was great for making meals and connecting as a family. Mary Ellen is a wonderful host and quick with communications."
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is a wonderful little cabin out in the country. It was spotlessly clean and had everything that we needed in the kitchen, bathroom and bedrooms. There is a lot of outdoor space with great seating around the fire pit. The communication with our host was timely and accurate and we easily found this cabin even though it is off the beaten path. I highly recommend this place to anyone who is seeking a peaceful and quiet retreat"
2021-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"Small, well-kept cute cottage in a remote rural location. Nice yard, very quiet. Will sure recommend."
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Had a wonderful time! This is a great place to relax and unwind. It has all the amenities you need! Highly recommend! Owner was very nice and helpful! Hope to come back again!
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The cottage was wonderfully remote, well kept and very welcoming! Perfect for a weekend get away in a quiet part of the world"
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,You would be hard-pressed to find a host more caring. She sent directions that enabled us to find it at 1:00am when GPS failed. She warned us about the wandering neighbor cows too.
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This “cottage” (old schoolhouse!) was exactly what this mama of 5 needed to get a break;) I loved being surrounded by nature and seeing so much wildlife! I saw so many fawns, does, 2 families of raccoons (!) and a few bunnies. I loved walking the dirt roads and looking at the view from the “volcano”. I’d like to have the chance to go again:)"
2021-08-01,4,Stayed one night,"Quaint, clean, and a perfect overnight stop as we work our way across the country."
2021-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Really quiet space, great for nature lovers. Just a short trip to Vermillion and Ponca. Great deal!"
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Clean, quiet and secluded,good cell service but no internet or cable"
2021-06-01,5,Stayed one night,Quiet and quaint. Lovely place! I enjoyed my stay very much!
2021-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Very clean, worth the price. Mary Ellen was a great host who kept us updated at all times. My reccomendation for those looking at this place is to bring something to cook for dinner along with you to save you the potentially lengthy drives to find a restaurant. Thats what we did and it ended up working perfectly."
2021-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,A symphony of birds and the Milky Way at night! Private and clean. Mary Ellen was great all around. We would definitely stay again.
2021-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"This cottage is nestled in some beautiful countryside. Taking a short walk down the road there are great views of the Missouri River. Cottage is small, but very clean and comfortable."
2021-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"After going down a beautiful and scenic (and very dusty) road off the main highway, pulling into the cottage's driveway and taking everything in is an experience I hope you won't miss. The immediate quiet falls on you. Then, one by one, as if nature is a symphony, you hear the wind through the trees, birds singing, crickets cricking and the far off corn fields corning (yes, that's a word!). The daisy blanketed cottage grounds are a delight and the inside is just as fitting. We arrived and stayed for ten days during an extreme heat wave and we were all very comfortable. The cottage kitchen was not only well equipped with all you need but with equipment that worked well. Between the air conditioner and fans in every room, the house stayed cool (which was good for us as we acclimated back to the Midwest heat and humidity). Beds were comfy with plenty of pillows and linens. Our kids loved camping on the living room floor watching DVDs. Mary Ellen had excellent communication, instructions and suggestions for outings. My only suggestion would be to make sure you use the bug spray at night when going out. And you'll want to go out at night and see the expansive starry sky and LIGHTNING BUGS and hear the whippoorwills!"
2021-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Peaceful, beautiful and relaxing. This cottage is a great place to stay to get away from your hectic everyday life. The host is very nice, great communication and does a fantastic job. We would definitely stay here again. A+++"
2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Mary Ellen was very helpful when we had gotten lost and was super nice on the phone. Even though we didn’t meet her she was super friendly on the phone.
2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Such a peaceful setting, everything a person would need to have a great getaway- beautiful yard too! Great smell of flowers as you exit the cottage."
2019-08-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Heaven! Quiet, quiet, quiet--just the wind in the trees. Super clean and comfy. Out in the big yard there's deer, all kinds of birds, little toads hopping in the big lawn, and lots of fireflies. On a clear night you can see the Milky Way. There's a very minor but cool Lewis and Clark spot just up the road with a great view of the Missouri. I came to work and wrote a ton of pages. Mary Ellen was super friendly and helpful. I want to come back!"
2019-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Very peaceful setting. We enjoyed a quiet campfire at night. Then a hummingbird entertained us early the next morning as we sat at the kitchen table, watching through the glass pane door. A doe and her ""twins"" were regular visitors. The cottage was very clean and comfortable and it had all we needed, and more. We studied the painting above the fireplace and wanted to learn more!"
2019-07-01,5,Stayed one night,Mary Ellen is a wonderful host and the cottage is adorable. Highly recommend!
2019-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Such a wonderful place to stay! Sparkling clean, great communication, and wonderful amenities! Mary Ellen was so thoughtful and kind- we would love to go back!"
2019-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,Phenomenal experience. Highly recommend.
2019-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"This cute little cottage was perfect for us. She sent us directions because the GPS was wrong and we did a terrible job following them. Mary Ellen was super helpful when we pulled up really late looking for the place. Once we found it, I realized her directions made perfect sense and I’m just bad at reading them. The bedrooms were tiny but they did the job."
2019-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The cottage was very cozy, clean, and comfortable. Host was very friendly and responded quickly. Mary Ellen made sure to check in on us after a storm during the night and updated us on the conditions of the gravel road since one of the people staying with us had a small car. Firm mattresses and a little on the small side for folks 6' or taller. Great place for a quiet weekend getaway."
2019-06-01,5,Stayed one night,A tucked away and quiet retreat in a very pleasing setting.
2019-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful little cottage! It is comfortable and well kept on the inside with a good kitchen and dining room. There's a grill out-front, plenty of lawn chairs, a picnic table, a hammock, and a large yard. It's quiet and private, and, if you're one for a small hike, you can go up the road and stand on top of a (formerly) smoking bluff that Louis and Clark discovered and look out toward the Missouri river just a mile away. There's an small sign that marks the spot."
2018-08-01,5,Stayed about a week,"This is a quaint and cozy hidden gem. Mary Ellen is an outstanding host and her cottage is lovely. If you are looking for a great place to mediate, enjoy some natural beauty, and be surrounded by tranquil sounds of nature (and quiet) this is utopia.
The property is maintained very well. The cottage is charming and very clean. It is cozy and romantic, making a great escape for a weekend or longer.
The cottage is furnished and the kitchen was has most everything you need if you would like to use it.
I loved staying here and chatting with Mary Ellen. Definitely would stay here again."
2018-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,A hidden gem. We enjoyed our stay! Would stay here again!
2018-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"It was nice to find such a bright, clean little home. We enjoyed the large, quiet yard with comfortable furniture for enjoying the birds, butterflies, squirrel and deer. We appreciated the kitchen furnished with what we needed, gas grill, movies & TV, A/C & fans. Remote, with good gravel roads. Quiet and peaceful."
2018-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Amazing communication, adorable cottage with everything you need and more. So clean and well put together and thought out. This was our first airbnb and it was so great we want to do this more often!"
2018-07-01,5,Stayed one night,We really loved Mary Ellen’s place. We’d been traveling on the road for sometime and wasn’t sure where we’d stop for the night. May Ellen very graciously accepted us on short notice and accommodated our late arrival. We woke up to a beautiful cottage teaming with the sounds of birds and wildlife. Very nice. Thanks Mary Ellen!
2018-07-01,4,Stayed a few nights,
2018-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Fire Flies!
We could see fireflies out the bedroom window at night and in the morning, I could hear the birds calling and even a woodpecker! It was awesome!
Spotlessly clean, well equipped kitchen, very comfortable.
Thank you for a wonderful time!"
2018-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"It was perfect. Clean, 100% accurate listing, great host, beautiful scenery. Four of us stayed in the cottage for a golf trip, but it would be for the perfect place for one or two couples. I won't rank hosts, but Mary Ellen would be hard to beat. I only wish I were a better writer. It may be an overused term, but this place would most definitely qualify as a hidden gem. I would go back to this place time and again if available."
2018-06-01,5,Stayed one night,Mary Ellen is a fantastic host. The house was sparkling clean there were nice outdoor touches and it was just as described. The communication was terrific and the setting is beautiful.

2018-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very lovely couple! Amazing place to get away and relax at!!
2024-05-01,4,Stayed a few nights,A little more camping and bathroom was kind of a hike.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"I stayed in the renovated chicken coop! the studio apartment like feel was very cozy and comfy. I personally didn't mind sharing a community bathhouse that wasn't attached to the stay but that's just me. the bathhouse was nicely furnished and felt like a mini hotel lol. The plot of land this place is on is gorgeous, wide open horizons for the sunset. They let me light a fire in the pit, I sat under the full moon and played guitar, dreams do come true lol. just stayed for one night, passing thru coming home from a roadtrip, and honestly am very glad I choose this place over a local hotel. it was fun, exciting, peaceful, rejuvenated the soul, and left me ready for my drive the next day. this air bnb left me with cool memories to finish off my roadtrip! Definitely staying here again someday!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"If you’re looking for something out of the ordinary, a stay in a charmingly unique converted chicken coop is it. Friends asked “where did you find this place” and I’ve recommended it, planning to write a short piece of a newspaper travel piece about unique places for a weekend-getaway. Inside and out, we loved the kitschy decor, the art, and the beauty of the property and countryside. Thank you to Kelley, for her personal greeting on site and for inviting us to explore the outdoor property. Loved the sunset view from the corn crib."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"We were only able to stay a short time, but would definitely come back! they thought of everything. The place was cozy and beautiful and the host was very helpful."

2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"My daughter and I were moving her from Seattle to Cincinnati and the Chicken Coop was a great overnight stay. They were understanding when we got in after dark, were quick to recommend restaurants on our way in, and we got such a great nights sleep in the very comfortable beds! Everything was as expected and was well represented in the posting and pictures. Since we got in late we didn't see the cool gate and fence on our way in but stopped to take pictures on our way out...it's made of bicycles and parts! Just another representation of their eclectic, whimsical stay :)"
2023-08-01,4,Stayed one night,Cute little home on a bigger property. The converted chicken coop is a cleaver idea. Host was responsive and reached out to ensure check in was ok.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Our stay at BTR was amazing! Kelly was so kind and welcoming, giving us all the recommendations. We loved the coop! It rained on our stay, and the noise on the tin roof put us right sleep. Recommend this place to anyone looking!"

2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"Absolutely loved our stay! The chicken coop was quirky and fun! Kelley was an amazing host and warmly invited us onto her beautiful property. Even though we booked this place to spend the night on our cross country trip, there was so many fun things to do. There were swings, a bonfire pit, a blackstone grill to cook on, and a fun cat! Our group loved the stay and it was a night to remember on our trip"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"The Chicken Coop, is an amazing little stay! My best friend and I stayed here for a girls weekend. It is small, but it was perfect for us!

2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"We would definitely recommend Kelly's place to anyone. We had very personal reasons that made their location ideal for us, but beyond that it provides easy access to Vermillion (USD), the Missouri River (a very special place), I-29, Whimps in beautiful downtown Burbank ;-) ....yet you're in a very sweet, tucked away spot that's very tastefully decorated with a very thoughtful host."

2022-08-01,5,Stayed one night,The chicken coop was the perfect place for two old friends to meet in the middle. We enjoys sitting in the gazebo and watching the sun set and swinging in the corn crib while we told stories and caught up on each other's families. The only thing that would have made it better is if we could have stayed longer!

2022-07-01,4,Stayed one night,Cute place and grounds!
2022-07-01,3,Stayed one night,"The Chicken Coop was an enjoyable basic accommodation. (They refer to it as “glamping” in the welcome book) There is no shower at the time of writing this, but there are plans to add one, so check before you book! The kitchenette only has a microwave, so plan accordingly. Overall charming and quirky on a beautiful property."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"We really enjoyed your beautiful property and I wish I could have a whole weekend to spend relaxing and just reading a book! Our only concern was a lack of shower/bathing option as that was not mentioned in the description, but thankfully wasn't a big deal for us for just one night! Who knows, maybe we will see you next year if my husband enjoys his week and the starting point is close to you again! Thank you, again!"
2022-07-01,4,Stayed one night,"Staying in a renovated chicken coop was pretty cool! Kelley has an amazing property with a lot of places to explore. The only downside was that there was no showers available. The listing says it has running water, but that’s only for a sink. If you want to shower, you’re going to have to drive up to the nearest truck stop."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,Nice little place to stay if you enjoy nature and getting away from the city but not be too far when you do want to go to town!
2022-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"First of all, this property was GORGEOUS. There was so much to explore and see, from the gazebo to the balcony of the reception hall to the corn crib swings and on! The twinkle lights strung throughout the grounds added a magical (and useful!) element to the stay.
To all people that will book in the future (which you definitely should)- remember that you will be staying in a refurbished chicken coop. There will be some spiders/flies/other random bugs in various nooks and crannies of the place. Do not come expecting your stay to be comparable to one at The Ritz. Embrace the eccentric and absolutely adorable stay for what it is. Outside, under the stars, in the fields, beneath the trees.
Kelley was a dream of a host. She was quick to respond and very informative. She provided cereal, milk, orange juice, and a gallon of water in the kitchen, as well as plastic cutlery, paper towels, garbage bags, etc. She also had chocolates and little snack pastries in the coop for us upon arrival.
I cannot stress how beautiful and expansive the grounds of this property are. I would highly recommend the chicken coop to anyone and everyone."
2022-07-01,4,Stayed with a pet,We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at the Chicken Coop! A true glamping experience with lots of fun things to explore around the property. The fact that it is pet-friendly was a big plus. Would recommend!
2022-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"The Chicken Coop was a great addition for our large group. It is a unusual space, but quaint and comfortable. The beds are wonderful. No running water or bathrooms unless you go to another building on the property (as advertised)."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed one night,Absolutely enchanting.
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,We stayed here and appreciated the whole ranch. I didn't mind not having wifi because I still had good signal. All the things I didn't think I needed was accessible and the washer and dryer made my life so much easier being on the road. Our group loved it here and we plan to be back in one years time!

2022-07-01,5,Stayed one night,very cute and fun place to stay
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Had a great stay in the coop! No running water/shower was complicated but the host was very kind and flexible and helped us out. We brought our lab puppy with us and he loved it there! Very dog friendly and lots of places to just hang out and relax. If you have dogs, beware of ticks! Coop was cute and eclectic, we loved it! The milk and cereal were a treat in the mornings, AC was nice and cold."
2022-06-01,5,Stayed one night,Blue Tin Ranch and the Chicken Coop were perfect! The Chicken Coop was comfortable and cozy - and Kelley was a great host. We loved the property! Thank you for making our stay so enjoyable.
2022-06-01,5,Stayed one night,This was a unique stay for the both of us. We liked the way it was set up. Clean and neat. If you don’t want the same old thing this is the place to stay.
2022-06-01,5,Stayed one night,I had a lovely stay with my dog. The property is beautiful. Kelley was a wonderful host. I definitely would come back.
2022-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Noreen is so incredibly kind and accommodating. We arrived pretty late into the evening on our check-in day, and she took the time to show us around, helping us feel safe and comfortable on the ranch. We stayed in the chicken coop, which was cozy and inviting after a long drive. The sinks and toilets are a short walk across their driveway (as stated on the listing), but this was a non-issue for us since the weather was very warm while we stayed and their light sensors turned on whenever we needed to head that direction at night. Although this was essentially glamping, there are plenty of outlets for lighting and charging phones/electronics if needed. We watched movies, relaxed, and were able to make cereal for breakfast (provided by Noreen). We even asked for extra fans to stay cooler at night. There is a window AC unit that helped a ton, but we're just not used to the humidity we experienced! Noreen took care of that and any other request we reached out for. My kids absolutely loved the ranch, chicken coop, and yard games... calling it their favorite part of our trip! The ranch location is just a short drive to Vermillion if you happen to be headed to USD like we were. Also, if you're lucky to stay on the property, you might get to say hello to Noreen's sweet pets Freckles and Moo. Thank you again for the memories, we hope to return soon!"
2022-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Such a beautiful location and stay!! If I ever pass through the area again, will for sure stay here."
2022-06-01,5,Stayed one night,Kelley was super friendly and the chicken coop and exterior spaces were all really cute! Such a great find and highly recommend! Made the perfect pit stop along our road trip to CO from MN!
2022-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"We had such an amazing time! It was clean, cute and cozy! Would definitely recommend to anyone looking for a fun little getaway!"
2022-06-01,5,Stayed one night,Unique spot and very cute.
2022-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,"we really appreciate the hospitality, made us feel like home. We were a little bummed out because showers were not available upon check in and bathrooms were located outside in a separate building. Otherwise beautiful experience. The kids loved the unique experience and adventure we were able to have on her beautiful property."
2022-05-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Loved my stay here. The hosts were very friendly and easy to communicate with, greeted me on arrival and let me know where everything was. The coop was as pictured and a lovely place to stay. The bathroom facilities are spacious and plenty. I did not miss having running water in the coop. The provided amenities were a nice touch, too. Note that the second bed in the coop is an air mattress on a frame. The first bed was very comfortable and easy to sleep on, medium firmness.
The property has some lovely shared spaces and would be great to hang out in. The hosts were also welcoming to my dog, which I very much appreciated!"
2022-05-01,4,Stayed one night,"Kelly's Farm is a fantastic and serene place. It is right off the road so easy to access.
The farm itself is very big and therefore lot of open places to explore. Kelly has decorated a section of the farm very well, sitting in that Gazebo with shade over you and the birds chirping around you is very peaceful.
We stayed in the Chicken Coop, and it is literally that, a remodeled coop.
Therefore, the cleanliness takes a hit inside the room. The blankets/throws have lot of dust in it, the bed/mattress too is not in the greatest condition.
Also, given that the restroom is a short walk away from the coop, for me to say this is good value the per night price needs to further drop a little bit to say $35-$40.
But in the mornings one will realize how beautiful the place is, we loved the place apart from a few minor issues mentioned above."
2022-05-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Great stay! Very peaceful, lots of unique outdoor spaces."
2022-05-01,4,Stayed one night,Nice quiet getaway! Well restored older building with tin siding and however no running water in the chicken Koop. But restrooms are available nearby. Unique experience!!
2022-05-01,4,Stayed with a pet,I enjoyed my stay. Lots of birds and away from the city noises.
2021-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"Blue Tin Ranch was fantastic! There are so many extra touches in the lodgings; cute decorations, clean and very spacious. Lots of fun farm games and things to see and do. I plan to stay longer next time and to bring my family! Hostesses were super nice!"
2021-11-01,4,Stayed one night,Beautiful property and a sweet place to stay!
2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Wonderful place with lots to see! You can definitely tell they have put a ton of heart and effort into making this a fun and enjoyable place to stay, any questions we had were answered so fast! We will definitely be back!"
2021-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"It was a fun experience staying in the chicken coop - they had the heater going before I came so it wasn't too cold and they provided extra blankets. There were a lot of nice little touches included and the entire grounds (Blue Tin Ranch) was beautiful and relaxing. The host was super accommodating and I would definitely stay here again. It is a chicken coop, so go into to it with the right level of expectation and you will enjoy your stay. Definitely take the time to explore the place."
2021-10-01,3,Stayed one night,There is no running water. The space is not insulated and has only a small space heater. The farm is beautiful and well maintained. I booked in Oct. It was too cold to pay $90 a night.
2021-10-01,5,Stayed one night,Beautifully and artfully decorated on a secluded and relaxing lot. Lovely place. Could be the perfect retreat.

2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"This BnB was wonderful!! The hosts were wonderful, the venue was wonderful, it was all just WONDERFUL!!
In the evening there were cookies left in the kitchen for us and they were wonderful!
I very much enjoyed the complimentary wine and spirits tasting. I brought home the rhubarb wine. The Lion’s Paw ale did not last when it got home. My boyfriend thoroughly enjoyed it so next time you see me, it will be with my boo not my son. I look forward to experiencing one of the other themed rooms!
P.S. Breakfast the next morning was WONDERFUL! The bacon was perfect and I loved the seasoning on the potatoes!"

2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful place to stay. The breakfast is wonderful. Can’t wait to come back.
2022-08-01,5,Stayed one night,One of our favorite places to stay. Sitting on the back deck watching the full moon come up in the east as a thunderstorm rolled across the plains in the west was the best.
2022-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"This is a real bed and breakfast - charming, quality furnishings and accessories, peaceful, excellent bed and delicious breakfast. Pleasant balcony patio. Excellent service."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"The University room is spacious and comfortable. The view from the third floor balcony, not far from the room, is gorgeous. We enjoyed the complimentary wine tasting and delicious breakfast."

2022-04-01,4,Stayed one night,"The place is clean and the breakfast is wonderful. The host is so kind.
The walls seem to be thin and we could hear a lot of others conversations in the hallway and wondered if other people could hear us. The bathroom did not have any conditioner so bring that if you need it."

The wine tasting was great and there were many fun items in the gift shop as well. Breakfast was delicious - felt like we were staying at a lodge! Highly recommend this wonderful winter retreat.
2021-10-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Everything about our stay the weekend of Oct. 22-24 was excellent. Friendly staff, great breakfast, clean room, etc. The only drawback was the low water pressure for the shower, but otherwise we'd definitely stay there again...and next time try to experience more of the vineyard and the wine tastings. Thanks for a wonderful weekend!"

2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Comfortable room with everything you need. Beautiful setting makes for great balcony hangs in the evening. The food is great and the hospitality is second to none. The vineyard is close to the Missouri River and we got out for some light hikes around the area each day. Lots of great lunch and dinner choices in town and close to shopping in Sioux City.
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place deserves all the accolades. We missed the wine and whiskey tasting days on the days we were there, but were invited to arrange a private tasting! The staff are amazing: we were cooked wonderful breakfasts; everything was clean and well organized; and the staff who worked there were really helpful and friendly. The shared kitchen has all you need to heat up and serve, but not really cook.
And oh, the deck! Get there early enough to enjoy sitting on the deck with a pair of binoculars. American goldfinches everywhere."

2020-11-01,5,Stayed about a week,"It’s an awesome inn. Our beds were very comfortable, but bring your pillows. The suite is roomy, with a nice en suite bathroom and everything is spotlessly clean. Best for last, breakfast is varied and wonderful!!"

2020-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"Sherry and Adriane helped me immensely as a person who has never been to South Dakota. I stayed during July 4th weekend when most restaurants were closed, and Sherry and Adriane went out of their way to help me get some food in Vermillion. Their hospitality was outstanding and the food was excellent for breakfast. I was pleasantly surprised by the beauty of the location and the historical significance of the vineyard and neighboring landmarks. Some of those landmarks were even part of the Lewis and Clark trail. Highly recommended, and if I am ever in Vermillion I wouldnt hesitate to stay again."
2020-03-01,5,Stayed one night,Great place for a quiet weekend away!
2020-03-01,5,Stayed one night,We enjoyed our stay here. Accommodating staff and comfy beds! Very charming place to stay and the wine we sampled was very good.

2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great location and easy to get to places in town. Thanks for the stay.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We love Airbnb’s for the room, comfort, and privacy. This one definitely has privacy and comfort! The yards are full of over grown plants - in a good way. They shelter the property so you feel like you are in an oasis. Private back sitting area, small but private. The front porch was the place to hang outside. The bathroom is small and the only access is through two of the bedrooms but that did not pose an issue for our family of 4.
Hosts were SUPER responsive! Check in was a breeze. We had everything we needed at the house for the week.
When we checked in the AC was on (was a hot humid day so we were very thankful!) and they left the lights on for us 😊
We figured only one TV (living room) so had packed another for one of the kids Xbox. But with all the trips we took - Sioux City and Sioux Falls, we were only there in the evenings.
Which to another point - Verm is nicely centrally located to go for day trips to two large cities!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,Beautiful and interesting home with everything you need.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"A great house with tons of character. I appreciate having multiple places to sit, read, and work. The location is super convenient for walking pretty much anywhere in town. It is my favorite place to stay in Vermillion."

2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Very lovely, well-kept older home! Comfortable stay."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"It was a great location in Vermillion, near Prentis Park and Main Street. It’s a minutes walk to coffee shops and to campus! This home has a lovely aesthetic and is both comfortable and inviting. We loved our stay!"
2023-07-01,5,Group trip,"Daniel’s home was charming, comfortable and served our needs for a one night stay in vermillion while visiting family."

2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This house was perfect for us to stay near campus for a three day long event! I highly recommend this location!
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Beautiful house with many great details. Clean and safe neighborhood. The host is thoughtful to provides little things like packaged breakfast and zip bags. The only issue I had was curtains. They are decorative and pretty but it doesn’t block the light from outside. Other than that, it was a very nice stay."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Amberly and Josh went above and beyond to help us out and make sure we were provided for. The house was perfectly situated for us in the town, University and nearby Prentis Park. It was homey and comfortable. We would stay there again when in the area."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed about a week,"This is great spot to stay for any visit to Vermillion. The decor was interesting, there were plenty of dishes, spices and cooking necessities in the kitchen, great selection of books to read, a desk for work, a large gathering table, and the privacy of 3 sleeping areas. It has one of Vermillion's beautiful iconic town lamp posts out front, a morning porch to sit on for coffee, Frnch Press and a very private back yard with flowers and plantings. Kitchen was clean, bathrooms were clean, and linens and big towels were just fine, a/c worked very well. This is a good examples of a family house being successfully turned into a very usable guest house. Hoping to come back. Loved the regional Sioux inspired art to enjoy and the fresh paint job throughout. The greenery in the back garden and off street parking gave us privacy and a few blooms to enjoy. Great for a family stay or couple's retreat with full kitchen, university event stay. They home is in a prime yet quiet spot."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,Such a lovely and peaceful space! I’m so happy to have the chance to visit my family and stay in this beautiful home. Thank you!
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Had a lovely stay at this eclectic home. It was very comfortable and it had everything we needed. We were not sure how to use the Roku, so couldn’t use the TV, but the Wi-Fi worked fine."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Bathroom situation was geared more for family style since the two bedrooms were attached with no other access than going through one or the other to enter the bathroom. Great place otherwise, quaint and comfortable!"

2023-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,Very nice cozy house.
2023-01-01,5,Group trip,"This is a very cute home that was perfect for our family of 6. My kids loved the bunk beds and the few kids toys and coloring that they had available. The place was very clean and had everything you could need. The gas fireplace was very cozy. Only downside I saw was that the only bathroom is in the middle of two of the bedrooms, so if anyone needed to use the bathroom from the 3rd bedroom they would have to enter someone else's bedroom to get there. We would definitely stay again! Much better for a family here than at a hotel!"
2022-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This house is adorable and we loved the bohemian vibe!! The place was spotless, and had so many interesting books and great kids toys and art supplies."
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Clean and pretty and super charming !

2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Daniel's house was great for our needs! Convenient location, quick replies from hosts, clean space, and charming!
Just to keep in mind, the bathroom is a Jack & Jill, so you always have to go into it from one bedroom or the other."
2022-10-01,5,Stayed one night,This was a great little house to stay in while visiting our son at USD. It gave us a nice place to relax together for the weekend.
2022-10-01,5,Group trip,Great location and great accommodations. Will definitely look for this place for future Vermillion visits.

2022-10-01,5,Stayed about a week,"The perfect mix of eclectic and traditional charm! We fell in love as soon as we walked in the door! Be sure to take note of all the little touches to be found… poems and artwork and books. Loved it!!! Everything was clean and tidy, and downtown is a short walk away. We would definitely stay again!!! :)"
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great location! Very clean. Well described!
2022-09-01,4,Stayed with kids,The hosts were great. House was nice and clean and the perfect space for what we needed. My kids loved the “kids room” with things for them to play with (as if we don’t always pack a bag full of toys when we travel). I felt the cost was a little high as we have stayed in much larger homes for cheaper but I was not in a position to be picky with last minute booking. The yard could use some TLC. I was super worried when I pulled up but was pleasantly surprised when I got inside.
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,What an exceptionally charming place to stay! We loved the way the interior was joyfully lit upon our arrival. All the interesting books and unique local artworks bring character to each room. The furniture and beds are super cozy for times when we needed to relax. The colorful kitchen seems newly remodeled and is both cute and highly functional--I did a lot of cooking there and found it very easy to use. The place also has a great location within easy walking distance of the university and downtown. Would have no hesitation about booking here again!
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great spot, nice furnishing and a great last minute find"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,The house was lovely and the property was very cool. It was a shame it was so rainy yesterday and we couldnt look around. Would absolutely recommend!

2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"What an unexpected treasure!! Very quiet, private and beautiful location. They go an extra mile with providing orange juice, milk, coffee, bread and cereal. Lots of helpful tourism information. Very flexible and helpful hosts. I highly recommend!!"

2024-01-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Kelley’s place was amazing. We were only there for a night, but because it was so cold and snow was expected, she met us at the door and we were settled very quickly. It’s such a fun space, but also very warm and inviting. The Christmas tree was still up and it just tied everything together for us."
2024-01-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"This is a cute place that is very convenient for when my family and I visit other family in Elk Point, South Dakota. It's quite quiet, although there is the train coming through sometimes, which just makes me smile as I grew up on a farm close to train tracks!
I'd recommend a coat tree or hooks upon which to hang winter coats."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"easy everything at the blue tin roof. exactly what we were looking for in every way. great location, very cozy feel, we plan on staying again!"

2023-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This is our second time staying here and it was even better than the first! It’s so hard these days to find a place that allows dogs and actually have the space to exercise them! Would stay here 1,000 more times if they’d let us!!!
Our 11 year old has grown attached to this place and that’s the best part!"

We got to the place and were able to check in early and we were so very appreciative of the fresh fruit and snacks that were there! Such a cute fun place to stay. We wish we had more time to enjoy it. Wonderful hosts and we had a great stay.
2023-10-01,5,Group trip,We were in town to visit our son at USD. This was a great location to relax and catch up. It felt like a home away from home.
2023-09-01,5,Group trip,We stayed for a quick girls night in and had a great night in the country! Our lightbulb went out and Host responded in minutes and was there with extra lamps in less than 10 minutes. 10/10 would recommend!

2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,Kelly's blue roof house was beautiful and just what our family needed during our grandmothers funeral services. Kelly has a vision for this property and I hope she can get the justice the community deserves for this property. Thanks for all that you do Kelly!

2023-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,Stopped in for one night to break up a long drive. It was so nice to have two separate bedrooms. There was plenty of space and the whole place was clean and tidy. I wished we could have stayed longer to explore the beautiful property.
2023-04-01,4,Stayed with kids,"Kelly was a great host at the farm. Our kids played all the yard games and enjoyed the fire pit. Two fold out mattresses are what you expect. We used some extra cushions for the one we used, and it worked out. Good value for all the amenities."

2022-09-01,5,Stayed with a pet,We really enjoyed our stay. Our kids loved all of the amenities.
2022-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"One of the best Airbnbs I’ve been to, the property was beautiful! So quiet and serene! Great communication with Noreen, so thoughtful with bringing snacks/cereal and fresh cut flowers on the counter. The place had nice furnishings, but I loved the corn silo that they converted into a swing/lounge/fire pit area. The property is a gem, and it was much more than I expected. Enjoy roaming the property, viewing the gorgeous sunsets, playing games, and maybe even getting a visit from their cat (So sweet!). Would love to come back again for a longer stay!"
2022-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Kelley and Noreen’s place is wonderful - comfortable, well-decorated, well-kept, and with all the necessities you could need. In addition they are great hosts. Highly recommend their place if you’re in the area."

2022-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We had a great experience at the Blue Tin Ranch. It was clean, the beds were very comfortable, and the property is beautiful.
It rained for us heavily so many of the outdoor options didn’t make sense us to use. In that situation, having no Wi-Fi was unfortunate. Otherwise, this stay is highly recommended!"

Overall, a fantastic experience."

2022-04-01,3,Stayed a few nights,This is a cute and quiet place. Check-in and out and communication with the hosts was excellent. There were cleanliness issues in the kitchen and bathroom. I asked the hosts to clean up those areas and they were very responsive to do the cleaning.
2022-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We wanted a quiet, peaceful weekend for us 2 besties and our babies and WOW did Kelley deliver! I am sure it is 100% her hospitality but it truly felt like she set the room up just for US girls. Not a phone to be seen the whole stay. Imagine that, 3 teenagers found some amazing country fun. Thank you for a beautiful weekend!"
2022-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,This was our second stay and we will be back again! Hosts are over the top! They even put a birthday banner in for my son! The sunsets are gorgeous and beautiful set up with lots to do! The kids never were bored!

2022-01-01,5,Stayed one night,This air bnb was amazing. They have thought of everything. And the view and lounge possibilities in the warmer weather makes it a definite place to return to. The owners are very thoughtful and go out of their way to make the stay a true home away from home.

We 100% loved our stay and would come back to this home over and over!"
2021-11-01,5,Stayed one night,Kelley was very accommodating for us last minute. The house and property are wonderful! Very spacious and lots to see and do. Beds are very comfortable as well.
2021-11-01,5,Stayed one night,Simply put this property is a class act from the accommodations to communications!

2021-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Pick this place and you will not regret it!!!! The view and accessibility you have is a dream. We planned to venture off to surrounding areas but there was no need once we settled in and admired the views from our quarters. We needed a weekend getaway and we did just that, nothing. With full access to the kitchen we picked up breakfast items and cooked. We enjoyed the views with coffee in one hand and puzzle pieces in the other. Sunrises and sunsets were gorgeous. If we find our way back to this area we definitely are returning!"
2021-10-01,5,Stayed one night,Beautiful wedding venue out in the country and the guest house makes for a relaxing private getaway Airbnb. Close to USD if you’re coming for a college visit!

2021-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great and comfortable guest house! All went smoothly with check-in and prior communication. Nice spot, quiet and out in the country. Well equipped kitchen to support all guests."
2021-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,Our stay was wonderful. It was everything it was advertised to be and more.
2021-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"Kelley and Freckles are the best!!! Ask for a personal howling when you see Freckles. The home is everything as described and more. Clean, an abundance of extras to make either a short or longer stay feel as if you were at home. Comfortable, beautiful surrounding farmland, sunset to die for, the corn-crib swings, basketball game, etc. Also, if you're looking for a wedding venue, Kelley is more than happy to provide. Even my husband gave a rare ""this is an amazing place. I could stay for several weeks""! Really wished we could have stayed at least another night, but had to get on the road again."
2021-10-01,5,Stayed one night,Lovely surrounding & lovely host!
2021-10-01,5,Stayed one night,This place was such a wonderful get-away. We really enjoyed just kicking back and relaxing. The nature and property is so beautiful. The place had everything and more then you need during your stay. We will definitely be back.
2021-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"This place is great, location-wise it may be a bit challenging to find, but honestly, it's all worth it. The guest house is huge and has all the necessary supplies. It was very important for us this is a pet-friendly property. They also host some sorts of special occasions and have an infrastructure to do so.
Thank you for hosting us!"
2021-10-01,5,Stayed one night,beautiful quiet home

2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Love coming here for time away from busy life! Kelley and Noreen are amazing hosts and always have a clean and restful stay here! Definitely making this a yearly trip!
2021-09-01,5,Stayed one night,Wonderfully unique place with a nice country feel. Super friendly host. A/C kept the space nice and cool on a 96 degree day.
2021-09-01,3,Stayed one night,"This place was nicely in the countryside, quiet, and remote.
While denoted as ""dogs allowed"" it definitely should not be considered ""dog friendly"". Inside the cottage, thankfully we spotted four Advils under the coffee table. Ibuprofen, as you may know, is toxic to dogs. Additionally, scattered on the grounds of the property was not only trash (paper plates, empty water bottles and soda cans), but also wrapped and unwrapped chocolate candies, which as you might also know, is toxic to dogs.
The fridge included an opened bottle of milk, which, while in date, also might've been chugged from some unknown previous tenant during a pandemic. No, thanks.
The bathroom had no hand-towels, but only washcloths well beyond their useful life to dry your hands.
The Ibuprofen on the rug, random dead insects and general dust and dead/dying plants leads us to think the cottage is not deeply cleaned very regularly.
There was a distinct lack of side-tables, so we pulled stools around to have a place to put our cocktails. The pallet-wood coffee table, though, was pretty unusable as the gaping slots of pallets do not work swimmingly well to hold beverages, remote controls, or apparently Advil.
Additionally, we will be rinsing glitter off ourselves and our dog-bed for the next several months, as it's clear some sort of glitter bomb had exploded in the bedroom, and had not been vacuumed up since The Event.
Additionally, do know if you do book this cottage, Google Maps will send you about 100 yards beyond the entrance of the Blue Tin Ranch, into a corn field. The gate is marked ""BTR"" and well illuminated with lights."
2021-09-01,5,Stayed one night,Great place! Very neat and clean
2021-09-01,3,Stayed one night,"Book this place to enjoy the countryside and disconnect. The place was spacious, there is a full kitchen, and Kelley was a friendly host."
2021-09-01,4,Stayed one night,"Cute stay in South Dakota farm land.
We were in town visiting my wife’s family who lives in Elk Point and we were excited to see this space was available for us to stay. Cute little house with a full kitchen and plenty of room for the two of us.
We didn’t stay on the property that much but everything was adorable and the check-in process and directions were very easy."
2021-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"The star of this place is the outdoor space. It is beautiful and peaceful but also entertaining at the same time. The hosts were very friendly and welcoming and their provision cereal and fruit was a nice and appreciated touch. The indoor space was cute and met our needs for one night, but given the layout, the use of the sofa bed for a long term stay may not be ideal."
2021-09-01,5,Stayed one night,Nice clean place out in the country to unwind after a long day of driving. The corn cage swinging chairs were a hit with my family and a great way to relax! Hosts were very welcoming.
2021-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,This is an awesome place in a great location. The scenery is worth the stay alone! Great host and a great home!

2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Wonderful host who goes out of her way for her guests, even the four-legged kind. Kelley was kind enough to alert other guests to our senior dog's special needs and all of us had a great experience. The space was large and comfortable and very quiet. You felt right at home when you walked in as we were welcomed by fresh fruit and flowers on the counter. The grounds are beautiful and we only wish we had the time to stay longer and explore the area to enjoy more of the amenities. Kelley is a great communicator and very attentive to her guests and their needs. Highly recommend!"
2021-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,If you are so blessed as to be traveling this way you will love your stay! Everything is adorable and tasteful. Windows galore and the outdoor space is beyond words! Highly recommend!

2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Lovely place hidden away in the corn fields of the Missouri River Valley. A perfect launch point for exploring Lewis and Clark Lake and surrounding state parks. Blue Tin has a good layout for larger events, and is adding new features around the property to showcase the rural-craft esthetic."

2021-05-01,4,Stayed one night,"We stayed for the night to get some rest in the first leg of our two week road trip. The place is stylish however, I did give it a 4/5 for cleanliness. The property is big and quiet and the amenities are awesome although we didn't get much time to enjoy them. There's a very friendly older pup on the property named Maggie. I adored her although my pups were taken back and not very nice to her after riding for 16hrs :( The swings were a very cool surprise, I'm not sure I've seen anything like that. The hot tub had just been cleaned and was ice cold so we didn't have a chance to use that. The hosts were very responsive. Overall it was a good stay."
2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Such a neat place! Very well cleaned and so many things to do outside!
2021-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"The place was very well stocked with breakfast foods and drinks. Everything was very clean and inviting.

Host was very kind and respectful. 100% would stay again."

2021-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"The house was beautiful, but what I really loved about this place was the property. It was incredibly spacious and had a lot of fun amenities — my favorite was the hanging basket chairs in the wire corn silo!
A beautiful Irish wolfhound greeted us as we drove up the driveway and Kelley’s husband came out to show us where to park. He was very welcoming and friendly.
The inside was just as nice as the pictures and had amazingly considerate touches, such as the Keurig hot cocoa and coffee; fridge stocked with creamer cups, orange juice, and milk; and the display of single-serve cereal bowls on the counter for us to enjoy for breakfast — all of which we really appreciated after two long days of driving!
We loved our stay and would definitely come back!"
2021-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Amazing venue! Beautiful scenery, excellent amenities (the corn crib swings are awesome!) and very comfortable sleeping accomodations. Extremely thoughtful. Had a wonderful and peaceful night of sleep."
2021-04-01,5,Group trip,"This was a great spot! So much awesome space and privacy. Loved the hot tub, played some games in the barn, and loved the hanging chairs.

Kelley and Noreen were quick to respond to my questions prior to our stay and they were warm and welcoming when we arrived. We hope to visit the Blue Tin Ranch again in the future!"
2021-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,Great place to stay.
2021-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This place is AMAZING. My husband and I are definitely coming back. The area is private but close to town. I loved being able to let my dogs run around without a leash. The house was very clean when we arrived. Very good communication which is always great.
2021-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"The property is absolutely stunning and Kelley was extremely friendly and accommodating. We only stayed one night but even a short stay is worth it. The place was very clean, check-in/check-out was straightforward, and it was an all-around lovely stay."
2021-03-01,5,Group trip,The Blue Tin Ranch was a beautiful place for myself and my friends to hang out. Kelly was an incredible host that was very kind and generous! We would definitely like to come back again!
2021-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We recently traveled to Vermilion South Dakota for our daughters first college visit. Wanted a place to stay that was close but could also just offer some genuine relaxation. In came The Blue Tin Ranch! It was truly the perfect getaway. Far enough in the country to have quiet in the morning and quiet at night. But close enough to town to be able to drive in for a dinner out and a campus visit. Loved the space & the hospitality! Fresh fruit, plenty of coffee, individually boxed cereals, & chocolate were a hit for our family!
Hoping next time we get to visit it’s warmer so that we can relax in the corn crib to swing the night away by the fire pit."
2021-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"My wife and I now want to have a re-do of our wedding and have it here. Great place, wish we had more time here."

2021-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I’m from the city so I was really excited to stay at Kelly’s farm. We came to visit friends from USD and couldn’t have been happier. The house was clean and Kelly was great about recommending things to do even in the winter. We look forward to our next stay!
2020-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,Stylish country house! Loved the place and would stay again. The place was super clean and hostess was welcoming even when terrible weather prevented us from arriving on our first night. The large barn property is something we would like to explore more in the warmer weather.
2024-06-01,3,Stayed with a pet,"A one week stay in this older Victorian style, kitschy residence. Well stocked kitchen appliances and tools. Private drive for tandem parking near rear of the house, but beware significant bird poop and some sticky leaves / flowers from the overhanging tree. Responsive hosts. Some improvements could be made in terms of cleanliness— perhaps just missing par for a short-term rental. Furnishings adequate for all activities of daily living. Aesthetically not my particular style, but based on other reviews many have enjoyed. Close to down town."
2024-06-01,5,Group trip,"Quaint home, well furnished. Sophie was very responsive and was a breeze to work with. We enjoyed the space in the home and the ability to enjoy the warm weather. also an easy walk to restaurants and the most amazing ice cream store."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Fabulous Victorian. Modern & antique decorations. Perfect location for whatbwe wanted to do and where we were going. Definitely recommend!!!
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,What a great place. Walking distance to downtown Vermillion in in quiet neighborhood. Loved our stay here and was a great value!
2024-04-01,4,Stayed a few nights,We enjoyed our stay & would stay again! Loved the walkability to downtown & off street parking.
2024-04-01,4,Stayed with a pet,Nice place
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great communication, very clean, looking forward to our next stay!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Great location, easy access, quiet, and walking distance to main Street. Clean house, even with some cold weather plenty of blankets to keep warm. Definitely would use house again."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed over a week,"Staying there was absolutely nice! Y really like living for a whole month, very private and Gabe was completely cool!!"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Kea, the host, was top notch - very nice, extremely helpful, flexible, and quick to respond. The house was spacious and charming. It had everything we needed and stayed nice & warm despite the snowstorm that passed through. Loved the location close to Main Street. Highly recommend!"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Cute & quaint older home, with lots of character. The entire house was spotless & clean. Kea was very responsive & friendly when I reached out to her. Couple of minor improvements could be made for our next experience (ice on the walkway to the rear entry; some of the beds had older mattresses; and the coffee maker almost defeated us 2 out of 3 days). But none of this would prevent me to from booking this home again. Overall a great experience!"
2023-09-01,5,Group trip,Clean and quiet!!
2023-09-01,5,Stayed over a week,"This is the second year we have stayed at Kea, Gabe, and Cosmo's wonderful home. We hope to stay again next year."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"I cannot say enough good things about Kea’s place. Super comfortable and laidback, but with vintage furniture to make the place interesting.
Both Kea and Gabe were quick to respond to any inquiries/requests we had.
Very easy to check in and out. Quick walk to a delightful coffee shop, restaurants, movie theater, library, etc.
Quiet, beautiful neighborhood.
Black out curtains in the whole house (slept incredibly well and I am not a good sleeper).
The kitchen is easy to navigate with all the essentials plus a really nice coffee maker and a blender.
We will definitely be booking with Kea again."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"One year later, our second ""honeymoon"" stay at Kea Sophie's vintage house was very much the same as the first, except this time we were joined by our son and two grandchildren from California...and a notable fresh coat of paint has freshened up the interior. Involving family gatherings, both trips to Vermillion were charged and meaningful, and ""glamping"" at this marvelous location surely served to ramp up those visits. Location, accessibility, amenities, convenience, all things favorable are adequately promoted in the listing, but the embracing ambiance and intangibles must be experienced. This house was built 80 years before Patricia and I were married for heaven's sake, and you can't buy this kind of domestic charm, you have to live it...and preserve it.
Thanks Kea Sophie and Gabriel for doing your thing, so we could do ours..."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed about a week,"My husband and I had a lovely stay at Sophie's home. It was ideally located within walking distance of my son and daughter-in-law's new (150 year old) home. They purchased it sight unseen and knew there would be work that needed attention right away. Having Sophie's place to stay at while going back and forth with the fast renovation schedule was perfect. The main street with it's restaurants and shops were all within walking distance, we never used our car for our entire stay. Thank you Sophie for our home away from home."
2023-05-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"A sweet place to stay in Vermillion! Lovely location, also, close to downtown."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"clean, awesome location"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Our family of five needed a place to stay in Vermillion while we attended a funeral. This house was truly perfect for us. Enough bedrooms for us and our three boys, comfortable beds, toys for the kids to play with, a spacious living room and dining room which served well as a gathering place for the family before and after the funeral, and very clean. This house was just right in every way- and besides that, it was much more economical for us to rent the whole house for three nights than it would have been to stay anywhere else in Vermillion. Kea was an excellent communicator and we'd be glad to stay here again if we are ever back in Vermillion."
2023-04-01,5,Group trip,Nice home in Vermillion.
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Awesome home & location both to walk to Main st. or short drive all around town. Don't be afraid to buy any thing you want to cook as the kitchen has everything I have in my home to cook with. Including a variety of Tupperware for leftovers. Short drive to many site seeing attractions as well. Just click on book now.
2022-10-01,5,Stayed about a week,We really enjoyed staying at this house! It’s in a great neighborhood and so conveniently located to downtown! Kea was easy to communicate with and check-in / check-out was easy! We truly enjoyed our stay.
2022-09-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"This is a sweet place that is clean, very quiet, and close to downtown Vermillion. Check-in and check-out were easy. Just a nice place!"
2022-09-01,5,Stayed over a week,"Kea and Gabe were wonderful communicators. We loved their front porch, location, and the town of Vermillion. This home was excellent value for the money."
2022-08-01,5,Stayed about a week,"This Airbnb is ideally located very close to the quaint Vermillion downtown area. It is walking distance from some excellent restaurants. The neighborhood is quiet and safe. This was our third stay at this Airbnb and if we return to Vermillion, we're sure to stay again."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Thank you for a wonderful stay in Vermillion! I appreciated how quickly you got back to me with my oddball questions—it truly was a great home base while I had family business in Vermillion! Quiet, clean, and the air conditioner held up through the heat!"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Sometimes the line seems to blur between the enthusiasm a visit generates and the housing that allows all the generous features of the away-from-home adventure to meld, but I am very clear minded about the salient features of host Kea Sophie and Gabriel's Airbnb; Patricia and I thrived there and our experiences in Vermillion were greatly enhanced by virtue of staying in such a such a curiously warm and charming house nestled in a neighborhood that at once felt familiar and friendly. If one of your things is peace and quiet, I can only report that the loudest noise I heard during our week's stay was the sound of my head hitting the pillow on a very comfortable bed. Clean? Sure. Amply stocked. Yes. Convenience? On foot, two zigs and a zag get you to the bountiful yet quaint historic main street, and 30 cents worth of gas will take you to either the franchise strip or all things University of South Dakota, depending on your bent...and back. Easy access and communication? Of course. But these aspects seem to pale in comparison to the house's character. It is an old house that has been updated just enough to maintain the integrity and grace that comes with age. It has a generous lived-in feel and an assortment of curious furnishings, each iconic, enriching, from its own era with a story to tell. Reservations about our stay? None, save this...I suspect it will be increasingly difficult to book this marvelous mini mansion as time goes on."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was our second stay, and we enjoyed it like the first. The home is in a nice, quiet neighborhood and walking distance from some very good restaurants. The amenities were in excellent shape, which help make for a terrific stay."
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Nice home in a quiet, friendly neighborhood, which is walking distance away from some great restaurants in a quaint downtown area. The Airbnb was clean and well-stocked.
We look forward to returning during our future visits to the Vermillion and Yankton areas."
2022-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This Victorian home in Vermilion, SD is wonderful. It is in a great location and walking distance to Main Street and the shops and restaurants in the area.
Kea and her husband were so kind and responded so fast to any questions we had.
The house is very clean and cozy."
