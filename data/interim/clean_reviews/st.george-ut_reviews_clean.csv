2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Just want to say that it‚Äôs probably one of the nicest Airbnb that my friend and I have ever stayed in super peaceful, quiet clean comfortable atmosphere was awesome and John was such a responsible host. Totally would come back here any day! Thank u!!!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We loved the place; my wife wanted to sit by the pool and get a lot of sun--mission accomplished! The family pool was nice and warm and there were enough lounge chairs most of the time. There weren't too many kids most of the time and not too crowded so it didn't matter so much that the adult pool was cold and there were geese landing on the water. Maybe if they heated the adult pool there wouldn't be so many geese. The ice machine was not working at first but it did after the first day. The patio was nice but no lounge chairs or cushions so I made do with the four chairs and I took the pad from the chair at the front door and pillows on the couch and made a makeshift lounge chair, where I could read and gaze at the starts and moon at night. That was delightful!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,I want to bring my family down here for a longer stay it was so nice! Our stay was wonderful!. Thank you. So clean and comfortable.

2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The first time reserving an Air BnB and was very pleased. I have already been raving about John‚Äôs listing to family and on my social media. His place added to the relaxing and restful vacation time with my son.

2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"This place is PERFECT for a retreat! I enjoyed 70 days of peace and quietüôèüèª
I‚Äôm a 58 year old solo traveler whose safety and well being were my biggest considerations. John and Stacy assured me that I would be pleased with the location and surrounding neighborhood. They are absolutely right!
The resort was quiet during my stay; this was a surprising benefit. The heated pool and jacuzzi were ‚Äúmine‚Äù to use without sharing with any other guests MOST of the time. How rare is that?
The condo is well equipped with everything you might need for however short or long you‚Äôre staying.
Melted Massage is a stone‚Äôs throw from the condo. Outstanding services!
I cannot say enough how much I loved being at John and Stacy‚Äôs place.
Thank you‚úåüèª"

2023-04-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"John‚Äôs place was great. It looked exactly like it does in the pictures & was very clean & comfortable. The only downside is that the facility as a whole is in need of care & upkeep. All of the plants on the patio were overgrown & dead also, which took away from the ambiance out there."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,I loved John's place ! It was so beautiful with so many amenities! It truly was such a great experience.
2023-04-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"I agree with others‚Äô comments that John is an extremely nice and responsive host and the condo was spotlessly clean. My major disappointment was that I wanted to swim laps and could only do so in the mornings when the air temps were low 50s. At other times the ‚Äòfamily‚Äô pool was full of kids, and the ‚Äòadult‚Äô pool was closed while I was there. John offered to arrange for me to swim at a nearby resort, but it would have been time-consuming. Also the pickleball courts were always filled, and there was no sign-up process. John said the resort was crowded due to spring break. So I would advise to check to
see how crowded it is and whether both pools are open (if you want to swim)."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"A Great place to stay for a week, the bbq and free laundry were a great asset ! The place was as advertised. Great communication, hassle free check in .

2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This is a beautiful private space, very quiet and peaceful. It's easy to find and access is easy from the driveway of the ""Melted Masaage"" next door to unload the car. (We even visited the massage place a couple times while staying, very convenient being just a few steps away). The fireplace was great on the cold snowy days and the design and furnishings had a great southwest look and feeling."
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"John was amazing, he was always available when needed. I even left my Apple Air that was hidden between the bed and the nightstand (not a smart place to put it) but John contacted me the day we checked out and got home to tell me his cleaner had found it and he had her lock it up. He then went out of his way to help get the computer back to me in Salt Lake City delivering it personally. Such a great host, trustworthy, conscientious and kind. I will seek out John's properties to stay at in the future because he goes out of his way to make sure your stay is the best."

2024-03-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"House had only a small heater in bedroom, so it was cold in other rooms. Bed is on a slant so the person on the outside wall rolled to the middle of the bed. One had to sleep on couch. No Hot water in kitchen, so not sure dishes were sterilized. It was worth what we paid."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was a comfortable little space with a nice new kitchen. I appreciated the modern appliances, new floors, and very clean.

2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We enjoyed our stay.
2023-12-01,3.0,Stayed with kids,"This Airbnb was in a great location next to lots of restaurants and such, the kitchen was stocked great and the couch was comfy. However the bed needs to be replaced asap, we ended up sleeping on the couch and the blow up bed (good thing they had one in there). The heat for this place is via a plug in fireplace and once we figured it out we stayed warm but the first night was pretty chilly. The only reason for the lower rating is the bed situation, it‚Äôs otherwise a great little place in Washington."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Probably the best place I have stayed while traveling from Vegas to Utah definitely will be back great host wonderful clean casita!

2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Clean private bnb in a central location. Great communication with host. Lots of features including Keurig coffee, washer dryer, even a portable playpen for kids (which I didn‚Äôt need). I used the ice maker in the fridge for my cooler, and when I had forgotten zip locks to pack up my snacks, I opened the drawer and there was a box of them.
The next night of my trip I stayed at a hotel and amongst other things noticed the Wi-Fi at the hotel was very slow, another benefit of the BNB.
I recommend Raylinda‚Äôs BNB."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We came down for the weekend, and was happy to come to this place to stay. It was really comfortable, and nice to feel at home away from home instead of a hotel or motel room. The hosts were concerned they might be noisy, but it was not a problem for us. More likely, we were concerned we were noisier. There were many choices for restaurants, but we found Bishop's Cafe which we liked, and also there are Walmart and Albertson's nearby if you need grocery. Would come back here again if we are in the area again. Thanks for letting us stay here."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Perfect place to rest your head and spend time! We basically just slept here but it‚Äôs so cute and inviting I wish we could have spent some time there! She had all the amenities you would need and things you might forget like a pack and play!

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Raylinda's place was perfect for a quick trip to St. George for a wedding! It was spacious and clean with plenty of off street parking. It wasn't loud or anything. The area with the bed gets a little warm at night even with the box fan provided (at least in July), so we slept on the pull out couch and it was perfect. It is nearby many restaurants, a Walmart, and other stores, as well as has quick access to the freeway. I would recommend this place for anyone needing a place to stay for a couple days in St. George!"

2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Wonderful first experience with Airbnb. The Hideaway Casita was very nice and our side entrance was private and easy to get into. The quarters were clean, updated and well equipped with everything we could possibly need. Even the chocolates that awaited our arrival ‚Äì really nice. We hope to be able to stay there again and again on subsequent trips to visit our son who lives nearby. We talked about keeping this Hideaway our little secret but decided that wouldn‚Äôt be fair to Raylinda. Better to share the excellent experience we had with others as long as we get first choice on future dates‚Ä¶ (Just kidding). ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è"

2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I from the spacious driveway and clear check-in instructions to the moment I opened the door to this very clean, good-smelling, spacious Airbnb, it was smooth and happy sailing.
An unexpected - and much-appreciated perk - was the darkness of the bedroom with no windows (only a curtain separates it from the main living room/kitchen). I slept like a rock and didn‚Äôt want to get up in the morning!
I would love to stay in this Airbnb (if in the area again) for its cleanliness, convenient location, and helpful amenities (especially the washer and dryer)."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Late check-in was not an issue. Immaculate accommodation. Definitely stay there again in the future.

I texted Raylinda to see if I just couldn't find it and there was one on the door step within 20 minutes. Talk about good service! There is an Albertsons just down the road and a Natural Grocer around the corner. We made all our own food and the Rubbermaid containers were great for leftovers. We were also able to take care of some laundry with the machines in the unit."
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Updated and very clean. Quiet neighborhood and close to where I‚Äôll be working. Raylinda was very accommodating and friendly. Check in/out is a breeze. I‚Äôll be back for more stays.
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Best property we occupied during our entire three-week, eight-stop trip! Thank you!
It's obvious ‚Äòla casita‚Äô attached to a well-maintained property, was an add on at some point. Superhost Raylinda has made it completely self-contained, private and welcoming.
The property is located in an older established neighborhood. However, we were pleasantly surprised with the accommodation. Nice touches all round, without being fussy; immaculately kept unit. On-site parking close to unit entry, also a big plus.
The property is well stocked in every way and could easily be a long-term stay consideration. The premises are clean with high quality appliances and necessities. Bathroom and bedroom linens are of nice quality and abundant. Good water pressure for showers and in kitchen for washing dishes.
Raylinda‚Äôs Superhost status is well deserved. Highly recommend this property. Thank you!"

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We loved the tiny house (it was actually quite spacious). It was in a great location close to everything and was extremely quiet at night to sleep.

Spacious shower and bathroom also. Loved the large fridge and washer and dryer. Everything we needed and more (: if we‚Äôre ever in town again, this is where we‚Äôd stay!"
2024-05-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Great Tiny home! Everything we needed was provided in the space. It didn't feel that tiny inside. Was very comfortable. We made meals inside and the kitchen was roomy enough to do that. The bathroom was surprisingly spacious and there is even a washer and dryer. We only stayed 3 nights but would have been comfortable staying longer. Will definitely go back when we visit St. George again.
2024-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Such a great place to stay. Conveniently located, not far from the park, close to the restaurants we planned on going to in St. George. My husband is 6‚Äô4 and didn‚Äôt have issues with the ceiling being short. Would definitely stay here again."

The ability to charge an electric car is great, as long as you remember your charging cable! The bathroom was surprisingly large and nice, and well lit. The loft was fun. I was worried our dog might try to jump off the edge, but she didn‚Äôt! We really enjoyed the porch‚Ä¶ it was perfect for a quiet dinner in the cool evening."

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We loved staying here! This place had a lot of amenities for the space. The A/C worked really well, they had an extra fan, books, movies, and a dvd player. Finn‚Äôs place anticipated activities and needs and was equipped accordingly. He was very responsive and check out was easy!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Cozy cute and clean.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"This place was every thing we needed! . Initially, I was a little nervous that we (me, 6‚Äô3‚Äù husband, two kids, and two dogs) would be a bit too crammed but it was actually so comfortable for the 6 of us and the design is so thoughtful that we had plenty of room for all of our things. I feel like we could have fit one more kid in there with us! The location is excellent; close to the highway, shopping, fossil falls park, etc. I loved having a washer and dryer to use. The muffins and water were a nice touch. I wouldn‚Äôt recommend for kids two and under as there aren‚Äôt railings in the two lofts but it was perfect for us. My 3 year old loved saying hi to the chickens every morning. Thank you Finn!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Fun place to stay! Loved the layout and they were very great to work with. I will definitely book again.

2024-02-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,It was a fun experience to stay in a tiny house. My husband is 6‚Äô 3‚Äù which is a little too tall for the bathroom/shower area of the home. Not host fault though. üòÇOverall it was as a great place to stay for our weekend baseball tournament.
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We just stayed here for 1 night while driving home. But it's a great spot in St George and very close to the highway. The tiny home is really neat and Fin was super easy to chat with when I had questions. Pretty affordable too. Would definitely recommend.

2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"It was a great little place for my daughter and I to stay. It was convenient to everything and we loved the swivel tv
The only thing and it is very minor is it was dark when we got there and a light on the outside would have been helpful to find it easier
If ever back in St George we would definitely book again"
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Great tiny home, washer/dryer, enough closets and space for everything. Will definitely recommend.."

2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We needed a convenient overnight stay on our way from Colorado to California and was so happy to find this awesome place! Spotlessly clean (felt brand new!), modern, and comfortable. Just a couple of minutes off the freeway but in a nice, safe, quiet residential neighborhood- conveniently located near numerous eateries. The design of the tiny home is perfect- we were one family so the curtained bathroom was not an issue at all. The king bed was super comfortable, and my kids loved the ""treehouse"" feel of the 2 single bed loft area. Our SUV w pod was packed full of stuff and it was nice to be able to park on the gravel parking spot directly in front of the tiny home for easy access and reassurance that we could leave stuff in it safely overnight. There is a nice grassy area down the street for those who have a doggo w them. Host Fin was super responsive and easy to communicate with. Great stay and will definitely return on future road trips if available!"
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Thank you!
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Fin was very responsive. The place is centrally located near shopping and restaurants. It is in a quiet neighborhood. It has quick and easy access to I-15 and others major routes to the surrounding cities, national parks, and event centers in the area."

2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,I absolutely love the time we spent here. Beautiful little cabin!
2023-11-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"Fin‚Äôs place was a great place to stay for our couple days in St George. Fun to experience a stay in a tiny home. After a few days you get a little tired of ducking and crawling to bed. You must be agile enough to squat and crawl. Very low ceilings in the sleeping area. I would also suggest a few more cozy blankets this time of year. It got a little chilly up in the sleeping areas in the 40 degree nights. Also, the freeway/road noise was a little loud at times. But, definitely not a deal breaker. Fin was very responsive with all communication. No issues and easy check in and out!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great place to stay at in St George!
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Loved the place 10/10

The gift cake from the hosts is very tasty and was very appropriate after a long journeyü•∞Everything is very comfortable, clean, cozy!

Finn was easy to work with and very pleasant.
Highly recommend."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was a nice private place to stay for my friend and I while we explored the national parks. Has all the amenities you need close to stores/restaurants and overall felt very comfortable. There are two lofts, one with a comfortable queen or king(?) bed and accessible via stairs. The other ""kids"" loft is definitely for kids or a light adult given the tall ladder needed to access. Finn is a responsive host."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Finn's tiny house was exactly what we were looking for staying in the area. It looks quite small on the outside, but is roomy and spacious on the inside with everything that you will need. The location is perfect as well for all shopping, eating, going-out needs."

2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Fin‚Äôs place was great. My dogs and I felt right at home. His place is located in a very peaceful neighborhood & had all the essentials and more. The muffins they provided where insanely good haha & much appreciated! I will definitely book again when I‚Äôm in the area!
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"It was exactly what we were looking for; a comfortable place for the three of us to stay at a great price. The huge TV was great and WIFI was plenty fast. We're family so it was perfect. It's best for folks with a close relationship since the bathroom doesn't have an actual door but has a privacy curtain, and the bedrooms are lofts which are open to the main room. The twin bed loft is accessed by a ladder. Again, all this was fine for our family trip and exactly what we were expecting, thanks to the detailed photos and description. The check-in instructions include detailed photos which were appreciated. Everybody thought the beds were very comfortable. Definitely would stay here again!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This property lived up to Finn‚Äôs description and was consistent with other reviews I read.

Thanks so much!"

2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Fin‚Äôs place was really nice and just what we were hoping for. It wasn‚Äôt too far from Tuachan and downtown St. George. It was a clean and fun place to stay.
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"It was at 11pm, but I arrived almost at 1 o'clock after two hours. I arrived at Fin's house because I was tired because it was late, but Fin also turned on the air conditioner in advance, so I had a comfortable stay like my own home. I'd like to go again if I get another chance if I get another chance"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This was one of my funnest airbnb stays! It looked exactly like the picture and was actually roomier than i was expecting!
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Very nice guesthouse, we loved the space!! Thank you."
2023-08-01,4.0,Stayed one night,Great tiny house and a good deal. Finn was extremely informative and made the experience a breeze. Please keep in mind that there is a height limit of 6‚Äô2‚Äù to fit under the loft and into the bathroom. The bathroom also doesn‚Äôt have a door; it has a curtain.
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,absolutely loved this place!fin was very helpful too.
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Fin‚Äôs place was just as advertised. Definitely small, but comfortable and plenty of room for me and and my wife. The place was incredibly clean with all the amenities you could possibly need, plus a huge tv. It worked perfectly for us."

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Would love to stay here again
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Just as described and looked like photos. The loft with 2 beds was a little scary for my two girls to climb up to the ladder so keep in mind if traveling with younger folks or if thinking about grown adults using that space. The tv was neat because it could be turned to watch from main bed or couch. Having full laundry was a great amenity. Thanks for the muffins!
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Our first stay in a tiny house did not disappoint! Finn‚Äôs place was awesome, with lots of clever touches everywhere to make great use of the space. My boys said it was their favorite stay on our cross country road trip!"

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We are a family of 4 and stayed just one night at Fin‚Äôs place. The location was good with grocery stores, restaurants and cafes near by. You could stay there if you‚Äôre planning on visiting Zion as well. The location was as described and we would definitely stay there again."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"The tiny house was surprisingly spacious and included everything needed for a great stay (pots and pans, comfortable seating, etc.). Fin was very responsible throughout the entire process and the bed was EXTREMELY comfortable. 5/5"

Thank you, Finn!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"This tiny home was quite spacious and didn't feel cramped - which is saying a lot for a gal with 2 50lb dogs! The outside was adorable and I appreciated being able to park directly outside the front door, as I was coming from a long, hot 8-hour drive. This unit had everything I could possibly need, with clear instructions left on the counter, which included not having to be shy with the AC on this 100+ degree day. Everything was clean, aesthetically pleasing, and easy to access. Fin was also very quick to reply and accommodate some changes in my timing. I highly recommended staying here next time you want to experience a tiny home in St. George!"

2023-06-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"fun design.
would be great for those under 40 yrs old and under 6 ft tall"
2023-06-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,Great location. Felt very safe with my two kids. Fin was very responsive and helpful. Everything was laid out with a cellular number to contact with any concerns or questions. Tiny house description was spot on! My only complaint would be the towels didn‚Äôt smell fresh and the water in the kitchen was cloudy. The towels were washed but perhaps the hard water gave them an unfavorable aroma? The master bed was super comfortable. I would recommend checking this place out for your next trip to St. George.
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My husband and I loved this place! The television was awesome to watch movies on. Fin was very responsive, and the muffins they left for us when we arrived were great!"

2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great location and hassle-free stay!
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Fin's beautiful mini home has maxi appeal. By maxi appeal, I mean it has most everything that a large house has inside (maybe more, i.e., microwave/convection oven, over/under washer dryer & more). The loft was different, but we got a good night's sleep. It was convenient to Albertsons, Costco, Red Hills Desert Garden & a very popular Mexican restaurant (Angelicas Cafe). Overall, it's a very lovely home. Don't hesitate. Stay there."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This tiny home was great. I will be staying here again.
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,This is my 2nd stay here because I enjoy it so much! One of my kids said it's their favorite air bnb we've ever stayed at. I love the quiet neighborhood and the fun loft areas.

2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"My family and I couldn‚Äôt wait to stay at this home. We love to watch the tiny house living on YouTube and wanted to have the experience of staying in one. We were very pleased overall.
We went to Zion National Park to hike and the Airbnb was only an hour away from it. The location was very ideal there was nearby supermarkets and shopping plazas. Our kids loved the lofts and would relax there watching their tablets or the big tv. The sofa was very comfortable and there was a beautiful small patio out front where we could sit and enjoy the nice weather. Very Satisfied!"
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Fins place is even better than the photos. Beautiful modern comfortable and very clean

All of the appliances and Furnishings are done with great taste and style. The decor is both modern and yet warm and comfortable.
I have already rebooked another stay!
The cabin is convenient right off the highway and a peaceful neighborhood and could comfortably house a couple and kids or even another couple because of the separate Loft spaces."
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We loved our stay at this cute tiny home! So close to so much and easy access to the freeway! Would stay here again!
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We had a lot of fun staying in a small place... something the kids had never done. The ladder to the loft was a bit hard on the feet, and we learned quickly to wear shoes when climbing."
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,would stay again. for price is a good value. make sure you can go up and down those stairs. :)
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This little house was so cool! So clean and so cute! Exactly as expected and better! After staying in a place with a kitchen yet no cooking or eating utensils I very much appreciate the simple availability to make me think I was going to cook‚Ä¶ lol, yet this place was quiet and serene, it was just off the main road with tons of restaurants and stores in both directions! One night there were so many choices it took me hours to decide‚Ä¶ our only complaints are silly, because this place was so perfect for 2 of us‚Ä¶ me and my 16yr old‚Ä¶ he chose to sleep in the big bed with me, because the ladder to the other loft hurt his feet, I wonder if he had it on backwards but I didn‚Äôt care. It was nice to think he didn‚Äôt mind being so close to me‚Ä¶ the bathroom was a good size for a small space! Washer and dryer were so helpful since we didn‚Äôt quite have enough clothes for our trip and we got a little dirty on an off road tour we took out of hurricane. All in all 10/10!"
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Super clean. Everything looked brand new. Very close to shopping and places to eat. Easy to find. Nice neighborhood.

The immediate area doesn‚Äôt have much to do besides big box retail, but it‚Äôs close to the highway and easy to get around town.
Overall this place fit our needs perfectly!"
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Though it is a ‚Äútiny house‚Äù the host maximized the space and we never felt crammed at all. There was plenty of room for all of our stuff and the house came with everything else we needed. It was a very comfortable stay.
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Perfect for my needs.
I stopped at Fin's house, as a break
from 6000 miles and National Park visits.
So, to be back in the city, and close to everything was great!
One road to all the things you could want, if not then turn on second road to find more!
Not my first AirBnB in someone's yard, felt like I lived in that neighborhood.
The house is bigger than it looks, so is the TV, Microwave and Bathroom!
Having a washer & dryer to yourself is awesome.
Close to Zion NP, others are reachable.
I will be back!"

2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Incredibly fun and fully-featured little house (washer dryer!), kids loved the high views and the swivel TV. Incredible value!

2024-02-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"the bed if it is quite bad, the place was quiet and beautiful. but in addition to a accommodation what you want is to rest well, and that was not possible, the mattress is very bad."
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Great little place to stay for our family of four. It was nice that we could bring our dog and the location was excellent. Jason was great at getting back to us with any questions we had. I would stay again.
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay. Very clean and perfect for what I was looking for
2024-02-01,2.0,Stayed a few nights,"The worst thing about the unit was the shower, you either had to take a scalding hot shower or ice cold shower. The shower valve wouldn‚Äôt mix hot and cold. The front door has a large crack around the door letting in cold air. My wife said the bed wasn‚Äôt very comfortable. It was nice that it had a fireplace. The owner was very responsive to our request for some paper towels. The unit is nicely decorated but the exterior and amenities seem very dated and don‚Äôt match the pictures. The unit was fairly clean other than the dust on the HVAC unit and dog hair on the couch. Because of the shower I would not recommend staying here."
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Everything was perfect!
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great spot for a quick stay. If you love the trails you can walk from this place and be at the trail head. I was thankful that we read reviews about getting to the place before dark as it could have been hard to find if we didn't. Once you find it you can come and go and it is easy to find. Right by the pool which has perks and some downfall. One night we had some people in the pool who were loud after 11pm. We used the hot tube at night, which was super nice looking at the stars."
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This was by far one of the cheapest places to stay, there was so much to do and the room was super cozy. Jason was an excellent host. I will definitely be back again."
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Jason's studio is very comfortable with a sweet gas fireplace to make it feel even cozier. The area is pleasant to walk in and the pool and hot tub are nice on a sunny day and lovely to look at from the patio. Jason is easy to reach if needed and very responsive to questions.
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The place was good the location was close to everything, try to arrive when the sun is out still because we had a hard time finding during the night"
2023-12-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"Great cozy place with everything we needed, including hot shower, fireplace and public hot tub.
Was a little difficult finding the unit after dark and determining the best place to park. Street parking is a couple minute walk from the unit. Seemed safe, but was not well lit. King-size bed mattress was showing a lot of wear and not particularly the most comfortable.
Overall, very clean, cute, reasonably priced, and would stay here again!"
2023-12-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great condo in a great location, right next to St. George's Zen trail and easy access to the city. The hot tub and pool were clean and felt great after a tiring day of exploring all the area has to offer. I'll stay here again next time. Highly recommend!"
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place!
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place was beautiful. Perfect location for day trips to the national parks and nearby state parks. The hosts were very responsive and helpful, they came within ten minutes when we needed extra blankets and the fire place lit as the seasons were just changing. The hot tub was lovely and never crowded. Couldn‚Äôt recommend staying here enough."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Really enjoyed our stay at Jason's place. He and the managers were very responsive did not delay helping with anything we needed. They brought us more propane so we could use the grill which was very nice. The hot tub and pool were great and right outside the back door. The wifi worked great. We didn't get to use the pickleball courts, but they looked nice. The lights over the sidewalk leading to the door weren't on at night during our stay--it would have been nice if they were working as we were often coming and going after dark. The listing also has ""dedicated work space"" as an amenity (one of the main reasons we chose this one over others) so we were hoping for some kind of desk and a chair as we worked from the Airbnb for one of the days we were there and had to sit at the bar stools or on the couch while working. Would definitely stay here again. Great location with a lot of good food and other things to do very close by."
2023-11-01,4.0,Stayed one night,confusing to find our room since we arrived after dark otherwise fine
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We loved staying here! It was the perfect size for a girls trip for three to St. George. It's in a nice part of town and one of our favorite parts was the two pools. We got to explore the town then come back and relax in the heated pool and hot tub.
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Looooved their condo and location
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Perfect for a weekend trip!
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,We stay here often because we love the location and amenities. Jason communicates quickly and is very helpful
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Loved this quiet little space! It felt so peaceful. Definitely what we needed!
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Great spot! The pool and hot tub are steps out the back door. Host helped out instantly when needed for something minor. Really enjoyed it.
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Cozy little place. Wish we would've had time to use the pool, it looked amazing. The resort was easy to find but finding the rooms is confusing so try to get there before dark and it might help. Clean and comfortable."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This was a great getaway! We would totally stay at Jason's place again!
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This is my second time staying at this resort, different unit. The place is spacious, clean and quiet. This is a great spot! Will stay here again."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Very pleasant stay. Pool just outside our gate which is convenient. Loved this spot for our trip
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Beautiful room, fun resort, quiet location. Will be back!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,My stay here was amazing. The host was very responsive and very helpful with my check-in and throughout my stay the host helped me with any issues I had.
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We are two young couples who have been looking for a place to stay in St. George and eventually came across Jason's AirBnB.
The apartment is part of a resort, relatively off the beaten path and quiet location. There are plenty of parking spaces and free of charge.
Everything was spotlessly clean. The bathroom was huge. For sleeping there was a big bed and a fold-out couch.
Another plus: The Zion National Park can be reached in less than an hour from the AirBnB. So it's very suitable for day trips
We can't say anything negative overall about Jason's apartment. We enjoyed it very much and would definitely come back anytime!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We had a great time - condo was cozy and conveniently located near the pool.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Awesome place! We very much enjoyed our stay while we were there! Easy to find, gave clear Instructions on how to get into home. Amazing vacation!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Nice & clean place. Definitely recommended. It has everything you need. We really enjoyed our stay. I will definitely book again if I go there next time.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My daughter and I wanted to take a few days, and go on a road trip to relax. We found this unit, which was perfect!! The condo itself was in a great location. It was a very quiet community. There are two pools. One is a family pool, and the other one is fir adults. Our unit is right outside of the family pool. We ended up spending our time at the family pool as our access code didn't work at the adult pool.
I have no complaints, just a few suggestions.
We ended up staying 3 nights, versus the two nights we initially booked. By Saturday we had filled the trashcan and were low on paper towels, as well as toilet paper, so I'd pack a few garbage bags as well as a roll of paper towels, but we made it work, and had a blast.
Jason was very prompt at responding to any questions we had.
I really enjoyed our stay here, and I would absolutely stay there again."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Great place. Would stay there again.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Such a cute condo! Had everything we needed for a nights stay. Jacuzzi tub was a definite perk!!
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Number 42 ! My New club med !
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Jason is an amazing host. He is very thorough and didn'tleave us questioning anything. Check-in was extremely easy, and the condo was better than described. The pictures are accurate, but simply don'tdo it any justice. We will definitely be back as we travel to Utah often. You will have no regrets staying here, I'm sure you'll love it just as much as we did. Thank you Jason, we look forward to staying at your condo again."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Jason‚Äôs place was very nice and as advertised, they have two pools, one for families and one for adults only. It is in a great location and quiet. The only negative is the water pressure on the shower is very very low, they have showers at the lockers by the pool which we used instead. Other then that the place is great."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Sent all instructions needed in a timely manner and took the extra time to send a video with directions. Beautiful area, great hikes within a 45 minute drive!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Jason was a great host! I‚Äôll definitely be back!
2023-06-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,"We really loved this stay and would recommend this place to others - if you're a mountain biker, it's right next to the trailhead for an extensive trail system with excellent trails, and if you're a rock climber, Snow Canyon is just 15 minutes away. The pool and hot tub were great additions for a post-biking or rock climbing adventure. Overall, we enjoyed our stay. There were a couple of things that we didn't like, that others might want to know:
1) All responses from ""Jason"" were clearly automated. We had an issue one night with a bunch of drunk people in the pool, and no one responded. It's totally OK if people want to be in the pool at midnight, but it's disrespectful to be loud and rude when people are sleeping.
2) The water pressure in the shower is 0 - which is fine if you only take baths...
3) No recycling...
4) There was no extra coffee in the room next to the ice machine!!!
Again, we loved this place, and hope this information is helpful to others!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Amazing stay! Had such a good time very cozy and clean can‚Äôt wait for my next trip to St. George!
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Had a wonderful stay! The room was clean and check in was easy. Great pool and hot tub area.
2023-05-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"great stay! we had unit 5, right across from the pool, the unit was clean, bed is comfy and pillows as well. 2 miles from restaurants and freeway. i will definately come back again."
2023-05-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"#5
It was a lovely staying here. It was just me so it felt a bit too big but also perfect. Speaking of huge, I loved the bathtub! I felt uneasy using the Jets because of the noticeable buildup around them. I don‚Äôt know when the last time the inner workings and the Jets were cleaned. Maybe I‚Äôm a germaphobe.
The king size best was so nice and comfy! I was extremely exhausted after a full day of hiking so the creaky bed frame didn‚Äôt bother me. If I hadn‚Äôt been so exhausted I‚Äôm not sure I‚Äôd be able to sleep.
One last thing, if you‚Äôre a coffee drinker the coffee maker is off brand version of a Keurig. I found coffee grounds in my coffee.
These things so so insignificant to how beautiful and right at home I felt. I loved all the roses and the blooming cacti. Such a lovely place!"
2023-05-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place and awesome pool/spa! Can't wait to get back!!

2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,My family and I had a wonderful stay at Jason's place. A great location for families. The room was very clean and well stocked and it is on the ground level just steps away from the pool and hot tub. Jason was very quick at answering my questions and accommodating with some requests that we had. I highly recommend if you are in the St. George area.

2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The place was as advertised. Everything was very clean. The bathroom was very spacious. Pool right outside, i didnt have a chance to use it, it rained almost every day, but look perfect for a hot day. Host was very responsive and proactive with instructions!"
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This was a great little suite that was perfect for me, my wife, and our 9-month-old. It was a little out of the way of the historic sites in St. George, but a great price for the area! The location was easy to find and access with a door code, and Jason was very proactive and responsive in his messages. The place wasn't as clean as I would have expected, but it was certainly not gross or messy. The fridge was a bit grimy, but it met our needs. The appliances were all good quality. The big bathroom was really nice to have."

2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was a very wonderful stay. Jason and his team was on top of all communications, and gave clear directions on how to get to our unit.
whenever we had any questions, we were able to have them resloved within 10 minutes for the majority of the questions. very professional and customer oriented.
The unit itself was clean and bright and inviting. The neighborhood felt safe, and like you were on your own little private piece of paradise. It was also nice being able to have the pool available, and all the shops so near for shopping.
Overall it was a great stay and I'd love to do it again sometime."

2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We loved the setup and the fact that there are multiple pools, a fitness center and other on-site amenities. Our unit was clean with effective cosmetic updates. The host was very communicative and endures all necessary information is available beforehand. It‚Äôs a little far from most central Saint George places/things, and if you don‚Äôt watch the videos explaining where your unit is‚Ä¶ finding your your unit could be hard. But overall excellent experience and stay!"

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"David‚Äôs is the 2nd condo I‚Äôve stayed at at Amira and it was just as amazing as I expected. My only gripe is that the sliding shutters over the back double-doors seem to be coming loose from the wall, and one of the doors doesn‚Äôt stay closed so we had to prop it closed with pillows. Besides that, it was spotless, smelled great, the bathroom was squeaky clean, the kitchen had basic amenities for our short weekend stay. We didn‚Äôt get a chance to get in the pool or hot tub this time, but I‚Äôve swam in both before and the complex does a great job with upkeep and cleaning. 10/10 recommend anyone to stay at these condos"

2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great place to stay for a short visit.
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We loved staying there and the entire experience. The only change I would recommend is having the drawer in the closet more accessible ( could not open it due to the way it was positioned). I really hope we come back to St. George and if we do ,will stay at this place. Thanks!"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great value for St. George. The unit was clean and had everything we needed for a short stay. The location provides easy access to the city sites and nearby hiking. David kept us informed and welcome. He was very responsive to us. The complex has several amenities that we unfortunately did not have time to take advantage of. We will definitely stay here again when in the St. George area.
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My husband and I just wanted to get out of the northern Utah snow for a bit, so we thought we would take a quick trip to St. George.

Very quiet resort, room was clean and perfect for us as we planned to be outside most of our trip though we could have easily cooked/relaxed in the room. The massage facility on site was closed due to short staffing. The hosts had a binder with tons of recommendations. We hiked one day in Zion, drove to Bryce another , and rented jet skis on Sand Halllow. We were surprised by the lack of ‚Äúlate‚Äù (past 8pm) dining options in St George, especially on Sunday so be sure to plan ahead! The area is beautiful though and we‚Äôre looking forward to coming back !"
2021-09-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"The room was very roomy and clean which is very important factor. David of the Airbnb provide detailed instructions on how to find the room. He was quick to respond when asked for information and assistance! The rose bushes were beautiful!
The only issues I had was the bed was not very comfortable to sleep on and it felt like it was tipping me on my head. We did use the adult pool, but it could used a little more upkeep."

2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We stayed here for our Wedding Anniversary and LOVED it!!! The unit was clean, quiet and the kitchen and full-sized fridge added to the bonus. David was readily available to communicate with, and having a ""guidebook"" that his wife Tricia, put together, was so helpful. If you're thinking about getting a massage while staying there, open that ""guidebook"" as soon as you walk in the door (it will be on the coffee table), and it will show you how to get a nice little discount on your massage...among many other tips. The parking is covered and close to the unit too, so follow the instructions on the email he'll send you before checking in. Enjoy your stay!!!"

2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This studio room is great! It has nice views out to the pool it‚Äôs in a quiet part of town and it has been remodeled to feel very clean and updated. The kitchen was very useful and made it easy to have meals at the room instead of having to eat out. It had new clean appliances as well. The bathroom was very roomy and clean. Instructions were simple and easy to follow and the hosts communicated everything clearly to the point we didn‚Äôt have to bother them for clarification. I‚Äôve all ready started recommending this place to families and friends for when they visit.
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,It was a very clean place! Also loved how everything you needed in the kitchen was right there for you. It was nice to go to Zion national park and then come back to a pool. It is about an hour from Zion so we had to wake up extra early but it was worth it!

Checkin is so simple with keyless entry and access codes sent within the Airbnb app on day of arrival. The adult pool is right out the back patio. Patio gets sun all afternoon and is quite private. The renovations and decor complete the stay with it‚Äôs clean and fresh feel. The kitchen space and tools are limited but doable for easy meals. The resort property itself is small and quiet which was very welcomed and well maintained. David provided a great book with everything we needed so there was no need to reach out to him. Great stay, will return."

2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Such a great place to stay! Twila makes every very easy and is super communicative. I definitely recommend getting the german pancake for breakfast -- it was amazing. There is more of a bed & breakfast feel rather than your typical stale AirBnb. Highly recommended
2024-03-01,2.0,Stayed a few nights,"TLDR: great location, lots of natural light, but only surface-level cleaned, bed misrepresented, unit needs maintenance, lack of usable storage. Total $515/3 = 172/night.
PROS:
- Full kitchen, spacious unit, easy off-street pkg
- w/i 10 min walk to many restaurants/shops
- Twila answered ?s prior to booking, & to accept a reservation adjustment quickly
CONS:
- NOT a Murphy bed (doesn't fold up against wall); Spring Air Chiro Elegance mattress, not a Tempur-Pedic as listed
- Needs deep cleaning (visible dust on furniture/floors, dirty utensils in w/ clean, pet hair on rug, old food in freezer, burned out light in bathroom, etc.)
- Needs maintenance (7"" hole in drywall, ceiling fan unbalanced so loud/clanky when on, wallpaper falling off in multiple locations, a few blinds broken, wood trim inside front door unsecured)
- Most storage unusable due to random stuff in most drawers/shelves. Had to move lots of items to have anywhere to unpack.
- Listed check out time (10 am) felt early."

2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Very cute space in an older building close to downtown St. George. We didn't want to stay in a sterile hotel and are so happy we found this loft! It's a charming vibe with the pottery store downstairs and a chicken coop in the back parking area. Cute little studio with a view of the big Mormon Temple in town. Was perfect for two people and a brief overnight in town on a roadtrip through Utah's natural wonders.

2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Very nice neighborhood where it's about a 15 minute walk to some great restaurants, especially By George's. Very comfortable bed where we slept like babies. Only minor quibbles were Wi-Fi info was incorrect and Twila had a great DVD selection but after perusing her library for 15 minutes before finally picking out a movie, the DVD played didn't work. Another plus was Twila prepared a delicious German pancake breakfast for us. Nice touch. Oh, and the kitchen was well stocked too. Thank you!"

2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We were just passing through in a road trip and decided to stay in St. George for the night because had gotten caught in a storm. I last minute booked this place which was easy to do, find and get into. Definitely more expensive than I would have liked since we were just staying until the storm died down the next morning and we could get back on the road. It was clean and comfortable. Only little mishap was Twila thought my dogs had damaged her couch which was not possible because my bags were on the couch and my dogs slept immediately upon arrival on their dog bed. She let it go once I explained how it couldn‚Äôt possibly have been my dogs but just felt a little weird. Also informed of an an additional $25 pet cleaning fee after my stay even though I had paid the $25 pet cleaning fee through Airbnb. I stood my ground on that one and she agreed to call it even."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,First time staying in St. George and just driving through. Twila‚Äôs place was perfect for one night and I can easily see being comfortable here for a longer term stay. Forget the hotel.
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,My fianc√© and I stayed here for a night before our 4 day trip to Zion. It was a great refresher to have an actual bed for a night!

Homey, comfortable, peaceful, and hassle-free in every way. I just feel bad I had to rush out and didn't clean my dishes.
On top of that, Twila was more than willing to work with me on a flexible check-in to accommodate my work schedule and dog. I'll be traveling to St. George for work periodically over the next few years, and I'm going to try and book this place every time.
Thank you, Twila!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Twila‚Äôs apartment is spotless and very comfortable. It was a good choice for the end of our visit to Utah‚Äôs natural parks. We had an easy 2-hour trip back to the Las Vegas airport the next morning.

A few things out of the host‚Äôs control that you may want to know, depending on your sensitivity to noise. 1) There is rooster nearby that won‚Äôt let you sleep past 8am. 2) There is noticeable road noise coming from loud cars. The traffic died down by 10pm."

2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Twilas place was great, we only stayed for one night. She has a pottery shop at the bottom that unfortunately we didn‚Äôt get time to visit.

It's a perfect size for an individual traveler like me or a couple, it's very private, meticulously clean and very comfortable. Everything works, the bed is comfortable and its very nicely stocked with amenities. What makes it ideal for me is the fact it's right in town so everything accessible by walking. Plus, being a woman traveling alone, having her nearby makes me feel safe. Twila is always very reponsive too!"

2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Thanks again Twila! Me and Cody had a great stay in St George. Twila's place is cute with the most thoughtful touches and is walking distance to the historic downtown. Short drives to lots of hikes too. Its nice and quiet at night and is so comfy. Twila is a great host and very responsive. We'll be back!
2022-12-01,3.0,Stayed with a pet,"The room was great but we had a negative experience due to a host not wanting to manage her property. A faulty door mechanism locked us inside the room, obviously a huge safety hazard. Twila‚Äôs response was annoyed & inconvenienced. She was ""in bed & worked all day.‚Äù It was 10pm. She implied we didn't know how doors work & ended up showing up with no warning, opened the door from the outside letting our dog out & left without telling us how to prevent it from happening again (it did, we ended up taking the batteries out of the lock.) Annoyed, she profiled us for having dirt bikes & filed a claim for ""un-washable dog hair & oil stain"" on the sheets. We (dogs included) used the room only to sleep for 2 nights. We didn‚Äôt leave a stain (all gear was left in the car) & photos of the dog hair are laughable. It was a tiny amount that must have been transferred from our clothes. We never let them on the bed. As world travelers who regularly use Airbnb, we respected the room & left it very clean"
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Twila's place is fully reflective of her peaceful and vibrant presence. Not only is it somewhere tough to leave (as is the meaningful convo with Twila) it is cozy and inviting from the moment of pulling up. Even though the location is right off a decently busy street, it feels fully removed, as if floating on its own private island. Definitely will stay with Twila again and possibly explore one of her other accommodations! Thank you, Twila!"

The place itself was beautifully designed with caring and thoughtful amenities. Great kitchen and love the communal idea where people can use up whatever was left from previous guests and also contribute something themselves too. An excellent bed too! As far as Twila, her instant communication and flexibility made our last few days on our vacation filled with ease and comfort. She also has a pottery shop below the Airbnb with some of the most beautiful kitchenware. Highly recommend to check it out. Thank you Twila and Renee for everything!!!"

Clean, well appointed, thoughtful design and details, literally anything you could possibly need was provided. Details like a 5 star hotel, welcome baskets, robes, sparkling cider, water bottles, earplugs, snacks, drinks etc. we felt very spoiled. The hot tub was an added bonus, and was cozy private and clean. Up on the cliffs, but Downtown location was great and central to everything. The views from the deck/windows of the city and landscapes were beautiful. We loved our stay with these great hosts."

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We loved staying here in every way! John was great to work with. His place was beautiful, comfortable, very clean and inviting. Even though it was in a large complex it was quiet and peaceful! Our grandchildren loved playing in the pool, playground and had fun with the bunkbeds. We enjoyed sitting out on the patio watching the kids play in the pool. Very peaceful complex and John was wonderful. He included lots of local information which we appreciated since we were not familiar with the area. We couldn't have been happier with our stay. We would love to return again and will refer friends and family to John."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We love this place. This is our second time staying in John‚Äôs condo. The resort itself is fantastic, and so family friendly. John‚Äôs condo is so clean.

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This place was absolutely beautiful! Great location, very clean and felt right at home. John is very responsive and an amazing host. We will definitely be staying here again!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We loved our time here. A good sign of this is when your kids don't want to leave. We felt right at home and had everything we needed. The kitchen was well stocked with what you'd expect. The bedrooms and bathrooms were well appointed. It was nice to have access to all the apps on the Smart TV's, including YouTube TV. Our kids especially loved the PS4 on the options for games. What a great idea to have available to your guests. John was really great to communicate with. We had a little blip with the YouTube TV, but John was very quick to address and fix the problem. The only thing I would address and this really isn't a big deal at all, is to maybe toss the basketball and buy a new one. The one that's kept in the bedroom closet has a bunch of lumps and really isn't usable. Again very minor complaint. Other than that we loved our stay and would definitely consider coming here again."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place is an absolute gem! Clean, feels new, bright and airy, perfect gathering for a group or family. We will definitely be coming back."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We had such a pleasant time! The pool was great and the condo was even better than we imagined it would be! So cozy and felt like a home away from home!
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"I gave it five stars because it was a great place to stay. At the end of the review is one potential downside to be aware of.
Overall, this place was phenomenal and I will happily stay here again without question. It was a great layout and my favorite part was that each bedroom had its own bathroom. That may not seem like a big deal, but with a readily accessible pool and hot tub everyone needs to shower afterwards. Having three separate bathrooms made it so easy.
I love having YouTube TV on each TV. This made it easy to enjoy separate programs in each room.
The one downside is internet access. Yes, there is WiFi, but it was often overwhelmed. This did not affect the star rating simply because I did not go to St. George to be online. If I had to do work while there this would‚Äôve made it extremely difficult, if not impossible. Also my phone carrier, T-Mobile, had almost no reception so a hotspot was not an option"
2024-03-01,5.0,Group trip,"John was so responsive, so kind, so helpful‚Ä¶ we loved the place, the amenities, the location, the pool, hot tub, and pickleball courts were great to have so close too.

2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"John is a great host and the condo was exactly what we expected, thanks!"
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We had a little bit of a hard time finding it because maps took us to the wrong place based on the address located on the listing.

Truly wish we could have stayed longer.

The pool was awesome as was the hot tub. Nothing like a nice soak after spending a day at Zion National Park.

John even worked with us on an earlier check in. Fantastic!! I would come back here again easily when we stay in St. George!"

2023-01-01,2.0,Stayed a few nights,"The Amira Resort unit I occupied had a lot of deferred maintenance issues that are relatively easy repairs to make. The unit was not clean and had a leftover in the fridge. The rate was an eye-catcher but after all the fees that were added, the out-the-door price was discouraging."

2023-01-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,Place was fine. Simple. Not elaborate or fancy but worked for our needs. One reason we booked though was because the listing said heated pool. It was not heated and the jacuzzi was warm but needed to be warmer. Was looking forward to an evening in the pool and spa after hiking. Was disappointed
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"The unit was very spacious and unique.
I enjoyed the jacuzzi tub in the bathroom.
There's also public pools because it's a resort!"
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"There was a part of me that wanted to give a low score because I don‚Äôt want this place to be booked up when I go to use it again‚Ä¶ but I guess that‚Äôs why I gotta give it a 5 star rating! This place was everything I needed it to be and more. I was looking to get out of town for some peace and quiet and Jason‚Äôs place was perfect to do that. I‚Äôm a small details person, so here are some of the things that I loved: 1. the mattresses on the beds were perfect, 2. The pool and hot tub right outside the back door, 3. I had the pool and hot tub to myself the entire time I was there, 4. The HUGE jetted bathtub, 5. The workspace, and 6. The price was right. I am definitely planning to return as often as I can!"

We only stayed one night, and there was some noise for a while. Kids playing and yelling right outside our door. However, it wasn't at night or anything, so it didn't bother any sleep. There is also a large crack in the front door that you can easily look through, which makes it feel much less private."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"perfect , just what I was looking for."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Thank you for a wonderful stay. Will look for this place again for future travels in the area.

2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Great location! Very private and personal space. Not connected and did not hear hosts or other guests.
Often times, airbnbs you can hear other guests or hosts but this was extra private and felt amazing.
One downside, the pillows smelled like they were wet too ling before they were put in the dryer or not enough soap was used during wash. But that was a minor problem.
But still the best Airbnb, I‚Äôve been at."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Clean, simple, conveniently located, as advertised, great value. Only stayed 1 night. Arrived late and left early but would recommend in future."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Was a great pit stop on my way to Zion - about an hour out from it and this was a BEAUTIFUL location. The Casita was huge, bigger than what it looked like in the pictures and it made me feel right at home.
Bed was firm and though I'm usually not a fan of firm beds, it was SUPER comfortable to sleep on and had an incredible night of rest on it. The linens on the bed were top notch and I would buy some for myself if I knew the details. Would stay here again if I'm back in Utah :)"
2023-04-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"The casita was very nice, quaint, and great parking right in front. We enjoyed staying and Scott was very responsive to our needs. This is a lovely place, however, the bathroom would not be good for someone in a wheelchair. Airbnb does not include this parameter in their required descriptions."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Super cozy place. Very clean and comfortable. Perfect location too
2023-04-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"this casita was great for our short stay. the bed was comfortable, the shower was nice & hot, and there were lots of movies to choose from! it was located in a quiet neighborhood & was very affordable. the only thing that could‚Äôve been better was the cleanliness. there was some trash behind the chair & bed, some hair in the shower, and no waters in the fridge (as advertised) :(
overall, the casita was very cozy & welcoming. if we visit the st. george area in the future, we wouldn‚Äôt hesitate to stay again."
2023-04-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"All in all a good stay. Noteworthy was cleaning appeared ok but cobwebs and dust, trash left behind the chair and worn bed linens. Only 1/8 roll of toilet paper in the unit upon arrival, it eas cold out and the thermostat was locked. We had to message the host to get that corrected. We had to buy our own coffee day 3 (only 1/3 can of folgers) and the sink faucet spout fell off one and sprayed us. Fortunately I fixed it and in truth that isn't anyone's fault really. I feel as a host myself, more detailed care in cleaning and some maintenance could be done. It is also noteworthy that he does have a very high rating over many many reviews. This was simply our experience."
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great little casita! Very clean and comfy- nice firm bed. Host was very responsive. Would definitely stay again!
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Just right for our stay in St. George. Clean and comfortable. We enjoyed watching a DVD. Located in a nice neighborhood.
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Scott‚Äôs place is serene, beautifully kept, and comfortable. This space is perfect for those who want a quiet (no traffic noise), neat, tech-friendly (good Wi-Fi and a work desk), private overnight or longer stay. Restaurants are plentiful and within a 10 minute drive, and if you walk up toward the red rocks the views are stunning at sunrise and sunset. Kitchen and bathroom supplies are minimal, but the shower is huge with lots of hot water, the microwave worked well, and the fridge kept things cold (with water bottles inside). I would stay here again without question."

One minor concern that won't apply to everyone...My husband has chemical allergies, so we are particularly sensitive to fragrances. There is a perfume odor, probably from fabric softener or an air freshener, in the apartment that was very strong to us and which lingered on our clothes. I don't know that it would be noticeable to anyone else. The strong perfume smell is the only reason I gave cleanliness four stars instead of five. The apartment itself was very clean.
Again, this is a great place to stay."
