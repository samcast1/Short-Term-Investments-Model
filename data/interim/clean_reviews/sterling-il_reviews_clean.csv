2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"The Strawberry is a beautiful, clean, and meticulous newly renovated home. The home is furnished with everything one would need for a comfortable stay from the cozy blankets and beds to fluffy towels and kitchen necessities to cook a family meal.

2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Absolutely stunning apartment! The bed was very comfortable and the ambiance was perfect. We had issues getting into the apartment as we were given the wrong code but Kelly came down and opened it up for us and gave us the new code.

2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Love staying here when visiting Clinton. It’s quiet, clean and comfortable."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Absolutely gorgeous, private, and homey. Kelly sent me a comprehensive house manual in good time before my stay including detailed instructions on getting in and expectations for check-out. Not only is the loft one of a kind, but thoughtfully decorated down to dimmable lighting throughout. I am shocked that it was so affordable; it felt like a 5-star gem tucked away in small-town Illinois. Parked right out front overnight, then moved the car to a parking lot just one street over during the day. I was left to myself during my stay, which I appreciated! Already planning to stay here again whenever trips lead me in that direction."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Worked perfectly for us.
Private, historic feel.
Great location for our needs."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We loved our stay in this historic apartment! Exactly like (if not better than) the photos, well-appointed, and incredibly comfortable. The town is quiet but it’s walkable to the grocery store and a couple restaurants/bars. We hope to visit again!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The place is beautiful and spotless. Lots of fun things to do in the area. Easy to check in, very comfortable bed, had coffee/tea available with some snacks. Thank you again for the wonderful stay."

2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great place for a peaceful weekend, close to many attractions!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I walked into Kelly’s listing and forgot I was there for work and being on call. It was a mini vacation in style. The aesthetics were pleasing to the eye, not to mention comfortable. Kelly has thought of everything her guests might need. Plenty of choices to eat a few steps from her place. The small town feel, I walked up and down the Main Street. I sat at the table by the big window, did paperwork and people watched. Before I knew it, the sun was setting. Her place made me feel a part of history. Thanks Kelly."
2023-05-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"Beautiful building, we really liked the charm of the place! Thanks for having us!"

2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We now refer to The Boyd House as our home in Morrison! It's THAT comfortable!
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This is our 4th time staying at the Boyd. Me and my partner are starting to consider it a full escape from our work stress and the hustle and bustle of Chicago. The renovated space is absolutely beautiful and it's very quaint and serene. It is our little private place of peace. Kelly is the best and deserves the stamp of *SUPER Super Host* on Air bnb if there was one. We look forward to returning throughout 2023. Strongly recommend to anyone looking for a quiet getaway in a cool town.
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"Exceptional loft, looked exactly as the picture depicted it! Our company rented this loft for a supplier visit and our guest had nothing but great things to say. Very clean, quiet, short walk to local restaurants and the store. He just really enjoyed his stay!
We have rented this loft previously for new employees relocating to Morrison and it was just as great now as it was then. We will definitely book again. Thank you Kelly!"
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Really gorgeous apartment in an historic building. Was quite glamorous to stay in. The market and restaurants are also within a 5 min walk. Very good location!
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Each time we visit ~ which is regularly ~ we notice some thoughtful improvement Kelly has made. In this trip alone, we noticed a new AC unit, dimmers on ALL the lights, a slow-close toilet seat, new & improved wi-fi service, and a couple of things that MAY have been there before, but we didn't notice ~ a really nice bath mat for the tub and handy shelves on which to put our shampoo while showring. I know, none of them in themselves is earth-shattering, but it shows me that Kelly is really mindful of the experience and LOOKS for ways to improve on an already great experience. Kelly is the poster child for hospitality and we're grateful to have such a wonderful place to call ""home"" in Morrison!"
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Really awesome spot. Very clean and conveniently located
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We had a wonderful stay here. It was clean, easy to get in to, and very comfortable. We also enjoyed the state park and it was only 25 minutes from Clinton, Iowa. We will definitely stay again if we come back to the area."
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful spot and a great fall drive up to Galena!
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This place is an absolute treasure!!! Had a wonderful stay Kelly got back to us fast when we had questions...We have no complaints We loved everything minute from start to finish...Well worth it 2 thumbs way up :)
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is a beautiful place that was lovingly restored in every detail. Everything worked perfectly many nice little touches and everything was exactly as they said it would be . This is a very enjoyable place to stay, you won't want to leave the room."
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Loved this apartment! Very clean and nice. Love all the space and and setup. Love the modern, vintage feel.
The area is okay. We went during paint the town event and could not park out front. Had to park in back and walk all the way around. One day all the parking out back was all taken and so we had to park over a block away with two babies to carry all the way there and back. Also, they had a live band going past 11pm one night and they were also shooting off fireworks. Luckily my two lil ones slept through it.
Other than the paint the town event it was a very good stay."
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Loved this great little place! So close to so many amazing state parks! Thank you, Kelly!"
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We loved the apartment! My two kids (4 & 7) and I stayed wed-sun and it was the perfect location for us- close to restaurants, and the WiFi allowed me to work while in town. We look forward to visiting again!!"
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great stay as always! I always pick Kelly’s place when I’m traveling if it’s available.
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Firat time staying in an airbnb and we couldn't be happier. Kelly wasy to reach. The pictures did not do this place justice!!
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Loved this place. Lots of character. We had an issue with the refrigerator, and Kelly was on it immediately."
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This place was a great stay! Kelly had everything I needed and more. Will definitely be using again when I’m in the area.
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was one of our best AirBnB stays EVER! We appreciated the style and value, along with the location. We were here on business but spent our free time meandering up and down the Mississippi among the towns on both sides of the river. Kelly's restaurant and coffee recommendations were excellent. Great place to unplug and unwind for a few days. Also, the art gallery owner below the loft is a gem!"
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was my second stay and it was as great as the first visit. Very comfortable bed, quiet space. Nice oasis on my work trip."
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Where do I start? Everything about this place is amazing! Soaking in the large tub, sitting at the table in front of the large picture window while drinking coffee, preparing food in the large spacious kitchen, proximity to great Mexican food, reasonable driving distance to Chicago, are just a few perks this place has to offer.
I highly recommend staying at this Airbnb!"
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is the second time staying at Kelley's. This is one the best properties I've stayed at. it hits all the notes: Design, comfort, amenities, historical and value. I got a chance this visit to explore nearby Morrison State Park. Gorgeous!"
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Kelly’s place is a historic gem! The woodwork is beautiful and the apartment has everything you’ll need. It’s conveniently located near a grocery store and nice restaurants are within walking distance. We had a comfortable and enjoyable stay!
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is second time we're stayed here. It's a great apartment with amenities you would need. It's clean, comfortable and for us a great location."
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is where you want to stay. Location, amazing. My mom and I were here for a wedding and this place had so much room for the both of us. The pull-out couch was a great addition to this studio style Airbnb. We also appreciated all of the local restaurants and dessert places."
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Bigger than the pictures even show, this loft was perfect for our needs. We even brought our infant along and she accommodated us well. It’s a good open space even for kids, and even though it’s big, you still get complete darkness when sleeping thanks to the blackout curtains and French doors. Loved everything and highly recommend."
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Thoroughly enjoyed our stay! Highly recommend!
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful room with ceilings so tall it felt like a luxury getaway for us. So tastefully done and the little details and amenities were icing on the cake. Excellent communication from Kelly and lots of instructions so we knew how everything worked. I would 100% recommend this Airbnb to anyone looking for a stay in Morrison.
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,A beautiful clean airy space. The furnishings were immaculate and very comfortable and Kelly was prompt and helpful in responding to all questions. The stairway leading to the room is a little challenging but as long as you are expecting it everything else was perfect.
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Cute, extremely clean, great location and perfect for a quiet getaway. Can’t wait for our next visit."
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is the sweetest airbnb for the area. It's a great location if you want a scenic ride to Galena or just a place to enjoy the country. The apartment is way bigger than it looks so you could comfortably fit more than 2 people if need be. This is a great price and well worth a trip, my boyfriend and I have already been a few times."
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We were able to enjoy an extended stay at Kelly's lovely loft and everything was ~ as usual! ~ top notch in accommodating our needs....even when the internet, which was clearly beyond her control, continued to drop out. Kelly shared they will be switching to fiberoptic service as soon as it's available, and she graciously offered an adjustment to our bill for the inconvenience. I highly recommend making this your home-away-from-home as we do ~ but kind of hope you don't take me up on the suggestion as I may be shooting myself in the foot! ;)"
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Absolutely awesome place to stay! Loved the vibe. Highly recommend!
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Elegant, bright and beautiful. I really appreciate restoration and this apartment was so aesthetically pleasing for me. Highly recommended."

2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Such an adorable hidden gem! The space is immaculate and so clean!
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Kellie‘s place was amazing and absolutely beautiful. It was impeccably clean and well-kept. The bathroom was my favorite part from the extreme cleanliness, to the amenities, to the plush towels. I would recommend this day to anyone even if you are from the area. It was so quaint and peaceful a great place to reset."
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Our second time here. It truly is exceptional. A beautiful little modern nook, cozy and tranquil. We will be back for many more trips!"

2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Amazingly well kept historic loft in a nice little town in Northwest IL. Appreciated the quiet surroundings. Kelly was a fantastic host.
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Perfect spot in a perfect little downtown!!
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great place.
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,A beautiful loft. Comfortable bed. We were on a business trip and wanted a nice place to stay for a night. This was perfect. I wish the art gallery was open when we were there. I only got to peek through the front window. I guess I have to come back. :-)
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The H.A. Boyd Guest House is definitely the place to stay if you're headed to Western Illinois. Absolutely beautifully restored. Very clean, well appointed and comfortable. Everything I could have wanted was there. The host, Kelly, was most helpful, always responding immediately if I had a question. Since this was my first ""AirB&B"" the bar has been set pretty high!"
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This space was much larger than expected and extremely cozy. It was beautifully decorated and very cozy. I wish I had more control over the thermostat (presets were difficult to adjust), but Kelly was responsive and helpful when I reached out to her."
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Our stay was awesome. The space was beautiful and cute. I love that the owners preserved the wood floors and original architecture.
For space, it was very clean and easy to access. We stayed with our two kids, ages 1 and 3. There was plenty of room for both their travel beds in the same room as our bed and everyone got great sleep.
We will definitely be booking again for our future travels visiting family and friends in this part of the state."
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This Airbnb is incredible and a real gift for this small community! We hosted my out of town family for Thanksgiving and didn’t have enough sleeping space, but Kelly and Josh’s Airbnb came to the rescue! The pictures are spot on, but it’s even better in person! The amenities are thoughtful, accommodations are cozy and comfortable, and the location is convenient to great places to eat! My family from the big cities were blown away by this gem!"
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful apartment. Much larger than pictures depict, which was a pleasant surprise. As this is only a rental, as opposed to family vacation residence, you won’t find any spices, creamer, or other conveniences. There was coffee, tea, sugar and water supplied by the host. Was very warm inside the unit due to unseasonably warm weather, amazingly the windows opened easily to allow in a cool breeze. Overall pleased with our experience and would stay again, if just for the convenience of location for visiting family in this rural area."
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,Great place
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,the place was so beautiful and it's bigger than we thought. we fell in love with the interior design. the coziness of the space was lovely.
2021-10-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful place! Very spacious, clean and a cool mix of modern and original features. Would definitely stay again."
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We spent two nights at Kelly’s place and loved it! It was spacious, clean, and so cutely decorated. What a charming place to stay! We would definitely stay here again!"
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Beautiful space, well maintained and clean, very accommodating host. Thank you!"
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Wonderful hosts, beautiful space, and great communication throughout the whole process. It is right in the middle of downtown Morrison and is within walking distance of shops, food, and nightlife. The loft itself is in a beautifully restored building with spacious rooms and comfortable seating and sleeping areas as well as a well equipped kitchen and bath. All in all, this has been one of my favorite spaces and I truly enjoyed my stay."
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Wonderful space. Great change of pace from my usual stay in a hotel room when I’m traveling for work in the area. One of the best nights sleep I’ve had in a while.
Downtown food options are plentiful. Can’t go wrong staying here."
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful loft with GREAT attention to detail! Very easy to work with! We enjoyed having an amazing place to stay as we were in the town I grew up in 40 years ago! A definite asset to Morrison!!! Looking forward to another stay in the future!!
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We loved our stay here! The perfect getaway. Though there weren’t a ton of eatery options in town, we were able to head a couple town over for more options. The place itself was beautiful and exactly what we were looking for."
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Met our needs and is one of the few AirBnBs in the area. Wonderful hosts and great location for the Main Street fun spots in Morrison. Highly recommend.
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Awesome place to stay. Very clean and stylish decor
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Stayed for an overnight en route back home from Chicago and absolutely loved it! The space is beautiful and well cared for. There were restaurants within walking distance and (because of the construction?) the area was VERY quiet over labor day. The check in process was easy and comfortable. I wouldn't stay in a place like this with children but for a girls getaway or couples weekend its perfect. Also a photographers dream with the beautiful big windows!! Definitely would stay again!!
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This spot is exactly as pictured. Kelly’s set up is so nice, would definitely recommend!"
2021-08-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place is roomy, very clean and comfortable. We enjoyed our stay and will even more when the road project is s complete."
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Better than advertised! Incredible last minute host communication! One of my favorite small town airbnbs, ever."
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This was perfectly what I needed after a long day photographing a wedding. The check in process was explained to the early and amenities were great.
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This was a beautiful place to stay! Will return!
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Thank you for a wonderful stay!
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Very clean, HUGE, beautiful rooms. Adequately stocked, many extras. Had some difficulty with the locks but that’s probably user error. Parking not ideal due to construction but that’s not her fault. Other than that we have no complaints and would definitely consider staying here again."
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Kelly's space was a delight! Everything was thought out to absolute perfection from the bed linens and towels to the kitchen and bath details. It was such a beautiful space and you can tell that they really care about it. We had a lovely stay!
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Comfortable, convenient and surprisingly quiet spot right in the heart of town. I would definitely stay there again if ever visiting in the area."
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,The place was clean and Kelly responded promptly with any minor issues we needed help with.
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Excellent communication by this host and property is super charming!
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"As always, every consideration was given to our comfort and convenience.
Despite street construction, our rooms were comfortably quiet, and Kelly's input regarding alternate parking options was really helpful. Even the local police were friendly and accommodating, allowing us to park in front of the building overnight and assuring us they'd keep an eye on our car.
As happens every single time, we hated to leave our little sanctuary in Morrison!"
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was my first time staying at an AirBNB and Kelly couldn’t have been more accommodating. Everything was so perfect. The place is so cozy and felt just like a home! Thank you, Kelly!!"
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This apartment is amazing! I love to see downtown areas of small towns. I especially like to see those buildings still being used today. I have always wanted to stay in a old shop keeps apartment above the storefront, it really takes you back. Kelly has done a tremendous job of combining the old with the new.
If you love the architecture of the past and enjoy staying in historical places, then definitely put this one in your list. Kelly did a great job of guiding us through the checkin. The Cliff bars were a wonderful surprise and a great morning breakfast to go."
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This apartment it is warm and historic beautifully decorated and full of wonderful amenities we especially loved soaking in the clawfoot tub
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This place was incredible! The rooms are enormous and lavish, with stunning wood working. Having a meal at the table in the bay window was transportive. Can't wait to come back."
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,Adorable place! Very spacious and had everything you could need! Kelly responded very promptly if there were any questions and check in and out was so easy. 10/10
2021-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"A hidden gem, hands down! You will not find a better stay in the area! I lived in the Sauk Valley area for 4 years as a Military Recruiter so I've traveled to and through all towns within the area. One of my biggest gripes with the area was lack of decent lodging. Fast forward 2 years and with this surprise visit my wife and I were floored with our stay. In all of the Airbnb's we've stayed in, this one is the best HANDS DOWN! One could argue an over abundance of space, fantastic view from above to sip coffee or do work, absolutely loved the small but significant touch of flowers thought out the dining room area, a great assortment of cooking utensils and dining ware, big, cozy bed with plenty of pillows, and I really could go on and on. Simply put, save yourself from the small yet over priced rooms in the area and lock in this diamond in the rough if you can, you won't regret it!"
2021-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Kelly was very accommodating! The stay was short but sweet. I recommend to anyone who would like a small town getaway.
2021-04-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,Amazing space!! Very nostalgic and comfortable. Kelly was an awesome host! Would definitely look her place up again should I ever pass through again.
2020-12-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Great place. Highly recommend for anyone looking.
2020-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Beautiful, clean space right on Main Street. Thoughtful touches and quick responses from Kelly. Simply amazing!"

2020-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"What a delightful weekend retreat! The apartment had charming historic details and was super clean. The little table in the bay window was the perfect spot to get some work done. I was a little nervous that there wasn't a full oven, but we still made great meals just fine. Main Street is so cute although there aren't many shops, and during the holidays there is Christmas music playing outside! Parking right outside was no problem."
2020-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Another great stay!
2020-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Very nice and spacious space. Very clean, which is my number one requirement. Comfortable and safe is a close second. Kelly was a great host, but to be honest, she has everything so organized and done up right that I didn't need to communicate with her.
If you don't believe me, just look at her review rating...'nuff said!"
2020-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"What a beautiful place to stay! I was looking for somewhere close by to do a personal retreat. The attention to detail and the amenities made it easy to feel at home. I left feeling refreshed. Thank you, Josh and Kelly, for making this available."

2020-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,My husband calls this his home away from home!
2020-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The guest house was wonderful for two nights. The self-check-in and check-out process was simple and easy, definitely the best I’ve had on the app so far. First impressions of the space were absolutely amazing! Great tall ceilings with crisp cherry wood floors, and a beautiful window view of main street. The wall art and lights were the perfect combination that fit the theme of the place exactly. The kitchen area was well stocked and had everything you could need to fix something up quick. I asked Kelly if she could hang up some Halloween decorations and she delivered to exceed expectations!
Overall, the guest house was a fully positive experience and I cannot think up of any reason not to recommend this place!"
2020-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The two of us had such a relaxing, fun weekend getaway at the Loft! Lovely stylish well-designed open space, spotlessly clean modern amenities in a historic building. Host gave clear instructions for no-contact check-in & only warning is flight of steps into unit & clawfoot tub, as clearly disclosed in listing. Open 2 rooms +bath/laundry & nice little touches made it a great launching point to explore Mississippi Palisades S. P. & discover the small towns along the Great River Road. We mostly cooked our own, but recommend Steam Anchor Coffee Shop in Fulton for coffee, pastries, & awesome sandwiches if you want a picnic for the park."
2020-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"If you're looking for a small town getaway, then look no further! Kelly's place has the perfect mix of vintage and modern touches all throughout the apartment. I was super impressed with just how clean and cozy the whole space was. We really loved the well-stocked kitchen, which made it easy to have a cup of coffee or tea. All in all, I would definitely recommend Kelly's place to anyone!"

2020-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great space for a weekend getaway from Chicago! Perfect spot to stop for a couple nights during our drive on the great river road.

Thank you Kelly and Josh!"
2020-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We enjoyed a lovely start to our anniversary weekend. Kelly was very prompt with responses and well prepared us with accessing the apartment and sharing all the things we needed to know.
2020-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Not only was this place clean, it felt so FANCY! I felt like I was on the set of a home decor magazine or something. I kept thinking that it seemed like the spot newlyweds would stay if they got married nearby. Beautifully maintained, full kitchen, just lovely."

2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is a beautiful and spacious loft with all the right touches to make you feel at home. The design is thoughtful and everything is comfortable. It felt like staying in a place you wish you lived, especially the level of cleanliness (much better than my own place). Although there isn't too much to see/do in Morrison itself, the loft is located about a 10-15 minute drive from a nice state park and about a 15-20 minute drive from where you can access the Great River Trail, if you've got a bike and want to do some biking along/near the Mississippi River. Over all, I loved this stay and hope to come back to enjoy the space again. Thanks for sharing your wonderful place, Kelly."
2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This is a great space and the quality of the restoration and modern toches in the loft is rare. Everything was very clean and comfortable. Morrison is small, but main street is a nicely maintained historic strip. Great value and a wonderful space."
2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This place is phenomenal! We pulled in after a massive storm that took out power across three states. The place was even great without power! Clean, uncluttered, huge bay windows, excellent amenities. Host even dropped off a lighter so we could cook dinner on the gas stove :)"

2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is a gem! Wonderful place to ride out Covid with a different view and new takeout to try. We walked almost every street in town and hiked in the nearby state park. The front window is a great place to play cards and people watch, and the whole space has a charming, updated antique vibe. Possibly the most unique AirBNB we’ve stayed in!"
2020-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Kelly's place was just what we needed for a one night stop on a cross country road trip. The place was clean and homey. She was quick to respond to our reservation request, which was made day of!"

Kelly is an amazing host!
Highly recommended!!"
2020-04-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"The studio is one of the best long stays I have stayed in. It’s small and BIG at the same time. Huge ceilings , super cool kitchen with the bathroom.. it is perfect. Kelly , the host of the place was kind and super friendly, I had packages delivered while I stayed and I didn’t want the UPS to leave it out by the door so I informed her and she helped me out by putting them by my door.
The studio is a perfect place if you want to work from home or just be lazy and do nothing. Kitchen was super clean and everything was easy to find.
The host took extra time to disinfect the place for me before I moved in and the place smelled great and welcoming.
If I ever find myself in Morrison, IL or near Morrison I’m going to book this place.
It was home far away from home!"

2020-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Located only a few feet away from a chic place called ""Da Bar"" and two attorney's offices one can create and have solved many of life's problems of an evening. Other fine points of this flat include stylish and attractive furnishings, a great location, an extremely inviting decor and an instantly home-like feeling.

2020-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Because I was not able to make the trip my husband was able to experience this adorable and convenient Airbnb. Communication with the super health was spot on along with all instructions and directions. The convenience and location of the Airbnb made it so that my husband could spend time with family and not have to worry about traveling. I would highly recommend this for anyone that needs to spend time in the area. He reported that it was very clean and Comfortable. Do you know men..... I couldn’t get a lot out of him. LOL! We will definitely be taking advantage of this Airbnb in the near future. Highly recommended!
2020-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"When we saw this listing, even though it was a bit out of the way of where we were headed, we decided to book it anyway and we are SO GLAD we did! This is one of the nicest AirBnB's I have ever experienced - Kelly's place is absolutely GORGEOUS! I loved every single detail; she obviously took great care in designing the space, and takes great pride in maintaining it. The towels are soft and luxurious, and the bed is incredibly comfortable. Extra-special little touches were everywhere, from bottled water to makeup wipes. This was an absolutely perfect stay in a charming location, and I look forward to having a reason to go back there again, someday. Thank you, Kelly!"
2020-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This place and its host did not disappoint. The space was clean and tastefully decorated.
2020-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Kelly went above and beyond! I drove in a blizzard to get to the AirBnB and Kelly checked on me to make sure I got in okay.
Then I had a snafu in the apartment and she was more than kind and accommodating about it.
Also, it’s just a gorgeous, chic space. Great, thoughtful amenities, charming view, and a super comfortable bed.
My only special recommendation is to bring earplugs. Sometimes the pipes in this beautiful old building make a little noise if you’re a light sleeper. Overall, amazing experience."
2020-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Such a pleasure, we really hated to leave!
Kelly obviously put a lot of thought into making our stay as easy, pleasant and comfortable as possible. The attention to detail and her quick and clear communications made us feel well taken care of before and during our stay.
Everything promised was delivered ~ and then some! We plan to become “regulars”."
2020-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Beautiful loft on a cute street downtown. Had a wonderful New Year’s Eve here and would definitely stay again! Loft was much roomier than expected and so charming. Very quiet inside but only a 1 minute walk to a few local bars and restaurants.

2019-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Loved staying in this whimsical space. Not super quiet due to creaky floors and what seemed like old rattling pipes that occasionally sounded like wind-chimes. But what it lacked in silence it more than made up for in comfort and character. The added touches of interesting books, maps, and other decor really struck a note with us. The wanderlust vibe was perfect."

When I come back to Rock Falls next year I will book well in advance. It was freezing cold outside, with snow on one day. And the heating unit worked great. I was toasty in no time. I accidentally locked myself out, by mishandling the door's key pad. I called Keith. He answered immediately--and remotely reset the lock. I got inside in no time. I was very impressed."

Keith AirBNB was 4-5 away from the venue and a lot cheaper than the hotel that was just 1 to 2 streets over and was able to feel like home there.

2024-06-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"We come to town annually to visit family and the hotel options have never been our favorite, so Brian’s place was a pleasant surprise to find in the area!
Place was easy to find and conveniently located. We were able to walk to a local cafe for breakfast and a coffee shop another day.
It was a little loud at night, but that was to be expected with it being a weekend and located downtown amongst the local businesses.
We couldn’t get the WiFi to work - so we were unable to utilize the TVs. We ended up using the hotspot via our cellphones to watch a movie one of the nights.. but we beyond that we were hardly around to have a need for it.
Overall we had all of the amenities we could have needed for a weekend stay and were MUCH more comfortable than we would have been in any hotel."

2023-08-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,"The unit was attractive and quiet. Also the surroundings were pastoral the landscape well cared for.
There were a number of maintenance issues, including no stopper in the bathroom sink, ground fault outlets that would spontaneously trip without warning, and a ceiling light that did not illuminate.

2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Amy’s duplex unit was perfect for my midway stay -over between my current residence and childhood home. Very clean , spacious , comfortable and the attached 1 car garage , was especially appreciated because it allowed me to move my suitcases and cooler in and out of car without getting out in the cold weather !! Having had recent ankle injury i also found it so helpful to have all the rooms on one level, and a vanity with bench in the spacious bathroom . Enjoyed watching wildlife and occasional grain semi trucks transit the dirt road behind the duplex . Kitchen was well stocked with cooking and baking dishes / utensils. I’m looking forward to coming back soon!! 😊"
2022-11-01,4.0,Stayed one night,This is a pretty good listing! Fairly bare bones but very cute. There’s a binder with more rules and check in/check out isn’t the most flexible. But there is so much space! Having the garage was awesome.
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Excellent place to stay. Very clean and easily accessible. Amy checked in after I checked in to make sure I had everything I needed. Quiet neighborhood and still close enough to drive anywhere in Dixon. Definitely will use this again!

2024-04-01,5.0,Group trip,"This place was awesome!! We have a very big family and for the first time ever we all got to sit together for dinner. You don’t find a space that can accommodate 25 people all too often. Jose was really easy to book with! Super nice guy!

2024-04-01,5.0,Group trip,"We were in town for our parents memorial. They both passed away just a month earlier. We were really happy we could all be together in one place. It was big enough to visit with everyone and felt cozy at the same time. We really appreciated the well equipped kitchen and spacious area.
There was plenty to do with outgoing portable and games . The weather wasn’t good enough to enjoy the outdoors very much but would have been a lot of fun. Especially the large walk around deck, fire pit , and kids toys. A few things need to be picked up outside butmitmwas early in the season so I’m guessing that will get done. Appreciated the extra time for check out so we could enjoy a little more time together before ever headed to the airport. Thank you Jose for the hospitality and wonderful accommodations. We left some puzzles for future guests. They were my moms and we know she would like to have them used there."

2023-08-01,5.0,Group trip,"We booked this cabin for close family gathering, for my son's wedding dinner. Upon arrival we were surprisingly pleased that the cabin and surrounding area was even more beautiful than online pictures. The whole house was immaculate, kitchen big and contained everything we needed. We had food catering and with the commercial stove and oven we were able to heat food. The long wooden table with 26 chairs was perfect for our gathering. Children also had a good time playing outside, on the jumping trampoline and by the fire pit. The beds were comfortable. Jose was a great host always texting and ready to help. He was responsive to all my questions. We all had a wonderful experience and I would highly recommend this cabin to others."

2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We loved staying here! Our family of 14 came out to celebrate my Dad’s 80th birthday. Jose even helped us with early checkin to set up for the birthday. Inside was very clean and spacious. Even though it was beautiful weather, our family kept lingering inside because there was so much to do. The pool table, ping pong, and air hockey were big hits. The amazing table had room for working a puzzle on one end, games in the middle, and still room for all of us to sit and eat. I was afraid with all those activities in one room the sound would be loud but we had no issues. Bedrooms were quiet as well. We also enjoyed the canoes, volleyball and fire pit outside. Very quiet and peaceful! Blessing to have family all together!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This place was wonderful and perfect for a few families to meet up together and spend some quality time all in the same place while still having privacy. Jose was a wonderful host and very helpful and responsive. We had a situation that required some extra attention and Jose was very understanding.
While some reviewers said they wouldn't swim in the river, we canoed/kayaked across the river (very close by) to a more sandy area and the kids had a blast swimming.
Would definitely come here again!"

2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This was a great place for a larger group of people to be together but not be completely on top of each other.
We came for a long weekend with my family (15 total ppl) and were very impressed with the size of the property. If you like to get your steps great for that, there are grass paths that go back throughout the woods that the kids liked to explore on. The boat landing is~3-5 minute walk and the current wasn't difficult to paddle against. We were prepared for a lot of bugs and to be honest mosquitoes weren't an issue when we went, gnats were more noticeable. There is a lot of kindling for fires and the fire pit is nice right on the water, need your own wood.
Each family had their own bedroom and though the main room is right off of all the BRs, the sound was not an issue as I thought it might.
I 100% plan to come back.
Things I wish I'd known: No TV main room (each BR has one); there are pilot flames that constantly run on the range (dont set anything on), BYO TP/paper towel"
2023-06-01,5.0,Group trip,All of us had so much fun we had the best time we played lots of volleyball! We went for a walk when the sun was setting! It was so peaceful we all loved it so much it was 100% worth it! There were enough room for everyone to sleep and be comfortable!!

2023-05-01,5.0,Group trip,"This cabin is amazing. It’s located in a beautiful, private woodsy area at the end of a long drive on the river. There are beautiful views from all sides of the house. Best of all, the enormous common area has a comfy sitting area, huge family dining table, big kitchen, pool table, ping pong table, air hockey, foosball and pac man all in the same space so that the guests naturally gravitate to the same area which is really fun. There is plenty to do outside too - volley ball, a fire pit, a grill, wrap around deck and kayaks. Also, while secluded, the property is located close to downtown Dixon and convenience stores and pharmacies. The owner, Jose, is easy to contact and responsive. The check in process is super easy.

You literally have all you need - bedrooms/bathrooms are comfortable, massive space inside if weather wouldn’t be great, plenty of indoor and outdoor games/activities you can just use, ready to go grill; fireplaces, kayaks, etc. We went as fall is getting started and the outdoor space is so beautiful and relaxing. You are on a 10 min drive from supermarket but once on the property, feel like you are in the middle of nowhere - it’s great! (And if we would already know next years school schedule, would book immediately again)"

2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Five star for everything
It was great ,my family and friends everyone enjoyed the stay and I received so many compliments for finding this property ,it was just perfect and beautiful,nature around,House was clean and well organized,everything worked.Joe was very helpful and communication with him was perfect,definitely planning to come again!! * * * * *"
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Upon arrival we were even more surprised, the pictures are beautiful but in person WOW ! Warm, cozy, inviting with a rustic charm and all the amenities you could ask for, lots of space and comfort for all 16 of 3 generations. Our first airbnb experience and not our last, Jose was always available and checked on us daily. We are definitely putting this on a annual gathering. The location was perfect 1 1/2 hour away for all . We were on our own island and secluded with a beautiful view of the river yet anything we needed was 10 minutes or less away . We made lifetime memories. It was refreshing to have 4 teenagers without a phone in their hands and playing pool, ping pong, foosbal and the games provided, with their grandparents, aunts and uncles especially cherades., priceless . Thank you Jose there is not one thing that would require improvements, our compliments on the little touches. Thank you !!!!!"

2022-01-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,Great place for a family weekend!
2022-01-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,Worked out wonderfully for our family. Host was very responsive as needed. All the games and outside activities kept our family busy even though it was winter. Very well kept and clean. Loved the big porch and xlarge family table.
2022-01-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,The place was great and spacious. Our family had lots of fun. If you plan to travel with children be aware that there are steep stairs and no gate for the children. Also if you travel here in the winter be prepared to spend several hundreds of dollars in firewood. We kept the fire running nonstop during the day to get it up to about 72. The heating system cannot keep up with the cold Chicago nights. There is no heating upstairs so you have to keep the doors open for the heat to travel and even doing that it was pretty cold upstairs. Other than that the place was great and we had a great time.

We were visiting Dixon for a funeral, and even though it was a very sad time for our family, this place offered so much entertainment that we forgot we were even sad.

The property was absolutely perfect for what I needed.
I know that if I ever make it back in the area that’s where I will be staying!"

I must say, if you have the choice between the units, C would be my choice. I love the nautical theme for the decor, the unit seems larger, and the layout is fun and unique. Kerina was amazing, as always. Welcoming, easy to communicate with, and willing to go the extra mile to make my stay enjoyable. Don't pass on the chance to be one of her guests!"

2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My family and I really enjoyed our stay. I booked condos A & C and they were perfect for our needs. We were in town to spend time with family so we didn’t really use the kitchen, but it was so great to have the space and it looked fully equipped. Check in was seamless which was perfect after our long drive. So many nice touches throughout with beautiful woodwork and I really loved all the various art pieces on the walls. I forgot my water flask and it was so easy to work out shipping it back to me, so extra thanks for that Kerina!
I would definitely stay here again!"

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Mary was very easy to work with and was very generous to allow an early check-in when our plans changed and were arriving in town earlier then expected. The home is in a very nice area of town with a beautiful view of Rock River and right next door to the state recreation area to enjoy. The home is cozy and very inviting.

2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This rental is well maintained and a pleasant place to stay. The view of the river from the deck was very enjoyable.
Would stay here again."
2023-05-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,"The best things about this place are the location and the price. If you want a beautiful river view with lots of shade trees, a nice deck, and easy access to the water, then this is the place for you! The cottage is clean and decently maintained but did have a couple of things you may want to consider. The beds, the recliner, the bathroom, the upstairs closet, and the kitchen are fairly small, so if you are a tall person like me (6'5""), you may find it awkward to get comfortable at times. The linens and pillows were clean, but the bath towels were fairly old. They were rough and there was not much nap left on them, so you may want to bring some fluffier towels if that's something of concern for you. The ceiling fan in the kitchen was noisy, so you probably will not want to use it, but the A/C was nice and cool. The shower looked new and clean, and the other fixtures throughout the house worked well, including the washer and dryer. Overall, my wife and I were pleased with our stay."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Mary’s place is where it’s at. It’s perfect for a couple people. A nice quiet get away by the river. Mary is responsive and helpful. Great stay :)

2019-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This is a super simple great place to stay. Very clean & would accommodate a single person or family well.
2019-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Peaceful spot on the Rock River, with a view up and down the river by virtue of being on a bend. Birds singing and hardly any other sounds made this a very restful spot. Well appointed space with a bed upstairs and one down and kitchen that would work well for a short or a longer stay. Play park for kids a 2 minute walk away and a launch spot for anyone with a boat. Good value spot."
2019-06-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"This cozy cottage is right on the Rock River nestled among old growth shade trees and green lawns. The views from the living room are breath taking. The beds and furniture are very comfortable, and the whole place is sparkling clean. The cottage has a homey atmosphere, a great shower, and nice laundry room. The heart of quaint downtown Prophetstown is only a short walk from the cottage. The town has some nice restaurants, a hometown grocery store, a gas station/mini mart, and a couple of beautiful parks. There is also a Dollar General nearby for anything you might have forgotten to bring. The cottage is at the entrance to Prophetstown State Park where hiking trails await you or just sit on the marvelous new deck and watch the river flow by."

It was an absolute pleasure to stay there and enjoy the park right next door, which is gorgeous. We would certainly return if we found ourselves in the area. Mary was also very understanding and also gave helpful suggestions about where to get food locally. We are so grateful to have had this experience :)"

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Classy, warm, inviting. This 1892 Airbnb is truly home, an oasis, respite from life’s big and little stressors.
Book it for a home away from home, or a home across the country. Enjoy the tranquility, history, character & comfort this space provides. Curl up with a good book & hold your loved ones close. Centrally located to anything you need in Morrison.
Cannot recommend booking through Mike & Colleen enough!"

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was a beautiful downtown loft! Seriously it was one of the BEST we've stayed at; definitely on our Top 10 list. So much character and functionality. From the kitchen and living room, to the comfy adjustable bed and walk-in shower. It was an absolute pleasure to stay here. NO complaints! (check out Isle of Rhodes for pizza... a block away, Original Taco... 50ft. away, and Forest Inn... 7 min. away if your hungry) 👍"

Thank you again Mike and Colleen - I will likely be back very soon!"

2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I chose this place because the location is close to my older brother and sister who live in Morrison. I would have been happy with a small room with a corner kitchenette, about what I would expect in most places for the price.
Instead I found myself in a beautiful full loft home. It was open, light, and welcoming. I used the full sized oven to prepare my part of Thanksgiving dinner. The kitchen was well equipped, the living room comfortable and spacious, and the bedroom quiet. I will stay there again and again."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Fantastic stay! Beautiful and comfortable place. Impressive, responsive and friendly hosts."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I stumbled upon this listing when the Airbnb I typically book was reserved, and I am glad I did - I can not say enough great things about Mike's place! I think it will be my go-to from here on out. They have really taken the time to think of every single detail - the comfort, design, and all amenities that someone could ever need. The photos do not really do it justice just how cool the layout of this space is. It is exceptionally clean and organized and feels very private despite being centrally located. I have already recommended it to others and will definitely be back. Thanks again for a great experience!"
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This space is amazing and suited our needs quite well. Mike was very responsive and answered questions very quickly. Will stay again!
,,,"“Clifford the Big Red House” is a beautiful home that is well furnished, clean, and inviting! Rocky knew that we were bringing a Toddler, so he set up a high chair, baby gate, and even bought a toddler bed/cot for our little one! We have family in the area, and we would love to return this summer for another stay! Our family had a wonderful time and highly recommend this home for a family getaway!"
