2024-04-01,5.0,Group trip,"Jerod‚Äôs little cabin was just what we needed for our weekend. Luckily I was with my two teenage boys, so they had no problem climbing up to the lofts! The whole place is clean and newly remodeled; ever felt fresh and new. Kitchen and bathroom had what we needed and beds were comfy with cool, smooth linens. The cabin is right off the highway (20 paces!), but traffic wasn‚Äôt too bad and only occasionally did we hear a loud vehicle drive by. Front porch was nice to sit on in the sunshine, but the view is an empty field - I though we‚Äôd be closer to the lake. My bad for not studying the map better. Overall we were comfy and enjoyed our stay! Lake Meredith is beautiful - a hidden gem!!"

The parking was a little muddy, not an issue, just something to keep in mind if it‚Äôs raining. They had a mop and broom next to the fridge to help keep things clean though. Hot water didn‚Äôt last too long, but held just long enough for 3 guys to shower back to back.
Close to Fritch and Borger, also a 5-10 minute drive to the boat ramps. Definitely a worthy place to get out of the cold and rain after being out on the water all day."

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I was fortunate to stay here for the 4th of July weekend with a three other friends of mine. We found finding the home very easy and Jerod had great recommendations for the local area. He was very quick to respond to any questions we had and super friendly. The home itself is wonderful. If you have a small group, this is easily the place to be. You could definitely do a larger group as well. The place was spotless and the AC cranked for those hot Texas summers. We found the furnishings comfortable and it was a great spot for us to relax and unwind at the end of the day. We interacted with both groups of neighbors while there and had a fantastic time. If you want to visit Amarillo, hike in Palo Duro, or enjoy a lake day; this is the place to be. Get out of the city and check this home out, you won't regret it. The only question you'll be asking after your stay is how much would it cost to build this place yourself."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Jerod was very quick in replying to me. His cabin was very clean, very nice, and looked just like the pictures. He provided towels, shampoo & conditioner, a bbq pit & chairs, etc. Highly recommend this cabin!"

2020-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Good place to stay, worth it"
2019-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We stayed here on a quick overnight while traveling elsewhere. It was easy to find but parking is a bit tricky (we ended up parking in alley next to it.) The space was open and clean. Clean linens and towels were provided. The mattress is very firm which my boyfriend loved, me not so much. Definitely a good value for the night, or longer if you need. As it is handicap accessible there is only a shower, but the water is very hot and had good pressure."
