2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"What are you waiting for? This was, by far, one of the BEST stays I've had in an AirBNB. The space was welcoming, warm, homey and clean! There are tons of little touches and extras to help you feel right at home. We had no issues and I am already planning a return trip to enjoy the area and this same space again. Everything is labeled, clean, spotless - we easily felt right at home and enjoyed the extra treat of a pizza in the freezer. It was so nice to meet the family, too! They are super kind and sweet spirited and friendly. Do pay attention to those directions! We accidentally came up the gravel road side - but it was a lovely drive and the road is well maintained but Andrews directions are the best way to go. I can't recommend a better place to stay!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Loved the personalized welcome mantelpiece. Cozy and incredibly well-designed home. Everything promised on the listing and pre-arrival messages was available and easy to use.
The creek sounds + stargazing at night is a huge win on this property.
100% recommend."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"I’ve stayed in a lot of Airbnb’s and this place is WONDERFUL. The best place I’ve stayed in with my family, by far. I travel with my two boys, and it was the perfect place to break up our drive. The area is gorgeous- the views and the sound of the creek are just what you need after a long drive. It’s perfect for families, as they had games & outdoor items to get some energy out (frisbees & soccer balls, etc). The accommodations are pristine; they are newly renovated and meticulously cleaned. Andrew & his sweet family go above and beyond to take care of their guests - all the extras and the added touches made me a return guest on my way back. If it’s available, we hope to stay here on our annual trips! LOVED THIS PLACE!!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful stay! Super clean and rarely heard the family staying above (and if we did it was so minimal.) Creek noise was lovely and everything was super thoughtful.
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"This property and hospitality stand out! We had more cooking supplies than we ever could have imagined. There was even a list of where you could find all the supplies. This host was very friendly, and responsive, and took the time to leave some of our favorite drinks in the fridge. We will definitely be booking again in the future!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This space is a beautiful oasis for weary souls. Andrew’s attention to detail is unmatched. He has truly thought of and proactively met any need you may have during your stay. The cleanliness is impeccable. Great water pressure. Very comfortable accommodations, especially the king size bed with memory foam. The environment is truly memorable with the sound of the adjacent creek, stargazing and firefly sightings at night by the fireside. Such generous hospitality and so much value for the price. Wish we could keep this gem for ourselves but everyone should get to experience this level of rest and care. So grateful we found this place and hope to return."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Me and my friends stayed here and we had so much fun. The carpets are soft enough to sleep on, the couches and beds feel like home, and the hardwood was easy to keep clean.
The kitchen was stocked with everything we needed (including spices). Each guest is given a little basket of stuff to use in case they forgot anything, and it came in handy. The wash room was very nice, with a basin next to the washing machine.
On our second day there, we went and explored the woods and creek on the property. there were benches following the creek, and bridges to get across. We had so much fun exploring the woods and spent over an hour just walking around.
On the night of the second day, we accidentally locked our keys in the car, so we texted the host. He was super helpful with providing a locksmith company and even trying himself to get the door open. We left a little after the check-out time and he was super understanding about it.
We loved the house, and we'll definitely book here again!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"This place surpassed our expectations. Andrew was an excellent host. He’s very responsive and always keen to help and make sure everything is okay. We loved every single detail, including the snacks, pizza, wine and beer he had for us, as well as the surroundings. The sound of the creek beside the house along with the flowers and peaceful nature really made us feel disconnected from our hectic routines."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,2nd stay as we stopped for a night on our way South and also on our return back North. Definitely recommend it!
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"The best Airbnb experience ever. I’ve stayed in more than 20 Airbnbs on 4 continents and this was the best experience ever. Andrew has set the bar high and has set a new gold standard for both hospitality and value. The unit is quite large, peaceful, and immaculate. Also Andrew remembers what most hosts forget, that the final B in Airbnb stands for breakfast. Andrew had food and drinks waiting for us upon arrival and coffee and yogurt for us in the morning. My only regret is that I only stayed one night."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Everything was great! The host was very kind and actually let us stay longer!
It was personalized, very clean and amazing 😭
Would love to come back!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at Andrew's, to celebrate our anniversary. It was a relaxing setting and the house was super clean. Andrew was an exceptional host, thinking of many little details to make us feel like special guests. We would definitely recommend!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Spacious and very welcoming for our family of 8. Games, snacks, creek, and fire pit. They even enjoyed the soccer field. Never saw or heard the hosts even though they live upstairs. Book it before it is gone."
2024-06-01,5,Group trip,"Andrew's Airbnb is the nicest I have ever stayed in. I tour manage a band and Andrew worked easily with our schedule and even had our welcome sign for us. The space itself is spotless, comfortable, modern and there wasn't a single thing that Andrew didn't do to prepare for our stay and make us feel welcome. Just a gorgeous space -- anytime I am in Boone I'll stay here if I can. Thank you!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"This place is a gem! I almost hate to tell everyone how great a place it is so it’s not
Booked when I need it next. 😂 very pristine inside, everything is new. Everything you might have left at home is there for you! A welcome sign personalized with our names was the BEST. The creek is very peaceful to listen to in the morning while drinking coffee. The added snacks was very nice and thoughtful. I will be back!"
2024-05-01,5,Stayed one night,What an amazing hidden gem in Boone. Part of me did not even want to rave and keep this amazing place a secret. I want to go back to Boone just to be able to stay at this place. Andrew’s place is the definition of a southern hospitality BNB! It’s worth 10+ stars!!! Even my teenager was impressed and you know teenagers are difficult to impress!! Will definitely return with my family again.
2024-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"Andrew was an incredible host, and the space was wonderful! From the personal touches, to the spotless condition of the space, to the way it was stocked, we felt very well taken care of. The drive to the mountainside location was scenic, and the stream that runs through the property adds to the charm! We will definitely book again!"
2024-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"This was by far the BEST host we have had in all of our stays thru Airbnb! Not only did it have everything we needed - this host thought of things to make our stay better that wasn't even on our radar! The thoughtfulness and planning that went into this stay was rockstar status!
From asking our preferences of drinks, temp and diffuser sent before we arrived to having goodies, snacks and even eye masks for sleeping - this place had it ALL. My husband slept so well - he made me ask what kind of mattress the host had! :)
The setting was very peaceful and we enjoyed sipping our coffee on the porch overlooking the creek. But not so secluded that you have to drive far to get into town.
Cannot recommend this place enough!!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Andrew & his family were very friendly hosts! They LITERALLY thought of everything we would need for a great stay. There were cute personal touches and the place was very comfortable. This was by far the cleanest Airbnb I have ever stayed in. Me and my partner felt cared for and relaxed. The hosts genuinely care about your experience and it feels like they set it up with all the things they would want if they were on vacation. 10/10 recommend!
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,gorgeous cabin! had things specifically set up for me and my service dog 🐕‍🦺
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Andrew and his Partner were great, responsive and precise. Gorgeous place, beautiful and peaceful surrounding.
Hope to be back again!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Would definitely recommend this place to anyone who is looking for a place to stay in Boone! Kimberly is awesome, and it made my engagement trip with my fiancé perfect! Thank you!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Was exactly what we hoped and better. Perfect cabin in Boone for a romantic getaway.
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Kimberly's A-Frame Cabin was exactly what we were looking for. Something remote where we could get away for the weekend, but be close enough to a town center to eat out a little and walk around. Kimberly was also an EXCELLENT host, with less than usual Check-out instructions, which is greatly appreciated.
The cabin isn't necessarily remote, like what'd I'd think in Pigeon Forge for instance, as it's located on a semi-neighborhood like road, but the directions the windows face coupled with the change in elevation and the tree cover really give a feeling of privacy."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This experience was top notch! The house was immaculate, Kimberly’s suggestions were spot on, and the house was adorable! We are looking forward to our next stay. Amazing!!"
2024-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Absolutely Storybook perfect!
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Kimberly's cabin is amazing. Beautiful decor with attention to the little details that make the stay easy. Kimberly's recommendations were spot on. Great restaurants and coffee shops in town. Loved the sound of the mountain stream next to the cabin. Beautiful and relaxing setting. I can't wait to get back to Boone so I can stay in Kimberley's place again.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I booked a weekend for my in laws as a gift and they had a great time. The cabin was beautiful and in a great location and Kimberly was fantastic to work with.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Booked it for honeymoon and it was the absolute perfect getaway!
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My husband and I were thrilled when we arrived at Kimberly's beautiful A-Frame cabin. The cabin itself was stunning and spotless. We immediately felt like we'd arrived home. We truly loved being there, from the twinkle lights upstairs to the cozy living room, every single detail was perfection. It's very easy to find and the directions provided were extremely helpful. We cooked dinner every night in the kitchen, which was stocked with everything we needed to make delicious meals. The scenery is gorgeous and the cabin is private while being centrally located. We never had to drive far to get where we wanted to go. Kimberly was a fantastic host, responding to messages quickly, and was friendly and helpful. This was one of our best Air BnB experiences yet, and we can't wait to return!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful cabin in a lovely, peaceful area. Cabin is stunning with wonderful decor throughout."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,Simply adorable and great little cabin. Perfect for a couple to stay in. Very romantic. Nice little touches.
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"If you're looking for a tucked-away, quiet but lovely place to unwind, this is your cabin. It's quaint, full of everything you need and surrounded by a nature's delight of views, including a brook running melodically beside the cabin. You're not far from a plethora of wonderful hiking trails, parks, restaurants and wonderful views of incredible mountain scenery almost everywhere you look."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Amazing!
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Tremendous space, location, and host! Would recommend."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Wow, what a cozy, serene cabin. One of the cutest air bnb’s I have been too. It very much looks like the photos and made me feel right at home. Good distance to downtown Boone. Loved the open kitchen, patio, and fire place! 100% recommend."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Amazing little cabin! We had an amazing time here. We have already booked an additional stay for later this year. Everything was perfect for our Valentine’s getaway. Thanks so much!
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a great time at this airbnb! It was very clean, beautiful and Kimberly had everything we needed. Would definitely recommend staying here!"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Loved staying at Kimberly’s cabin! A friend and I got away for a reading/ girls weekend, and this was the perfect spot. The decor is so eclectic and cozy. The beds were crisp and so comfortable, fell asleep every night instantly. The area was quiet and the perfect atmosphere for really getting away and unplugging. Loved the wood burning stove, we used it every day. Kimberly had clear instructions and was kind in all of her communications. Overall cannot recommend staying with Kimberly enough, already planning how to come back!"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great stay. If you are going in the winter. Do not skimp on a the vehicle. You need 4 wheel drive for this area during winter.
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What a cool cottage! This cottage is among our top Airbnbs in America. It is beautifully situated and really a fairytale cottage. Very cozy, super clean and equipped with all the comforts. Delicious luxury towels and shower gel/soap. And the tranquility! Sleep wonderfully with the sound of river. This truly is a top cottage!"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The cozy cottage was picturesque and perfectly suited for our stay. I highly recommend.
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My husband and I had a magical stay at the cabin. The location is super close to town and great restaurants, yet also super quiet and relaxing.
The space was cozy and we appreciated all of the creative and thoughtful touches. Will definitely be back!"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Kimberly is the best host! She was very communicative and helpful. The Cozy Owl Cabin is the most quaint, comfy little cabin in such a beautiful location. There is a cute little swing tucked away underneath the deck (great for star gazing in the evenings) and has a gorgeous view of the mountain range. We definitely intend to visit again!"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Absolutely beautiful! Even better than the pictures. We even got a little snow and really loved having the wood stove. Very quiet neighborhood and a very pretty view of the creek down below. We can’t wait to come back!
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"One of my favorites! Absolutely adorable, super clean, quiet, and super cozy. Peaceful yet close to Boone. I will definitely stay here again next time we are in Boone."
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My husband and I just stayed here for our honeymoon and it was an absolute dream!! The cabin is even cuter and dreamier in person than in the pictures. Kimberly was so kind and responsive. There is a neighboring cabin immediately next door, and we were able to hear a number of cars going up the hill next to the cabin throughout the day, but it was never enough to be disruptive or annoying. We stayed here during the first week of January and despite the cold there was so much to do in the area- delicious food, cute stores, and beautiful hikes & scenery. Appalachian ski mountain was a blast and access to the Blue ridge parkway is within a 20 minute drive. Could not recommend this cozy place any more!!!!"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place was a great place for a little getaway! It was peaceful, quiet, and cozy all for a great price! I would recommend this place to anyone thinking about travelling to the Boone area. The cabin is enhanced by the natural beauty of the mountain surrounding it and we thoroughly enjoyed our stay!"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Cabin was just perfect! Great location.. so cozy. Very clean and Kimberly was excellent and so thoughtful. Enjoyed our anniversary get away and would definitely stay here again!!
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,One of our favorite stays ever! My wife and I met while going to App State and were celebrating our 5 year wedding anniversary. The location was beautiful. We especially loved the spacious deck to watch the sunset. It was very tidy and welcoming inside. We stayed in the loft and absolutely loved the space. We will definitely add this place to our list to come back.
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I’ve never been in a cleaner, more aesthetic or thoughtfully designed Air Bnb in my life! I’ll be recommending this cabin to all my friends and family. Thank you for such a fantastic experience!"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great place to stay, everything was spectacular and very relaxing. Owner was very friendly and answered all my questions fast. Definitely would recommend this place."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Could not have had a better experience! My husband and I were trying to find a local getaway for our 25th wedding anniversary and this precious Cozy Owl Cabin did not disappoint. Kimberly’s touches in the cabin were intentional and well-thought out. She was an excellent communicator, and most of all, we felt like we were in a magical space as soon as we walked in the cabin. High marks for this incredible space and host! It was wonderful!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This place was everything the pictures showed and more. It was cozy and comfortable. We are so grateful that we got to stay here and be so close to downtown Boone. It was the best!
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Everything was perfect. We will definitely be staying here again in the future.
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The cozy cottage is exactly that - incredibly cozy! Kimberly's home feels like a HOME, not an airbnb / anything corporate. The details were lovely and the closer you looked the better it was - so often it's the other way around. Do not hesitate to book. If you value proximity to things to do nestled in a private and incredibly quiet location, this is the place for you."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What a lovely cabin! Immediately upon arrival, we knew we would enjoy our stay. Simply and beautifully appointed with all sorts of sweet details, we felt relaxed and pleased to have found this cabin conveniently located near Boone. We recommend this host and her cabin!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"we had a wonderful stay at kimberly's cabin. kimberly, thank you so much for hosting us! we enjoyed our visit and can't thank you enough for your kind hospitality. the space is lovely and we hope to return soon!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,It was a wonderful place to stay . Very peaceful. Kimberly is a great hostess very proactive with any issues that arose!! Definitely would recommend
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This stay was GREAT! We came for our honeymoon & it was the best cozy spot! It was affordable, close to places we awaited to eat or be @ & also had a great host! We will be back for sure!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The Cozy Little Cottage was exactly as described and has been one of our best experiences with AirBNB! Kimberly (host) was proactive with her communications and incredibly helpful.
The cottage is beautiful and equally important spotless. It was immediately noticeable that the host takes pride in providing a clean cabin. We immediately felt comfortable upon arriving.
The location is convenient to Boone (approx 2 miles). We also ventured over to Banner Elk and did a couple of hikes while in the area. Kimberly provided a couple of recommendations. One was the Stickboy Bread Kitchen which was amazing.
We would definitely recommend staying here and hope to return in the future."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,A peaceful little cabin nestled in the woods. Very quiet and private close to everything. The host is wonderful and everything needed will be there for you. Loved the deck and the scenery. Very comfortable to sit back and relax and sleep soundly. This will be put on the bucket list to do it again.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at Kimberly’s place. It was just as described and had everything we needed. She even provided fire wood and a $10 gift card to Stickmans bread. We will definitely stay here again. If you’re in the Boone area it’s a must stay. You won’t be disappointed. Thanks again Kimberly.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,Great stay! We had a great time in this beautiful cabin
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"It is such a beautiful cabin and we loved staying here. I proposed this weekend and was able to surprise my now fiancé with staying here; she’s been wanting to stay here for years and absolutely adores the cabin. The cabin is private, peaceful, and cozy. Kimberly is proactive and thoughtful. We would absolutely recommend booking this AirBnb and hope to come back soon!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I've submitted a few reviews for Kimberly's 'Cozy Owl' AirBnB & I try not to say the same things over & over, but it's hard not to.
Reason being, this place & this host are so incredible that there are few words that actually do it justice.
We've based our trips to Boone on the dates this particular cabin is available, and only hope we get so lucky in the future to be able to book it near/on the week of our anniversary (which is what brings us here each year).
This place is charming, beautiful, cozy, close to downtown Boone, still tucked away in the woods to feel secluded. And it has everything you could think of, including things you wouldn't know you needed until you're there.
Kim is a really special host & you'll definitely have a more enjoyable & relaxing stay here than probably most other AirBnBs locally for all those reasons.
Worth booking every single time!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"A dream!!!! We were visiting Boone for a football game. The house was beautiful. So cute and cozy. We’ve been misled numerous times by deceiving photos etc but this place was PERFECT! Good location, not too far from the stadium. We also had the cutest & sweetest little kitten visitor on the deck. Next time we’re in Boone this is a must stay place for us."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We loved staying at Kimberly’s place. It was in a great location close to downtown Boone. The cottage itself was adorable and very clean/well equipped. It was very cozy at the end of our adventurous days. When in the area we would definitely stay again!
Recs for the area: Stick Boy Bakery, Espresso News, Speckled Trout, Boonshine Brewery, Hatchet Coffee, CoBo sushi. Hiking the Boone Fort trail was great too! The high country is just spectacular in the fall :)
Thanks, Kimberly! :)"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I am so happy I chose this cozy cabin for my annual fall colors trip. Kimberly is a fantastic host, accommodating and thoughtful. The deck is the star attraction of this beautiful abode!!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We couldn’t have asked for a better place to stay during our elopement trip to NC. Kimberly was so kind and responded quickly to all our questions. The house was so comfortable and in a peaceful neighborhood. This was our favorite Airbnb stay EVER! 10/10 everything, absolutely incredible."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The cozy cabin was a wonderful stay! It was so easy to find, and yet felt secluded. It was also super easy to get in and out of town for what we needed. We had a very relaxing trip, and especially enjoyed the wood stove and sitting on the back porch. The beds were comfortable, the place was incredibly clean, and the kitchen was very functional. I would definitely stay again and recommend it to others!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Words cannot possibly be enough to describe how amazing our stay was. Kimberly was an amazing host wayyy before we even arrived and the space is absolutely beautiful!! Came here to get settled a few days before our wedding and it was just PERFECT. Everything was so cute and we’ve never had better sleep in that comfy loft bed. 100000% recommend. Will definitely be booking again when we come back to visit!!
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful space to land for exploring the area. Kimberly has created a cozy, inviting space for unwinding and relaxing. The pictures are exactly what you will find when you arrive. Morning coffee on that spacious deck was peaceful just breathing in that crisp mountain air and listening to the water in the creek was a great way to start our day. Thank you for sharing this with us. We will most definitely return when back in the area."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"A+ for this Airbnb! Everything about this stay was fantastic. Clean, comfortable, spacious, memorable. We will return for sure :)"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Kimberly’s place was all we hoped for and more! It was the best airbnb we have ever stayed in. The property was peaceful and the house was clean and beautifully decorated. Kimberly was extremely responsive and welcoming. She even left us a gift card for a local bakery to enjoy during our stay. We would definitely stay here again and will recommend it to any of our friends visiting Boone!
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Better than a 5+ your airbnb is a 10+++++. We loved it, so clean, decor so tasteful. Even quickly found the Golf Channel for my husband, he was so impressed. The newly stained deck was fabulous, we spent alot of time out there listening to the creek. We will return many times."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed about a week,My husband and I stayed here for our honeymoon and loved the experience. The house was clean and comfortable and the location was perfect for the activities we had planned. Excellently priced and responsive host!
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Nice little cabin to stay in when around Boone. The decor is great and cozy for rainy days, back porch is very quiet and a great reading spot with sound from the nearby stream. 5ish minute drive to downtown Boone and all that comes with it."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Kimberly was an amazing host and my husband and I throughly enjoyed our time at the Cozy Owl Cabin! It was a beautiful mountain retreat and I highly recommend Kimberly as a host!
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My friend and I wanted a peaceful spot to enjoy nature, read, and just unplug for a few days. Kimberly's cabin caught our eye and we are so glad we got to stay at the Cozy Owl Cabin. We both enjoyed the outside deck, swing, and small trail to the creek. My friend loved the loft and we both thought this cabin was the perfect combo of peaceful but within an easy distance to town. Kimberly was responsive, friendly, and a great host. We hope to come back in the future!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Cute cabin. Tastefully decorated. Wonderful big deck with tiny stream next to house. Located close to downtown. Quiet and relaxing.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"AC is cold, house is beautiful, host is very thoughtful and kind and has great attention to detail.
Loved it!!!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We loveddd this place!! It was very clean, cozy, stylish, great location, and perfect for a little getaway with my mom and sister. The porch and little swing outside was beautiful overlooking the woods- we would’ve stayed out there all day if it weren’t for the rain. Can’t wait to come back!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This was a beautiful and comfortable place to stay in Boone. The cabin was very clean and cute and looked exactly like the photos. i will say the photos don’t do justice to the back deck. The deck was a wonderful place to sit and enjoy the surrounding trees and the sound of the creek. Kimberly is a very thoughtful host and this is a wonderful place to stay while visiting Boone.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What a cute and restful property! Kimberly was a fantastic host and took care to make sure we had everything we needed. Boone and the surrounding area is one of our favorite getaways, and this house helped us enjoy the experience even more. My husband and I loved this place and hope to return someday!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My first Airbnb plus stay did not disappoint! I’ve had this place on my wishlist for awhile and was thrilled to finally stay here. It was all we had hoped for…and more. Loved the decor, it was thoughtful, simple, and comfy. Packed with every amenity you could need. If I had my own Airbnb I’d strive to be like this one. Was nice to return as an ASU alum and stay here, definitely recommend. Thanks for everything Kimberly!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Fabulous little cabin - my friend & I stayed there when we came to Boone to see the Highland Echoes show at the Appalachian Theater. The cabin is a short drive into the busy part of town. The location is very quiet & private, yet easy access to the two-lane highway. The cabin was so clean, neat, such a great use of space, & so thoughtfully decorated that it appeared ready for a photo shoot. Every little detail was thought of, including not only little decorative touches but also what a traveler might need during their stay. It's very well cared for; there's no cloud of Febreze when you open the door as if the owner is hiding odors. If you are a runner, you may want to drive somewhere to go for your daily run. The hill up to the cabin is @ .4 miles (at least according to my watch). It's a challenge for doing hill repeats, & I mean that in a good way. But if you're going for a flat run, the two-lane highway has no shoulder. Attempting that hill for 2 days was enough for me. :-)"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We had a wonderful time at Kimberly’s cabin. The house was in a great location close to downtown Boone, and at the same time felt very secluded. We highly recommend!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The cabin was beautiful & fully stocked for just what we needed for our stay. Private location but close to downtown Boone & Blowing Rock! Loved the cabin & Kimberly was a lovely host!
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The cabin was easy to locate, immaculately kept, cute and cozy! We couldn't have asked for more!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Starting from the communication at booking, Kimberly was an amazing host. This was our first experience with Airbnb, and she made it all an easy process. The directions were very detailed and made finding the property very straightforward. The keyless entry into the cabin meant we could checkin on our own time and not have to bother the host. The cabin was exactly as described, spotless, and peaceful. The back porch was huge with plenty of seating under the tall, beautiful trees. The area was quiet and peaceful. The location was close enough to restaurants and shops, but still removed enough to be nestled among nature. We highly recommend this cabin and host. Thank you for an amazing stay! We can’t wait to be back!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had the best stay at the cabin! Kimberly was friendly and responsive prior to check in and the cabin was absolutely gorgeous!

Definitely will be back!"

So many great trails to see (went to one with a waterfall on the cloudiest day and was still so beautiful). I have to mention Kimberly also left us a little gift card and was overall so quick to respond- beyond!"
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"If you're looking for a cozy getaway in the mountains of North Carolina then look no further. I would highly recommend you book your next mountain getaway with Kimberly. Her A-Frame is very clean, nicely decorated, and it has so much natural light. Not only is it beautiful and well kept on the inside, but on the outside as well.
Our family felt at home with the large windows, beautiful creek in the distance, and of course the warmth of the fireplace in the living room. I would have to say our favorite part of this cabin was the loft. This room was so special because of the large windows, natural light, and the cozy vibes.
We truly loved this cabin and hope that many others get to experience Kimberly's cabin the way we did. Thank you so much for welcoming us into your home, Kimberly."

While we did not choose to cook on this trip, we have planned to return and make meals in the cabin since the kitchen is well-equipped. Our goal was to relax and this cabin provided the perfect space for it. The weather was right to sit on the deck (and don't miss the swing below the deck). We streamed a few shows while relaxing on the sofa (logging in with our own streaming service accounts). Thanks for Kimberly for making available this wonderful space and maximizing our enjoyment of it. We have already booked a return trip!"

2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Whatever I could possibly say about Kimberly's Cozy Owl Cabin or about her as a host & person could never do justice.
The home itself is perfect for a couple looking to get away, while simultaneously being super close to downtown Boone (<7 min drive) & the Blue Ridge Parkway.
Location is a win.
It's an immaculate cabin with every single inch being planned out and used to accommodate guests.
Everything in the house seems to be their for a reason. Kimberly has anticipated everything you'd want to have in an AirBnB and then she's optimized it to make your life easier.
The 1st time we stayed here, I was walking around thinking ""it'd be nice to have X, Y, Z"" ...and sure enough, those exact things would be there.
^ You'll only know what I'm talking about when you stay.
Kimberly is one of the sweetest people I've never met.
The home wouldn't be what it is without her. She takes a home & turns it into an experience.
You could have literally everything else go wrong on your trip & as long as you booked here then you'd still have a great, relaxing time.
Book it. Enjoy it. Then book it again & again like we have & will continue to do."
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,My husband and I thoroughly enjoyed our stay here! The home is adorable and super close to downtown Boone! Kimberly was very sweet and accommodating! We would definitely recommend the Cozy Owl Cabin to others looking for a sweet mountain getaway!

2022-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The cabin was amazing. Really comfortable, and we definitely enjoyed our stay. Kimberly left us coffee and tea, which was super delicious, and a gift for us, because we were using the cabin on our honeymoon. We definitely recommend the place."

2022-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I really enjoyed my time at Kimberly's A-Frame! She's a great host who was easy to get in contact with if I had any questions. I am a huge fan of A-frames and the way they look, so it was nice to stay in one and see the layout. The location was great; close enough to downtown Boone, but far enough to have some privacy. 10/10 would stay here again!"
2022-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Had wonderful time in this charming cabin. Very clean. Well designed. And best of all Kimberly was so responsive and nice! She had coffee for us ready when we got there because I told her my husband loves coffee as well as a gift card for a local yummy coffee shop and bakery!!! We came in Jan-Feb and it was actually not cold inside the house and we didn’t have to wear warm clothes inside. The fire place helped and is really nice to start as it adds to the charming view of the house with the outside. All in all, we had a wonderful time. Highly recommend."
2022-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"It was my 1st time in the Mountains and seeing snow, I couldn't have asked for a better place to stay at it was perfect in everyway posible. Definitely a memory I will keep forever, and recommend to anyone looking for a quite peaceful place."

2022-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place was so charming! The host Kimberly was super sweet and thoughtful and the cozy cabin was everything I had hoped for! Located just 10 minutes away from their main town area, super convenient but yet the cabin felt completely secluded! Surrounded by trees and mountain, the cabin was immaculately clean and super adorable in every corner! Perfect little getaway for sure!!!"
2022-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Can’t say ENOUGH good things about this adorable AirBnB. Everything was absolutely perfect, as pictured & more. The cabin was cozy, clean and perfectly decorated for a weekend getaway. The host was wonderful and responsive. About 5 minutes from downtown Boone, there is nothing this place lacked or could have done better on. We cannot wait to book our next trip there. If you are thinking of the perfect cabin getaway, look no further… THIS IS IT!  
Kate & Paul"
2022-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We had a wonderful time at the Cozy Owl Cabin! We stayed during winter storm Izzy, and were unable to get to some of our planned events. However, we felt like we didn’t miss a thing! The cabin is well stocked with kitchen and toiletry items. The inside is beautifully decorated with unique pieces/decor, and the outside has a great deck and area underneath we enjoyed in the snow. One of my favorite details was the sensor nightlight on the stairs - you can tell Kim has thought of everything to make sure her guests are taken care of and enjoy their stay!"

2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful property. Porch side creek was amazing. We were pleasantly surprised at how neat it was inside, considering it was transformed into this cute, cozy home from a shed! The reclaimed wood was a great touch. Owners very responsive. Exactly as described."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is a gorgeous little hut! The creek in front is very peaceful. The gravel road in is well maintained and easy to access the house. Everything (restaurants, stores, etc.) is about twenty minutes away from the house. It’s very cozy and well thought out. You can tell they put a lot of effort in to the furnishings and decorations. Their cleaning crew does an amazing job! The place was exceptionally clean."

It was easy travel time to Boone, Blowing Rock and West Jefferson as well as grocery stores and, of course, Dollar General for all those things we forgot. I would love to come back and stay another time."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"Awesome house, very unique would gladly stay again"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had an amazing time! We always enjoy to stay places that feel homey, but are nothing like our home . (Hope that makes sense). The Hut is so well thought out and has everything at your finger tips to enjoy your stay."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We loved the hut and immediately felt right at home there. It was beautifully decorated, comfortable and we loved the coffee."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Another wonderful stay at this slice of heaven! Jason has great communication and everything was clean. I love that the front door is facing the creek so you walk out to beautiful scenery as well as privacy. It’s a short drive to either Boone or West Jefferson. We’ll definitely be back! Thanks again!
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place!
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This tiny home is wonderful! The wooded setting was perfect and private, even with other homes nearby. We loved the little creek off the porch! It was too cold to make use of the porch, but in warmer weather we could have sat there all day listening to the creek. The inside is roomy and adorably decorated. So many special touches and amenities. The beds were comfortable, the kitchen was well equipped, the shower is pretty small but worked for my daughter and I…and the hot water never failed! It was fabulous! The owners were responsive and helpful. We would definitely recommend this property and hope to stay there again!!"

2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"I only stayed for one night while visiting my nephew at App, but I just loved this little hut! It's the perfect size for a solo trip but would also be great for a couple or small family, and it's very affordable compared to other places in the area. There are some other houses close by but the front door faces away from them so you get the effect of almost total solitude. The weather was balmy when I arrived so I opened the door and windows (after turning off the heat of course) and the sound of the little steam that runs right outside the door filled the entire house. It was so peaceful and idyllic. The hut itself was incredibly clean and comfortable and cute as a button! Jason responded quickly and courteously when I messaged him with a question. All in all a wonderful place to stay and I hope I'll have the pleasure of staying there again next time I visit Boone!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place is truly a hidden gem, the price was great for the experience. The house was well taken care of, the washer/dryer was convenient. We were shocked by how big the space was and by the beautiful surrounding landscape. It felt very private. We took advantage of the outdoor grill and fire pit, and just enjoyed the peace and quiet. We will definitely stay here again!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What a find! Fantastic, off the beaten path, secluded mountain setting but close to amenities. It was perfect for our Annuversary celebration to see Ashley McBryde at Appalachian State University!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was the perfect place for a nice getaway from normal life. Everything was clean and well thought out, and included all the necessities.

2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had an unforgettable stay! Just the 3 of us. This was the perfect place! We walked around the trail, saw the Christmas Trees, we did s’mores on the fire pit, and just hung out watching Netflix. We stayed 4 nights and we will never forget the times we had with our little girl. The hut is only 30 minutes away from Appalachian Ski Resort. Thank you so much for your hospitality dear Jason. We will definitely go back, God willing 🙏🏼"

2024-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We booked this tiny hut based on all of the amazing reviews. Those reviews were spot on! This was the cutest, coziest place in a beautiful location. We were there for one night - my husband and our two kids. The kids loved the loft area. It was their own little space, which allowed us the downstairs area. The couch was cozy, the kitchen was well stocked and the shower was amazing! I saw that in the reviews and couldn’t wait to see what the hype was about. It was spacious enough and the water pressure was perfect. It was really cold when we were there so we didn’t get to take advantage of the beautiful scenery. But we did love the sound of the creek and see the fire pits that were available. We really loved our experience!"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We enjoyed our stay at the cabin! Easy drive to Blowing Rock and Boone. There was a nice view to a little creek out back. It was unseasonably cold that weekend but many extra blankets and space heaters were available.
2024-01-01,5,Stayed one night,2nd time staying here! We love how quiet it is here and it is the perfect mountain getaway location!
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Love it! Little hideaway get away spot that is full of natures beauty!

We will definitely be back here again for another get away trip in the future!"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"A wonderful place to stay, host is amazing and friendly"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This space was completely serene. I'm talkin' calming silence, vibrant stars, warm and cozy house... all the things you need to enjoy a peaceful getaway. If you need a pick-me-up, Boone was a 15-minute drive to good food, fun bars, and live music.
We rang in the New Year at this home around a fire and it was absolutely perfect. We will definitely be back."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The Hut it’s truly lovely. Clean, intentionally and thoughtfully decorated, and a great place to temporarily call home. Parking and access is convenient. The shower is one of the favorite ones of my entire life – no joke! The kitchen is surprisingly well appointed. One thing to note for – the Blue Ridge Parkway is currently closed within that area for construction, unrelated to weather. This significantly impacted my travel time to local venues. It’s certainly not the host or listing’s fault - i’m just noting it here for future occupants’ research."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,We had a great time!
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Loved staying here with my kids for the holidays !! Lovely cabin.

2023-11-01,5,Stayed one night,This sweet little hut was SO cozy. It felt like we were much more remote than we actually were. it rained while we were there which was fine bc we spent the morning drinking coffee on the porch looking at the Christmas tree farm and listening to the rain on the tin roof. The beds were incredibly comfortable. Everything was wonderful and we will stay again!

I will definitely keep this place on my list of place to return to again."

2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,Jason's place was the perfect size for our family of four. We have two young boys that were excited to sleep in the loft while my wife and I had the bedroom. The kitchen had everything we needed. Our 5 and 7 year-old boys loved playing in the stream just outside the door. There is also a larger stream maybe 100ft out the door that we explored. The sound of water can be heard outside and contributes to the peaceful nature of the property. We absolutely loved our stay and highly recommend it to anyone seeking a peaceful retreat not far from Boone.

2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Our family of four loved this place! Very peaceful, close to Boone and Blowing Rock with beautiful views. Our kids loved the loft space and didn’t want to leave!

2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"The place is larger inside than the photos make seem and has a wonderful bathroom with a rainforest shower that is not shown. A grill, outdoor firepit, and a covered patio that overlooks a private section of cascading creek , makes the outdoor space perfect whatever the weather. The private entrance is around the back of the building away from the small private road, so is not overlooked. A very peaceful stay with all mod cons ."

If we visit the Boone area again, we'll certainly see if Jason's cabin is available!"

2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Was an absolute pleasure to stay at! It is in the perfection location that allows you to have the seclusion of being “in the wilderness” but also the convenience of being within proximity to just about everything! My only suggestion is maybe put some curtains over the front door for privacy (plus a giant glass door facing the woods always give me the creeps) other than that 10/10!
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful spot and great place! Jason was very communicative and accommodating.
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had an absolutely great stay! Best of all, the space was very clean, and the surrounding areas were absolutely beautiful."
2023-03-01,4,Stayed with kids,The Hut was absolutely happy. The creek outside was a dream. My son LOVED the loft room and we were cozy our entire stay. Thank you!
2023-03-01,5,Stayed one night,Great homey stay close to Boone!
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had an amazing stay at Jason’s place! It was quiet—a few neighbors, but generally private area down a dirt road and only a 20 minute drive to Boone. The space is small and very quaint, we were provided everything that we needed! The welcome book contained lots of good information about the town (places to eat, night life, things to do, etc) as well as clear check out instructions. Our only problem was the front door doesn’t have any kind of covering on it—all glass. And while it does face the woods/creek with no neighbors in that direction, we were a little unsettled by it at night! That might have been because we were unfamiliar with the area and the neighborhood, but nonetheless, something to cover the door with when it got dark would have made us feel a little more comfortable. All in all, amazing place at an even better price!"
2023-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We really enjoyed our stay. The home was exactly as described and pictured on the site. Jason was very prompt when responding to our questions.
We only wished we had had better weather to enjoy the lovely little porch by the stream."
2023-02-01,5,Stayed one night,Wonderful area. Restful and relaxing with great natural options nearby. Quiet. Peaceful.
2023-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,We had a wonderful stay!
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This place was so awesome! The hosts were responsive and helpful. We had the best time exploring Boone! We will be back.
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Wonderful place! Beautiful creek right outside your front door ❤️
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We had a wonderful time! It is so peaceful sitting on the porch listening to the running stream. The inside is so clean. I was shocked how beautiful and how well planned out the inside is! It was cozy and felt right at home!
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Perfect location - private but close to town. We have stayed in lots of places in the mountains but this might be our favorite
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Perfect for a little ski trip getaway!
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"It is a great and charming place, spring water, quiet"
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place! Appalachian ski resort is perfect for beginners!
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Very cozy and adorable, loved the privacy and how clean the place was."
2023-01-01,5,Stayed one night,Loved staying in the Hut! Would definitely stay again.
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Awesome little spot, perfect for what we needed!"
2022-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"Good value, beautiful rental. Has everything you need. Stayed warm even in freezing temperatures.
Make sure to read the welcome book as there is a detailed checkout/cold weather procedure. Also, the wood stove is off limits which was a little disappointing but understandable for an Airbnb.
Only hiccup we had was that when we arrived, the previous guests were still checking out. The hosts apologized and told us we could wait or come back later, we went into town for dinner and when we came back everything was good to go. To be fair, we booked on very short notice so I understand if the hosts were surprised by our quick arrival.
Overall, it’s a beautiful rental on a beautiful property. Everything was clean and organized. I had a great stay."
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This is quite possibly our favorite Airbnb ever. This place is beautiful and extremely clean. The location is peaceful yet close enough to enjoy the local town. Jason was a great host and quick to respond. They even decorated for Christmas! 10/10 best Airbnb! Highly recommend!
2022-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,Great stay here. So cute and clean inside.
2022-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"The CUTEST Airbnb ever!! The size of the outside look is deceiving to the space inside; the space inside is divided very well and has everything you need! If I could live here 24/7 i would! Nice hot water, comfy beds, everything was amazing!! I do plan on booking here whenever I visit my second home from now on!!"
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"It was the cutest little hut, and despite having others around it still felt private. Clear instructions before checking out, and very accommodating."
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"A perfect getaway, highly recommend."
2022-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"The pictures are very accurate. Make sure you study them closely as loft access requires some agility. Very convenient to Boone but also very much away from it all. Make sure to save a few hours to sit on the ""front"" porch (which is actually in the back). Amazingly restful vibe."
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Best airbnb I've ever been to!
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great place! Right on a creek. Inside was comfortable with everything you need.

2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Wow! What a perfect place of peace! This was the best home in the mountains we could have asked for. Cozy, yet spacious. A fully equipped kitchen and lots of attention to detail. We felt right at home and never wanted to leave. Thank you for a beautiful retreat!"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place was amazing. About 20 to 30 minutes outside Boone and perfectly peaceful and remote. We enjoyed the comfort and quiet as we relaxed and enjoyed our time away.
We saw a plenty of wildlife (deer, rabbits, fox squirrels and chipmunks) as we would eat meals and look out the French doors.
10/10 would stay again."
2022-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,Had a blast at this little hut. Wouldn’t mind coming back!
2022-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"What a unique place! We loved all the different woods and decor. The space was utilized so well and we could tell a lot of thought went into the design of the house. The beds and couch were comfortable and the information in your welcome book was helpful. Warm & cozy all around. Jason was always available for any questions. All in all, a great place to enjoy the flavor of North Carolina's mountains."
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Jason was extremely helpful during this entire visit and the weeks leading up. The space itself is perfect for relaxing after exploring the surrounding areas. Would absolutely visit and stay again

2022-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Overall, we loved it. The house was cozy and clean. They had everything we needed.
The trail around the house was very peaceful to walk. The communication with Jason was awesome! Thank you. We even saw a shooting star!
The sound of the creek was plus!
Two things we didn’t expect were we thought the house was totally surrounded by nature but there are a couple houses close by. (One is right next to this house)
And Monday morning was a little noisy with the commercial vehicles and big delivery truck passing by…Weekend might be more quiet:)
But we made a fire and my kids explored nature and we could spend very peaceful night. We needed it. Thank you."
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This was the perfect Airbnb! Small and cozy but had everything needed for a weekend away in the mountains!
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Lovely little stream out back. Clean, cozy, perfect for two people!"
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Jason’s little hut should be called Jason’s Gem: really nice, superbly clean with a great deal of attention to details including leaving coffee (forgot to take some from home before leaving, in the mornings, if I don’t have a cup of coffee first, don’t even talk to me..LOL). House is situated in a beautiful surrounding, so peaceful and calm, it was very clean, loved the shower. Will definitely stay again if we come to Boone. BTW Jason, if you ever decide to sell it, let me know please, my wife loved it."
2022-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"So cute, clean, and comfy. Such a peaceful stay - overlooking trees and stream from the porch. Will definitely plan to stay again!"
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Cute and comfortable Quonset hut in a great location. Enjoyed relaxing on the patio at the end of the day listening to the creek. I would definitely stay here again.

2022-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,Awesome little place nestled into the mountains! We loved it and will probably return.
2022-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,Beautiful small home and great location for our family. The kids definitely enjoyed the creek nearby. Will hopefully book future stays with the host at this location or the other properties. Very impressed!
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is a great stay! Very clean, and well stocked with everything you’d need for a vacation from home. Jason also was very good about communicating with me in a timely manner, which was much appreciated."
2022-07-01,4,Stayed one night,Cozy cabin in the woods. We enjoyed sitting on the back porch and listening to the creek. So relaxing.
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful home, great location!"

2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Wonderful, clean, cute, had a lot of extra necessities"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,They place was amazing.

2022-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"What a gem! Beautifully done tiny hut, it feels so spacious inside! Great location and the river nearby makes it so much better!"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This was our very first stay at an Air bnb so I was a little skeptical at first, but I couldn't have asked for it to go any better! The description was just as listed. Everything was very clean and neat. No complaints!"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,Omg the cuteness is indescribable! My children and I loved it!! Hoping to go back again soon
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This adorable tiny house is such a wonderful and cozy stay. Me and two of my friends rented this house out as a bit of a get away we have known each other for 15 years and this Airbnb was the perfect getaway spot!
2022-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This place is super quant, relaxing, and full of character!! The atmosphere was amazing! The guy was beautiful on the inside and out!! It was the perfect little place for my daughter and I!!"
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"An adorable, cozy home. Perfect for a couple. Plenty of privacy with beautiful scenery."
2022-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We loved our stay here. The home was comfortable, clean, and thoughtfully decorated. We really loved the little stream off the front porch. And the location was great, only about 15min to Downtown Boone."
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Communication was top notch from jason. Place was clean and well kept. Perfect location from boone, west jefferson, and blowing rock. Great stay"
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Very cozy, cute place to stay!"
2022-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"What a wonderful little Airbnb! Very cozy, inviting, and clean. The sound of the rippling creek outside was so peaceful — we loved it! If you’re looking for a cozy, quiet getaway, I would highly recommend staying here. ☺️"
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Perfect and private! Very cozy! The sound of the creek right outside the front porch is so peaceful!
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We’d definitely recommend Jason’s place to friends driving through Boone. It was clean and cozy, we loved sitting outside and listening to the creek. Even the little loft beds were super comfortable."
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We really enjoyed our stay! The space was clean, comfortable, and just want we wanted. I would rebook in the future."
2022-06-01,5,Stayed one night,super cute place!! the hut was easy to find and offered plenty of space for parking. it was such a cozy environment with the little creek out front!! 10/10
2022-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We stayed here last year and couldn’t wait to come back! It was such a great stay once again. We love the location and the property, they really have a great little place. We always love looking out for the little bunnies that cross the road as we drive through. Can’t wait to come back again!"
2022-05-01,4,Stayed one night,"Jason's AirBnB was immaculate and thoughtful. We could tell a lot of care went into every detail. The location is lovely and peaceful. The bed was comfy and the rainfall shower head was a nice surprise after a busy wedding weekend!
One note: We wished there was some indication that the decor had a religious theme. Not being religious, the space didn't feel welcoming to us.
Overall, it's a nice little mountain getaway!"
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very peaceful place - would definitely recommend!!!
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Fantastic place to stay! Very clean and great setup. Place on grounds to hike and play in a creek. Love it!
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great stay. Beautiful location.
2022-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,"I normally don't give reviews, but this little cabin deserves a great one!
If you want to have the cabin/tiny house experience in the mountains this is a perfect place. We are a family of 3 and we all loved it! Our son absolutely didn't want to leave, he enjoy the loft space so much. We played games, made food, listened to music, took naps, and had hot showers. There is a little creek that runs right through the entrance on the porch which makes the experience even more pleasant.
AS a germophobic, I do struggle every time I travel. This cabin was clean, and the bathroom and kitchen which are my top 2 areas were very clean. They did a good job covering all the aspects, in terms of supplies and essentials. My favorite things were the hooks, baskets, and dimmer lights all around the house. We were very pleased and will definitely come back in the fall."
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The hut is a great place to get away to return to nature and ourselves. The bed is great. It is all that it is advertised to be.
2022-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This is a nice, cozy and beautiful place for a small family. We liked every bit of it. The appliances are very good. The location, cleanliness and instructions are pretty good. The quietness along with bird chip rings and subtle sound from the creek bring an ultimate serenity. Thank you Jason for hosting in your beautiful hut."
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Exactly as described - what a gorgeous setting! We had every thing we needed for our stay to celebrate our daughter’s graduation from App State. The space was flawlessly laid out, the creek right off the porch was so relaxing in sight and sound. Check in was easy, communication with the host was very timely and informative - all the special touches were in place when we arrived! Such a cozy, homey, and comfortable space for my husband and myself, along with my mom and our son. Wouldn’t change a thing!"
2022-05-01,5,Stayed one night,Very cozy and quiet place. Stream of water just outside the porch. Well equipped house has everything you need. Doesn't get any better than this at this price. Or at any price ? Maybe it does. But you'll never feel like you should've spent more. The host has thought of every little thing.
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This one is a gem. Although the views and sound of a gurgling stream are mountainous the approach is a very easy on maintained gravel road. The hut's porch is charming and the interior well planned and furnished. Tall people only need to duck at the bathroom pocket doorway. Wifi and cell service were good.
2022-05-01,5,Stayed one night,This lil place is so cute! It is very clean and well maintained. A lot of thought was put into the design. You will absolutely love it! There is a fire pit and waterfall stream and it is close to Boone! Absolutely wonderful!!
2022-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,Jason’s Quonset Hut was beautiful and he was very accommodating. I highly recommend staying there!
2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a wonderful stay at this cozy little place. It was clean, well furnished and had beautiful surroundings."
2022-04-01,5,Stayed one night,This place nails it for charm! Sweet little creek greets you from the porch. Everything you might need and super clean too. Highly recommended!
2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The hut is adorable! It was the perfect size for the two of us. I loved the fact that it’s sitting on the creek. It was clean, organized, and had a well stocked kitchen. They also have games and puzzles as well! Highly recommend!!"
2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,very nice tiny home
2022-04-01,4,Stayed one night,Cute little spot! Pretty close to Boone. Perfect for a couple or a couple friends.
2022-04-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"This adorable little hut was awesome for a get-away! It was a little father from downtown Boone than expected. However, the amenities were great— especially the washer and dryer! The place was clean and exactly what we needed. Ceilings are low so beware! There aren’t any blinds or curtains for the front door and there were people walking around the area in front of the hut, so not the most private place."
2022-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,This place is even better and bigger on the inside then it looks from the outside. My two children and I absolutely love the experience especially the loft for the kids. The stream behind the place is wonderful and hiking near the cabin is also wonderful. We will absolutely stay again soon.
2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Perfect little stay in the mountains and very convenient to Boone or Jefferson. Everything was provided and the personal touches made it feel very comfortable. The pictures perfectly represent the little hut. So cozy and clean! We would definitely stay again.
2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This sweet cabin is so beautiful, clean and located in the sweet spot - feels like we’re secluded surrounded by mountains, streams and Christmas trees and still a quick and easy drive to Boone! The place comes with everything one could ever need! I’ll defiantly be back!"
2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,So nice! Looked exactly like the photos. Very clean. Very easy to find. Great instructions. No issues.
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Catherine's place was easy to check into and included extra amenities - coffee, creamer, snacks, and a cooler were all available for us. She even had a small stocked library! The place is secluded and quiet, while also within walking distance from bars and restaurants on King St. Thank you for the visit!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I loved this place, perfect for a couple for a getaway, walkable to downtown boone, so great for picking up food and comin back."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,The location was perfect. Right down the road from the venue we were attending. It was clean and comfortable. We throughly enjoyed our stay!
2024-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,A great spot right on the edge of downtown which made it easy to walk in for morning coffee and back in for dinner. Cozy and comfortable space. We worked from the Airbnb and local coffee shops for a couple of days while also enjoying the opportunity to explore town and nearby hikes. The convenience and comfort were perfect from this studio garage apartment. Coffee in the morning on the deck with mountain and views was perfect. I would highly recommend this place!
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Loved staying here! Location was perfect for our trip!
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Thank you so much for letting us stay we really loved it!! So cute and cozy! (Also, so close to downtown Boone)"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,Cozy little place with a nice deck. parking can be tricky so be careful!
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"great place to stay! word of advice for taller people though: the shower is a bit awkward- I'm 6'3 and made it work but since the ceiling is sloped, the taller you are, the less space you have."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great location for our App State College visit. Perfect accommodations and very affordable
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had great time during our stay. The loft had everything we needed. Will, definitely look at staying there again next time we visit."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,Great spot for exploring Boone. Quiet neighborhood that’s an easy walk to downtown. Would definitely stay again!
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was a great stay! I loved how close to town we were. The loft was cute & cozy, definitely will be booking next time I’m back in Boone."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Nice location not far from downtown. Very quiet. The space is a good size for 1-2 people. The location is walkable to downtown, though there aren’t sidewalks so you do have to walk in the street a bit. Everything was as listed. Only strange thing is when I booked I sent a messages or two just introducing myself and thanking the host for having me, and was met with complete radio silence. 🤷🏽‍♂️ There also weren’t anything with local recommendations (a lot of places have this now, which is always super helpful), which was a bummer. But the space itself was great!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Cute little place that is close to Appalachian State. We enjoyed the friendly cat that came to visit us throughout our stay. We will definitely be back if our daughter chooses App State ❤️
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great stay. Easy to King St but would be difficult to walk due to a steep hill to get to the Airbnb but very close to many shops and restaurants. Need to be able to navigate steps to get inside but the picture shows this clearly and this wasn’t an issue for me. Great balcony and neighborhood. It was perfect for what I needed.
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Wonderful location within walking distance to downtown Boone. We loved our stay!
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,great clean stay! loved the mountain view

2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,So amazing WILL book again
2024-02-01,4,Stayed one night,the bed and the futon are super firm and hard to sleep on. the place is pretty small but it was super clean and have everything we needed for our quick stay. also right next to downtown boone a great lactation
2024-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This place is great. Second year in a row coming here for a quick Daddy Daughter getaway for snow tubing and Boone life. Probably won’t be the last as my daughter loves this place. They had games we played and a little kids play area nook. ￼
Simply wonderful!"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Will definitely stay here again! Right beside town walkable but quiet loved it!!!!

2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Catherine’s place was awesome! Very quaint and clean, super easy to get to and right off of the main strip in Boone. Catherine was extremely communicative and accommodating and went above and beyond. 10/10, will definitely stay there again when I go back to Boone!"

2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Nice, cozy stay. Will be back the next time I am in the Boone area!"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The perfect place for my roommate and I to stay over the weekend. Very close/walkable to king street. The room was clean and very organized!
2024-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"The location was beautiful and close to everything Boone has to offer, we loved our stay and would gladly book again!"
2024-01-01,2,Stayed with kids,"When we got to the place, we had no problems opening the lock or trouble getting inside, the couch had saliva stains from prior residents to what we assumed, we did not use their blankets because it had hair on it and was dirty, the bathroom floor as well as the toilet seat upon arriving was hairy and dirty, my son had to clean the bathroom just so we did not have a panic attack relieving ourselves, the floor itself required sweeping, as well as the bed sheets being dirty."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Everything was as described and our stay over graduation weekend was great. Easy walk to King St. Would stay again.
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This was our second time staying at Catherine’s place. It is just as described and in a great location!
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I’ve stayed here more than once and will plan again ! It’s very convenient - visiting App state or just enjoying downtown Boone! Very clean, feels safe, comfortable overall! Love having the kitchen option to cook to prep for our tailgates!! 🖤💛"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,Catherine’s place was perfect for our weekend get away! Great location with tons to do near by! Would definitely stay again!
2023-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"Catherine was super flexible with our changing schedule. The apartment was cute, clean and welcoming. Thanks so much!"

The place was super cute, clean, and homey. It’s in a great location that’s right off King street, so it was easy to walk to restaurants and shops. The only thing that I had an issue with was the noise from passing work trucks early in the morning. But I’m sure if you bring some earplugs you’ll be just fine!

2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a wonderful stay at the Green Nest. The location was perfect, whereas we could walk to downtown Boone. The apartment had all of the amenities you would need for a short stay. I only had two complaints, both easily resolved. The bed was a bit firm for our liking ( I knew this going in as another reviewer mentioned it). A mattress topper would have made it perfect. And though I appreciate the fancy oat milk, it is no substitute for half and half in coffee. Also, I think the oat milk was bad. I shook it up but there were still tons of particles that ruined my first cup of coffee. The French press was nice, and so were the tasty cranberries and nuts. Thanks for a wonderful stay."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The Green Nest was everything expected and was a cozy retreat in the great college town of Boone, North Carolina. The host Catherine was responsive and offered good recommendations for things to do and places to eat. The Green Nest is perfect for a weekend getaway in Boone for a couple or small family. The Blue Ridge Parkway is within close proximity to Boone and offers many opportunities, for great views of the Blue Ridge Mountains, hiking and picnicking. Downtown Boone is within walking distance of The Green Nest and offers many great places to eat and shop. The neighborhood was quiet and off-street parking was provided."

From beginning to end, everything we needed for our stay was at our fingertips. We cooked all our meals, and found the kitchen supplies more than adequate. I appreciated Catherine's eye for detail, and throughout the Green Nest, evidence of Catherine's concern for the environment. It made our stay more comfortable that Catherine had the forethought and intention to be environmentally responsible. Catherine responsiveness to messages was phenomenal! I would add that we returned to the Green Nest for our second stay three days later and were grateful that it was available."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"The place was perfect for a night in Boone! The bed is very comfortable, space private, and King street is very walkable (just a pretty big hill to go up and down). The host is very responsive also! Would stay here again."

2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I planned a last minute trip to Boone with three others to snowboard. The studio apartment was just enough space for all of us to fit comfortably and we didn’t have an issue with a sleeping arrangement between the bed and futon. The apartment came with everything we needed for the weekend and we didn’t have to worry about kitchen appliances or basic amenities. Catherine left behind extra toiletries, snacks and more, free to use. The apartment was beautifully decorated and felt like home, as well as in the perfect location. The home is located on a quiet and slow street that was only a five minute walk to downtown. Ideally, we were only fifteen minutes from App Ski Mtn and 12 minutes from Walmart and other grocery stores. We are thankful to have found such a good stay on the short notice.

As a former local, I found The Green Nest to be a surprisingly convenient yet affordable option for visiting Boone.

I also like to run in the morning, and had a fun time exploring the App State campus, as well as the challenge of the steep hills. We did have an incident where the toilet started leaking, but that was an unfortunate break that could happen anywhere. The hosts put little touches in the house that show they care about the guest's experience."

Instructions to get in were simple and the location was perfect! Had I known how close to everything the bnb was I would have planned to spend more time close by. The apartment was very spacious and there is a HUGE projector TV that was an excellent end to the day. There is a binder on the table with wonderful instructions and recommendations for things to do in town I wish I was staying a little longer to check out all the fun things to do. Defiantly will have to keep this in mind should I be in the area again.

2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great location! This spot was so close to everything. I liked how the parking spot was separate and marked off- it made getting in and out uncomplicated. The mini kitchenette was a nice to have. I had wanted to make popcorn for a movie night but there isn’t a microwave- which is not a deal breaker, but would have been nice. The shower was perfect, nice hot water with good pressure after hiking all day is the best. Communication with host was good and notes around the place helped with any extra info which may be needed. I would definitely book this spot again next time I come to Boone. I would recommend to anyone looking for an unfussy, understated, convenient, and cozy place to stay. Happy travels :)"
2022-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"Adorable flat that is a skip away from the ASU campus. Restaurants, bakeries, and shops are all within walking distance. Highly recommend this cozy little spot!"

2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Truly a hidden gem. The apartment was super clean, easy to get into and filled with some extra touches and Earth conscious items including soaps infused with essential oils and the simplicity of a French Press. *yes there was a traditional coffee maker too, but I loved using the French Press. The bed was like a pillow which led to a wonderful nights rest. The towels were plush and the water pressure was great which lent a helpful hand at waking me up from my slumber."
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Excellent place within walking distance of ASU campus and stadium. It removes the stress of having to find a parking space on game day.

The loft was super clean, the bathroom was spotless, the kitchenette had everything one would need and the bed was comfortable. The LCD projector/screen and ice cold AC was the icing on the cake.

2022-04-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Great location as far as proximity to downtown and ASU. Very clean. Only negative would be no microwave in place. There is a hot plate/burner but if you are looking to make a quick frozen meal in microwave you are out of luck. Very fair price for the accommodations.

2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"stayed here for the weekend. Great location, convenient to everywhere in Boone/Blowing Rock. Priced fairly.
If you're looking for somewhere to crash for a few days, this place has all the essentials that you would need.
If you're going up here in the warmer months, I would suggest asking the host to open the windows before you arrive or put in the window unit. It was a little humid when we arrived, but we contacted The host and they were more than willing to accommodate.
Great place and a great price!"
2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This IS your quick get-away place for 2 or 3. Close to Daniel Boone Inn, nearly atop App State University. Great accommodations for a few days' stay!"

2024-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We enjoyed our stay! The cabin was very cozy, the beds were comfortable and the kitchen was well-stocked."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Really nice secluded spot, if that's what you're looking for. The home was welcoming and comfortable. There's a few reviews on the driveway however keep in mind it is in the mountains, gravel and well maintained. Accessibility is fine driving a standard vehicle, as the host stated only during winter months ""with snow"" would the need for 4-wheel drive arise. The main access road is 20 feet off the front porch to another property further up however, we never seen any vehicles travel by. Blowing Rock is within 20-30 minutes using Old Turnpike Rd., ""gravel and well maintained"". The cabin is well centralized to all the area mountain attractions. Beds were super comfortable. Kitchen is well stocked for cooking and eating. For the coffee drinkers, there's a Keurig and standard coffee maker available. The back deck overlooks the downward side of the ridge so deer travel across the property, beautiful sight. I highly recommend this cabin for peaceful getaway."
2024-06-01,3,Stayed a few nights,"We found the cabin to be fine. The kitchen sink was dirty, there was a blood stain on a mattress cover and it smelled like someone had smoked in the cabin. The cabin is on a gravel road and the driveway is not maintained. At one point there is a concrete well on the left and the road drive drops off on the right. It is very dark if you are arriving in the evening."
2024-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,A great cabin in the woods with the most comfortable beds ever! We enjoyed our stay.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"A very quiet and well equipped cabin in the woods. Everything was in working order, and the cabin was very clean. There is enough room around the cabin grounds to take short walks in the woods. In addition, there are number of walking and hiking trails within relatively short drives. The host is very responsive to inquiries. Overall, a very pleasant day."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Nice relaxing weekend with our friends in Boone. Everything worked out really well at the cabin. Enjoyed the fireplace when the weather turned a bit cooler.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"My family and I had a wonderfull time. The cabin was very comfortable and we really enjoyed using the fireplace. We visited Boone, Grandfather Mountain, and Blowing Rock during our visit, which was very convenient because the cabin is centrally located and those destinations are not far."
2024-03-01,4,Stayed with a pet,Great area out of the way from city noise and traffic. Easy to get to local areas when needed. As described and pictured.
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay in Boone. We always do, and we continue to search for the perfect cabin to stay in with our pets. Thank you for being pet friendly!
The kitchen appliances were absolutely top notch. There were plenty of pots and pans and most other necessities. We enjoyed the outdoor space, deck especially, and found the cabin cozy.
Ultimately, the place was tops! We will be back!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Thank you very much Chris!! beautiful place, the cabin is the same as in the photos. we had an incredible time in your cabin.!! We will stay in this cabin again!! We'll see you next time, thanks again.!!"
2024-02-01,5,Group trip,"Great BnB for a getaway with friends! We loved the fireplace and had all we needed to cook for a 3 day stay with 6 people. We all fit comfortably with the beds, bathrooms and table area. The host was also great at responding to any questions and gave clear directions. Would stay here again!"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This cabin was secluded and private. It was the perfect getaway for a few nights. Would stay again.
2024-02-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Christopher was very responsive for anything we needed. The location was perfect for our plans and very peaceful and private! We all said we'd definitely come back!
2024-02-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"My family and I loved our stay here. It was my husband and I, our 3 kids and our 3 dogs (2 boxers and a chihuahua). There was more than enough space for all of us. Check in was a breeze and I loved how there was a binder of clear instructions on everything. The cabin was beautiful and very clean, beds were super comfortable. My kids enjoyed the loft area, toys, and board games. This was by far our best Airbnb experience yet. I did have a minor panic attack on the last 2 miles to get to the cabin lol, but if you’re used to driving in the mountains, or not a wimp like me I guess you’ll be fine! Christopher was friendly and quick to respond when we had questions. There was plenty to do near by and Blowing Rock is approx. 20 min away. I can’t say enough good things about this place, I definitely hope to stay again soon!"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Wow! So private and serene! Thank you for the short notice rental - it served our purpose well!
2024-01-01,5,Stayed with a pet,The cabin was awesome. It was everything we wanted. Even though there was a house near by it felt like we were very secluded. The wood burning fireplace was awesome. We felt right at home. It had everything we needed. The cabin is close to restaurants and shopping. We would definitely rent this cabin again.
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was our second time staying at Lazy Bear. I hate leaving! I think our next trip I’ll book 3 nights instead of 2. It’s SUPER cozy and perfect! There was snow on the ground bringing our 4x4 helped a lot!
Our family LOVES IT HERE. Highly recommend!!"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,The cabin felt just like home! The beds and furniture were so comfortable! The kids enjoyed the toys in the loft area and the ping pong table downstairs. Thanks and we look forward to visiting again!
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We loved staying at the cabin for Christmas. The cabin is definitely off the beaten path, but it’s at the end of a road so there was no through traffic and it’s super peaceful. It’s only a 15-20 minute drive into downtown Blowing Rock where there is great food and shopping. Christopher was super responsive and everything was just as described. Highly recommend staying there!"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We had a wonderful family pre Christmas at the cabin. It was very clean, cozy and comfortable. Great space we enjoyed the fireplace and playing games. Boone and Blowing Rock close by for any needs."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Best cabin stay we have ever had in NC mountains! You can see neighbors, but so private. Super clean, comfortable, cozy and well appointed. We LOVED the fireplace and we just cant wait to go back!"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Thank you for allowing us to stay in your home! It was absolutely beautiful. We would love to come back again in the future. Thank you!

2023-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,We enjoyed a lot!!!! Beautiful place!!!
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Christopher’s place was great for a cabin getaway. It was peaceful, extremely clean, and secluded. The cabin was also in a perfect location to be able to visit all the major towns around Boone. Would definitely stay here again!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Great location, welcoming home! The upstairs bed is the absolute most comfortable one I’ve slept in outside my own house! 😁
Everything was great - people and pets were happy and cozy!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Enjoyed our stay, was a comfortable home and beautiful area."
2023-11-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Christopher’s place was perfect! It was so cute and homey!
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"I loved the quiet! We enjoyed sitting on the deck. The cabin is surrounded by woods and although there wasn't a view of mountains in the distance, it was enjoyable to see the falling leaves and deer."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,We enjoyed our short getaway. The cabin was perfect for our family. It was clean and in a good location.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Awesome house, very clean with everything you need."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Lazy Bear Cabin was even more than we expected. The four of us and one dog had plenty of room inside and outside. It was cool so we really didn't use the deck but we did take a walk and explored a bit. We had some trouble with the tv but only because we are not smart tv savy and I couldn't remember my sign in for the apps. We saw two deer which was fun for all of us. The fireplace was perfect for cool weather. I would suggest arriving for the first time in daylight. The kitchen is very well equipped and I like the Keurig. The beds are really comfy. I can't think of anything I would change in the cabin. Boone was a bit busier than we expected but with map app on phone we were able to find our way to where we wanted to go. There is plenty to do in the area and the cabin offers peace and quiet when you want to relax. Great trip.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"My wife, dog, and I needed a “home base” for hiking and this was perfect. It took us less than 10 minutes to access the Blue Ridge Parkway from Lazy Bear! We will be returning for wildflowers in the spring!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Nice private cabin, everything we needed was included! Very peaceful. The inside was extremely clean. Would definitely recommend arriving before sunset on the first day to avoid problems finding it on the narrow gravel roads - we learned this the hard way! But very easy to navigate during the day. Christopher was very responsive. Great location for getting to Boone, Blowing Rock, and Banner Elk. Blue ridge parkway access is only a few minutes away!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with a pet,The cabin is cozy and looks exactly like the pictures. If you and looking for a location outside of Boone give Christopher’s cabin a try you won’t be disappointed. Just make sure you have a 4 wheel drive vehicle.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Great cabin for a weekend getaway! My family loved it. Christopher responded very quick if we needed anything.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Cabin was lovely and very well appointed. Appreciated the little touches that were provided, such as food and water bowls for pets."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Great mountain get away
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with a pet,This was the perfect place for us! We felt right “at home” and had everything we needed. I hated to leave to come home. ❤️
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The cabin was just what we expected and matched the pictures and description. We appreciated the suggestions for dinner and hikes in the guidebook. The kitchen had everything we needed to cook almost all our meals. We used the grill which worked fine. Overall a nice stay and was as described.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Chis was very responsive to our requests. We have to leave the cabin early due to death in the family.
2023-08-01,4,Group trip,wonderful place and will go back they should just invest in some fans to help with temperature
2023-08-01,5,Stayed about a week,"We loved our time at Lazy Bear cabin. Quiet, peaceful, in the woods, but close Boone, Blowing Rock and Banner Elk. Wonderfully clean windows allow you to take in the views of the woods. Great porch with rockers. Christopher quick to respond to questions."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This is our place to go when staying in Blowing Rock. It’s close enough to get in and out of town easily, but also gets you the privacy and feeling of being in the mountains. The kids favorite part was seeing the deer going to and from the cabin (we were constantly hushed in the car so we wouldn’t “scare them away”). Love staying here and will be back for sure."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Couldn’t have asked for more! We visited from Florida in July. The weather alone was worth it! The cabin and its amenities are exactly as described in the listing.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"The cabin is wonderful. Just go and experience it for yourself!. I’ve stayed in many airbnbs and this is up there in favorites for functionality, proximity to several great towns, and just the overall experience. My dogs had a blast running up the hill in the backyard, and we enjoyed using the house as a launching point to do lots of hikes in the area. Highly recommend!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Beautiful cozy cabin. Loved the quietness & privacy. Seeing deer was an awesome plus especially when we got to see a doe & her baby walk down the drive in front of the cabin!! We will definitely stay again and longer next time.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,We had a wonderful stay! We loved the loft area for the kids and enjoyed the beautiful views. Thank you!
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Cozy, comfortable and clean cabin! We enjoyed hanging out on the deck. Fireplace inside was nice after hiking in the rain!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This cabin is fantastic!! Exceptionally clean and the most beautiful neighborhood. It is a great location-very private, yet close to anything you would want to do! The kids loved the toys and that was a great touch! Beautiful and relaxing balcony! We will definitely be back!!"
2023-06-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"My wife and I booked this small vacation to celebrate our 46th anniversary with some relaxation in a quiet place. This cabin seemed to fit the bill according to the reviews posted. After the first mile on the bumpy gravel road, I began to rethink that decision. When we did finally reach the cabin, it didn't quite match up to the photos of the exterior. The outside furnishings were weathered and dirty. Entry was a simple process though. The inside of the cabin was clean except for some food scraps that had been left in the kitchen sink. The furnishings were beautiful. We were a little unnerved that there are no curtains or blinds on the doors or windows. It is very secluded so I guess they thought there was no need for them. Still took some getting used to. Cell service was very spotty at the cabin. Most essentials were well stocked although we only could find 3 wash cloths in the cabin. If you like secluded places down a long, winding, bumpy gravel road this cabin is for you."
2023-06-01,4,Stayed with a pet,"After a busy school year (kindergarten teacher here plus two boys that just finished 6th & 9th grade) this was absolutely what my soul needed. The peaceful, quiet surroundings, super comfy bedding & cozy couches (along with the adorable decor & ping pong table in the basement 🙌🏼) made it hard to leave. I made dinner each night & we played games & watched a movie as a family. The porch was my favorite place to be. So grateful for Christopher’s “Cozy Bear Cabin”. I hope we can visit again someday."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Nice place and nice location. Did not like that we were supposed to take trash with us as a part of the checkout instructions. Seems like a cleaning crew should be able to take care of that.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Delightful digs!
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Everything was great! It was fairly remote and quiet. 10 or so minutes until you started to reach the edges of town. convenient to Boone and Blowing Rock.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,The cabin was a very relaxing and much needed retreat.

2023-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Very peaceful and private.
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Cozy cabin in the woods, great place to catch up with friends!"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Love the rustic feel of this cabin, especially the fireplace and the back porch. Road to the house is a bit challenging in bad weather, but once you get there it's very peaceful. Nicely furnished, kitchen adequately equipped. Check what's provided. Didn't have coffee, shampoo, and a few other amenities typically provided by Air BnBs, but generally the cabin is well-equipped. Feels remote, but only a few minutes to Blowing Rock, the Blue Ridge Parkway, and other attractions."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"wonderful stay, great cabin. lots to do, responsive host. family of 4 and a 60 lb dog, all had fun. thank you!"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Well stocked, cozy, clean, comfortable, and perfect for our 2 dogs. We will happily book here again next time we are in the area."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,It was a great stay in a great location.
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Christopher’s beautiful oasis was very serene. The caving was tucked away about 3 miles off the main road which was very nice and made for quiet nights. Several deer were spotted throughout our stay. The evening we arrived to mourning doves were spotted taking a bath in the wooden barrel on the back porch. My wife absolutely loved that. Overall the cabin was very beautiful and amazing will definitely rent from him again. Thanks Chris for such an amazing experience.
2023-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Our family had a wonderful weekend getaway at Christophers place! The cabin was so cozy, clean, and well stocked! Would love to visit here again and stay a little longer next time."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Beautiful cozy cabin in the woods. The kids loved the ping pong table and playing about outside. So grateful to be able to bring our dog without the crazy up-charges. The cabin is close enough to stores and restaurants but far enough to be out on your own.
2023-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,We had a great stay in this cozy cabin in the woods! We would definitely recommend it to others!
2023-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,"My family and I loved the place, the photos were what the host offered. The place is quiet and hassle free."
2023-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Christopher’s cabin was really cozy and comfortable. Everything was super clean as well. The kids loved the little touches placed all around. The road leading to the cabin was a little scary, but it was well worth it. Great time!!"
2023-01-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This cabin was perfect for a quick getaway. It was spotless, well stocked, & very comfortable. We will be back!"
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"LOVED IT! Better than the photos or teenage soon and my 77 year old Mom loved it! Cozy, well laid out, CLEAN….we can hardly wait to go back. Highly recommend. Christopher was very responsive and easy to communicate with."
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We loved the cabin and how secluded it was, we saw deer daily. Super close to Hawksnest tubing as well as other amenities. Will definitely be back!"
2022-12-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Stay was great other than the extreme cold weather did cause water pipes to freeze. Christopher did refund some though.
2022-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Really enjoyed our stay. Christopher was very helpful and quick with communication. The house was very clean and had everything we needed. There was plenty of firewood but no starter logs or kindling. Not that we expected it to be there but just something to keep in mind if you're wanting to build a fire. We were able to go out around the house and gather small sticks before it rained, to help get the fire going. But if you're not experienced with starting fires, bringing some sort of starter log will be helpful. We would definitely stay here again! Great value and location!"
2022-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,We really enjoyed our stay. The home was cozy and well decorated. It felt very clean!
2022-12-01,5,Group trip,Very nice cabin and great host will definitely book again
2022-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,This was is a wonderful cozy stay!!
2022-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Such a relaxing and comfortable couple of days! The cabin was so nice and we loved the proximity of hiking within walking distance. Wish we could’ve stayed longer!
2022-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We had a wonderful stay at the cabin! It's even cuter and cozier than the photos. The space was great for our family (2 young boys and a newborn) but could have accommodated a couple more people as well. The kids really loved the toys available to them- huge bonus! The property is really beautiful- a very scenic drive off of the main road and very serene with only 3 hours in the area. Like other reviews mentioned, we saw deer in the backyard every day! Given the privacy of the road, it was easy to walk our dog around the area. Although we didn't take advantage of it, we really appreciated the piles of wood available should we want an indoor or outdoor fire.
One thing to note (which isn't reflective of this property, but of the area)-- on a Saturday night in the fall, we tried 4 takeout/pizza places who were not able to provide takeout given how busy they were, so you may want to stock up with a few items from the grocery just in case.
We will definitely be back to stay here!"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Very comfortable house. Enjoyed our stay.
2022-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We had an amazing time at the cabin, it was beautiful, clean, well stocked and in a perfect location. We would definitely love to stay here again! There was plenty of space for our family of 4, the beds were comfortable and the setup was perfect. We especially loved the Heron Falls and how close it was. Christopher was great in getting back to us right away. Excellent host!"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This is a beautiful home that delivers everything listed with a highly responsive host. From comfortable beds and a well stocked kitchen to excellent wifi, this cabin is great for friends or family wanting a mountain retreat. Very comfortable gathering spaces, both inside and outside. The area is also lovely, as there is hiking nearby. We even saw and enjoyed deer with most walks. Easy to get to Boone, Banner Elk, and Blowing Rock."
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We absolutely loved this house! It’s close to Boone, Blowing Rock, and Banner Elk. Lots of great hiking close by. Cabin was spotless, and very well stocked. No problem with wifi or TV service, even through a couple of storms. We would absolutely stay again!"
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Wonderful place to stay. Nicely decorated with great accommodations. Due to rain we weren't able to get out and do the hiking and waterfalls that were so close by, but found the cabin cozy and comfortable to just relax in and enjoy a nice home cooked meal and play board games. Very quiet and peaceful. Very clean and well stocked. Comfortable beds. Adequate blankets and pillows. Very easy to get to and not that far from town and outdoor activities. Would highly recommend."
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Fantastic cabin!! Christopher was very responsive, the cabin was clean and very comfortable. Loved the back porch and the party lights. Wonderful time!!"
2022-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,This cabin was perfect for our weekend stay! It was so cozy and beautifully decorated. Everything was very clean and it was such an added bonus that our pups were able to join us on our trip.
2022-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Excellent location between Boone, Blowing Rock, Banner Elk and Valle Cruis. Very clean cabin in a private setting. Well stocked kitchen. We stayed 5 nights and miss it already!"
2022-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Adorable, easy to access, all the amenities you need to cook a nice meal. The hikes near the home were beautiful. Close to surrounding towns. We would totally book again!"
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful retreat with wonderful location, very clean, and extremely peaceful . The back porch was amazing to sit in the rocking chairs in the evenings and enjoy the calls of the owls and slight breezes that came across the mountainside. The decor in this cabin was really nice and the kitchen had everything we needed. I would recommend to anyone who wants to gets away from everything going on right now in this crazy world!"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great place, very well stocked, very clean and in a very peaceful setting. Head and shoulder above most Airbnbs, and I've stayed in quite a few. Would highly recommend. One caveat though. If you are towing and/or riding motorcycles, the road to the cabin is rideable if you are careful, but does have loose gravel and is rutted in places. Also the road off the main one to the cabin is quite narrow if you are towing anything other than a small trailer. The parking beside the cabin is adequate for cars, but difficult, although doable, with a trailer."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,A beautiful cabin. Extremely clean and quiet. 20 minutes to Boone. Well stocked!
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,Wonderful cabin! We enjoyed our stay very much!

2022-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Excellent value for a more than nice place that has many extra’s.
Not a view to see from the porch but certainly enjoyed the peace and quiet and sounds of nothing but nature. Cabin is well kept, clean and comfortable for 6 people without being crowded at all.
Internet access was easy and works great, TV’s a plenty but just enjoy the quiet and leave the TV off! Would definitely book again."
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very nice. Large and well maintained. Nicely furnished and stocked. We stayed at five locations on our trip and this was the best. Wish we’d stayed longer.
2022-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"The cabin is a perfect location - between Boone and Blowing Rock! Kitchen has all the basics, beds were comfy and porch rocking chairs were awesome!!
Overall the cabin was great! Don’t miss the Hebron Falls hike that’s right around the corner."
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful place to stay and perfect for all family members!
2022-05-01,5,Stayed with a pet,This house was magical. I loved the location of the fire pit with lots of dry wood available. The beds were comfortable and the stove and oven were so fancy!
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful home in great location. Very comfortable.
2022-05-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Having traveled cross country by car from CA to Atlanta for grandchild’s birth a month ago, we needed this break! Lazy Bear absolutely fit the bill and our only regret is that 3 nights were not enough! We will be back someday. 😃"
2022-05-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Great place to stay. Convenient and secluded all at the same time.
2022-05-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Very clean home w all you need for a few days stay.
Christopher was a superhost and responded all questions
quickly. A pick up truck or a 4 wheel drive is highly recommended to reach the location."
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Talk about an experience! The cabin was an absolute one-of-a-kind. The location was remote with a few cabin neighbors and close to nearby towns like Blowing Rock and Banner Elk. The backyard scenery was beautiful. I made sure to enjoy the swinging hammocks during early morning. Kitchen was stocked full of everything we needed to cook up a few homemade meals. The rooms were clean. The fireplace was the perfect touch as we enjoyed game night and a Netflix movie. It truly felt like home away from home, and after long hours of hiking, it was such a treat to kick back and relax in such cozy quarters. If you’re feeling the need to take some time for yourself, this is the place to do so. Thanks again!"
2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay, with those comfortable beds (I like to be able to sleep in a king size bed on vacation), the rustic interior and wonderful cozy setting. Our teenager also liked to play table tennis. Those seat hammocks on balcony are a nice touch, so relaxing... I also was thankful for the nightlights in the house."
2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Nice cabin. Clean and well furnished, with most everything you might need."
2022-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Kids loved the cabin, off the beaten path. We had a great time"
2022-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,super clean and very well maintained. awesome cabin for a couples get away or for a family vacation. very quiet and off the road a bit.
2022-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Beautiful, clean cabin! Great place to stay!"
2022-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Nice quiet weekend getaway. Location was close to many hiking trails. Cabin is very cozy.
2022-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Great stay. Fantastic location, super clean. Dog friendly. Would definitely return!"
2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Super great stay! After a storm we woke up to a tree over the drive way, within minutes I had a reply and within two hours someone was out to cut it up for us! We loved the fireplace and the seclusion of the cabin"
2022-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,This is s fabulous cabin. Clean and well-located. Chris is very responsive. We’ve already booked our next stay for this summer.
2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great cabin. Very clean and in an excellent location. Host was fast to respond to any questions I had.
2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great get-away! Close to Blowing Rock and Boone. Just as described. Christopher is an excellent communicator. We will visit again. You will not be disappointed!!! Bill
2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We had an amazing trip with our 3 kids under 5years old! The house was perfect and we loved the ping pong table and play area downstairs:) Our only wish was that we had booked a longer stay!
2022-02-01,5,Group trip,We had a great experience at the Lazy Bear Cabin. It really was like being at home. Would definitely consider a return trip.
2022-02-01,5,Group trip,"Super clean cabin, love the 6 person table for games, and the cabin is extremely cozy as it says! Some friends and I got the cabin for the weekend, went skiing (excellent location for Sugar or App Ski mtn, but we took the further drive to Beech), and overall just had a super relaxing and enjoyable time at this cabin. Host is super responsive!"
2022-02-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Overall a nice house in a pretty setting. Everything was clean and in working order. The beds were comfortable and cozy. Sound does travel in the house, so if you’re there with a family it could be a little noisy. There were a couple of blips which Christopher responded to and handled promptly.
A couple of things we weren’t aware of that would have been nice to know…
Bath soap is not supplied, only liquid hand soap. Had we known we would have packed some. Seems minor, but the liquid hand soap supplied is not something that most people would want to clean their body with.
The bigger issue for us was the requirement to pack up your garbage and drive it to the local dump site yourself. Never had to do that before and expected it to be covered by the cleaning fee."
2022-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I booked this cabin for a Christmas gift getaway for my Grandmother and mother. They absolutely loved the whole trip. The location was perfect and the scenery was breathtaking. Thanks for making this trip possible!
2022-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We enjoyed our stay in this cozy cabin. Great central location from everything we wanted to do. We enjoyed the fireplace and the outdoor setup. This best part was bringing our dog along. We will definitely be back!
2022-02-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Great cabin, convenient to both Blowing Rock and Boone. Very nicely decorated, well-supplied with everything you need, including firewood. Great TVs and fast internet. Loved the fireplace, nice beds, well-equipped kitchen. Definitely need AWD in winter, as the last few miles are on pretty steep, unpaved roads. But, overall, we loved this cabin. Very cozy and quiet."
2022-02-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Wonderful little gem of a cabin!~ We had a great time and the kids loved it. It is off the beat and path so definitely you will need a 4 wheel drive or all wheel drive to get to the cabin. Cabin had plenty of towels and sheets available, kitchen had all the small appliances you would need. Christopher was so responsive and wonderful to work with. We will definitely be back."
2022-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great stay! This cabin is well equipped with everything you’ll need for your stay and great location near town, hikes and ski resorts. Christopher also provides you with well written instructions and info on everything you’ll need to know during your visit."
2022-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Wow, what a wonderful cabin and trip! From the moment that we walked into the cabin, we could tell that all of the minor details were taken care of. From the cabinet full of board games, to the firewood out back, to the extra ping-pong balls in the basement, no detail was missed in the cabin! The beds were beyond comfortable, and I have never experienced a rental as clean as this cabin was! The location was perfect, right between the ski slopes and downtown Blowing Rock. We were so sad when we had to leave and will definitely be returning in the future!"
2022-01-01,5,Group trip,"Great communication from host, easy key pad check in. Location is lovely and quiet. Cabin was very cozy and well equipped with comfy beds, high end appliances, wifi and lots of TV options. Perfect place to relax in front of a fire with a good book!"
2022-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This was the perfect secluded get away we were hoping for. 2 miles down a dirt road led us to the most peaceful cabin tucked away in the woods. We will be back :)
2022-01-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"This cabin is very cozy and decorated so fun! Perfect for 2 couples. There is also a loft for a few children to sleep in, if needed. Both bedrooms had private attached bathrooms. The kitchen has all appliances, cookware, and plates/glasses/silverware we could need. Nice big wood burning fireplace. We enjoyed feeding the deer with corn. They were always around the property."
2022-01-01,5,Stayed about a week,"We’ve been renting cabins for the past 5 years & this one was the best one by far. The entire place was spotless. We had everything we needed… from comfy blankets to a bottle opener to all the pots & pans that were helpful in making our stay as comfortable as it was. Every time I looked for something, I found it. Also, the communication with Christopher was excellent. We will most definitely return and refer to our family & friends."
2021-12-01,5,Group trip,Great host and everything was just as described. Thanks
2021-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The Lazy Bear cabin is a lovely log cabin in a great location. We really enjoyed our stay.
2021-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great host, great home, great views!"
2021-12-01,5,Group trip,We absolutely loved our stay at the cabin. It was the perfect size and was everything we were looking for. We would definitely stay here again and recommend it to any and everyone !
2021-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,We had such a great time and loved the seclusion and quietness of the cabin. Also it’s not far from both Boone and Blowing rock to be able to enjoy downtown restaurants and activities! We can’t wait to go back!
2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Christopher was great with communication. The house was very clean and the atmosphere was lovely. I would stay here again.
2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We did not want to leave this sweet cabin. So clean and felt like home. We will definitely be back!
2021-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,Amazibg cabin! Secluded and peaceful yet still close to all of the area attractions. Perfect place for our 2 young kids to explore and relax. Highly recommend staying here!
2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place was amazing! One of our most favorite airbnbs ever! Super clean, warm, and cozy! Exceeded our expectations. Would highly recommend staying here. We hope to come back and stay again."
2021-11-01,5,Stayed about a week,"The cabin was exactly as expected and even better.
So clean and we loved the location. We bought birdseed and enjoyed watching all the birds from the living room window.
The cabin was so close to everything we wanted to visit. Lots of great restaurants nearby.
We hope to be back soon!"
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Loved staying at Christopher’s place. Everything was perfect! Literally would not change a thing. Having the real indoor fireplace was so dreamy and we really felt like we got away from everything because of the privacy of the location but were still close to all the things we wanted to do. Highly recommend and hope to be back soon!
2021-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,This place was an ideal location between Boone and blowing rock. Cabin was spacious and well maintained. Highly recommend if you have kids! Great playroom and toys to keep kids occupied.
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Our stay at this cabin was wonderful! Like others have said, it feels very secluded but is close to many things the area has to offer. Grandfather Mountain was about thirty minutes away, The Blowing Rock was less than 15, and we found an excellent park nearby called Valle Crucis that was about ten minutes where we did all our fly fishing. The cabin was very clean, the kitchen was well stocked, and it had a great area in the basement for the kids (when they weren't playing outside). We used the outdoor fire pit multiple times and it was so nice to watch the sky get dark outside by the fire. The host always responded quickly, and access with the keypad was simple. If we ever head back here in the future, we will be sure to check and see if this place is available!"
2021-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This cabin is a great getaway location! It's close to Boone, Blowing Rock and Banner Elk but still feels very remote! The cabin is beautiful and comfy!"
2021-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We absolutely loved everything about this cabin. The inside was comfortable, attractive and spotlessly clean with everything we needed. The location was fantastic and gorgeous and close enough to attractions but also secluded. So fun! 10/10 recommend."
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I enjoyed a delightful, five-night stay at Lazy Bear Cabin. The quiet location was centrally located for exploring Boone, Blowing Rock and Banner Elk. The house is nicely furnished and well-appointed with creature comforts like strong internet, Disney Plus, and a great back porch for a quiet escape from the internet and TV. Everything was clean and in working order. Chris was quick to respond. I appreciate being able to include my dog on this trip. I look forward to staying at Lazy Bear Cabin again."
2021-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Great place to stay, good location. Excellent hosting by Christopher. Comfortable, peaceful.
We were surprised it was on a gravel road that would require 4x4 in winter and that we had to remove our own trash to the dump. Maybe we missed that in the listing somewhere? But if not, those details shouldn’t be surprises. So heads up!"
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The cabin and its location are amazing. Very cozy setup. Highly recommend for anyone looking to getaway.
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Cozy cabin in secluded location. Very clean. Christopher was quick to respond (we were first timers with Air BnB so had quite a few questions). Instructions and directions were excellent as well as suggestions on what to do during the visit. Would definitely stay here again. We really enjoyed the rocking chairs on the porch. Appreciated all the essentials being provided - towels, bed linens, soap, dish detergent, TP, etc."
2021-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"If you’re looking for a centrally located cabin in high country - this is it! Far away from it all and surrounded by forest, but only a 15-30 min drive to most every thing we wanted to do! We enjoyed rock climbing, mountain biking, nearby waterfalls and relaxing at the Lazy Bear on the back porch after all the fun! Cabin was super clean. Comfortable and well furnished. All we needed to cook meals at home was available. Great value for the Boone area. Comparable places seemed to charge a lot more. Only thing to note, if you aren’t familiar with mountain driving arrive during the day. It’s a short windy drive up a gravel road for a few miles to get to the cabin. The location is fantastic and everything we were hoping for during a week in the mountains."
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Super cute cabin! We loved the nice porch to hang out on at night, and we were able to sleep 8 adults comfortably. It did get a little toasty without AC in August, but night time cooled things off enough. Overall a neat place!"
2021-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Wonderful stay! Peaceful and lovely home to share with my husband, my toddler and my pup!"
2021-08-01,5,Group trip,Loved our stay here!
2021-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This cabin is perfect! You feel away from it all while just being down the road from everything. We moved our oldest into App, and it was 12 minutes to his dorm thru a backroad which avoided all campus traffic. With our two other children with us, we were able to enjoy the mountains, play ping pong and cards when we weren’t on campus. Thank you for sharing your lovely home and making everything so easy!"
2021-08-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"The cabin is lovely, roomy, we’ll-equipped. At the hottest point of the summer, maybe too warm for some visitors but it was fine for us. It’s easy proximity to Blowing Rock, the Blue Ridge Parkway, hiking, shopping, etc. We enjoyed a pleasant happy hour sitting on the back porch listen to the rain."
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Such a wonderful, peaceful place to stay for a few days. Quiet, comfy and really nicely appointed. We hope to be back soon!"
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The house was very clean and the instructions were clear. I would come back!
2021-06-01,4,Stayed with kids,Nice and private!
2021-06-01,5,Group trip,"Great cabin to stay of you are looking to stay in/on the mountians its an amazing spot. It is a little difficult to find at first. Not too many parking spaces, had a little difficulty turning my F150 truck around to leave the cabin, it's doable just have to take your time.
Cabin located in the middle of all kinds of tourist activities, so plenty of stuff to do! overall great stay and would definitely stay again as it is a great place for the money."
2021-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,The cabin was beautiful and we loved our stay. The setting was secluded but convenient to Boone and Blowing Rock. Our boys loved playing ping pong and exploring the woods and everything was cozy and comfortable. We would definitely stay again.
2021-06-01,5,Group trip,The cabin was wonderful and peaceful. It was very clean and spacious and came with all the essentials. We did a girls weekend here but I would definitely recommend it for families as well.
2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"A wonderful stay in the mountains, convenient to both Boone and blowing rock but very secluded with no traffic noise. Comfortable with all the amenities including a professional gas range, Netflix and Amazon prime, nice beds, great deck to sit on, nice shared living space. Good walking trails only about a mile down the road. And dog friendly! Highly recommended."
2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We had a great stay. The house is very comfortable. It is not too far from hiking or town.
2021-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,Beautiful cabin tucked away in the woods. Great value for the price. Would highly recommend!
2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had such a wonderfully relaxing time. The remodeling is tastefully done, and everything we needed was included. I am a morning person, and the stillness of the woods accompanied by a chorus of songbirds while sitting on the back porch with a cup of coffee-was absolutely perfect. The cabin is in an extremely convenient location both to Blowing Rock and to Boone. There are lots of great places to hike, take in the scenery and explore with or without your four legged friends. We would highly recommend this cabin for a mountain getaway!"

Location is good for walking to downtown.
Very clean. Comfortable bed.
Host is what you need! Non-invasive but very responsive.
This stay is perfect for single or a couple. More than two people is doable but better be a small person.
Note: These are not negatives in any way, just facts. If you are 6”2 or taller, be careful to duck! Also, lots of height changes(step up /step down) on entry area. Kinda of a tight squeeze, too!
Will definitely go back to this place!!!"

Initially the hosts said there would be an air mattress for the 3rd person but they had managed to get a nice twin bed before our trip - so it was a comfortable stay.

2023-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"I cannot say how exceptionally accommodating Aaron and Kelly were. I had last minute delivery I needed for my project in Boone and had to have it overnighted. While I was already checked out the hosts were amazing and helpful in receiving that package and communicated beautifully with me every step of the way so that I received it.
Even though I did not meet the hosts directly they’re care and consideration for me and my “high maintenance” issue speaks to the character of the individuals and just shows that they do indeed care.
Highest praise."

Unfortunately, a lot more places were closed on Sunday than we expected in the area and the weather got nasty, but we made it work. Usually I don't watch TV, but it would have been a nice option. Fortunately, there were some games to choose from provided by host! Very responsive and helpful.
Also, the suggestion to hike at Elk Knob State Park from our host was the best part of trip. Thank you!"

2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What a perfect, cozy spot to take advantage of a long weekend away! Aaron & Kerry made the whole process so easy and provided us with a very detailed guide to local trails, restaurants, entertainment options etc so we were able to plan out our trip well in advance. We really appreciated that they thought of everything that could make our stay most comfortable - coffees, waters, teas, toiletries, etc where all top notch and I was excited to see they had a white noise machine at bedside (even though we certainly didn’t need it here!) The bed was comfortable and the temperature was just right. It was great to be within walking distance of so many restaurants and a health-focused grocery store. We wish we could have stayed longer and look forward to coming back again!"

2022-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"I only spent 1 night here but it was a perfect spot for a quick trip. The house is really well situated and a quick walk from downtown. The night I was there was chilly but the space heater provided warmed the place up quickly and the comforter on the bed was super warm. You can tell a lot of thought was put into the amenities, from the snacks to the extra toothbrush in the bathroom in case a guest forgot theirs. My only complaint was that I had no cell signal in the unit but that’s on my provider, not the hosts. But the wifi worked great at least. I would definitely try to stay here again if I’m in the area."

Aaron & Kerry provided a great list of eateries and activities ahead of time. I hope to stay again. Thanks!"
2022-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Aaron and Kerry’s cozy accommodations were absolutely perfect in every way. Easy walking distance to the heart of town and campus (first college visit for my senior!) cleaner than most hotels I’ve been in, and if you have ADHD when you’re packing and forgot your toothpaste (like I did) or toothbrush (like my daughter did) or shampoo (we packed two conditioners. Why?? Ha) you’re going to open a cabinet in the bathroom and see that your morning has not been ruined by your own stupidity- they’ve already saved your day. :) Even down to the little things you always wish you’d have in a temp kitchen outside if cups, flatware, and bowls, like ziplock bags to store leftovers, a cutting board, and wine glasses. Oh and did I mention the chocolate? Sweet welcoming touch!
The bed was very comfortable, outlets for charging on each side of the bed are readily accessible, it’s easy to check in and lock up, and it’s quite spacious with room to work if needed (big desk and comfy chair, wifi is strong.)
There are even books and games for any down time, though no table for your card games or take out- we made do with the chairs and clever little wedge-shaped side table. If I had stayed longer I would definitely have taken a cool morning to sit out on the patio with coffee to watch the wildlife beyond the little creek that runs through the backyard. As we were packing the car we watched a mama and 2 baby deer getting breakfast.
I’m so glad we chose to stay here, and if my daughter ultimately chooses App State, I know where I’ll be staying for my future visits. No hesitation."
2022-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great location just blocks from king street and Daniel Boone inn /app state. Well lit for late night arrival with clear instructions. I appreciate the well laid out space, felt safe, secure and quiet! Loved the coffee and chocolates- much needed snack after a long day! Perfect landing for a quick visit to Boone! I can’t wait to visit again. Thanks for sharing your home!"

The hammock swing on the porch was my favorite spot to read and drink my morning coffee, I was visited each morning by a beautiful doe. We certainly hope to stay here again in the future!"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"A lovely hide away, minutes from a bustling Main Street but you’d never know it while sitting by the stream soaking in nature. Highly recommended"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is a hidden gem. Accommodations could not be any better. EVERYTHING we needed was there. Aaron and Kerry introduced themselves and we were delighted. The back porch for morning coffee was the highlight of our stay. The neighborhood was quiet. And you would not know that a family of 6 was upstairs. How do you get teenagers to tiptoe? 😁 We really never heard anything. Great location. Great hosts. 5+ stars.

Hosts are a super-kind & friendly family, but the space was very private & easily accessible.
Perfect for 1 or 2 people visiting Boone for any purpose!"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This cozy space is just as pictured. We loved the location (2 blocks off King St) to walk to restaurants & shops.

2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great little place for a stay. Very convenient to shops and restaurants in Boone. Hosts are great, very hospitable."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Jason’s place was perfectly located. Close to anything you could want in Boone. We parked on day one and didn’t touch our car again until we left 4 days later.
The apartment was as described, with one exception - the restaurant below is now a breakfast place (Famous Toastery - they have great food and staff), which means the kitchen noises start at about 6:30 AM, but they are closed by 2:00 PM, so nothing in the evening. We turned the fan on the window unit to high whenever we were in bed and it did a pretty good job of drowning out noise from the street at night and from downstairs in the morning.
This is the second time I’ve stayed in one of Jason’s places in this same building. Between the location and Jason being a great host, it’s the first place I check when I’m headed to Boone. Would definitely stay again."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Jason's place was central to downtown Boone. It was cute, clean and comfortable. I enjoyed being able to walk into the door and be right near all of the fun shops and restaurants."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great location right in downtown Boone. Nice, clean historic place."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great location! Very worth the stay. Had a great time, had a hard time deciding where to eat. Right in the middle of the action. Bring a fan to help with the road noise, wasn’t a big deal I sleep with a fan anyways. It’s an old building with lots of character which we love!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"King Suite on King Street is a great spot to be in the middle of everything in downtown Boone! We loved the historic building and the ability to walk to shops and restaurants. There’s plenty of space for two people and, my favorite, the best sheets I have ever slept on. They’re Biltmore brand sheets, yes I looked!
Our host, Jason, was very responsive. His instructions were clear and exact. This was our first time using AirBnb and it was a great first experience!
Jason explained in the description that there would be noises associated with downtown living, mainly due to the restaurant downstairs. Honestly the restaurant closed daily at 2pm and we never heard them. We did hear noises from traffic but with the location that was to be expected.
I would absolutely stay at this or another AirBnb that Jason hosted."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a great stay! The apartment looks like the pictures. The location is great- right in the middle of town. It can be noisy due to the location and thin walls, but there are ear plugs and a white noise machine. Would recommend staying here!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a wonderful stay at Jason’s place! It was perfect for exploring, Appalachian State and downtown Boone. Very clean and comfortable! We had several really good meals at restaurants right outside the door. I would definitely stay again!"

2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What an unforgettable getaway! It’s not often you are able to stay in the middle of boone at this great of a price. The place was clean and perfect for two.

We really appreciated the central parking pass and simply walking to all the destinations on king street. Would 100% stay again!"

2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We loved this stay! This is the cutest apartment with so much charm overlooking King St in downtown Boone. Easy to get in and out, we even lucked up with street parking. The location was perfect for walkable activities such as breakfast/brunch, lunch, bars, breweries, and great restaurants for dinner. I love this area of Boone and Jason’s place made my dreams come true of staying right on King St for Thanksgiving. His place is incredible! Clean, charming, cozy and the perfect stay. Jason is nice, very helpful and responds quickly making it easy to communicate if any questions arose. I would love to stay here again and would recommend any couple stay here for a cozy, romantic getaway. Thanks, Jason!"

2023-10-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Excellent location right in the heart of downtown Boone. We were able to park our car and walk everywhere that we wanted to go.
The stairs leading up to the unit are fairly steep, but the unit is spacious and has plenty of room for two people. The bed was super comfortable.
The parking spot is a little bit of a walk, but parking is so tough in Boone that it was definitely a perk to have the space.
Overall, we really enjoyed our stay and would definitely stay there again. Jason was very responsive to the any questions we had."
2023-10-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"the location on King Street was perfect, could walk to everything. since parking in Boone is tough, having the included parking pass was awesome. Being right on King Street was very noisy however, a noise machine and ear plugs were supplied, which helped a bit. the town starts cleaning the streets early, so if you like to sleep in, this is probably not the place for you."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We had a great stay on King St.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Jason was a lovely and responsive host. Apartment was cozy and modern in a historic little building. Great location right in the middle of downtown, close to campus and restaurants, shops, pubs. Will def return when visiting Boone."

Was a bit of street noise but had a white noise sound machine and had no problem sleeping. Highly recommend and will stay there again
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"You can’t beat the location! It was a little tricky unloading our car 4:00 pm on a Friday, but it worked out! We came for a football game, so not having to worry about parking once we arrived was a blessing. Kept the car parked all weekend and walked everywhere. The space was very clean and comfortable. You can hear people/traffic on King St. but it never affected our sleep. We would stay here again!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We loved the charming character of being in downtown Boone! The place was just what we expected and enjoyed it immensely.

You are in an old building which is cool make sure you can walk up stairs . Being in an old building and on the street you can hear traffic and noise.
He does provide ear plugs.
He is very responsive at all times and was a great host."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Jason’s place was a great find! Walkable to restaurants and shopping. We will stay again!
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place if you want to be close to downtown Boone in walking distance of restaurants and shops
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Nothing beats the charm of an older building and this home embraces it - the beautiful wood floors are full of character and mix beautifully with the simple, up-to-date furnishings. Incredible location in the heart of King Street with large windows overlooking it all.
Host's communication was clear and friendly.
I hope to stay again but I fear it will book up quickly!!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The perfect location, we loved being in the heart of Boone."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"On the smaller side, but absolutely perfect for two people especially when you are around town so much. Really great location too! Host was fantastic and super responsive. I would highly recommend it to others!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Jason was very nice and communicated very well with us. The building is definitely old but it was very clean and well kept. Ideal spot right in downtown Boone. It does get a little loud at night since you are downtown. Great place for a weekend getaway. We really enjoyed our stay.
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We had such a great stay at Jason’s place. He was very communicative and provided helpful instructions. His place was very clean and comfortable. The perfect location if you’re looking to walk around town.
2023-05-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Jason’s place was very clean, and right in the heart of King Street in Boone. The apartment was easily accessible. Unfortunately, we cut our stay by 1 day due to the temperature inside the apartment. The original post for the apartment indicates that there is AC window unit for the warmer months, we stayed mid-May and there was not a window unit present. The temperature inside the apartment reached 80 and we left our reservation a full day early."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay. Very convenient to all amenities downtown.
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Loved the location and character of this space! It was very clean and communication with Jason was super easy and fast.
2023-04-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Very convenient one bedroom condo in downtown Boone. Clean and comfortable, walking distance to most Boone attractions."
2023-04-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"The place was exactly as pictured, and the messages from the host were templates. This space and the experience felt built of a checklist, and not that meant some challenges and annoyances that could be avoided if the host tried out the space of experienced it through the guest's eyes. It was 40 degrees outside the day we arrived, and the heat wasn't on. To get it on in the main room we had to move furniture and the TV. The blankets were soft but thin, not designed for cold mountain nights. There was only one towel bar (with the hand towel) and no hooks for towel to be reused the next day. The water was grainy and un-drinkable, quite the suprise when brushing your teeth. It was also much louder in the evenings than advertised. Even with a white noise machine, we could hear traffic, and music well past midnight on weekdays Jason has some kinks to work out, but it's a good space."
2023-04-01,3,Stayed a few nights,"Great location. Owner was very prompt with communication. When entering the apt, a strong smell of new paint and/or refinished hardwood floors. Informed the owner immediately. No one knew the origins of the smell. Had a floor fan and opened windows and after 3 days, the smell remained. Don't know if Jason ever physically came to assess the situation. The bathtub/shower and kitchen sink are feed with the same cold water line. Very little cold water flowed. The shower was barely usable due to not being able to regulate the hot water with cold. Informed Jason and he indicated they would be contacting a plumber to assess."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a lovely 2 night visit during the week! Everything we needed was at hand and the listing was extremely clean! I appreciated the vibe of the listing with the radiated heat and polished hardwood floors. Lots of daylight and could easily be darkened with the blackout drapery. Once on site, very little reason to move our vehicle. Thank you for a lovely visit!"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place is exactly as described! It is located in the Herat of downtown Boone. Walking distance to shopping, restaurants, nightlife and campus. Would highly recommend if you like being in the middle of town!"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Came in for a concert. The Appalachian theater was right down the street so the location was perfect. The place was very clean and comfortable. I would definitely stay there again. We did have trouble getting the key for the outside door out of the lock box. It definitely takes two hands and a lot of pressure to open it.
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We loved being in the center of town!
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I really enjoyed this apartment! It was perfect for what I needed. It was clean, cozy, and comfortable. The heater in the bathroom was just what I needed after getting caught in the rain on a hike. It took 5-6 minutes to walk to King St and a little longer to walk back since the walk back is almost all uphill. The neighborhood was quiet and clean. If you're looking for a space for 1-2 people that's close to restaurants, bars, shops, campus, etc. this is a great spot."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a great time. Karen was super accomodating, the home was wonderful and the location was perfect. Would love to stay there again! Steve and Beck"

2024-03-01,4,Stayed one night,Karen was very responsive with all questions. We had to cancel one of our night due unforeseen circumstances & she was very nice & helpful with getting the night refunded. Her place is very nice & clean & as described. It was easy to find & get checked in. It was in a very walkable distance to downtown & App state but due to the pouring rain we chose to drive. It is definitely a place that is worth staying at & would stay again when in the area.
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Thank you for a wonderful stay! We enjoyed the place and loved that it was so close to town!And, Our legs got a good workout!

Overall, we had a phenomenal stay and would absolutely stay again! ❤️"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This home is a perfect place to stay for a visit to Boone. The property itself was extremely clean and inviting.

2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Super convenient location to downtown Boone and App St. We were in town for a football game and while you are so close to everything you feel tucked away from it all and can be anywhere in town within a 5-10 min walk. Nice clean space and quality host in Karen.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Karen’s place was just what we needed for a short stay. Walkable to town and Appalachian State University.

There are tons of great places to eat and drink. it is well stocked with everything you will need. Highly recommend."

found on Airbnb."

2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Location is right off the main street in downtown Boone. Beautiful, secluded, perfect if you’re planning on visiting university or hiking nearby. I was worried about the A/C situation since I’m from Florida but honestly we went in June and it was perfect inside the unit. Slept like a baby. Loved the space, super cute"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great little clean and updated space. Perfect for a couples getaway. within walking distance of Boone. Would definitely stay again.
2023-05-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"The unit was very clean; the bed was comfortable. It was smaller than I expected, but doable for a few days."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I had work at ASU and really don't like hotels - plus hotels in Boone aren't walkable. Karen's place was extremely walkable to campus - multiple trips a day (it's Boone, so it's hilly). The basement apartment was perfect - comfy couch, great kitchenette, and even a deer wandered over one evening. It's in a shared house, so there are minimal other noises, but I regularly live with teenagers and they're loud. Neighborhood is safe and very pretty to walk through. The entire place was spotless (I do yoga in the mornings) so even saw under the bed while on my mat. I will definitely stay again for work trips."
2023-05-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Karen clearly goes to a lot of trouble to ensure the place is absolutely perfect for guests. The unit is pristine.
It’s a delightful and cozy place close to the heart of Boone but, at the same time, off the beaten track in lovely wooded, secluded surroundings."

2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is a wonderful spot all around. It feels like a secluded, wooded area in the mountains, but just a short 5-10min walk to the best of downtown King Street (main area of Boone.)
Comfortable bed, wonderful walk-in closet to dump suitcases or whatever and get your own clutter/stuff out of the way.
Highly recommend it--and in fact, I was thrilled to find it available for another week when my own local place needed more time for extensive renovations."
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Karen’s home is the perfect High Country getaway. My wife and I felt right at home. Great neighborhood and within walking distance of downtown restaurants and bars.

I honestly hesitate to say good things because it means more people will want to book it and I won’t be able to get a place there!

5 stars all the way!"
