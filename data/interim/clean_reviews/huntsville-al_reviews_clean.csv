2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,A1. Will repeat.
2024-06-01,5.0,Group trip,Great place for a golf getaway. Slept 12 easy. Forgot a bag & they took car of it for us.
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I was in town for work, but It was a really nice home. I thought the John Whick theme was cool. Beds were nice, rooms were comfortable, the second floor deck is really cool, and it is not far to get into whatever you‚Äôre looking for."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great place to stay in a great location!
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Nice home, great value, good location"
2024-06-01,5.0,Group trip,Great place to stay! thank you for hosting.
2024-06-01,5.0,Group trip,Amazing place to stay at! Everything was so roomy and overall a wonderful place to stay if you have a lot of guests in your party!
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Very nice place inside & out !
2024-04-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,"The Hosts were extremely nice and responsive. Photos of Airbnb were stunning but the actual listing fell beneath my expectations. Home was quite dusty and some areas unclean/kept. Home hasn‚Äôt been dusted, vacuumed, or sweep/mopped. It was difficult to change AC/Heat on units but Hosts were very responsive. There were no towels in bathrooms. They were found in the dryer I guess from previous rentals. Restrooms were not as clean as I would have liked for new rentals. It seems as if property hadn‚Äôt been rented in a while and just a little more TLC would have been appreciated. Our guest that stayed in the downstairs bedroom had an unexpected guess (mice). The balcony was not clean at all and enjoyable for us. The neighbors seemed fine at first but late at night it was a lot of loud music played (this was during the week day). With a few upgrades and TLC this property will be keynote. I do appreciate the Host and their home. Just constructive criticism."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,we absolutely loved this home. plenty of room. very clean. they have everything you could possibly need throughout your stay already available. we will for sure be back soon.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Unique and roomy! We'll be back next time we're in Huntsville.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Really enjoyed staying here it was very convenient to get downtown and other areas west of town.
2024-03-01,5.0,Group trip,Very nice property! We enjoyed our stay!!!
2024-03-01,4.0,Group trip,"Difficulty getting in on day of arrival due to keypad lock not working. Delay in response through app to provide instructions for getting in; however, only about 30 minutes. Place was clean and exactly as described. Instructions for the AC/Heating would be a recommendation for leaving guests. Overall, great value for the area and the theme of John Wick is excellent."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The home was exactly how it was described! Easy check in and all items that were included were stocked and available!! Loved the layout and abundance of clutter free space for everyone to enjoy!!! Totally recommend visiting Huntsville and staying in the John Wick house!! It was very cool!
2024-03-01,3.0,Stayed with kids,"All and all the place was ok, but not at all the upscale place we were expecting. I did not like the fact that I was sent a door code for a lock that was known to be out of order. While the host was prompt with responding that the lock didn‚Äôt work and a key was available, I had no plans to keep up with someone else‚Äôs house key when ‚Äúkeyless entry‚Äù was part of my search criteria. For us, the best thing about it was that it was centrally located near the places we had planned to visit. We traveled with our young children and this home is not at all kid friendly. Additionally, the exterior was not clean with trash bins strewn over the front lawn. We did not feel safe in the area as people were walking up and down the street and cars were stopped in the middle of the road. While the house was ok for the one night we stayed, it needs some attention to be brought up to its upscale billing."

2024-03-01,4.0,Group trip,Good and responsive hosts. Walls a little banged up but the place is nice

2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Wish I could have stayed here longer and had a John Wick themed party on their awesome balcony/deck area. Go to the amazing restaurant Domain South while you're here. It's only 5 minutes away.

2024-01-01,4.0,Group trip,"I was very pleased with our stay,
Just checking in I had to get in touch with host bc the keypad wasn‚Äôt working and instead of letting me know ahead of time we had to call just to found out it wasn‚Äôt working at the timeüòü and the key was left for us‚Ä¶ also the shower downstairs had stopped workingüò∂‚Äçüå´Ô∏è I really think it‚Äôs was bc of the temperature outside not sure if it was frozen but the bathroom was freezing cold as wellü•∂‚Ä¶ the dining area wasn‚Äôt enough seating at the dinner table at a table to seat maybe 6-8 only 3 chairs so we really couldn‚Äôt eat all together‚òπÔ∏è..But I can SAY Theses things are somewhat minor but my overall stay was 10/10 ü•∞ I‚Äôm definitely looking forward too booking again !

2023-07-01,5.0,Group trip,A group of us came to Huntsville to see a concert at the Orion. The house was perfect. Plenty of room and beds and showers. Felt right at home. There were two chairs in the dining room that were a little sketchy to sit on and there were only 4 forks to use but besides that everything was great! The beds were comfy and the air conditioning was fantastic. We didn't spend any time on the deck because it was so hot out but it looked nice for a cooler evening. If you are looking for a spacious house close to everything then this is the spot for you. Thank you Eric and Lavena for your hospitality.

2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"What a delightful and comfortable stay this was, especially when you have two kids who get a lot of anxiety when sleeping in new places (hotels are especially stressful for them). Yet here, they told me they felt like they were home. They loved how open the living room was with the stairs going up and they could easily call to each other, see each other whichever floor they were on.
The hosts were very proactively communicative, and responded quickly.
The kids said if we come back to the Huntsville area again, they don't want me to look at other options. They want to stay HERE! Can't get a better recommendation than that! üòéüëç"

2023-04-01,5.0,Group trip,"We really enjoyed, the house was beautiful.!"
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Top notch hosts with a top notch home. Mr Wick is sharp, cool, comfortable and clean. The epitome of first class STRs. Dripping with creative design, inside and out. This is the Best rental in Huntsville so far, without a doubt. Even after nearly 6 straight months renting homes in HSV (with employees in tow). There is no competition. If there was, this probably ate them before their first client confirmed their booking. It naturally stands apart from all the rest. It‚Äôs as if the coolness reactor experienced a critical, catastrophic meltdown, blasting this home with massive doses of cool for the last 12,000 years, culminating in its current form available for our enjoyment! Unless you double the price point, there‚Äôs nothing to even compare to. I woke up the first day 12 percent cooler and 9.3 percent more handsome. Will definitely stay here again! Wish I had booked a month."
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Eric & Lavena‚Äôs place was perfect for our stay. Everything was spotless, check-in was seamless and the location was great. The upstairs deck is a great place to relax and unwind."
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Eric and Lavena‚Äôs John Wick themed house is just absolutely beautiful and unique. The design of the house itself has character and was extremely comfortable. Awesome house all the the way around and the rooftop hangout area is perfect for cookouts and small get togethers. If you‚Äôre in Huntsville, AL., I would definitely recommend this spot!

You don‚Äôt want to miss out on the opportunity to relax at this lovely oasis!"

The location is 10 min from the school! In addition to this I was traveling with 2 adults and 2 babies under the age of 2. I was so worried about the place not having enough space for everyone! There was so much space for everyone! I‚Äôm addition the this, their place is cozy, comfortable, and clean.

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Relaxing, quiet, close to downtown, Great Price. More spacious then the pictures lead on. Highly recommend 11/10."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Cute place, not big but well situated so that there was plenty of room and the master bedroom was pretty large and had an unheard of (in a home this size) king-sized bed. All of the furniture was very comfy and clean. The kitchen was huge, although we spent little time in the house and did not cook, it was a nice kitchen for anyone who wanted to do so! The house on one side of this home was absolutely beautiful and well landscaped and maintained and the one of the other side was not-so that was truly the only slight negative. Either way-it didn‚Äôt bother us and we spoke to neighbors when we took short walks and they were always very nice! I would definitely recommend this home! Oh! The second bedroom has a queen-sized bed, so there‚Äôs room for two kids!"

I connected with Michael and Jamie through the AirBnB system, and they responded immediately that it was a scheduled maintenance call."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Micheal and Jamie‚Äôs place was exactly as listed, and we had a wonderful stay! The house was well decorated, stocked, and clean.

2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"lovely cottage style home, conveniently located for our needs.
loved the bathtub. Most remodeled airbnbs only have showers. It was nice to enjoy a long soak in a bubble bath. It was the main reason we booked this particular airbnb. It really did exceed our expectations. Another great bonus was that I had forgotten my curling iron, and there was one in the bathroom with the hair dryer. This really is a wonderful little gem. we will be back."

2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The hosts with the most!!!
This was my first experience using AirBnB and I am very pleased with the service, communication, and accommodations.
I enjoyed my stay at Michael and Jamie's cozy home. I felt right at home. It was comfortable and I felt safe.
I was able to meet the hosts as we arrived at the same time. They were checking on something from the previous guests. Their sweet son helped to carry my bag inside. Thank you Michael! I found everything I needed in the house with no problem. Oh and the bed was to die for. I slept soooo good.
I would stay there again in a heartbeat. It was convenient to everything I needed, a quick jump on I-565 or Memorial Pkwy and I had everything at my fingertips. I want to try out their other property next time I'm in Huntsville.
Kudos to you, Jamie and Michael and kids, well done! See you next time."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Great stay! Just as described! Safe and cozy spot, close to downtown and everything we were doing. Thank you so much!"

2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Thanks Michael and Jamie. The place was such a great fit and so much enjoyable than a hotel room!
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"The hosts were friendly and had excellent communication. The house was free of clutter, which made it easier to keep my young children from getting into things. The owners have made good use of the space, making the house feel open and bright. Check in/check out were simple, and instructions were easy to follow."

2023-01-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"A+ Owners, but some room for improvement. Unfortunately upon arrival we found a very strong cigarette smoke smell in the main bedroom, & then we later moved the living room ottoman to lay down a play mat for our infant & found smashed & whole cereal/crumbs. Food also smeared on to the wall behind the sofa & what looked like chocolate stains on the arm of the sofa. Needless to say at first felt very dirty, opposite of the many reviews saying how clean it was. I messaged Mike & Jaime several times, who were wonderful & responsive, &did everything they could to rectify the situation. Ultimately issues were fixed minus the smoke smell coming back. Bonus: Cute place, Bed is SO comfy & bath towels were plush & smelled amazing. Suggestions: 1) To fine previous guests for smoking when there‚Äôs clearly marked signs saying No Smoking. 2) Label remotes as all 3 were left in the wrong corresponding rooms. 3) Have a deep clean after long term guests, blinds were dusty & walls/doors need wiped down"
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Beautiful house , I have stayed in a lot of Air BNB and this was one of my favorites. Whoever cleans it does a fabulous job and I have pretty high standards due to owning a cleaning business. It was a home away from home. I was 1000% recommended. They are also the nicest people & go out of their way to do what they can. Very grateful that I got to meet them!
Beds are comfy and their are TVs in every room which you don‚Äôt find a lot, also dresser space another thing I don‚Äôt find in homes for some reason. We need places to store clothes. They had everything plus more. Every cooking thing you might need . You can tell they care and are not in this to JUST make money.
We appreciate you guys!
Thank you . ü•∞"

Close to Dollar General for small items, Exxon with the best Pizza, and O‚ÄôReilly for auto parts. Property is in a residential neighborhood. There are neighbors on both sides who respect privacy but are welcoming & helpful. We had a minor issue with our SUV : no fret‚Ä¶ Neighbor to the rescue! The neighborhood is clean & quiet but not intimidating. The house looks just like the pictures (better in real life)! We had a teenage boy and an 8 year old girl who were quite pleased. My husband is a carpenter and gave the house 2 thumbs up!
Spacious enough for the four of us!
The only downside side to our trip was that it had to come to an end!
Would recommend these hosts!"

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We ended up extending our stay and Curtis was accommodating, friendly and very responsive. Great stay overall."
2024-04-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"We felt very safe and the area was very quiet. It was also a convenient drive to down town and the museum. I do hope the place is deep cleaned - it really needs some attention to baseboards, shower heads etc. the beds were comfortable, and it was spacious with 2 bedroom/bathroom social area and the added benefit of a washer/dryer."

2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Very clean, and comfortable!"
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The place was great and in an awesome location.
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Not a lot of places in Huntsville accommodated a one night stay. Curtis did. He was so quick to respond. The apartment community was extremely quiet and very nice. Inside was warm and cozy. Beds were comfortable. We genuinely had a great stay and would come back anytime. It was automatically a home away from home.
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Had a nice stay at Curtis's place...it was surprisingly quiet and peaceful for apartment-type accomodations, parking was no problem, and the space had what we needed. Having tvs in the living space and both the bedrooms was really nice."
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,I‚Äôm satisfied when the photos are true to the photos in the listing. Curtis‚Äôs instructions for entering the community and the condo were timely and easy to understand.
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Keep up the good job Curtis this place was A1

2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,My stay at Curtis‚Äô place was nice and quiet. He was very responsive and helpful. I would recommend to others.
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Curtis was a responsive and helpful host. The apartment had plenty of space. It is in a convenient location.
2023-10-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"Thanks so much for letting us stay in your place! The location was quiet and next to a wooded area, which was very pretty. It was very clean and had been painted since the photos were taken, so has a space-theme! Bring your own soaps/shampoos :)."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"It was perfect for us! We were in town for a camp with our daughters. The girls had 2 sessions each day. We were super close to the venue staying at the condo and were able to come back for lunch to enjoy some down time and the pool (which was also a great amenity). The space was nice and clean. I‚Äôm most thankful for Curtis‚Äôs quick responses each time I had a question, whether it was before or during our stay. I‚Äôm quite certain we will be back again during competitions or camps!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Everything was exactly as described in the listing. Very clean and comfortable place for my family. Curtis was very responsive and provided very instructions for the entry and check in process. I will definitely be staying again.
2023-07-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,"Host was very responsive, kind and helpful. Beds were comfortable and linens were sufficient. The big chair in the living area was broken, the coffee maker was full of old coffee grounds, and the washing machine was broken (which we discovered after we put a load of clothes in and filled it with water). After reaching out to the host about it, he made a couple of suggestions of how to fix it, but neither worked. Rain leaked into the apartment‚Äôs entryway. The kitchen was functional, with the basic necessary utensils but there were only 4 dishes, 4 coffee mugs, 4 bowls, and 4 cups, and no wine glasses or corkscrew.
I didn‚Äôt visit the on-site gym, but the day we went to the pool, the water was cloudy and a bit green so we did not stay. Location was relatively convenient: a short drive to grocery store, restaurants, and other shopping. There was some highway traffic noise outside the bedroom windows at night.
Overall, it wasn‚Äôt terrible, but it isn‚Äôt somewhere I will stay again."
2023-07-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Super convenient to the pool at Brahan Springs. Nice and quiet. Good value.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Curtis was very responsive and kind. Instructions were clear for a smooth check-in/out. The space is private and felt safe. About 10-15 min drive to downtown or Orion Amphitheater. Could have provided a few more amenities (shampoo, cutting board, pepper), but overall the space worked for a quick two night stay. Was nice to take a dip in the pool."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Love it 10/10
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Apartment was very nice and clean post was awesome anytime I‚Äôm in that area. I would love to stay there again.
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The location is perfect, especially for working professionals in healthcare. two bedrooms two bath..washer dryer. I have plenty of space. the neighborhood is quiet the Airbnb is well equipped for a long stays.. definitely 10 out of 10"
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This is a wonderful place to stay in Huntsville! It feels like you really have a home of your own. We were able to use the pool a couple times and it was wonderful and clean. The check in and check out process is very simple and Curtis responds very quickly to any inquiries. We would absolutely stay here again and would recommend it to our friends!
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,My family came down to support our cousin in his first starting game day for Alabama A&M. The location was great. Curtis home was great. It was just what we needed for the weekend.
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I came to Huntsville to be with my son during his recovery from major surgery. Margaret's place was perfect due to it's easy 5-minute drive to the hospital, it's secure parking behind a gated fence, very comfortable bedding, great shower and well equipped kitchen."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Had a great stay! Margaret was very helpful. I enjoyed the no contact and the separate private guest house. I would say the only inconvenience was parking, opening and shutting the gate but that was minor and i only noticed bc i came and went alot for work while i was there and Margaret was clear about the parking options and instructions. Overall, it was a great stay, some walkable restaurants and coffee/breakfast places. Quiet neighborhood, the place was clean, and Margaret was kind enough to leave extra amenities like travel toothbrushes, paper towels, trash bags, etc which was nice, not every place has those. 10/10 would stay again."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We stay there every year. The neighborhood is beautiful and convenient to downtown and restaurants. Pool house is just as described.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Nice place for single, couple or small family. Really enjoyed walking the historic neighborhoods to downtown. Didn't need a car."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This is a great spot not far from downtown Huntsville. Great restaurants and big spring park all within a 10 minute walk. A very clean and cozy place to stay we thoroughly enjoyed it
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We felt right at home. So glad we found such a nice place to stay. Felt very comfortable and safe. The place was extremely clean.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Margaret provided a great place to stay in a fantastic neighborhood which was close to evening needed. Fun place!
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This was our first time staying at an Airbnb and Margaret's place set the bar high. We felt at home and found everything as described by other reviews. The location was great for visiting downtown Huntsville and walking to restaurants. Would definitely choose this Airbnb if in the Huntsville area again.
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place! It‚Äôs on a quiet street and very close to downtown.
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"If you ever find yourself in Huntsville this is a great central location. Comfortable, clean, and lovely. We love Huntsville!"

2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Wonderful stay. Great place for the two of us.
2023-12-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great location within blocks of downtown area. Was an affordable space. Check in was easy but the driveway is for a single car only to pull in behind a full wooden privacy fence gate. Additional parking is on the street only. The gate opens into a school parking lot. This is a cute place but it is a converted pool house/small guest house and is all one room with several beds/fold out smaller couch. The bathroom is separate with stackable washer/dryer combo. It fit our needs for two nights but it would have been nice if we had been told in advance that the main house/yard/pool areas were all undergoing remodel/renovation projects during our stay. There were air hoses, air compressors and work equipment throughout the driveway/ yard areas when we arrived and the workers had to come running to move things so we could pull in to park. The yard is dirt with a few stepping stones to the deck to get into the space so we were worried about tracking in dirt as well. The bed was comfy though."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Our Daughter and Son in law LOVED this space. Super walkable to all the new things downtown and so easy to jump onto 565 for anything on Madisson side. Would love to book again when they visit next time! Thank you for providing a private, secure home away from home. Stacy & Chad"
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,We had a great stay! Walkable to downtown Huntsville and many restaurants and breweries. We will definitely be back!
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,I was able to ride my bike most places from the air bnb so that was pretty cool. Perfect for just me and my small dog.
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is the cutest guest house. I found it to be clean,comfortable and quiet which is what I was looking for. Old Town is a delightful neighborhood. I will stay here again"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very happy with my stay. Overall a pleasant experience for an exhausted traveler.
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,A lovely little guesthouse in a beautiful neighborhood! Comfortable bed and responsive hosts - I definitely recommend it!
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Margaret was good to follow up on messages I sent. This is our 3rd or 4th time staying at her place and we‚Äôd like to continue the tradition!
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Wonderful host. Great stay and extremely comfortable
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Loves the fresh flowers!
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Great cute & cozy spot walking distance to downtown. I would definitely recommend!
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great location. Plenty spacious.
Would stay again"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Comfortable place w/ private driveway. Lots of space and kitchen is stocked with all the appliances, dishes & cookware you‚Äôll need. Easy walk to downtown to grab a meal. I really enjoyed this place! A++"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Do Huntsville right with this place. You can walk downtown or to 5-points in less than a mile. The place has everything you need, is well furnished and nice all around. Quiet, private, clean and the dogs too were happy."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place for 2-3 people. Just outside of downtown and the neighborhood is fun to walk around and look at the old beautiful houses.
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is the second time we have stayed here, and this is easily one of the top five AirBnBs we have used.
The small house is a perfect size for two people. Parking is secure, and for a place inside Huntsville proper, it is very quiet at night. We feel really, really safe when we are here.
The Keurig was well stocked with Kroger Donut Shop coffee.
We stayed here for an event at the Von Braun Center, which was perfect. The VBC is 1.1 miles away, about a five minute drive in morning traffic. It's pretty much a straight shot from Margaret's place. There is a small Thai restaurant 1,000 feet from our door. Just walk along the tree lined street, and bingo, it's dinner time.
We didn't see or interact with our host, because honestly, there was no need. The entry instructions worked fine, everything was self-explanatory, and everything we should have had was right where it should have been.
The A/C worked great, even in the August heat.
We hope to return here next year."
2023-08-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Margaret and Patty are lovely! The guest house is actually a converted pool house and their yard is great. My only issue was the lock, they have a non traditional keypad on a screen, so no tactile surface + the numbers aren‚Äôt in the usual keypad order + the screen is VERY dim so it is EXTREMELY hard to see and put in their several-number long digit code. We were stuck in a storm getting rained on for like 10 minutes trying to see / work this lock. If you are at all visually impaired or dyslexic, this will be a struggle for you to get into. I wish I had known how inaccessible this lock is before we had bookedüòπ But the place is clean!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The home was very beautiful, private, and in an excellent location. Extremely clean and well stocked as well."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,The guest house was very cute and easy to find. Check-in was easy and the neighborhood was quiet. Very central to everything I needed. I would love to stay again if I need to visit Huntsville!
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place! Would highly recommend!
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I loved this place. The neighborhood is just beautiful! Flowering trees and nice, neat old homes. Walked downtown, to music on the park, to coffee shops, restaurants & bars. The cottage is really cute, bathroom spacious. Should this Midwesterner ever need to be in AL again I will definitely stay here again."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"I can‚Äôt say enough about our stay! The location was absolutely perfect, nestled in Old Town. We walked everyday to downtown Huntsville and had coffee/lunch. The neighbor is safe and has shade almost everywhere you walk (nice when it‚Äôs super hot). We both worked from home while we are there and the Wi-Fi worked without hiccups. Our kids were at Space Camp while we were there and it was just a 7 minute drive from the house to camp. Everything is nice and clean! I highly recommend this place!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Margaret place was excellent, this is the second time for us, very quiet neighborhood, and everything you need."

2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Margaret was a great host, and I heavily recommend her to anyone looking to stay in the Huntsville area.

2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We enjoyed our stay very much. The property was exactly as described, clean and well appointed. The neighborhood was very quiet and safe, and we would absolutely stay again. Excellent value!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Great stay! It's a very nice airbnb- well equipped and just like it looked in the pictures. Even though it's on the same property as the house, it feels very private because there's a separate parking area and entrance. The neighborhood is quiet and seemed very safe. It was an easy drive to everywhere I wanted to go in the area."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We enjoyed our 2nd visit to this home and as with the first time it was amazing, very clean and comfortable. Communication was excellent, I would definitely recommend this property to anyone visiting Huntsville and I would definitely come back to this property on our next visit if it is available. Thank you for your hospitality."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"I actually communicated with Patty, Margaret's house manager and she was very sweet & helpful. The place was just perfect for my needs. The only thing I would offer as an improvement is to leave a light on in case the guests come at, near or after dark. Also, the porch light was not working & when I took my dog out before bed it was great I had a flashlight with me."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"The Airbnb was exactly as described hence the great review. Wasn‚Äôt overly fancy, but had everything necessary for a comfortable stay. The Airbnb was in the historical district of Huntsville and was absolutely gorgeous. Walking with the family and dog was peaceful and felt safe. Loved looking at the architecture in the neighborhood. We didn‚Äôt walk into downtown but easily could have if we were willing to add an extra 12-20 minutes on the front and back end of our outings. Very close driving to pretty much anything and everything we wanted to see. Would stay here again if in Huntsville."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Traveled down to Alabama for a lil getaway and could not be happier. Patty and Margaret were very gracious hosts and were very communicative about their expectations. Very easy walk to downtown and getting around the Huntsville area was easy

They let us check in a little early when we arrived to town a bit earlier than expected and they helped us get a few of our belongings we left behind. Great, clean place to stay in Huntsville. Very private but right in the middle of it all."
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,This was a repeat visit to this house. And as always everything was great. We plan on making several more visits over the next couple months.

2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Absolutely wonderful place to stay. It's modest, but feels very spacious for two people and has plenty of amenities. Great location that's just a ~30-minute walk from downtown Huntsville through a beautiful historic neighborhood."
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is a perfectly located, beautifully appointed, and very affordable guest house in a gorgeous neighborhood. It's very close to downtown, and has private gated parking. Everything you could possibly need is at your fingertips once inside. Clean towels, coffee, plenty of electrical outlets, and even laudnry detergent for the stackables.
It was exactly what I needed for my couple of nights in town. Hopefully, it'll be available the next time I'm there!"
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I can‚Äôt say enough good things about this sweet little cottage. It was very comfortable and spotless. Located in a very nice and safe neighborhood. Patty was a awesome host, giving a lot of great suggestions for eating and entertainment venues."

2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is truly a gem of a spot. Spotlessly clean, comfortable, and with all the amenities one could need, I can't recommend highly enough. While we were only there for two short nights, this studio would be well-configured for a long term stay. The only kicker is finding the gate for access-- it's essentially on the school parking lot. Once you find it, though, the rest is seamless."
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very nice place as described in great area close to downtown.

2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Everything in the Airbnb description is on target. This place has the safest vibe of any Airbnb we've ever used.
Parking behind the wooden fence is not cumbersome at all, it's an easy thing, and made us feel like we were inside the castle walls.
Comfortable is the best one-word description. The bed? Lawd, like sleeping on a familiar cloud.
Well-stocked kitchen. Dinnerware, appliances, wine glasses, and the bathroom has a stacked washer/dryer.
Honestly, you could bring your own groceries and what you'd save on eating out would pay for the rental.
At night it was quiet and peaceful.
We're already planning to stay here again."

Margaret and Patti were very responsive and gave us good suggestions for restaurants too. This is a gem of a place and we would definitely stay there again."

2021-06-01,3.0,Stayed about a week,"I stayed at Margaret's place for 7 nights when I was visiting family in town. It was a perfect location for my needs and roomy for 2 people. The main downside to my experience was that the space was very stuffy in the warmer temperatures. There is an AC unit that needs to be on continuously to vent the space, and it is very loud. As well, parking inside the manual gate can be a bit cumbersome, especially if it is raining. Margaret responded to my messages quickly. I would stay here again in the cooler months. All the best and thank you, Laurie"

2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Margaret‚Äôs guesthouse was great! It was in a quiet neighborhood that was a 15 min walk from downtown Huntsville, and every location we needed was, at most, 20 minutes away. It was also close to a gas station and the highway.
Save for a few cobwebs, the guesthouse was very clean. There was no dust, the AC unit worked to cool down the house quickly, and the shower delivered hot water almost immediately. The bed was firm, which I like, but keep that in mind for those who prefer soft beds. The couch was very comfortable. We did not use the kitchen, but it was clean and had plenty of amenities.
This was a great stay for our short trip!"

2021-04-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"This Airbnb exceeded expectations. I was a guest for 3 months on a clinical rotation during grad school.

The gate is a potential issue for some people with mobility issues but it wasn't for me. Thankful for accepted my little dog. Bed is a memory foam, firm but not hot like most. Couldn't recommend any more highly! Pick this place üòÅüëçüéÑ"
2020-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The location is a wonderful place to stay. There is onsite parking. The location is perfect for huntsville as you are close to everything including downtown. The inside was spotless. The amenities are wonderful. The kitchen had a decent set of supplies (plates, pots, pans, silverware, etc.) The tv and internet are also nice."
2020-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I needed respite care for myself after looking after and schooling my 4 children for 8 months straight. Margaret's place was perfect for my little escape. I soaked in her deep tub, watched movies, and even baked a pecan pie using her well stocked kitchen. I ventured out to Monte Sano State Park and also to Lowe Mill. Ted's BBQ hit the spot, and the nearby market filled in my grocery needs. It was sublime!"
2020-12-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"This space is in a great location! Close to everything in the city, and tucked away to feel like you‚Äôre secluded in a little cabana. Very clean and has everything inside you could need. We stayed here for 9 days and felt completely at home."

2020-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The guest house was nestled off to the side of the home. Loved the privacy aspect. The space is as pictured. The gate isn‚Äôt too tricky , you get used to it. You have the pool view that isn‚Äôt for use by guest but you also have a front porch where you can sit out. Lots of clean linen. A washer machine and dryer in the bathroom area. Self check in and again a good amount of privacy. We liked it!"
2020-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place!
2020-09-01,3.0,Stayed with kids,"The location is cozy, but there is construction going on outside across the street that will continue for some time. The gate does not lock, rendering it ineffective. The description given beforehand, and even written on the tenant note inside, does not accurately depict the space limitations. Confinement to the porch area is not explicit, and should be, considering the area directly outside our window is off-limits. Neighbors were quite aggressive, which certainly detracted from the feeling of security. If the description was more accurate, this location is otherwise great, and u would recommend it, granted a few small changes."
2020-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We had a great time!
2020-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,This space was perfect for us. It's a large studio with plenty of room. Margaret was quick to reply to questions.

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Stayed here during an event at the Von Braun Center. It is walk-able to the center if there is nice weather. We did a lot of walking around down town. The place was great to come back to for breaks during the day and to stay at night. The living area was really nice to hang out and watch TV. We did not use the kitchen. It also had its own private patio that we would have used if the weather was nicer. Over all a great option if you need to be close to down town.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Jonathan's place was so spacious, and homely. After staying in hotels for 4+ weeks it was comforting to stay in such a beautiful private retreat in the heart of historic downtown.

2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Good
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great place to stay! Was worth it!
2023-11-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,"Cool apartment above the owner's garage, which is attached to the house. Despite the owner being on premises, we never saw him. This place is tucked away in the historic area - easily walkable to all local restaurants. Place was comfortable and quiet - except for the big dog next door. He's almost always under control, but did wake us one morning at 5:00 AM. This place is about as far from the restaurant area as Embassy Suites and the Marriott AC, just on the other side of Big Spring Park. We'd stay here again."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Jonathan‚Äôs photos described the apartment well. Because
we were only there for a short time, we didn‚Äôt really go anywhere in Huntsville besides the Mars Music Hall. It was very
convenient for that purpose. Beds were comfortable. Porch was a great place for talking or a cup of coffee."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Fantastic stay! Felt more spacious than expected, cute & quiet spot right at the entrance of old town, but close & walkable to all things downtown. Perfect location. Jonathan was proactive and gave clear instructions. Easily digestible manual inside the house. Pretty outdoor deck space with some desks that can be set up as well. Loved our stay, highly recommend!"
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great place with lots of space and super-clean! Our daughter will be playing soccer next year at UAH so there will be plenty of opportunity for us to stay there again! Thanks for the wonderful hospitality!
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Great stay! Comfortable, spacious, clean, safe‚Ä¶feel like home. The only thing that my wife complained is no hooks in the main bathroom to hang towels and clothes. But I think it‚Äôs fine. Thanks Jonathan. Will stay again next time."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Comfortable, spacious, and private. Well separated from the main residence. Clear instructions."

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay.
2024-04-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"We loved staying in the tiny home. It was in a peaceful neighborhood near the foot hills of the mountains. The kitchen was nicely stocked and we were able to cook. It was very central to the things we wanted to do while visiting Alabama...Cathederal Caverns, U.S. Space and Rocket Center, and some good restaurants. Quiet neighboorhood and enjoyed walking around the village."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"My wife and I were visiting family in the area and stayed for 7 nights in this spacious, comfortable, peaceful and relaxing home. The surrounding pine trees and the view of the mountain from the front porch was beautiful trade-off as compared to the parking lots and busy roadways we typically see outside the windows of homes in chain hotels we've stayed in previously. And yet this home is twice as nice and half the cost - and has more room, too. We won't hesitate to stay there again next time we're in Huntsville."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My stay here at the Patriots Family bnb was very lovely :) everything was as described and pictured, even bigger than I had expected as well! The temperature was easy to regulate and every amenity was easy to access. Loved the private location as well!

2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great stay at this tiny home! Patriot family left helpful instructions for an easy check-in and checkout. We were even able to call ahead last minute and check in a little earlier. The house was super clean and had everything we needed. We would stay here again!

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Pictures do not do the place justice! Immaculate and thoughtfully prepped. I have been using AirBnB for years and this property is one of the best in which I have stayed. Great Value! Best spot in Huntsville/Madison!

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The home is absolutely stunning, very clean, and looks exactly as pictured. Check-in was easy and the neighborhood is quiet.

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was the cleanest place I've ever stayed! It felt like I was the first person to stay there. There's a full kitchen with an air fryer, dish washer, microwave, full size fridge and freezer, huge sink and an oven and stove. The bathroom was spotless with a very nice shower. The place is practically brand new. The living room is cozy and has a desk if you need to work from home and a table for two so you can eat separately from your work space. There's a TV in the living room and the bedroom. It's about 15 to 20 min from downtown so it's quiet, but you can get in to the city quickly for some great food, drinks or activities. Frederick gave me some great suggestions on what things to do and see while I was in town. He is very quick to respond and even got there fast to help with check-in when I couldn't figure out the door key pad (user error lol). I would 100% stay here again and highly recommend this property."

I loved every bit of it and it felt like a home to me. Mr. Fred is probably THE best host I have had while staying in an Airbnb. 10000 out of 10, I highly recommend this place!!! You won‚Äôt regret it!"

2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"What an absolutely wonderful stay. The pictures do not do this place justice. Anytime I'm back in town, this is the place I want to stay. The hosts were amazing and answered all my questions in such a timely manner and the price was oh so nice. I was looking at other places in the area and I am so glad that I found this one. I felt like I was at home with an upgrade. Comfort met luxury in the most beautiful way. I wish more Airbnb's were like this one. 10 out of 10 would recommend."
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This was an amazing stay, very private and homey. beautiful kitchen I will be back!"

2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Absolutely beautiful and pristine. I had no intentions on staying the night but after seeing the place, I had no choice but to stay. The price was fantastic and should probably be charging more (oops)! Will most definitely stay again every chance I get and will book for family members. Thank you for the experience. Merry Xmas!"
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Exceptional ! The location is so convenient with quick access to the airport, freeway, Toyota Field & Redstone.
The condo was amazing! Great shower, and the towels were nice and soft! The bed is extremely comfortable, and the linens smelled great. I was so impressed with the kitchen. It was a dream stocked with everything you need and then some.
Best of all, it was nice and clean and smelled wonderful inside."

2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Constructive feedback??? It was honestly the best 4 days I‚Äôve spent in a long long time. I honestly wish I could‚Äôve stayed more. It was the most peaceful and relaxing time I‚Äôve had in my life in a long long time. I was sad to leave.
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Awesome stay
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Overall stay was amazing only spent the weekend and I wasn‚Äôt not disappointed. The only thing that I can say I would‚Äôve loved was a shower caddy but even without that I‚Äôd still stay here a million more times. Store was right down the street, no animals wondering at night, and definitely no loud traffic. The owner and partner were more than welcoming and helpful at anytime of the day with anything I needed. Will be staying here again! DO NOT PASS HIDDEN GEM!!"
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Extremely clean and very accommodating great area would recommend 10/10
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This unit was absolutely perfect for a pilot I had come in for training. It is close to the airport as well as restaurants and grocery stores. I will be booking these in the future for my out of town employees and guests. They have everything you need for a comfortable stay.
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,NOT in the ghetto. I feel I always book something beautiful online then it‚Äôs nothing like described and it‚Äôs in the ghetto. This is not! Very pretty building. Beautiful inside. 1 mile to Publix and 2 miles to Walmart. Very accessible and close to lots. Great hole in the wall Mexican food 50 feet from the residence. Smart TV aun living room and bedroom. Would highly recommend and stay at again.
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Absolutely love it there! It was very cozy and easy to get comfortable in. Definitely recommend this to anyone who wants to visit huntsville!!
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"By far this is the best stay I have had in a very long time. Beautiful unit, very private and peaceful.

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful units 10/10 would recommend and book again! Fredrick was extremely nice helpful and listed these units right on time!! My friend stayed right next to me in Suite C and we both agreed we were 100% satisfied.

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very much enjoyed my stay! Would highly recommend!
2024-04-01,5.0,Group trip,Fun location for the outdoor hiker!
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"I immediately felt at home in this rental; there was just something about it. It is just before the entrance to Monte Sano State Park (a few blocks).
This Airbnb is not fancy: the furniture doesn't match, the threshhold to most of the rooms are not level (bathroom is not accessible), but this one-bedroom, two bed apartment has CHARACTER. I would have loved to stay longer."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Vanessa was very easy to work with - always responded quickly to our inquiries. She was flexible when we needed to change dates right before the stay. The cabin is located on a shady, green lot close to the park entrance. Walking in the neighborhood is nice with the trees and sidewalks. We don't have kids but I could see there was plenty for kids to do out in the yard area surrounding the cabin."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Fantastic stay, just a couple of minutes away from Monte Sano state park. Vanessa was a fantastic host, flexible with my check-in, and helpful with any questions I had.
The space itself is private (I had two amazing nights of rest) and exceptionally tidy. All of the items I needed were there along with instructions for lighting the fireplace. Fully equipped kitchen, large living room, and cute outdoor patio.
Thank you again Vanessa!"

2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Vanessa is a very accommodating host, who is willing to work with people to find the best result - where everyone is happy and taken care of. Extremely mindful, and I appreciate it!"
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We were in town for a wedding on Burritt Mountain. We stayed here for the convenience. We only slept for the night and left shortly thereafter the following day.
2024-01-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"We enjoyed our stay at the cabin. Vanessa communicated clearly and quickly. The house was very clean and the bed was comfortable. Our dog was welcome, too!"
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,We had a wonderful stay at Vanessa‚Äôs place. The cabin is just as described and was perfect for us. The surrounding area is beautiful. Looking forward to coming back with more time next time. We would definitely stay here again.
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"5 stars doesn‚Äôt do our stay justice!
Vanessa could not have been a better host to me + my family. We came up for a few days to experience a snow day or two and ended up staying the week due to closed roads. Not only did she offer to let us use their washing facilities since we extended our stay but they offered to grab us supplies from the store + even let our kiddos use their sled!
Can not say enough wonderful things about this stay, the hosts, the area, and the memories we made here!
Adorable little getaway! ‚ù§Ô∏è"
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Vanessa‚Äôs getaway was perfect! The space was amazing, the fireplace was wonderful, and Vanessa was the perfect host! While we were there a winter storm rolled through and Vanessa was extremely communicative about the situation. We would highly recommend this location and will be back to enjoy everything Vanessa‚Äôs place has to offer!"
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We SO enjoyed our stay at Vanessa‚Äôs cottage and will definitely be booking again when we return to Huntsville in the future. The location can‚Äôt be beat, especially if you‚Äôre planning on exploring Monte Sano Park. My husband was running a race at the State Park and was easily able to jog down to the starting line from the cottage.
The cottage was clean and cozy and we were happy and comfortable our entire stay! Vanessa was proactively communicative and quick to respond to any questions we had. She was able to give recommendations for food and was just so lovely to chat with when we met in person during our stay. This was truly a gem of a find for us and our kiddos and we look forward to booking with Vanessa again!"
2024-01-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,This was our second time staying here. Vanessa makes it cozy and check in is a breeze.
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Second time staying, just as great as the last time."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was an incredibly peaceful retreat. Vanessa added some Christmas cheer to the space before arrival and helped ensure the space was warm and cozy prior to arrival. She was incredibly responsive, recommended a great hike and sunrise overlook, and made me feel at home. Thank you!"
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Have had multiple visits here. Always been a great place to stay. The cozy comforts and the privacy of the mountain is a big win. Vanessa is a great host and so helpful if you need.
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Great place, super homey and comfortable. So much great hiking close and also right around the corner from five points and the rest of the downtown area. Really enjoyable stay."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Unfortunately, we were only there for about 12 hours because we had somewhere to be at 7 am. I would love to come back and enjoy this location for an extended time! It was a perfect, quiet spot at a great price."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"As avid outdoor enthusiasts, we usually prefer to lodge at state parks when exploring a new area. We needed a pet-friendly cabin, and there were none available at Monte Sano State Park, so I looked around and found Nolen cabin on AirB&B. It was perfect! We were so excited to see deer in the backyard as we pulled into the driveway. Later, we fell peacefully asleep in the warm, cozy bed after spending an evening by the fireplace.
We enjoyed exploring Monte Sano State Park, which is just a few minutes down the road. And it was easy to get down the mountain and into town for meals and exploring the city. That said, it was so nice at Nolen cabin, we opted to eat supper there every night and just relax by the cozy fireplace instead of going into town.
I‚Äôd also like to note that Vanessa and her husband were super friendly and helpful. Looking forward to our next visit to Huntsville! We would definitely stay at Nolen Corner again!"
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"My Family and I only wished we had more time to spend at Vanessa's cabin! We loved the woodsy atmosphere, birds chirping, and peaceful environment. We would absolutely visit again!"
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,we were very happy with our stay at the cabin. The location was close to the state park and we walked in to go hiking. The drive into Huntsville was barely 15 minutes. so nice to be away from city close enough to get in food and coffee. We would highly recommend the cabin for anyone who wants to be in a quiet place in nature.
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great location and a cute artsy place with well thought out items. We appreciated our time and accommodations here.
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Small space, perfect for a couple to get away. Great host. Easy check in and cozy little cabin. Worth the price."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Great atmosphere
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We had a good stay on Monte Sano, we don‚Äôt live far from Huntsville but have always wanted to stay on the mountain. We enjoyed this stay.
I will say that the cabin is not actually a cabin- it was nice but we just weren‚Äôt aware prior to our arrival so I wanted to tell others coming after us."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Vanessa was so accomodating, we couldn‚Äôt ask for a better space while we were visiting family. It was cozy and the fall decor was on point."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This place is very peaceful and cozy , I enjoyed my stay very relaxing and the place was just so homey !!! Definitely would go back"

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Vanessa‚Äôs place was amazing! Quiet, cozy, peaceful and beyond comfortable. Pet friendly, which is a big plus. Vanessa went above and beyond when we needed to check in early for my husband‚Äôs meetings. She allowed us to use one of her other places as a work space until ours was ready for us. We are in Huntsville quite often and will make this our go-to place. Thanks for your incredible hospitality Vanessa!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Okay, after staying at Vanessa‚Äôs we are ready to move to Huntsville. This location is so amazing. The state park is right down the road. They have great disc golf, hiking with beautiful views, and will be a great spot for birding. Our dogs were very comfortable and loved walking the neighborhood. We were surprised at how much cooler temperatures were up on the mountain. I think it dropped 6 degrees from the base of the mountain to the top.
The best part of the trip was how incredible Vanessa was. She treated like royalty! We can‚Äôt wait to come back."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great stay right outside Monte Sano. Well kept and cozy place.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,I was attending a wedding and several parties on The mountain and this place was perfect. It is a rustic cabin and is just steps away from the state park for hiking adventures --or an early morning walk through the beautiful neighborhood. The bed was very comfy and the kitchen was well stocked. Vanessa was truly a super host and responded to all my questions quickly. I will be going back.
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Incredible place! I will be coming back to their place when I want to go back for another visit in the mountains. My only suggestion is we had to get creamer and sugar for coffee, so that might be nice to have. But that‚Äôs the only flaw, and it‚Äôs even a not a big deal! Beautiful, serene, cozy, peaceful, and welcoming! I highly recommend! You‚Äôll enjoy your stay!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,This place was amazing! Received a message several hours prior to check in time letting us know that we could check in whenever we were ready. From the moment we walked in we smelt a fresh clean aroma. All of the linens smelt very clean. It felt like an old English cottage. Could not ask for a more perfect location the spend our evening.
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Vanessa‚Äôs place was perfect for our quick weekend trip! The location is AWESOME if you‚Äôre looking for something quiet, peaceful, and in nature that‚Äôs away from the bustle but just a short drive from great restaurants, coffee shops, walking trails, shopping, etc. The cabin itself is also nice. It felt quaint and cozy with all the standard amenities you‚Äôd have in a hotel room but without the ambience‚Ä¶streaming channels, internet, a/c, full kitchen, etc. Vanessa was also a wonderful host. She was responsive, helpful, engaging, and so accommodating. She checked on us throughout our stay to make sure we had everything we needed. I come to Huntsville frequently and will definitely plan to stay at Vanessa‚Äôs again!!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Vanessa is a great host with an awesome setup in Monte Sano! Very convenient to the state park, Huntsville, and plenty of great local restaurants and shops. Would definitely recommend!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We stayed a night in Huntsville and this was a cute, comfortable, and quiet place to stay. Everything was as described and Vanessa went over the top to make sure things were perfect for us! The bed is comfy and the living and bedroom are spacious. We didn‚Äôt need the kitchen, but it had everything. The bathroom was small, but worked fine. One thing to note-there is no AC unit in the bedroom. It is in the living room, however this wasn‚Äôt a problem for us. I usually sleep Iike a polar bear but had no issues being hot while I slept. The drive up to the place is beautiful and the neighborhood was quiet and safe. It‚Äôs about a 20 min drive from Bridge Street, where we ate, which was fine for us. Overall, a great experience and we would stay here again."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Our stay in Huntsville was exceptional. Provided a week of much needed downtime in a super quiet area...yet only minutes to everything Huntsville has to offer. The cabin was great - exactly as pictured - and Vanessa was so friendly, ensuring our needs were met. Would definitely stay here again should we find ourselves in northern Alabama again."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,We‚Äôve been using Airbnb for over a decade. Vanessa is by far the best host we have ever dealt with. Awesome location in a great neighborhood.
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We very much enjoyed our stay. This wasn't a crowded hotel, but a nice rustic home in a mountain community in a forest near a state park. Many restaurants were within a 15 minute drive. Many cool attrctions were within a short driving distance; the U.S. Space and Rocket Center, the Huntsviƒ∫le Botanical Gardens, the Monte Sano State Park walking trails (attractions we visited). I played in a disc golf tournament and for disc golfers there are many outstanding courses in a 30 minute radius from wheee we stayed. Most of all it was peaceful and quiet. If I had any criticisms, they would be that this is an older house and it is rustic. It was a little musty when we arrived, but once the air was moving (fans and A.C.) it was just fine. The home was nicely furnished, clean and comfortable. We are not big Airbnb people, but it was a good introduction. We had very good instructions on the whole process of arrival, check-in and check-out. Thank you, Vanessa."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great stay
2023-05-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Vanessa was a great host. Close to Monte Sano hiking! We'd probably stay again with some easy fixes from the host.
Likes:
-Location
-Easy parking and check in
-Very Clean
-Private entrance
-Lots of lighting
-Awesome washer/dryer
-Safe neighborhood
-Lots of pillows
Dislikes:
-Bathroom window needs a curtain/covering for top half. It faces backyard but it makes your bathroom use not feel private.
-We encountered bugs in space. We had a wasp/hornet in bathroom and one in bedroom and some other bugs.
-Mattresses could have been better on both beds. They were old and unsupportive.
-Shower stall was confining and narrow in bathroom. Probably OK for smaller person.
-You have to step into certain areas of space you want to access. Understandable for an older building but just pointing it out for other guests."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We want to thank Vanessa, because after a long day of traveling, she saw we hadn‚Äôt checked in yet and turned the lamp on inside so we could locate it easily. She was easy to reach and very responsive to messages. Very attentive host. My family and I really enjoyed our stay. Will stay again when in town."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We were in a bind due to my booking mistake and Vanessa was amazing! The Cabin was lovely, the bed very comfortable, towels big and fluffy, and she was a smiling friendly hostess! Monte Sami mountain is a beautiful location! We had a great stay while we were in town house hunting! Thank you so very much Vanessa!"
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Had a wonderful stay. Beautiful location and the house was perfect for a weekend spent exploring Mt. Sano and Huntsville.

2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,My stay at Vanessa‚Äôs place was perfect! Very friendly and responsive host and the house was just as described. Would definitely stay again if I ever visit the area in the future!
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Vanessa was very accommodating and responsive when we needed this place last minute due to an emergency. It was very clean, and as others have said cozy. The living spaces were also roomy. The surrounding area and nearby state park were also nice for the dog walks. Would not hesitate to stay again."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great host‚Äîalways thought of how to improve the quality of my stay!
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Friendly host and perfect little place to stop for the night or a long weekend!
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Very cozy and accomodating. Rustic cabin feel with good towels,plenty of hot water and water pressure. Thank you Vanessa!"
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,The place is very cozy and nice! Being in the mountains was a huge plus too.
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The cabin was cute, comfy, and cozy! Super easy to find, because Vanessa gave clear and helpful instructions. The whole house was spotless! There was everything I needed for a comfortable stay, and more! The outdoor area is packed full of seating, and was great to kick my feet up after a day of hiking. The neighborhood is adorable, and within walking distance of hiking trails. I appreciate all the extra little details added in the house. Wifi worked great!"
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We are a traveling band So we visit lots of towns. This place was perfect for us sleeps 4 nice quiet neighborhoods We actually wrote a new song outside enjoying the peaceful surroundings. Thanks Vanessa you Rock........J
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"My family all felt right at home from the time we arrived. It is a relaxing location with lots of activities within a mile of the cabin. The neighborhood is walkable and safe to ride bikes.
Vanessa was proactive in making sure we had everything we could possibly need.
It was cold when we arrived, so she turned on the gas fireplace and space heaters before we got there. She ensured we were nice and toasty! The cabin is a little older and more rustic than I originally had thought, but still very comfortable. It is updated with nice furniture and art.
The bed was comfortable and all the linens/towels/ dishrags, etc. were fresh and clean. And soft! It was very helpful to have the shampoo, conditioner, hair dryer and coffee already there. We are already planning to come back this summer!"
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We needed a quick place for a four day mini vacation and wanted to stay away from hotels and loved the fact that this was in the mountains near a state park. Vanessa's place is clean and equipped with lots of linens, pillows, heaters, books, games, and kitchen stuff. Vanessa made herself available all the time, even though we never needed her.
I do have to point out that the bathroom is small and has two steps down. We were fine with it, but for my husband, who's 6'4, it was tight. Other than that it was fine, but anyone with size issues or a handicap might find it difficult.
We enejoyed our time at Vanessa's and we'd stay here again!!!"
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Wonderful, cozy spot in monte sano! Super helpful and nice people, would stay again!! Vanessa was proactive, responsive, made sure we had everything we needed. Book this spot if you love forested hikes and cozy cabins :)"
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"This is a WONDERFUL spot! It's cozy but spacious. Very, very clean. Large bedroom with a very comfortable king-sized bed. Complete kitchen for cooking, and the bathroom was spotless.The fireplace is the icing on the cake, though. A welcoming and comfortable atmosphere with a rich history greets you as soon as you walk in. The entrance is very private and looks out to a woodsy lot that disguises the fact that you are a 5 minute walk to the State Park and only an 8 minute drive to the charm of downtown 5 points for any necessary shopping. If you choose to walk around, you won't find a friendlier neighborhood. Vanessa is a proactively considerate host that has anticipated your needs and is also very quickly responsive to her guests. You will add this stay to your list of return visits!"
2023-02-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,Nice quaint apt unit that is a section of a house so other parts of the house are also units and rented to other guests at the same time. The unit has thin walls and not private so do not expect a completely quiet place if you are looking for an isolated destination or have children-babies. The host is lovely.
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I ran a trail race at Monte Sano Park and Vanessa‚Äôs place is 30 seconds away. The fireplace is a staple and kept the place warm during the cold weather. I found the bed and pillows comfy, and it had everything I needed. Vanessa also provided local recommendations. Just note if older/injured the bathroom level does have a couple steps down. I loved my stay and couldn‚Äôt have asked for a better place to stay on the mountain."
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I love all 3 of Vanessa's places, but this one has a fireplace, and I just loved it. I would stay in any of them, but this one is my favorite. You cannot go wrong with any of these places. The linens smell lovely. There are books to read, and plenty of room to spread out. The TV is nice, and the kitchen is perfect for a get away. I loved the big comfy leather recliner too. Every piece is well thought out. Very nice experience, and Vanessa is a top notch host."
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Loved where the place is located. Quite neighborhood. Not far from downtown. And lastly loved the owner was right there for ANYTHING you needed!
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Vanessa‚Äôs place made for a great trip. The location is just fantastic‚Äîit‚Äôs easy to get to, is in a very quiet and walkable neighborhood, and we were able to ride bikes right from the house over into Monte Sano State Park. Vanessa was always super quick to respond to any questions and was just plain pleasant and easy to work with."
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,The cutest little place to stay! We were only there for a night but wish we could have stayed longer. Vanessa is so helpful and friendly if you need anything at all! We would love to come back when we can stay longer
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Great hosts in the best neighborhood in all of Alabama. This is an historic Viduta property blocks away from Monte Sano State Park and Old Chimney Rd, which has a fascinating history (see Old Monte Sano Hotel). The units here are quaint with all the amenities a cabin at Monte Sano State Park would have but with more room and an at-home feel. We made new family friends & look forward to our next visit. Happy New Year 2023!"
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Vanessa was the perfect host. Place was perfect.
The extreme weather conditions caused a few hiccups but, where others would have canceled us, Vanessa was on the phone getting everything bask to perfect. She definitely went above and beyond.
Place is wonderful, very clean and cozy.
Vanessa‚Äôs place is our only place we will stay when we‚Äôre in the area"

2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Great experience witt Vanessa and her adorable rental atop Monte Sano. So convenient to the state park and just minutes from downtown. She went to great pains to accommodate us early.
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"A friend and I used the cabin for our 1-night getaway. It was perfect! The feel of the place, inside and out, is so cozy. Vanessa was very friendly and accommodating. Our favorite part was the fireplace! We hiked the trails at monte sano and it was just a few minute drive from the cabin. The cute downtown area was only a 12 minute drive. The neighborhood was quiet and safe. Vanessa‚Äôs directions are thoroughly explained which made it easy to know exactly where to go. We can‚Äôt wait to book again next time!"
2022-11-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"Vanessa‚Äôs place is wonderfully appointed, with attention to detail. The location is perfect for those appreciating the mountains, the outdoors, hiking, and scenic views of the city. She was a very responsive host, and I enjoyed my stay very much."

2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Vanessa does extra touches to make you y feel very welcome!
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place was easy to find and a cozy little getaway. The gas fireplace was nice in the evenings as well as the outdoor fire pit. Communication was fast and friendly from start to finish. We would absolutely stay again. Also, for good southern BBQ lovers, Ted's BBQ was quite the treat for dinner while we were there and was only a few miles away."
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Everything is just as described. Easy to get to the state park and surrounding restaurants. Quick 10-15 minute drive to downtown and Space Museum.
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Very cozy little place to stay for a while! We enjoyed our time very much.
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Everything was so easy. Needed a place to stay so we could spend the day hiking Monte Sano, and this location could not have been more perfect. Communication was great, and instructions were all clear and easy. Will look at renting this again in the future with a group of other people, and look into renting all units at once!"
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My family and I really enjoyed our stay at Nolen cabin. Cute, clean, and wonderful location. Vanessa was a great host who made sure we had everything we needed. Definitely recommend if you are in the area!"

Vanessa was extremely accommodating kind and their home made me feel very comfortable."
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We so enjoyed our stay at Vanessa's cottage. The location for what we were looking for was great! We had never been to the mountains so, it was a first for us. The cottage was very cute, cozy and comfortable. Vanessa's was a very prompt and wonderful host!"

2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Great, quiet location and it is a very quaint cabin. No cell service but the Wifi worked great!

2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Another wonderful stay in this cozy cabin! Appreciate the convenient location, clean, comfy accommodation, and hospitable hostess!"
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Vanessa‚Äôs place is exactly what you see. Beautiful location, peaceful extremely comfortable so many things to do and the State Park is just a very short beautiful walk up the road. She also provided so many little attention to personal comfort details. Nice extras like lavender pillow spray to help you rest, great quality shower products and all.
Vanessa is beyond anyone I have rented from before. We were over 6 hours late getting in because of our delayed flight and a two hour drive. She kept in contact with us, mainly to make sure we were alright! She was attentive to anything we wanted and so friendly (she literally live a few hundred feet away).
Cabin was great we just requested it for Christmas today, so that should give you an idea of how much we enjoyed Vanessa, her husband and the cabin.
I can only give 5 stars, but our hosts alone deserve much more than that."
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,The perfect place to relax and unwind in the beauty on the top of the mountain. Loved drinking my early morning coffee outside with the singing birds and once even a deer! With downtown and Redstone so close there is so much to do and see in the short drive down.
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Loved staying at this beautiful cabin on Monte Sano! The owner was accommodating, communicative, and friendly. Clean, cozy space with plenty of room to work, cook, relax. Enjoyed short walk from the cabin to the State Park to hike the trails! Lovely stay!"

2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We loved this place! It was so charming, pleasant and peaceful. The host went over and beyond making sure we were comfortable and had everything we needed and more! We loved the proximity to the state park. It was literally less than a 2 minute drive, we could have easily walked it and still had plenty of energy to enjoy the park. We will definitely be back to stay at this adorable rental!"
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"A great place to stay. dog friendly and right next to the entrance of the beautiful Monte Sano state park. we even saw deer walking through the yard one morning. 15 mins to get downtown to the art museam and restaurants. Vanessa is a wonderful host, thoughtful and easy to reach if you need something. I loved all the sitting areas in her yard too. lovely peaceful neighborhood."

2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Our stay at Vanessa‚Äôs place on the mountain was so quiet and peaceful. It‚Äôs nice to find a place where we can bring our corgi loaf with us and and leave him in puppy care. Squirrel and bunny watch off the patio area, and we loved just sitting and listening to the sounds around us at night, very peaceful.
Plenty of room in the bedroom and living area for two people and their fur baby, you could easily add another person or two in the mix. There has been a lot of attention to the decor and details to make your stay here a relaxing one. Vanessa was quick to respond to any questions we had, she was so friendly when she greeted us when we arrived at the cabin.
The cabin is an easy drive down the mountain into Huntsville where you‚Äôll run into the hospital area, Starbucks, Chick-fil-A, Publix, and a close drive to Lowe Mill arts, Botanical Garden, Space & Rocket Ctr and many other things Huntsville has to offer.
Vanessa‚Äôs cabin is definitely a place that has a history in the area and to stay there makes you want more!"

the little things, like the soft throws, just added to the coziness of the home.
We were traveling with our rescue dog and the securely fenced yard and dog dishes were a huge bonus!

2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Nice place
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,It was a perfect house. The back porch needed a light because I couldn‚Äôt see my dog well at night and he loves to play. I was unsure about the neighborhood at first but it ended up being fine with no issues. Very home-like vibe.
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Justin's place was great for my needs. It was clean, in a good location, and spacious enough to work from. I was happy to stay here."

2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"I stayed here while in town for training for 2 weeks. Good sized for me & my 2 dogs both weeks along with a colleague and her cat the first week. Backyard was a good size for the dogs to run around in and although there were several neighboring homes with fences, there were no other neighboring dogs to cause fence aggression. It had all the basic supplies we needed and even kept me cozy while iced in for 4 days. It‚Äôs an older, modest neighborhood that is well-kept and quiet. It met my needs very well and the host was always very responsive even as I wondered if I‚Äôd need to extend my stay due to the iced roads."
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Great location. Close to Stovehouse and downtown. There is a neighborhood market about 2 minutes away so it's easy to stock the fridge and not have to eat out every meal. Host responds very quickly.
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Great place to stay with dogs! Nice fenced in yard, though gate only has a latch so if your dog likes to open gates bring a lock or carabiniere for the chain. House was cute and clean. We didn‚Äôt stay long enough to explore the area but it fit all our needs well!"

2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"A great place for me and my colleague to stay for our brief business trip to Huntsville. Quiet, comfortable, clean, well equipped and good location for getting to our appointments and eating out in the evenings. Nice decor. Thank you Justin."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"It definitely was a great deal for this place. It felt very homey & the area was peaceful with no type of distractions providing a great opportunity to relax. Restaurants were easy to get to as well as Walmart was right around the corner.

Traveled with spouse, 9 year old son & 2 dogs and it was just what we needed. Close drive to plenty of Huntsville attractions and restaurants. Not the place to stay if you‚Äôre looking to be in the thick of nightlife or walking to restaurants/bars, or want lots of amenities, but worked perfectly for us. Clean and tidy home, and having the washer/dryer available was nice. The neighborhood is solidly working class, not particularly upscale in any way, but was quiet and seemed safe. The host was friendly, flexible and communicated quickly when needed. I‚Äôd recommend this home for a simple and affordable place to stay."

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great duplex AirBnB, in a good location for being close to downtown. Easy to find and park. I loved the pre-check in YouTube videos that James sent our way to make it even easier to navigate and a how to use the shower. Speaking of which, the shower was perfect easily the best shower situation I have experienced.
The only downsides were I thought the bed ran a little soft and hot, so a better mattress would send this AirBnB to a top tier stay. Otherwise, I had a great time and would stay again."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is my second time renting here. I‚Äôm in the local area, but for an intense annual virtual masterclass I like to get away from my home office and home front.

As an Airbnb, the place was very nice. Couldn‚Äôt really ask for much more.
I don‚Äôt recommend this, and James would probably not enjoy seeing this - but I did check out a few minutes late and James was very understanding.
No fluff - the stay was great!"
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is a great spot, highly recommended for a couple or single person . This was my 1st time flying in almost 20 years. I flew from Boston to Nashville then drove to Huntsville! The location. Is great, very close to downtown, nice parking spot right outside the door. Amazing spa shower! The bed was super comfortable! And to make it even better they had the good toilet paper.(I brought my own, but didn‚Äôt need it as they already had the same;-) I wouldn‚Äôt change a thing. Rent this house, you will not be disappointed!"
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Loved this Airbnb! We rented during the winter storm so we would be closer to work. It was perfect! Cozy, comfy and warm, and loved our dog was able to stay with us. Will definitely rent again. Oh, and the shower is amazing!"

2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was a fantastic place to stay. The host was super attentive, and very nice. James even made a YouTube video going over all of the features of the apartment, which was super helpful because of all of the cool tech and equipment. I was absolutely obsessed with the dishwasher, which I know is a really funny thing to say. Also love the electric stove and gave me a really good idea to make my own. And don‚Äôt even get me started on that shower. Obsessed. I totally understand why it‚Äôs mentioned in so many of the reviews now. I don‚Äôt think I have ever showered before that shower. Overall, just a really clean and great place to stay."
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Was a fantastic stay, will be staying again"
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Very much enjoyed our stay! James was very attentive to anything problems or questions we had.

Our only regret was that we didn't stay longer."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,What an amazing stay my husband and I had visiting family in Huntsville. Perfect size for just the two of us! My husband LOVED the shower!! The place was clean and centrally located. We will definitely book again when we‚Äôre in Huntsville.

2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This place is great! James was very responsive and provided great recommendations. Would definitely stay here again!
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was an absolute gem of a find for Airbnb. I was in Huntsville for a wedding, and this was a perfect location. It was easy to get to all locations and explore all that Huntsville has to offer. Moreover, the Airbnb itself has all the amenities you could hope to find: a beautiful kitchen and living area, pristine bathroom, and comfortable place to rest. Access was easy, and James was a brilliant host. I would definitely stay here again!"
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Had a great stay! Will definitely stay again when in the area.
2023-11-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,"James‚Äô place was clean and updated ,overall, a nice little place. There wasn‚Äôt very much to it in size, but had nice amenities. The stay was good, with nice touches, even a treat for our dogs and a few beers in the fridge(thank you). I just think it was a little overpriced compared to other stays we have had with similar prices."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I would literally rent this place just to take a 15 minute shower. But aside from the gloriously fantastic shower everything about this place is perfect. From the kitchen, sitting room, bathroom, and bedroom to the little details - framed pictures of local recommendations, 2 complimentary local beers, the responsiveness of the host when we locked ourselves out (sorry ‚Äòbout that), and the nice little welcome card.
I found myself googling tables, couches, lighting fixtures, appliances, and design ideas, so I can replicate the place in my home.
So needless to say, if you are in the Huntsville area and need a cozy place to stay (or just a 15 minute shower), stop searching Airbnb for other options and book this place if you can."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Great stay! Loved the location, very comfortable, great amenities! James was very responsive and helpful. Will be back!"
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Thoroughly enjoyed our stay in Huntsville! Loved the masculine chic vibe of this space. The master shower was amazing. Kitchen had everything we needed to cook a fine dinner and breakfast. Bed was comfortable. Space was clean and perfectly cozy for two. Street was quiet. First time I‚Äôve had a host provide instructional videos for entry and appliance use. They were professionally done and very helpful. We took a short Uber to a local music venue and walked back home afterwards. Would 100% stay in another one of James‚Äô spaces. 10/10.
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This place was fantastic! And the shower ‚Äì ‚Äì my goodness ‚Äì ‚Äì the shower! That‚Äôs worth the price right there. It had everything I needed for an ‚Äúat home‚Äù stay. James is an amazing host. I would highly recommend staying at his place!
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great place for my stay. Excellent suggestions cleverly displayed as framed posters in kitchen. Made it easy to navigate the best spots as a local. Great breweries, restaurants and coffee very close. Immaculate apartment with great appliances and very thoughtful touches."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We just completed a two week road trip. Stayed at a few Airbnb locations and a few hotels. James's place by far was the best. Nice, cozy, clean, great amenities, great communication. Can't go wrong staying here. Has to be said that the shower was the best of any hotel or Airbnb we have stayed at.

I would stay there again in a heartbeat. The only thing, which was out of their control, was loud music many times and a very loud lawnmower while I was trying to attend a virtual conference. Speaking of that, the internet speed was fabulous!!!! Overall, it‚Äôs a fantastic stay and the pictures accurately depict the property."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,I was just in town for a wedding but had to bring my dogs. What a perfect little Airbnb for the weekend! Convenient to downtown and the breweries.

No fault of the owner. Thanks again for everything!

1. Easy to find and right down the road from the Stove House (have to go there)
2. Easy to get in (super easy)
3. Very clean
4. Awesome d√©cor
5. Washer and dryer (really? Yep) Good ones too, not just crappy ones.
6. Full kitchen (missing a whisk and maybe get an extra small pan)
7. Big closet, lots of space
8. Nice size bedroom (probably needs a bigger bed for some, I was ok though)
9. Nice size bathroom.
Last but not least.....................
10. THE SHOWER!!! I love showers and this was the best, hands down. Full body sprayers from the front, rain and fountain from the top. Add to this a hand held piece. Coming back here for sure."

2023-08-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"Location was great, just a few minutes Uber from Orion Amphitheater which is why we were in town. Music themed decor was appropriate. One of the chairs on the balcony had a broken back making it somewhat difficult to get comfortable. My biggest complaint relates to the sleeping arrangements. We rented the unit for 3 adults with the understanding that the living room couch would pull out to accommodate the 3rd person. Fold out bed was nearly impossible to pull out of the couch. One of the fold out legs at the end of the pull out was bent at angle that prevented it from touching the ground and made the bed unusable. All 3 adult guests had to share the master bed. Also, the extra blankets and pillows mentioned in the amenities were nowhere to be found. Furthermore, no laundry or dish detergent was provided to start loads as requested in the checkout binder."

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Beautiful place!! It‚Äôs very quiet and private. We love that the ‚Äúmaster‚Äù bedroom is on the first floor with its own bathroom. The decor was very fitting and wasn‚Äôt cluttered. We loved the pool table and the arcade Simpson game especially because it didn‚Äôt require quarters (my girlfriend would have needed a shoebox full lol). The instructions were clear for checking out! Would definitely recommend
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We loved the location was very convenient to everything. My husband daughter enjoyed the pool table and my daughter and her friend enjoyed the hot tub. Beds slept very comfortably which is always important to us.
2024-04-01,5.0,Group trip,The place was awesome it is perfect for birthday weekends where you could enjoy the city and enjoy the home
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very nice location with first class host.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The property was very clean and the surroundings very quiet at night. I enjoyed the fact that it‚Äôs located next to a coffee shop that also serves food

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Great location, cool, clean, and I will be back"
2024-04-01,5.0,Group trip,We had a wonderful stay! It was fun playing pool and also playing the Simpson‚Äôs arcade game. Close to several bars and restaurants and the coffee shop next door was really good.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We came to town for a wedding and we were able to work in a trip to U.S. Space & Rocket Center. We had 4 adults and plenty of space.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"My family and I stayed in this house for a few nights while visiting Huntsville to go to the space center! The home was easy to find and looked just like the photos (yes there's mostly nude female art on the walls!). It's kind of in a weird spot in between a police station place and a business. Not a lot of outdoor privacy, but there was some curtains for the back porch if using the hot tub- which was nice! The amenities and modern decor are the big draws for this place - nicely appointed inside and kids loved the pool table and arcade game (and hot tub). The location was catty-corner from a hipster coffee shop and also near a cool artist/shops building (Lowe Mill) that are walkable! Space center was close too, less than 10 mins drive. They provide an eclectic collection of standard bath towels and washcloths but NOT hand towels (FYI). Kitchen stocked with plenty of items like plates, toaster, corkscrew, etc.... although BYO K-cups for the Keurig! Owners very responsive to questions."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We had a great time! It was our second time staying there. The house is in a great location and it is spacious and clean and comfortable. The coffee shop is so close and convenient! Most definitely will book again!

My favorite part was the pool table and the hot tub. The response time was amazing. Whenever I had questions they were happy and quick to answer. I will definitely be back! 10 of of 10, would recommend. Great Vibes"
2024-02-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"We rented this house for our son‚Äôs 13th birthday so he could have a ‚Äúguys weekend‚Äù. The first thing they noticed being teenage boys were the naked women art pictures on the wall. So glad their parents are understanding. They needed towels and we couldn‚Äôt find them. They were in the dryer! The internet went out and I tried to contact the hosts. Instead of them responding, I got an automated message about not smoking inside the house. I messaged again hours later about the internet being out, and got a response then. Even though these few things were irritating, we would definitely stay there again. It‚Äôs very cute and very clean. It‚Äôs in a great location and is very private! The boys made memories this weekend to last a lifetime!"
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,I very much enjoyed my stay. there was plenty of room to spread out. very relaxing atmosphere and comfortable bed!

2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Place looked exactly like the pictures‚Ä¶it was very peaceful and felt like home away from home. Eric & Lavena were very polite, friendly, and responsive. Most definitely would stay again. :)"
2024-01-01,3.0,Stayed with kids,"The house is beautiful, when I say it‚Äôs put together very well. The location is awesome, being by the police station ensured more safety in the area. Very private area, rented for my daughter 18 birthday sleep over. Very spacious, I absolutely love the house. There was a few things i didn‚Äôt like. There‚Äôs definitely not enough kitchen material to cook with, they had a coffee maker with no coffee, we looked everywhere for napkins, which ended up being behind the trash can under the sink. We also looked everywhere for towels and wash clothes and they ended up being in the dryer! Big inconvenients! I was there with a teenager girls and the first thing we looked for was towels and wash clothes because we had a dinner at bridge street, so that was aggravating. Due to the lack of response to my questions I had I would only rent again because the house is nice. üòä after getting messages about smoking in the house and no response to my question was a big red flag. I ensured them I read the rules"
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Very peaceful and quiet!! Close to a lot of food places and shopping!!
2024-01-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"Beautiful craftsman style home, updated floors, cabinets and appliances! Owners great, responsive. I was sadly disappointed on a few items. We have a family of 5, traveling with children. We were surprised when we arrived to see 3 images on the wall (does not appear in listing photos) of a naked woman in 3 different poses. With 2 younger sons traveling with us, I found it terribly inappropriate. Perhaps this house would be better for adult travel, but I wouldn‚Äôt recommend for families. Train can be heard at night when putting kids to sleep."

To find the cleaners still in the home . We only
Waited maybe 20 more mins before they finished cleaning. Cleaning I guess due to it being the holiday was a bite rushed . We found hair on the beds stairs and hot tub. I asked how I could change the water but I received no response . Communication was not great at all. I could got in but I won't. Airbnb has great potential but my family won't be returning."

The towels were in the dryer still. There were NO k-cups for the keurig. Theres a silver dollar stain on the coach that was visible immediately upon arrival. Broken blinds in the primary bathroom.
The coffee shop catty-cornered was amazing! The location was great for visiting the Orion. And the owners were very responsive. It just lacked what I have come to expect in an Airbnb."

,,,"I thought this was going to be a great stay. Sadly, not great for remote work. Every week day, the guest house exterior was being worked on. The power-washing, paint scraping, hammering, and sawing made for a terrible work environment. After one week, I had to cancel the rest of my Huntsville trip. Not sure why it was listed while scheduled for maintenance"
