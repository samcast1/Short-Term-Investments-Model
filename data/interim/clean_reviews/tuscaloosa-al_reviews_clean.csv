2024-03-01,4,Stayed one night,Place was clean and the stocked coffee bar is a nice touch. I loved that I didn’t have to figure out the coffee situation. Haha. Coffee a must. Carpet on stairs and upstairs -we were not a fan of but the place was clean and quiet.
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The place was easy to find and an easy drive to campus. We enjoyed having our own place vs just a hotel room. Communication was clear and timely.

2023-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,The cleaning service messed up their days so they didn’t make it before I showed up. But Ally offered to call the maids in and I said no since I was already there. She was very kind and apologetic and told me where I could find clean sheets and towels. She also refunded me some of the money for the inconvenience. The place was NOT a mess. It was simply just the sheets hadn’t been washed/changed and there weren’t clean towels out. I appreciated the transparency and the help. Would definitely stay again.

2023-10-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"The apartment was nice and decorated well. The backyard was set up with a private fenced in yard. We only used as a place to sleep, so it worked well for that.

The internet was fast and able to sustain remote work.
2021-09-01,5,Stayed one night,We were traveling to NC & Tuscaloosa was our 1/2 way point. I searched for a place that accepted dogs and this condo popped up. The condo was immaculate & comfortable.

2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"I stayed here to break up a long drive. I left the following morning feeling considerably better than when I arrived. Must mean it’s a good airBnB. I enjoyed kicking back in the loft. Plans to go to Tuscaloosa for dinner were 86'd - the space was too comfortable to leave. I also liked the vintage rock motif, particularly the autographed photo of Richie Havens playing at Woodstock. I was growing up about 110 miles SE of that Bethel, NY event. I was a mere lad at the time - no chance my parents would have let me go - but it was nice to live vicariously. I did a deeper dive on Woodstock on the Internet and learned that Richie Havens kicked off the concert because the original opening act was stuck in traffic, that the gig meant much to Richie and his career, and, after his death, his ashes were spread over the concert site. The CSN poster reminded me of the first rock concert I ever saw - CSN at the late, lamented, never forgotten New Haven Coliseum. Thanks for the nostalgia & the stay!"

Everything that we needed was there and even some things we didn’t know we needed. My daughter especially appreciated the extra charging cord when she realized she forgot hers. 🤣
Our hosts couldn’t have been more nice and polite and it was a pleasure to chat with them. We look forward to returning to this idyllic spot when we come back to Tuscaloosa! Don’t wait to book this one, it’s a gem!"

The bed is comfortable and the kitchen and bath well stocked. On this visit, I was able to enjoy the weather. I enjoyed opening the windows for a refreshing breeze. I have always felt safe in this neighborhood and enjoyed a walk to downtown Northport everyday. You can enjoy a visit the café, the bakery or the five and dime - so enjoyable! I would recommend this loft to anyone."
2021-02-01,5,Stayed one night,Don’t let the term “loft“ make you think you are sharing the space with anyone else. You get the whole building to yourself. It’s a very nice studio apartment above a garage.
2021-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This loft was perfect for me and my 2 daughters. David was amazingly fast with responding to my rental request, which was made very last minute due to weather conditions. Thank you, David, for allowing us a place to stay during this crazy weather situation!!!"

David is a wonderful host--helpful, very responsive and eager to make us feel at home. The Northport location was wonderful. There is a beautiful walking trail nearby on 30th Ave where we walked each morning. Beautiful views of the levee and the Black Warrior River. The business district is in easy walking distance and Tuscaloosa is a short drive over the bridge. A perfect refuge for a short weekend or a long stay. We'd love to stay again!"

David was friendly and easy to get in touch with. Overall, we had a great stay."

I wouldn't hesitate to stay here again, it was perfect for us."

Helen was wonderful to work with and even arranged to mail back a couple things we left behind. Truly a wonderful spot and I highly recommend this house!
Niki Jones"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Townhome was clean throughout. Location was great if you’re going to the strip until closing time, not so great on Saturday night when school is in because Gene Stallings turns into a drag strip all night and if you want to chill, or turn in early, good luck. Very nice place, very clean, great stocked kitchen."

2024-02-01,5,Group trip,We loved it! Great location and very clean.
2024-01-01,4,Stayed with kids,Place was inviting and comfortable. Helen was very friendly and responsive. I’m only giving 4 stars because the water heater froze and we had to find a place to shower before our event. She did send maintenance out as soon as possible but not in time for our event. Would recommend placing the hot water heater in the garage since it’s heated. Would recommend to my friends and family.

2024-06-01,4,Stayed with a pet,"Good overall experience. The only reason for the 4 stars is that it was very hot in the room and there was no central hvac. Only a window unit. That didn’t work very well. So it was a hot night sleeping. Other than that, I enjoyed it."

2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I LOVED staying at the Shop! It was a great place and I felt right at home. I was in town for a training at UA and my daily commute wasn’t bad at all. I appreciated the work space I had in the evenings to conduct my virtual sessions. The amenities were excellent from the snacks, water, and WiFi!! I am positive that I’ll be staying here again in the near future."

2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Sandy's place, ""the shop"" has been one of the best Air b&b's I have stayed at. I felt right at home, I was treated and welcomed as a member of their family and they were genuinely kind and caring. I'll be back to stay at their place, I'll be looking forward to my next visit."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,This was my second time staying at Sandy’s in less than a month. 🙂 “The Shop” feels more like staying with a friend than a total stranger. I love the location—close enough to the University of Alabama but a little bit away from all of that traffic. #iykyk Check in and check out is so easy. Some AirBnbs have a laundry list of things to do for check out. Not Sandy’s. Would definitely stay here again!
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"Safe neighborhood, clean place, friendly people. We had a great stay!"

2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,No
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"A travel group I’m in is always posting horror stories about AirBnbs. This is NOT one of those stories! What you see is what you get at “The Shop.” If you are headed to Tuscaloosa, it is a great location a little bit away from the madness of McFarland (#iykyk) but still easy (and quick) to get to the University of Alabama. I love that it is in a peaceful area near a school, but it also has a Walgreens and Jack’s a couple of minutes away by car. The bed is super comfy, and I loved how spacious the shower and bathroom were. The snacks and KCups were such a nice touch; it’s one of the things that made it feel more like you were staying at a friend’s. Check in and check out are a breeze. The only bad thing is that you can’t stay forever."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Sandy's home is an excellent place to stay in Tuscaloosa. The bed is comfortable and everything is clean. The fenced yard was perfect for my dog and Sandy's family was very friendly and welcoming. I highly recommend this to anyone spending time in Tuscaloosa.

2023-09-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Beautiful guest house. It was accurately described. Clean, comfortable bed, and very nice/spacious shower.

2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"Hi all, I hope this review finds you well. If you are coming across this spot looking for somewhere to stay, book it. Just book it. Sandy is a great host, friendly, understanding, and she made sure to stock the fridge with drinks, and leave snacks out. I had the option in the morning for coffee, oatmeal, grits. The wifi was fast, they even had a little heater for the bathroom which I loved because I’m always cold when I get out of the shower. Oh and the shower, it’s beautiful. Also, you know when you stay away from home you usually get a bed that’s mediocre. Not this bed. It’s so comfortable, I thought I’d have trouble sleeping being in a new spot but I was out like a light. It’s so homey feeling. The shop is clean, comfortable, beautiful neighborhood, super responsive friendly host, & for the price you can’t beat it. You’ll pay twice at a hotel with less amenities and less comfort & twice the hassle. Book ‘The Shop’ thank me later :)

2023-04-01,5,Group trip,"Michael was a great host! The property was in a terrific location; safe and very walkable to the downtown area. The condo was clean and included small but helpful things like q-tips, trash bags, and even laundry pods and dryer sheets. Michael was easy to communicate with, and he was able to accommodate our early arrival, which was much appreciated after a very long day of traveling. Lastly, all three of the beds were incredibly comfortable. One of our guests described it as “like sleeping on a cloud.” The bed in the larger bedroom was seriously more comfortable than my bed at home! Bed quality is one detail that I always comb through reviews for, and trust me when I say that you will absolutely sleep well in this property, regardless of which room/bed you choose. We will definitely book Michael’s place again in the future! So glad we found it before our son begins at UA! :)"

Novice Airbnb users will find it super easy to check in and he has everything you need. Experienced Airbnb folks will appreciate the ease of check in and great communication. Sean does an amazing job of making sure his guests are taken care of. Look no further for a place to stay near the university if you're visiting your college student or going to game day. It's about 12 minutes from the heart of the university. There are several ways to get there, so use G**gle to avoid traffic. Generous check in time of 2pm and checkout by 11. Super clean. I appreciated the well organized kitchen area. Carport available for off street parking. Huge backyard that is fenced in! The beds are super nice!

As soon as we first entered we felt very welcome; there were even muffins waiting for us on the kitchen table! The attention to detail as far as the well-stocked kitchen and linens was impeccable. There was even a first aid kit and extra personal amenities (toothbrush, etc.) available. We did not want or need anything during our stay - it was all right there! Everything about this home was delightful and we thoroughly enjoyed our stay. Thank you, Sean!"

Best part for me is I was able to bring my dog, it’s pet friendly yet not pet friendly obvious. Sounds odd to say but what do I mean by that, it is pristine clean and no pet or previous pet visit odors. Sean is easy to access and promptly responds to any request. I felt safe and at home.

2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"My husband is on a walker. Within an hour of arriving, Sean stopped by the house to make sure we were settled in and that my husband was ok. Security cameras on the driveway so we felt very safe. Optional home security alarm also helped us feel safer. When I booked, I inquired if there was a shower chair as my husband is disabled. Sean offered to look into purchasing one. We declined that offer and brought our own but it was very thoughtful to make the offer."

Chip and Joanna would be proud! There were fresh muffins on the table, plenty of ground or k-cup coffee with creamers, plenty of other extras as well. Just in case you forgot something, there were extra toothbrushes and toothpaste, shaving cream, soaps, feminine products, shampoo and conditioner, and bar soaps.
Location was perfect. Tucked into a quiet neighborhood. Away from all the university traffic and busyness but close enough to get to the sports activities quickly. A Walmart close by and one of the friendliest staffed Waffle Houses you will ever visit.
We are big Alabama fans and Sean’s place will be at the top of our preferred places to stay! Thanks Sean! ‘See you’ again soon!!"

Everything you could want is here on site. Kitchen is very well stocked for cooking at home but any restaurant you could want is near by.
Close to the main roads for easy access to everything but very quiet in a real friendly and safe neighborhood setting.
Beds are comfortable.
Temps are easily controlled, but we never touched the thermostat.
there is a house alarm, but we never used that either.
We really loved staying here and will certainly return."

2023-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"Beautiful well maintained with decorative upgrades. It’s the perfect house for 4 adults or two adults and children. It also has a large, flat fenced backyard. It’s perfect for Alabama game day weekends or University parent weekends. I’d most definitely book this property again. One thing that would help is to have lamps in the bedrooms so overheat lightning isn’t as needed and to add another chair near the window in the living area for more seating. ☺️"

2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I've stayed in 22 Airbnb's in the last two years and this is one of my favorites. Sean's place was spotlessly clean and beautifully decorated. The furnishings were comfortable and the kitchen was well stocked. The beds were extremely comfortable (one even had an adjustable mattress.) The backyard was fenced in and the neighborhood was quiet and walkable. It was convenient to Walmart and many other stores and restaurants. I will definitely stay here again the next time I am in town.
2023-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,Loved it
2023-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,Very nice house for small family. Worked perfect for what we needed.
2023-01-01,5,Stayed over a week,"Five stars because I can’t give more! My family and I stayed here 12/23-1/3 and agree this is where we want to stay when we’ll be in town. The pictures are truly represent the place you’re staying, Sean is helpful and hospitable, and you will be thrilled you chose to stay here.
We forgot one of our CPAPs back home, so my husband and I slept in separate rooms, meaning all three room were used during our stay and the beds are all very comfortable. The house has the right amount of everything you need – dishes, silverware, pots and pans, closet space, and more. We hosted a small party for our daughter’s 20th birthday and our guests said if they didn’t live locally, they’d want to stay here!
It helps that the neighborhood is really quiet, and is located extremely closely to a variety of restaurants, grocery stores, shopping centers, as well as Downtown Northport and Downtown Tuscaloosa, and the UA campus. Seriously, book it before someone else does!"
2022-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,This was a very cute place! We felt right at home. There was hot cocoa & muffins waiting for us when we checked in. Everything was very clean.

I always see pictures of hosts doing cute little things for families and a nice snack etc only to get there and not see any of it.
The sign, muffins, and even the tree were all welcome sights after 12 hrs of driving. Thank you so much for such a cozy place and all the thought put into it!"
2022-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"We only stayed one night, but this was a great place! Highly recommend!"

Kitchen is fully stocked - we ate all our meals in. Dishwasher made clean up easy. Full sized washer and dryer would have come in handy if our stay had been more than a few days. Top it all off with Sean, a friendly and attentive owner who made sure to address any questions quickly! We’ll stay here again!"
2022-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"Sean is great! He truly takes pride in his air bnb and making his guests feel at home! The house was stunning, clean, safe and the details to welcome guests were amazing! Will definitely be staying here over and over again!"

Will definitely stay here again if I’m traveling through Alabama again."
2022-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"Sean’s place was absolutely amazing!! The pictures do not do justice. The home was extremely clean and very spacious. I loved the southern feel. The bed was extremely comfortable and very clean. The bathroom had everything you could possibly need which was a plus. Sean is an excellent host and his communication is the absolute best.
My stay was very last minute but from the time I hit confirm on Airbnb until the time I checked out Sean was in constant communication, giving me a periodic update on the home and the times I could checkin. Sean even went beyond the call of duty to send a Good Morning message with instructions on how to leave the home. To me this was great because I no longer needed to go back and find the checkout instructions."
2022-10-01,5,Group trip,This place is great. So clean and has everything.

The decor is great. Loved the surroundings when we looked out the windows. Great spot to get to downtown Tuscaloosa and explore there as well as it was only 8 minutes away from the wedding we were in town for. Definitely recommend this space and host and we plan on staying here again if we're ever back in Tuscaloosa (which we are planning another trip to in the future)

It was the perfect location, about a 10-minute drive from almost anywhere on campus. We sat on the back porch and enjoyed the fireflies, cicadas, and birds. The owners were very responsive and communicative. They should give a master class for Airbnb on how to decorate and run a place; everything was so convenient and well thought out. When I come back to visit my daughter, I'd like this to be my landing place due to its location, quality, and affordability. Thank you!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,One of the best places to get away if you're visiting or just passing through. Super comfortable and the amenities were great! Would absolutely stay here again!

The bathroom/shower are regular sized which was nice for a tiny home. The water pressure was also really nice/hot! The backyard is huge and fenced in and has a nice bed swing and garden to enjoy and perfect for our fur babies to run around in. The host were extremely welcoming and communicative.

2023-05-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We really enjoyed the tiny house. It was homey and we were very comfortable.
We didn't communicate with our hosts while were were there, but that is because we didn't need too. Directions to get there and check-in were clear. I have family that lives in Tuscaloosa, so didn't need help finding anything in town.
Thank you for letting us stay in your tiny house!"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Had a great stay over a week while in town for work. It’s small for any more than two but it was a perfect peaceful place to rest for one. I’m sure the loft was great when it was open. William was quick to respond with any issues. It was very clean.
2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"Such a joy to stay in this tiny home!
Instructions and details prior to check in were so helpful and clear the start - I was especially impressed by how many little details had been thought through before even checking in. From specific parking details, local recommendations, and thoughtful amenities (bathroom products, snacks and waters, and personalized welcome notes.)
In addition to amazing hospitality, this tiny home is such a unique and peaceful getaway! Perfectly clean and tidy, cheerful and full of character, and so well-designed you don’t miss extra space. Bed was very comfortable and clean, and fully stocked kitchen utilities were a huge plus.
Hands down, best part is the historic preservation of a former grocery store. So many little touches nodding to its past, really lovely and well done!
If you want a unique and inviting stay not far from Tuscaloosa and other attractions - this is the place to be!"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This was a very well renovated and decorated Airbnb, Tiny House (not so tiny though, perfect size).

They've done and wonderful job of transforming this former one room grocery store into a peaceful retreat that captures the history of the building. Just look up when you enter and you will see the original wood and beams. Great kitchen and bathroom. Decorated with cute touches from the old store and modern, useful furnishings. We had a great experience and would stay again, if available!"
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"A must if you’re in the Tuscaloosa area. On a scale of 1-10 this place is a 100. Hosts communicate promptly to make sure everything is in order when you arrive.

2022-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Kristi and William are the most amazing hosts and people and really made this trip to Tuscaloosa far better than I could have imagined. I’ve been staying in a lot of airbnbs lately for work and they’ve all been pretty average with little to no communication from the hosts. That is not the case here! The tiny home is definitely my favorite Airbnb I’ve stayed in.
The yard is huge and fenced in so my dogs could run around and play and they have a new dog best friend in Ollie, Kristi and Williams pup!
The tiny home is beautifully done and every detail has a personal touch to it. It is unique and very comfortable. I was a longer stay and there wasn’t anything missing for cooking, cleaning or toiletries. Perfectly stocked! It is located in the backyard with a view of their pretty garden and is set back away from the main house so it feels very private. If there was anything I needed, they were on it immediately. There is plenty of parking as well.
In all, I had a great stay and made new friends in Kristi and William. I highly recommend and will definitely come back!"

2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Linda was a great host. I would recommend this place to anyone in a minute. I can honestly say that I felt like home. The UA Football decor is what stood out the most. So many to list but her attention to detail is impressive, down to the pillows and linens. Linda was also very accommodating. Our flight was delayed so Linda allowed us to check out a little later due to the fact that no one was checking in that day."

2023-08-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"This property is as described and suited our needs well. It was clean, comfortable and well stocked. I would definitely stay again and recommend to others. My only thought is the beds were very uncomfortable (possibly older/poor quality spring beds).
If you are booking for the pool please note that the pool is not well maintained. It is well used by kids/teens that do not respect the property. This is no fault of the AirBNB owners. When called about a pool issue they called the maintenance man immediately. He came and tried to fix it, not for sure he really has a good grasp on the pool care."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Host was very responsive and easy to work with. The space was clean and well-maintained. We didn't have a chance to use the pool or other offered amenities but it looked nice. I plan to stay here again in the future.

2023-01-01,5,Stayed about a week,"It was very hard to find a decent place that was pet friendly on short notice. So when this listing popped up I was excited to see what they had to offer. I’m pleased to say it was just as it was advertised and even more. The hosts were extremely accommodating and helpful from the very beginning until the minute we checked out.
The couch was so comfortable and the television was large enough for everyone to see from the couch and the chairs. The water pressure and temperature were so on point. It was truly a home away from home.
The kitchen is fully equipped and very clean and easy to keep clean with supplies available in the unit. The washer and dryer were also a huge help with suds available.
The house rules were simple and easy to navigate. There were no move out instructions that made it hard to just pack up and leave at the end of our one week stay. Although we were not required to clean up, we had enough time to do so. Lovely home and lovely hosts!!"
2023-01-01,5,Group trip,"Amazing stay at this location! I recommend it to all other guests, you won't regret it)"
2023-01-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"The place is really nice. Quiet, safe and clean. The fenced yard made our stay with the dog a lot easier. Alan was very helpful; gave us all the information we needed and answer our questions really quickly. I would recommend this place."
2022-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,Just great thank
2022-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"I was very happy with the accomodations. I was worried a bit because there were not a bunch of reviews, so I was really surprised that it was even better than the description. Nice pet friendly places are hard to find, but this was truly an unexpected gem."

2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Esther and Thomas are such excellent hosts. They strive to be the best hosts, meeting and exceeding my needs in arriving in the area for work. Their property excels in cleanliness, is quiet, very private, a wonderfully comfortable sleep, and their kindness to make one's stay enjoyable exceeds expectations. I highly recommend this property if needing to stay in the area."
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My wife and I just stayed at Esther this pass week. We needed a place close to DCH hospital in Tuscaloosa because my wife’s sister was hospitalized there. Esther’s location was perfect. 18 minutes away from the hospital, university of Alabama, restaurants and any possible place you can possibly need if you’re on vacations or in our case a family member hospitalized near by. Esther works with us in our indecisions of days and dates on our booking since my sister in law condition changed dramatically in a matter of days. After 16 hours of driving we arrived to a very pleasant place super clean and quiet in a beautiful neighborhood close to everything we could possibly need; gas, food, drugstore, restaurants etc…
This is our first experience with Airbnb and after this it won’t be the last. We recommend Esther as a host to anyone interested, she was great, great place and great location…
Sorry I couldn’t give you more stars since this review tops 5 but in our opinion she deserves 100 +"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We always love to stay at Esther's!
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Came to town for the weekend to catch a football game. Easy access to get to the game, lots of places nearby to eat. Quiet neighborhood. I Definitely recommend!"
2023-11-01,3,Stayed a few nights,"The room was a great deal for what I paid for. There was a ladybug problem. I killed no less than 50 ladybugs during my stay. Unfortunately the patio doors in the room were not properly sealed and they were coming through continuously. I contacted the host, and she gave me a vacuum with a hose to suck them up during my 4 night stay. This is not ideal when you are paying for a room, no matter the costs. She apologized and said this is an issue and they have sprayed the outside door. I finally had to buy tape and tape the seals of the door, which worked."

While we were out one afternoon they called us to let us know there was a tornado warning for the area, and we were welcome to come back with our son from the university and use their shelter.
