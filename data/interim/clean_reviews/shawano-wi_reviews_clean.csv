2024-06-01,5,Group trip,"We realized we forgot to write in the guestbook, which we know can be fun to read but thank you so much for a great stay. We all are still talking about it and reliving the beautiful memories we made. It was a perfect, peaceful retreat. The place is so cozy. We could hear every bit of nature. The fire pit got used both nights. We all did a canoe around the lake. The amenities were nice. We both cooked at the place and went out to a few local restaurants. It was a much needed vacation. We did realize when we got there that we weren't sure which dock was in the picture that belonged to the place and if we could use it. We reached out to ask and got a quick response. Friendly folks around as well but still secluded and able to keep to ourselves."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We spent a weekend at Camp Lee in mid-may. The cabin was cute and comfortable. The loft was great for multiple guests. The kitchen was well stocked, but bring your own paper towels and seasonings. The bedding and towels were clean and plentiful. The bonfire pit area was our favorite spot to hang out and it was well maintained. The deck area didn’t have the outdoor dining set, and there is no dining table. The lack of dining areas was the only drawback to Becca’s place. Highly recommend. Great hosts and beautiful property! Thanks again!"
2024-05-01,4,Group trip,Thanks so much! It was great to get away!
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"My family and I really loved our stay and will definitely return again. The lake is beautiful, peaceful and was perfect. The upstairs loft was perfect for our group of kids and the yard is great!! If you're looking for a quiet getaway this is it!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Very nice and quite, would definitely stay again!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We loved our stay at Debbie’s place. Their backyard was almost park like with a beautiful view of the channel. It was serene yet entertaining as we watched boaters pass by. The accommodations were very comfortable. The spaciousness of the studio was a wonderful surprise. There was a loveseat for sitting along with a small table/desk & chair. We used the mini fridge for our HH beverages & leftovers. The queen sized bed was very comfortable for our 3 night stay. Bathroom was spacious with a corner shower & separate soaking tub.
The location is ideal and is within walking distance or a short drive to downtown Shawano which has seen a revitalisation of Main Street in the downtown with much needed addition of upscale boutiques, speciality stores and even a wine tasting bar!
Debbie was a wonderful host and checked in with us daily to ensure our stay was comfortable.
We love Shawano and would definitely book Debbie’s adorable studio for future stays."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Debbie was a great hostess- extremely responsive, especially when we had a key issue that was entirely our own fault! We loved being able to kayak, fish off the dock, and walk to the coffee shop. Enjoyed visiting Stubborn Brothers Brewery, Hayman Falls, and Navarino State Wildlife Area."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,My second stay and another wonderful visit. The only issue I ran into this time was the bathtub as a bit dirty. But a quick wipe down with a paper towel and some available cleaner and it was hardly an issue. Will definitely continue to return to this beautiful home.
2024-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We enjoyed our stay at Deborah’s loft so much! The space was clean, quiet, and relaxing. The view of the lake was beautiful. Deborah made sure we knew where to go and checked in to see if we had everything we needed. Thank you for a great experience!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very cute and cozy stay!
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,A very nice and quiet place to stay. Close to work and the downtown. Great hosts.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"I booked with Deborah for a night away myself. Her loft is absolutely gorgeous. The view off the deck is beautiful and serene. I spent time sitting out on the dock and got to see turtles, fish and a River otter swimming. I already booked my visit back next months. Can’t wait to bring my paddle board out in the water."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,This was a lovely place to stay! Deborah was very friendly and communicative. The view from the room is incredibly beautiful and the room itself is cozy and clean. Thanks for the lovely stay :)
2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"I’ve never had to strip the bedding and place in laundry basket at previous air bnb’s, but if it keeps the cost low, I don’t mind. The place was very clean which is a huge thing for me. Thank you Debra."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Clean, cozy, quiet, and safe."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Very clean and peaceful location. Host was very responsive.

2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,perfect
2024-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"Beautiful bungalow to stay with my sister! Clean, comfortable, peaceful with a beautiful view."
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"A great little hideaway. Beautiful setting on the river. A lot of consideration was given to all the little touches, such as hot chocolate, teas, coffee , snacks and a nice surprise in the refrigerator.
Deborah reached out to us to make sure we were comfortable in every way."
2024-01-01,5,Stayed one night,Deborah was great! Would definately stay again
2024-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great space in a small town with tons to do! Great food, shopping, recreation, and culture! This place is right on the river and just on the edge of the city. A city that hosts many cabin/lake folks with a close proximity to Green Bay and the Packers. Love this spot."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"This place is just lovely! Cozy and warm, clean and inviting. We stayed after watching a cold game at lambeau, it was wonderful to get in the warm bathtub afterwards. We got pizza from a local place that was delicious, there were lots of menus to choose from since Deborah had a whole basket of local awesomeness to choose from! The snacks and drinks were thoughtful and enjoyed. The bedding was soft and the view was amazing. What a perfect space! We will definitely be back for a longer stay and some kayaking. It was easy to find with clear instructions and a quiet neighborhood."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Wonderful stay. Clean and quiet! Would stay again and recommend.
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,One of my favorite places I’ve stayed on a vacation. The wife and I loved our stay so much we plan on making a trip during spring/summer to better enjoy some of the other beautiful parts of the area that winter weather shut down.
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We had a great time staying here! Beautiful location right on the river. Inside had everything we needed and was clean and well taken care of. Deborah was super helpful giving us ideas on places to check out around town too. Definitely would be stay here again!
2023-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"There's clean, there's very clean, and then there's Deborah Clean! By far, the tidiest, cleanest, most spotless Airbnb I have ever stayed in!
Beautiful, extremely quiet and peaceful neighborhood, but close enough to downtown Shawano if you needed a restaurant or a pub to visit.
Right along the riverbank with kayaks to use. Just cannot say enough good things about this location.
One thing to keep in mind. There is no formal kitchen. There is a small (dorm sized) refrigerator, toaster oven, and microwave, but if preparing meals from scratch is what you are planning for your stay, that's not an option here. But if you are looking for abundant, spotless linens, a walk-in shower and a jacuzzi tub, comfortable furniture, or just a place to read and unwind for a few days--look no further!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What an amazing find! Probably the cleanest AirBnB I’ve ever stayed in, and Deborah was so communicative and friendly! I’d be happy to stay again and would recommend this place to others!"
2023-10-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful location. In town to take in the surrounding nature hikes and waterfalls. Deborah was very kind and responsive in her communication.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,My stay at the studio exceeded my expectations. The hosts were kind and helpful and I felt comfortable during my stay. I was appreciative of all the amenities-they were exactly as listed on the site. I was able to relax after working and also do necessary work from the studio-as the workspace was conducive to my needs. The neighborhood is serene and peaceful and beautiful with all the leaves changing colors. I hope to return again- when working in the area. Thank you for sharing your beautiful studio!

2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"Would definitely recommend!
A friend and I like to visit different areas in Wisconsin. While searching the website I came across this place. I loved that it was on the water with kayaks available. It has a fire pit the guests were able to use. And a giant bathtub if you’re looking to relax. Deborah went above and beyond with personal touches, and the space was practical, clean and comfy. She was great at communicating, even helped us get the kayaks in the water. She has literally thought of everything her guests may need. This would also be perfect for those going to Green Bay for a Packer game!"

Thanks again and hope to see you soon."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Our stay was over a lovely summer weekend! The location on the Channel was superb. The ambience on the waterfront was memorable. I was very interested to learn a little more about the history of the home! Thanks for sharing it!
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"A lovely place, quiet and cozy inside and surrounded by nature outside! We loved having coffee on the balcony and the soaker tub is a nice feature. Deborah was quick and thorough in her communication and made self check-in easy. We will stay here again!!"

2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,very nice and peaceful area. grea host!
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The place was just perfect for my needs for a weekend away. The host has thought of every little amenity that you may have forgotten at home from condiments to toiletries.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Deborah and Jim were great hosts. They were responsive to all our needs. The patio and back yard were very inviting areas. We spent a whole afternoon sitting under a shade tree reading. It was awesome! The views were beautiful. We had a great time!
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Such a wonderful place. I'm grateful that she offers it as an Airbnb

2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,What a lovely space to stay. Close to town with some nice amenities- my mom and I really enjoyed exploring the river with the paddle boat and the deck felt cozy and private. A fun oasis on the Wolf.
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"Super cute place with a lot of charm! My husband and I only stayed overnight, but the place was perfect just for that. The bathroom is nice and roomy, the outside and surrounding area are beautiful. There are instructions inside the unit as well as a book with helpful info. We had a little trouble with opening the lock box, but the host was home and showed us how it worked."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"What a great place! The surroundings were beautiful, I wish I would have had time to enjoy the area more. The Airbnb was super clean, easy to find and get into. Lots of clear notes and instructions and just the right amount of amenities for a short stay. The bed was super comfy!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I had a great week staying at Debbie’s place and would highly recommend it to anyone. She and Jim were great hosts!
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"It rained most of my stay but instead of letting that spoil my visit I felt it added beauty to Deborah place. Warm, cozy and peaceful. I loved watching the Spring- swollen Wolf River roll past the property. Very good vibes all around. Debrah was very direct and brief with her interaction. I appreciated that. Thank you Deborah for sharing your home."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,I only wish I had more time to enjoy this location. It was a very beautiful place. I would definitely recommend this for anyone going to games or passing through.
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"An easy, comfortable stay -- lovely view of the channel on the Wolf River, opposite Heritage Park and Sunset Island, site of the first (?) saw mill in shawano (now gone, of course, so very scenic).
Roomy bathroom, helpful instructions easily located, comfortable bed, closet with hangers and plenty of room.
Hostess very communicative by text.
Snowed the morning of my departure, and my host cleaned off my car, and left his brush for me to finish the job.
Quite perfect!!"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Thank you Deborah for the amazing hospitality! Our stay with you was incredible!
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Just as the initial listing says, this little studio is indeed charming! Plenty of natural light, bright and clean linens and surroundings! Deborah was a fabulous host for our anniversary getaway! We celebrated 10 years of marriage and my husband's 42nd birthday 😍 Deborah was easy to get a hold of and was quick to answer all of our questions about the area and staying in her studio. It was so relaxing and peaceful to be in her Airbnb space."
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We’ve stayed here once before and it was just as wonderful, if not more, the second time around! It is clean, comfortable, and has everything you need for a relaxing weekend away! There’s plenty of things to do, even in the winter, and lots of delicious places to eat! The location is perfect to be close to all the action, but not feel like you’re right in the middle of it."
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Love love love this place . Waking up seeing the backyard view so peaceful and beautiful . Thank you Deb🤍
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Thank you for a great stay!
2023-01-01,5,Stayed one night,Thanks Deborah! Had a wonderful time staying at your place and your recommendations for hiking and restaurants were spot on. 😊
2023-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"Love the location, great place for a get away. Lots to do in warm months very beautiful sun rises over the river in cold months. Nice place to stay. Very warm environment"
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great stay. When there was a problem they were quick to respond and fix it. Enjoyed our stay
2023-01-01,3,Stayed a few nights,Deborah’s place was sufficient but felt it was slightly overpriced. The shower wouldn’t get hot. The bathroom has a microwave oven in it and forks that just felt like an odd location and unclean. A padlock was used to lock the sliding door. It just felt like it was priced a bit high for what it was. Deborah herself was very responsive and an attentive host. Hopefully some of the income from renting out the space can be used on a few improvements.
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place!
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Thanks!

2022-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"My stay in Deborah's studio on Wolf River was perfect. Easy to check in/out, clear and easy communication with the owner, and the Studio itself is very comfortable, cozy, and perfectly appointed - Deborah has thought of everything a guest might need and made it available. The location also can't be beat - the Studio is right on the water with a lovely view and is just around the corner from a local coffee shop you can walk, drive, or boat to.
Thanks for a great stay!"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"Really great views and privacy. Good communication and instructions from the hosts, an overall great little place to stay"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Deborah really makes you feel at home! From the personalize note to the backyard views it truly was the perfect escape from reality.

2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We came to Shawano for a fishing tournament and to stay at this loft was pleasant compared to a hotel especially a day out in the rain and having a “home” feeling place to rest one’s head - we are first time Airbnb and we are hooked!!
2022-09-01,4,Stayed with kids,"Location and space is beautiful, relaxing and what we needed. ♥️♥️♥️

2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Our stay at Deborah’s studio by Wolf River far exceeded our expectations. This place is not only situated in a beautiful and scenic location, it is immaculate and tastefully decorated, supplied with everything we needed. The location is quiet yet conveniently close to town. The backyard river view is amazing-we didn’t want to leave!!! Be back for sure. Thank you Deborah and James❤️"

2022-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Very clean and comfortable spot. Host was attentive and checked to make sure everything was satisfactory. Beautiful spot on the river. Very relaxing atmosphere and very private for owner occupied dwelling. If you’re in this area looking for a cozy clean space for a reasonable price, you can’t go wrong here. Wife was super psyched with the soaking tub too!"
2022-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,Beautiful place on the river - it's so calm and peaceful there!
2022-06-01,5,Stayed one night,Such a relaxing little spot. We loved seeing Hayman Falls nearby and enjoyed kayaking right from the pier! Communication was fantastic and the suite was very clean! We also loved the big tub! Would definitely stay again sometime!
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay. The loft is nicely decorated, cozy and comfortable. The view of the river from the private balcony is beautiful and the yard was peaceful and park like. I even enjoyed a little time sitting on the pier in the evening watching the river activity. It was so quiet and peaceful there. It is a perfect place to relax and unwind and the bed is soooooo comfortable! The bathroom is huge and there really is great water pressure in the shower! There was great communication from the hostess with just a quick daily check in to make sure everything was ok. She even checked with us the second day to see if it was ok if she turned off the ac because it had cooled off outside. The only negative I have to say is there was a very strong odor in the loft the first day we were there. It smelled like some kind of essential oil (but not necessarily a pleasant one). It seemed to dissipate the second day after the ac was turned off so the only thing we can figure is maybe something was being picked up by the ac and since the room is closed off, it was very strong. I have not seen any other posters commenting on it so it must have been some weird fluke. It would not deter me from staying here again because everything else was so great. We would definitely recommend this cozy little place on the river!"
2022-05-01,5,Stayed one night,Absolutely beautiful space and environment. The host worked closely with me to provide special amenities for a special occasion. They also were helpful when working with me on fluid agenda schedule. Overall very accommodating.
2022-05-01,5,Stayed one night,We had a wonderful getaway from the city! The views were amazing and the host was very accommodating.
2022-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"Deborah was an excellent host, she provided detailed notes all throughout the home explaining water pressure, helpful tips, and even had a cute guestbook that was fun to read of other travelers. The property is definitely worth the trip to explore on the Kayaks. She is a gracious and wonderful hostess. I plan to come back to stay here longer."

2022-01-01,5,Stayed one night,Super cute and cozy place! Hosts are great. Gave local restaurant recommendations and let us use their snow shoes to enjoy the beautiful winter afternoon! Would definitely stay here again.
2022-01-01,5,Stayed one night,It was our first time renting an Airbnb. Super cute studio. Very clean and well maintained. Huge bathroom. Pretty location. Would have loved our visit to be in the summer. Very close to Green Bay. Had a little trouble trying to get tv to work but got it working. Great hostess and easy to communicate with.
2022-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"Deborah's place has all the comfort and privacy of home. We stayed during a Packer weekend, and for that purpose it was perfect! Close enough to not be a hassle, and the price point is simply unbeatable for the amenities, location, host gameday knowledge & pro tips, and of course the perfect mattress.
Comfy, woodsy, outdoorsy--> everything a stay in northern Wisconsin should be! Highly recommend! A+
If this space is available and you're headed somewhere close, book it fast, and your memories will last!!
Thanx again for everything, Deb."
2021-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Debbie's apartment was lovely, in a great location right on the river. The treats and cold drinks were appreciated. We enjoyed our stay."
2021-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"This cozy spot is well worth it! We loved staying here, even in the winter. The space was clean and comfortable, with a great view and abundant light. We would stay here again!"
2021-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,You will love this place! Great location in Shawano. Deborah is the hostess with the mostest. I was grateful for some thoughtful snacks and drinks so I didn’t have to stop at the grocery store for my weekend solo getaway. We had beautiful snowfall and I felt like I was in my own little bungalow tucked away to enjoy the weather safely from the upstairs loft. It was a great weekend in Shawano.
2021-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"Super cozy, peaceful place! The view is beautiful and the location was close to everything we needed. We booked last minute for a mini getaway before the Packer game and would have loved to stay another night but couldn't get time off. We will definitely be back in the future! Thanks Denorah for sharing your place!"
2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Deborah’s studio apartment is perfect for the overnighter or the extended guest. I’d love to be there in the summer and take advantage of the kayaks on the Wolf River, but regardless, it’s beautiful. Even in winter time!"
2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"After booking our stay, Debbie helped me arrange a surprise proposal to my now fiancé.

We will absolutely be staying here again in the future!"

2021-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"I could not stay long myself, it was mostly a hotel for me after a long, tiring day, but well worth the price, an excellent alternative to a hotel - easier check-in and more cozy and relaxing. Definitely would stay again."
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,A great find in shawano! Cute cozy and clean
2021-10-01,5,Stayed one night,Deborah and her husband were the most lovely and welcoming couple. They thought of everything that could bring us comfort and relaxation during our short stay. Definitely use l the kayaks if you can - the river is stunning and so peaceful! We hope to come back!

2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very clean and quiet place. Everything we needed for our weekend getaway
2021-09-01,5,Stayed one night,Cute little place right by the water. Much quieter than most mother in law style apartments and incredibly clean.
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"It's a very cozy studio loft space, exactly as advertised, but with so many additional small touches to make guests feel welcome. The outdoor space, including private balcony, and park-like setting on the lake channel, are resort-like this time of year. Excellent communication with the host. Would stay there again without hesitation."
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I highly recommend this place. One of the most peaceful Airbnb we’ve stayed at. Deborah was a delightful host, anticipating all our needs and providing a lovely setting for rest and relaxation. We will definitely stay here again when we next visit the area."

2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"You should not date or marry anyone that gives this place anything other than 5 stars…it will end up in divorce because that person can not be pleased.
I didn’t get to meet Debbie, the stars didn’t align for us. She was very pleasant in texts and checked up on me but not so much that made me feel like I have a stalker.
The view is great. Peaceful. Quiet. Tranquil. Great place to think or sleep. I didn’t have a lot of thoughts, but I slept great.
The place was clean. The water pressure was strong. Nobody notices the water pressure until there’s none. There was a nice stream of water. I have no idea why I just dedicated a whole paragraph to water pressure.
Would stay again."
2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is a very nice place to stay for a single person or a couple. Very clean, super comfortable bed, wonderful bathroom, and welcoming hosts. We highly recommend it and will definitely be back since we have family in the area!"
2021-06-01,5,Stayed one night,The view from the balcony is calming peaceful and beautiful. The room has an air of relaxation about it. Do not get me started on the over the top bathroom. After a long drive I took a restorative nap. Slept like a baby that night. I absolutely hated to leave. Location was excellent. Easy to find and close to everything.
2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Cute, easy, and delightful."
2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I had a lovely, relaxing stay in Shawano! I would definitely recommend to anyone looking for a quiet getaway."

2021-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Everything about my stay was absolutely perfect ! From the ease of checking in, to taking one of the kayaks out on the water, setting up my hammock and just laying by the river, and soaking in the bath tub after being in the sun all day. This place has all the amenities you need for a nice relaxing weekend getaway and is exactly what I needed this weekend! Thank you so much Deborah!"
2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Deborah was a great host and the Airbnb was beautiful! :) Her and her husband are both very friendly and approachable.
On one of our kayak trips, we got stuck in a storm and had to pull our kayaks to shore. We had to temporarily leave the kayaks on someone's lawn. After letting Deborah know about this, she was helpful and let us know she was glad we were okay. She even offered to pick up the kayaks where we left them. My partner and I chose to go back after the storm and ride the kayaks back to the Airbnb, but we were still very grateful for Deborah's kindness and willingness to help us out.
Great communication from the host, beautiful Airbnb, and lots of amenities. Would stay here again if I'm ever back in Shawano, Wisconsin! :) Thanks Deborah!"

2021-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"Deborah's loft space is such a relaxing and quiet spot. The deck overlooking the river and backyard was such a nice place to catch up on some work and enjoy the good weather and bird activity. It was a short stay, but I would book again when I'm in the area."
2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Cozy and picturesque! We looked forward to using the kayaks, but the weather didn't cooperate. Very nice location for Shawano."
2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We really enjoyed our stay. It was great to have the kayaks available so we could go out on a whim! We also enjoyed walking around the town and hiking in the area! The space was clean and nice and we had everything we needed! We have recommended this place to our friends, and would definitely come back."
2021-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The location is excellent. A beautiful riverview, a nice town to explore, and close enough to Green Bay and other attractions. The soaker tub is also a nice plus. It's a great place to stay!"

2021-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"We had a great time at Deborah’s place! It was easy to find, very close to the main drag, and perfect size for the two of us. The big tub was wonderful after a long day in the elements, and she even had homemade essential oil bath salts for us to use. Our stay was very short but very pleasant and relaxing."
2021-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"This was our first ever Airbnb; we’ve been skeptical for so long until we came across this place.
First off, it was the prettiest town in Wisconsin and had so much more to offer than the bigger cities. We felt like little kids again when we saw the antique shops and video stores.
Our host had such a stylish loft set up, and it was way beyond our expectations. The bathroom is honestly humongous and she provided so many things for us, along with such a clean space. Thank you, Deborah. You have set very high standards for our traveling experiences lol!!"
2021-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"As my first experience using an Airbnb, this place sets a crazy high standard for further experiences. I will be back. Sitting right on the Shawano river Deborah’s place is a breath of air and total relaxation. My only complaint- that I didn’t stay 2 nights. :/ my bad. Lol BUT because she took single night stay bookings allowed me to try this Airbnb thing out with much less reservation than a bigger 2 night stay financial investment. Thank you! Oh and the bed is crazy comfy! And that bath tub!! ❤️❤️😍😍"
2021-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"Beautiful and very clean, comfortable place to stay! I hope we can stay here again because I want to check out the nature on the river. Just as we were leaving, spotted two bald eagles from the balcony, soaring above. Pretty amazing."
2021-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great place to stay. Clean, nice location, and great hospitality. The room is very cozy and well-decorated. Glad we chose to stay here!"

2021-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Our stay was excellent. Debbie was so helpful in answering questions and letting us know local tips/locations to visit. The place was very clean,, comfy/cozy, and had a beautiful view with the snow. We would love to stay again on a future trip to northeastern WI!"
2021-01-01,5,Stayed one night,Lovely view I love the place ! Extremely nice and clean !
2021-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Deborah's place was easy to find and has a gorgeous view of the river. Her instructions about parking, check-in, and check-out were all very clear.

2021-01-01,5,Stayed one night,Such a cute home and space and very comfortable!
2021-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"A wonderfully peaceful and relaxing space. The soaking tub was a wonderful amenity to access during our stay. The location is great, right on the wolf river, very scenic and beautiful in the winter. Access to the gas grill outside bolstered our ability to cook a nice meal for ourselves for the 2nd evening we stayed. Attention to detail, wonderful light filled space, very clean and super sweet space to getaway to."
2021-01-01,5,Stayed one night,Fantastic place to get away. Beautiful scenery with the river steps away. Studio was extremely clean and have everything we need. Would love to go back in the summer to take advantage of the water!

2020-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This loft suite was bright and clean. No-contact check in was easy. The big bath tub was very inviting and the bed perfectly comfortable.

2024-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Lucas and Tracie were very nice and helpful. This was the first time we stayed at a Airbnb. They answered questions very quickly and completely. I appreciated that very much.
The place was wonderful. I don’t think we will ever stay in a hotel again.
Thank you both very much for making our stay so relaxed.
Tammy and Tom"
2024-06-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Was fun to use the kayaks and have a fire pit by the lake. Beds where comfortable.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place I would come back again!
2024-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,Great place! Super clean and comfortable. Everything you need and more. Great location right on the water. Absolutely beautiful
2023-12-01,5,Group trip,Great place to stay
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Was visiting shawano for an event at USAIR racetrack. House was a short drive from the track, a massive Walmart and any other amenities you'd ever need. Hosts were quick to respond and even when I asked where to get propane they came by and handed us a fresh tank within a few minutes!
Hopefully get to make the trip again next year."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Had a great time! The place was clean, spacious, and everything I could have asked for."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great location. Boat rental close by. Plenty to do in the area.
2023-07-01,5,Group trip,"I have stayed at many vacation rentals over the years. I have never experienced so many special touches by Lucas and Tracie at a single stay. The amenities offered from coffee, s’mores, kayaking, towels, Webber grill (seriously who has a Weber waiting for you), fire pit with wood, and cleanliness beyond what I would expect for lake front property. You will be glad you stayed here!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Beautiful home on lakefront. Tastefully decorated, very clean and comfortable. Remodeled bathrooms with ample towels and really nice showers. Having 2 full baths with 4 teens was extremely helpful. Two living rooms with TV and a big dinner table allows everyone space. Loved the extra touches of smore fixins and coffee pods. Kids enjoyed the kayak and paddleboards in addition to dock fishing. The week would have been perfection if the weather had been a little more cooperative."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Wonderful place to stay, very friendly host, will be back again!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Very nice place with a great view of the lake and sunsets. Quiet neighborhood and safe, was able get several 3 mile runs in easily! Host was very nice and friendly. Will be back!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We were repeat customers and everything was as good as last year. Good safe spot for a boat off the main waters, but can access the river and lake in a few minutes. Everything at the house worked for us and we didn't need to contact the owner for any additional questions or concerns."
2023-10-01,4,Group trip,Quaint and cozy cabin with a beautiful sunrise view.
2023-09-01,5,Group trip,easy and clean 👍
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Very cozy residence within a few minutes of the raceway and great local restaurants, and right on the water with enough water traffic to give that “on the lake” feel, without staying immediately on the lake. Highly recommended."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Awesome place! Great location and responsive host. Amazing view
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This channel-side cottage is great! Excellent access to Shawano Lake AND the Wolf River via the channel. You have to launch your boat at one of the public boat landings but then you are able to keep your boat moored at the dock right in back of the cottage. There's a long stretch of gravel in front of the cottage for you to park both your truck and trailer on while you're there.
The cottage is nicely equipped with plenty of towels, clean bed linens, and lots of kitchen supplies. (We didn't do a whole lot of cooking though, because there are lots of great food options in and around Shawano Country!) The hosts are working on upgrading the cottage, and it's already very nice. One item that could use updating yet is the mattress in the master bedroom. Everything else was great!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay!
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay! My family and I stayed here while visiting friends on Shawano Lake. We were able to easily launch our kayaks from the dock and the main lake was a 5 minute paddle away. The place was clean and well kept. Would definitely stay there again.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great place with a beautiful location! Cabin is beautiful, clean and simple! We loved our stay!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,Adorable little place! Definitely would stay again.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Our family of five enjoyed our week at the cottage. It was perfect! Very clean, perfect size for our needs, backyard/dock were relaxing, all the amenities we needed, and the neighborhood was nice.
We were only a few min from downtown Shawano and enjoyed: Shawano Park (beach), Wolf Rover tubing, consignment shopping, coffee shops, and a few restaurants.
We have friends in Appleton, Green Bay, and Clintonville and we were able to spend time there (Bay Beach, Clintonville Fireworks, etc) while we stayed at the cottage.
We def plan to visit again!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great location on the water for your boat, you can get to the lake in 2 mins. Right by The Lighthouse bar and grill. The living room and kitchen area was very spacious. Lots of new kitchen items to use. We enjoyed the yard by the lake for yard games and a fire at night. Host was very great at answering all my questions. 5 stars."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great location!! Very clean and nicely furnished. Also a nice quiet area. We would stay again!
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Judy’s place was the perfect place to relax for the weekend. It had the cabin feel with everything I needed to have a comfortable experience.
The river was so close and beautiful, the living room has beautiful large windows that allowed me to feel like I was right outside. I was able to have a fire and watch the swans on the water. It was a perfect location, I felt like I was out in the wilderness yet town was minutes away.
I will definitely return. Judy was a wonderful host, very kind and responsive. Thank you for a great stay."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,Was great experience
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Great location, beautiful water view, fun decor, clean"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Our family of 6 stayed here while we were in the area for an event at USAIR Motorsports Raceway. Less than 10 minutes from the track was so very helpful. It was perfect for our family. We walked in to the most sweet sign ""Welcome Race fans"" on a rainbow board. That's the moment we felt right at home. It's clean, beautifully decorated and in a perfect spot to watch the sun rise over the lake. We LOVED the kitchen and the kids had a great time on their ""own floor"" in the attic area which has 3 beds. This space has a cabin feel with a modern splash, which I enjoyed. The host is on top of things, informative and helpful. I HIGHLY recommend this space. We've got it saved in our list of favorites and will be back soon."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Great stay , perfect location and amazing views."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"I loved this Cottage, I could easily see myself returning. Everything was very well thought out, including the extra blakets for a chillly night. The second floor bedroom was so much larger than expected but the stairs are narrow if that something you cant navigate. We were fine though, and very happy."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Where do I start?! Michelle was amazing. Even before booking she was very responsive to all the questions I had. We wanted a place on the lake with kayaks and a dock for a boat. Michelle’s place had it all. She gave me great tips on places to rent a pontoon boat from, places to eat, and other things to do in the area. She very much wants her guests to be comfortable and enjoy their time.
Location, location, location!Michelle’s place is located at the end of a dead end street which just adds more to the peacefulness. The views from the living room and bedroom were some of the most beautiful views I’ve seen. I had my teenage daughter and her friend with. They absolutely loved the loft area. It was perfect for them. The kitchen is adorable and has anything you could possibly need.
Thank you Michelle! We can’t wait to come back next year!!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Cheery cottage was perfect for our little lake getaway weekend! It was quiet and quaint with great finishing touches inside the home. Would definitely recommend if you’re in the area!
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Staying at Michelle's AirBnB gives you the feeling that you are staying in a friend's lakehouse. The home is clean, comfortably furnished, the kitchen is very well stocked, and there is great seating on the deck overlooking the lake. It's refreshing to find an owner who provides enough staples and supplies for a guest's stay, including firewood stacked near the fire pit and a full tank of propane for the grill.

We enjoyed our time on Shawano Lake and would stay here again. The stairs to the converted attic bedroom are a bit challenging--we're assuming that an ongoing renovation plan includes a railing."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This place was perfect for our family. Right on the water, so easy to get to the boat launch and docked our boat right out the front door. Was really nice to have access to kayaks. The lake was just the right size and fun to hang out on. Was a nice area for a morning walk too! We made ourselves right at home and didn’t miss anything as the amenities met all of our needs."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Great place to disconnect. It felt like home. Neighbors were super friendly. Very clean with lots of amenities. I will certainly plan to return.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Michelle was a fabulous hostess! So responsive from the day I inquired all the way throughout our stay- we had a few questions and she immediately responded. She also gave us some great suggestions as to restaurants and things in the area. The neighbors were also very friendly and had nothing but great things to say about Michelle as well. We had a great time on the water with boat rentals right around the corner within walking distance. Thank you Michelle and hope to visit you again soon!
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"this home was lovely! it was bigger than expected. neighbors were so helpful and friendly! I loved the decor and totally appreciated all the little amenities (towels, pillows, blankets, soap in the dispensers, Netflix log in, and wifi)"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"My husband and I were looking for a special little cottage on Shawano Lake to enjoy and make memories with our girls. We were able to bring our surf boat and keep it in the water all week. The boat landings are great (something we struggle to find at other lakes we visit). Plenty of parking for truck and
trailer on site. Wifi, grill, fire pit, wood
The cottage was soooo cute, cozy, clean and had so many excellent amenities and ""special touches"" that were so welcoming. We cooked out, swam, boated, & watched the Fireworks from our boat! Our girls caught big frogs and had so much fun. The neighbors on both sides were really friendly!
The host Michelle was so fast to reply to any questions we had. The home was just all around great. My girls just loved the loft upstairs. Beds were all so comfortable for each of us. They even let us bring our Boxer, Millie.
We highly recommended this cabin if you are looking for a really special gem of a place. We will be back"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place! If you can get a boat rental it would be worth it as the lake is very weedy
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This was one of our favorite stays so far! We got married at the Crescent Ballroom/ Stubborn Bros and this was so convenient to be right next door with our bridal party. It had a super cozy and welcoming feel to it!

Second, she leaves water bottles in the fridge and an awesome selection of coffee & creamer! Third, it’s a fully stocked house, so just like at home! All the way down to sugar and some seasonings! Her place is super cute and nicely updated! It’s about a block from the county park beach, you’re able to see it from the front door! It’s a very safe & friendly neighborhood!

The location is great if you want the amenities (boat launch, playground, beach, etc.) of the nearby Shawano County Park but are looking for less camp like overnight accommodations. The house was clean and welcoming. Stephanie and Tyler’s hospitable attitude was the cherry on the top. For anyone bringing a boat along... We paid for 3 days of overnight boat launch fees right away on day 1 and were able to park our vehicle with the boat trailer overnight, directly in front of the house. Enjoy your stay!"
2020-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"My family enjoyed our long weekend at this charming cottage next to Lake Shawano. Being right next to the county park was a huge bonus, our front yard had a playground, well kept sandy beach, picnic tables and an ice cream stand all within 100 yards. The kids loved it. The cottage looks like it was recently renovated and the owners did a great job with the upgrades. Nice they provided bottled water and quality coffee for us. The list of restaurantz and things to do in nearby Shawano were much appreciated. Tried out the Torch Light for Friday night fish Fry. Busy place but good food. Breakfasts at Angies Cafe and Farm Inn were tasty. The Stubborn Brothers brewery was a hit with the adults as well. We all liked the mini golf course in town. We drove a half hour over to Hayman Falls County Park which had fun hiking trails and a swimming hole for the kids. They did a ton of swimming at the beach too. Great place to stay with the family. Would certainly stay again."
2020-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The location is great, you just walk to the beach. The beach is not too crowded and clean as the maintaince was keep cleaning up. There are lots of picnic benches and tables you can relax. Our kids enjoyed swimming, we rented a boat , did tubing, went for mini golf!
The cottage is very clean, has everything !"
2020-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,Great little place! Great location! Everything we needed and more!
2020-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My family and I loved staying at this cottage! It was very clean, comfortable and large enough to accommodate our family of four. It had all the things we needed to feel at home (coffee maker, stove, microwave, TVs in each room, air conditioner; no Wi-Fi but we didnt really need it during our short stay) and all the decorations/furniture made the place feel very cozy. We especially loved how close the cottage was to the park/beach (a 1-2 minute walk), which made this mini-vacation super relaxing. For example, we spent the whole day on Monday swimming in the lake, sunbathing on the beach and grilling in the park. We also made s'mores in the fire pit in front of the cottage. Our short but extremely relaxing trip was perfect thanks to Stephanie's great hospitality. We had a lot of questions before the trip and she provided quick and very helpful answers/recommendations to make our stay even more enjoyable. Her communication with us before/during/after the stay has been very friendly and prompt, and we really appreciated that. We look forward to staying here again in the future :)"

2022-01-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Will’s place was a perfect weekend get away.

Home was spacious, very clean, beds were comfortable and Will even put snacks out for us after our long drive in. Thank you Will!"
2021-11-01,5,Stayed one night,Wonderful home on plenty of land to roam and for the pups. Will greeted us at the site to go over a few things we would have had questions on.

2021-09-01,5,Group trip,Will was very accommodating and helped us a lot with allowing us to use the property a little longer than we expected. The property is incredible and extremely clean. I would recommend staying here and we plan on coming back to stay here again!

2021-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,Traveled back to the United States after living in Japan. Stayed at multiple hotels during this vacation and all were dives! Was a breath of fresh air staying at Will’s. Had more than enough room to stretch out and the place was cozy and clean.

2021-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,Will is the perfect host and his home is a gem.
2021-05-01,3,Stayed a few nights,Will met me at the rental and kindly helped me inside with groceries and luggage. He also brought over a stopper for the bathtub and some Epsom salts when I asked if tub could be used. He has done quite a bit of work updating his property but I'm afraid it needs more at the price.
2021-05-01,5,Group trip,"This was nice secluded place very close to Shawano Lake. It was an old farm place with an old barn, garage and grainery, it was fun to walk around and look. You are not to go inside the buildings. House was fine. nothing fancy but functional, no complaints. We rented the house with our kids and their significant others. Will was very responsive to any questions or help with anything we needed."
2020-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We really enjoyed our time at Wills place. It was the perfect mix of serenity with close access to Shawano Lake yet close to town for anything one would need. It was a relaxing escape with an abundance of wildlife. Also we were able to view Jupiter/Saturn without need of a telescope because of the country quite. Will’s place was extremely clean and we look forward to our next trip there. We will definitely stay at Will’s place in the future if it is available.

2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"Cute place! Exactly as pictured. Passed the smell test with flying colors (I’m very sensitive to smells), I’ve experienced some rentals that have funky odors and it ruins the entire experience. The kitchenette and bathroom seem brand new, VERY nice. Check-in was easy. It was peaceful & quiet setting. On the lake which is so nice. Very close to town where there are cute shops. Easy parking. Roku tv was easy to log into my Netflix. My favorite thing about the entire place/experience were the white soft and fluffy TOWELS!!! They are better than the towels at any luxury resort I’ve been to, even Four Seasons Costa Rica! I took two showers just for this fact even though I only stayed one night. I’d love to come back, what a great place to relax!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"Very cute, clean place. Was a perfect space for us (a couple). Check in and out was very simple and quick. The fall colors in this area was beautiful (mid October). Highly recommend for a weekend stay."

2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is my second time staying at the Clausen's Cottage and it is just wonderful! Shawano has lots to do as far as bars, restaurants and shopping but if you want to stay in you can enjoy the beautiful fire pit or the screened in porch w/tv, grill & table top fireplace. Fishing and kayaking were on my list to do and both were just great. The river was calm to kayak on and there is even a bar & grill close enough to kayak to. I also caught lots of fish right off the dock. Everything was pristine and comfortable. You would think its never been used right when you walk in. I will be coming back yearly - I highly recommend Clausen's Cottage for a relaxing vacay!"

2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Excellent place in the heart of Wisconsin Lakes country. Walking distance to 2 restaurants, less than 1.5 miles to 3 more restaurants. Less than one mile to great beach and easy on off boat launch at Shawano County park. Loved playing Golden Tee to wind down for the night. Best part was the huge fire pit area where we had s’mores, great convo and a ton of laughs the whole stay. Would highly recommend this place and Steve was an awesome host!"

2022-08-01,5,Stayed over a week,"I was able to secure a reservation for Reel Paradise for lodging during a visit to Shawano for work rather than vacation. Having such a neat place to come and relax each day is so awesome, it's like a working vacation. The cabin gives a warm home feeling and is a very comfortable hideaway. Steve was an excellent host, we communicated back and forth a good bit during my stay, he was always right there! I hope my next trip to Shawano that this house will be available!"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is a great place for a family to stay. There is lots of room with three bed, two of which are located upstairs and one on the main level. It is in a great location to the county park which has a beach and a boat launch. It is a short drive to the grocery store, shopping and restaurants. There is a washer and dryer with detergent. There a fully functioning kitchen with fridge, stove, dishwasher, microwave, and even a toaster. They have anything you would need to cook and eat with. They even have dishes for kids. There is a six person dining table. The shower was very nice with three head settings. We found many types of board games to play. There is a tv and large couch with a large big bean bag chair that we enjoyed. There is a fire pit with four chairs around it but also a bench around the porch. They also have a grill. Neither the grill nor the fire pit seemed to have supplies so you will need to bring your own I suppose. It was very dark when we arrived and no lighting from the parking to the door except some solar lights on the ground around the firepit so you may need to use a light of some sort if you arrive after dark but otherwise not a problem. the secured pinpad is a nice extra security except you will need to learn the trick to it. Once you get it down though, it's not a problem. We enjoyed our stay and it was just what we needed."
2022-07-01,5,Group trip,"Great location, super nice inside, cozy and clean. We will be back in the future!"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Steve's place was very well cleaned and came with all the necessary accommodations (towels, shampoo & conditioner, etc..), We will definitely be back!"

2024-04-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Wonderful cottage with a cabin feel! the lake and accompanying park/beach is right outside the door. The decoration of the interior was very nice. We found that the futon in the living room was far more comfortable than the bed (personal preference). Wish the kitchen, although small, had more baking/cooking supplies (baking sheets, pots, pans, non stick spray, etc.). In the absence of a full kitchen, the surrounding area is full of wonderful restaurants, bars, and chains. Overall we enjoyed our stay and look forward to coming back!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I absolutely loved Lorna & Stephanie’s adorable house! It was so cozy & clean. They were very helpful & communication was the best. Beautiful views & perfect location. Definitely a place to return to over & over.

The town, a short drive away, is cute with great food and drink.
So many trails and trees and beautiful farms, just an aimless drive through the country is a wonderful activity.
The cabin was just right for the two of us and provided a home base to explore from. Clean, lots of amenities and a binder full of fabulous information on the area.
Highly recommended and can't wait to come back!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We had a lovely stay at this well-located vacation cabin. Stephanie went the extra mile to make our trip perfect. We especially liked being so close to the county park and all its amenities. The beach is great, but you can also borrow equipment to play a whole host of games (from ping pong to Monopoly and beyond), and there is a snack bar too -- all within sight of the cabin. Our stay was too short, really -- just a couple nights -- but we were able to do some hiking nearby and explore/enjoy town. Lots to offer. Already dreaming of coming back for a longer vacation. Thanks, Stephanie!!"

2023-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,The cottage is right next to the county park so swimming and boating are just a few steps away from the front door. It is VERY quiet at night...just wonderful...didn't even hear traffic. It is a great place for young families.

2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Stephanie’s quaint house was exactly what we were looking for during our quick weekend stay in Shawano. You can see the lake from the living room and the house is on a nice quiet side street. Wifi worked great when we had little service, very clean home and plenty of space for the two of us. House rules were clear and reasonable, there was parking in the driveway available, air conditioning worked well. The home was right next to a park/boat launch. Plenty of places to find food and drink around the lake. No complaints whatsoever. Check in/out was also easy.
Thank you Stephanie for the lovely stay as well as accommodating our last minute reservation. Everything was perfect!"

Look forward to coming back in the Summer when we can utilize the firepit & lake!"
2023-12-01,5,Group trip,Amber's place is gorgeous. My family and I stayed here during the Christmas holiday. The house had plenty of room for all of us to spread out and decompress after busy days spent with family. The location is peaceful and the view of the lake is lovely. The entire house is very clean and the kitchen is well stocked with all of the essential equipment. We would love to stay here again.
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is a beautiful property. The owners have done some extensive remodeling! Our stay was during the winter so we couldn't experience the deck or the yard, but the inside was fabulous. It was so nice to have a fully functional kitchen with filtered water in the refrigerator and an ice maker. The beds were comfortable, the bathrooms were great and there was plenty of seating on both the ground level and the upstairs. The lake view is wonderful; we even got to see some people ice fishing during our visit. We would definitely stay here again!"

2021-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Relaxing! That is what I can tell you about this place. From the big tub to the great view of the lake. Amber and her husband are great communicators and were there if we ever needed something or had a question. Take some time to relax at this great location!
2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was such a wonderful place to stay in! My family and I were extremely impressed with the view and the apartment. It met and surpassed expectations, by far! We had such a wonderful time waking up to the sun over the lake, and playing card at the kitchen table! We celebrated thanksgiving here and even in the early winter, it was gorgeous! Amber and Eli were so responsive and were very on top of everything and we hope to stay with them again at some point in the future! It was a perfect weekend getaway!"
2021-10-01,5,Group trip,We enjoyed our stay! The house was clean and well appointed - and the lake access was fantastic.
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The lake house was beautifully decorated and immaculately clean. The view was stunning!! Amber (the host) put a lot of time in the little extras that weren’t expected. We loved staying there and fell in love with the area. I would highly recommend staying there.
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The place was so cute, cozy and inviting. Mike was very responsive & helpful. We don’t live too far and definitely plan to stay again for future close to home “get-aways”."

2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"If you are looking for a unique place stay in an out of the way place that is quiet and peaceful, then look no further.
The unit was clean and cozy, and the added perk of the bar area with darts, pool and pinball made this an ideal location to relax, catch up on some reading and recharge the meter."

2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was a last minute stay for us. My boyfriend and I just wanted to get away and relax, and that is exactly what we did at Mike’s place. We enjoyed the common area so much. What a nice piece of history being restored. We can’t wait to return with friends and family."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Second time staying was great!
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,We only stayed here for one night but definitely will come back. There is a great bbq and bar across the street and the room was very comfortable! It was exactly what we were looking for.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place. It was quite but also had entertainment places close by.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Wow Mike, you have a gorgeous place. The appliances, kitchenware etc. were absolutely perfect & anyone would need for their stay. Beautiful flooring throughout, fantastic bathroom & sitting area. Your attention-to-detail i.e. TV trays, night stands etc, etc. all reflected the effort you have put into this new remodel. We even enjoyed the beautiful ""common area"" and played a game of darts & pool. And thanks for making a campfire available complete with wood & chairs. What a great touch to begin our ""Up Nort"" experience. And even a public boat landing on a beautiful lake less than two blocks from your driveway. Perfect!
Very very nice. Thanks Mike!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a wonderful weekend with many area lakes and restaurants to visit. Our rental was quiet, clean, comfortable and the kitchen was well-stocked with dishes and cookware. The old bar area had a really neat area to play pool or darts. There is a tavern right across the street where everyone was friendly and welcoming too. We are looking forward to our next stay here!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very beautiful location! Awesome views inside and out! Thank You!
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,This was a surprise getaway for my parent’s anniversary. They loved the space and enjoyed taking their kayaks out on the lake.

2024-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,Great location
2024-01-01,5,Stayed one night,Awesome loved the lake
2024-01-01,5,Stayed one night,A+
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"Clean place with beautiful scenery, perfect for a weekend getaway. Great local recommendations by the host. Exceeded all expectations. Will definitely be back!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We cannot wait to come back! I walked in the door and said immediately, “let’s come here all the time!”
The view, the simplicity, the cozy factor, and soft sheets made it such a delightful stay."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"The only thing you could hear from the large cozy back deck was the geese and the crickets at night. Every star in the sky lit up the lake view. Kitchen is stocked well, and overall it is a RECOMMEND for peace and quiet."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,Very accommodating on short notice booking and late check-in.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Experience matched listing. We enjoyed our time in Gresham. Thank you
2023-09-01,4,Stayed one night,Great location to get away. Very friendly Lutheran Church nearby.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,Nice quiet place. Beautiful with the lake right behind. The added amenities were nice and it was nicely decorated. Recommend staying there and I'll return if I get another opportunity.
2023-08-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful view and a very comfy stay. Quiet surroundings and enjoyed the peaceful getaway. Only downside was the algae was along much of the exterior of the lake so a boat was needed for the best fishing experience.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Clean, updated, and great view of the lake. 2nd bed is just a foldable foam pad that went on the floor but worked fine for a kid. Would stay again!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Had a kid free long weekend for our 10 year wedding anniversary. We weren’t looking to go out every day and do a bunch of stuff so this place was perfect. The views were incredible and enjoyed fishing off the dock. The host was extremely responsive.
2023-07-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Very clean place to stay. It was smaller than expected and we didn’t know it was connected to another home. There wasn’t much to do in the area unless you drive somewhere else. It was a very quiet place which was nice.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What a wonderful little place! Probably the best Air BnB we've stayed at yet. The space is a studio but has a full bathroom and nice kitchen space with an oven. The deck overlooking the lake is such a lovely place to relax. We will be back!
A few things:
If you plan to cook a lot of meals there, check what cooking utensils there are before you go grocery shopping. The kitchen was well stocked with plates, bowls, cups, knives and silverware but lacked just about everything else. A tongs and a strainer would have been handy for us. There were two fry pans, a large pot with a cover and a pizza pan. The gas grill is very nice.
There is a small hole in the screen door that another patron mentioned. This allows bugs to get in.
The fishing kayaks were an awesome bonus, however whoever used them last put them right under a pine tree so they kayaks were full of pine needles. Took a good portion of my morning hauling water from the kitchen sink out to the kayaks to rinse them out."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Sunset Studio on Red Lake was the perfect home base for our 3-day stay in the Gresham area. The lake is beautiful and the views from the studio are even better than the pictures! The space was pristine, well appointed, spacious, and relaxing. Excellent AC, too (it was very hot during our stay, so we really appreciated that!). Loved our morning coffee on the deck overlooking the lake. Tim was a super responsive, extremely friendly host, too! Overall, this was a great stay on a lovely, peaceful lake less than a 5-minute drive from downtown Gresham. I'd definitely stay here again and will be recommending it to others, as well."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"My son and I enjoyed or stay at Sunset Suite. Communication was great and the hosts went “above and beyond”.
Sunset appears to be half of an old cottage that the hosts are renovating and they’ve done a beautiful job w/ the Sunset side. Everything looked new and it was very clean. My son was happy to see the TV and Firestick so he could continue his 2-year binge of Dude Perfect videos.
The master bed was very comfortable and while the 2nd bed is a floor mattress, my son said it was very comfortable too. Loved the lakeside deck for morning quiet times and very much appreciated the fishing kayaks.
Things worth noting:
Sunset is a studio (as the listing heading states), not a 1-bedroom as stated in details. A listing edit there would be good.
Heavy rain on departure day revealed a leak above the new patio door. I’d check to make sure it’s been repaired.
The lake is quite weedy. We still caught some nice fish but until they came by with the weed eater, boating was a little tough."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,We enjoyed our stay. Everything was clean and very nice. When we asked for a fire pit. It was brought over within an hour with two big stacks of wood. Great host!
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Wonderful scenic and peaceful spot. All the rooms were very clean, the kitchen was well supplied with equipment and it met all our needs. We are planning on staying there again next summer. I hope next summer I have time to use the kayak."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Tim, who co-hosted with Novitiate, is very communicative and responds to any situation that arises. We had a minor issue that Tim was extremely helpful with. The Sunset Suite is beautiful, efficient, and a perfect place for a getaway on a lake. 10/10 would come back to stay."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Absolutely tranquil location on a lake near Gresham. Quiet, and watching the sun go down over the lake is a sublime experience. Only thing I would change -- the curtains are gossamer white, and since the sun is up early in the summertime, you will be too."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,Beautiful place in a beautiful setting. Debbie was a 5 Star communicator when an issue came up and resolved it masterfully. I wish it had been warm enough to take out the kayaks (we visited early spring) because the lake is surprisingly undeveloped and quiet…absolutely gorgeous. Highly recommend!
2023-02-01,5,Stayed one night,Nice quiet place! Full kitchen with necessary utensils! Bed was very comfortable
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great price for a cozy studio on a nice lake! We were there to ice fish for the weekend. Good experience.

2024-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"My wife and I brought my parents to Camp Miller for an early Spring getaway, and the cabin made for a fabulous long weekend! We made many fires in the woodburning fireplace, enjoyed the peace and quiet and nature surrounding the cabin, and a couple of great restaurants in the area. Check in was easy, the cabin was very clean and well-stocked with provisions and cooking supplies, and the location was great for stopping into Cecil or Shawano. Would definitely recommend!"
2024-03-01,4,Stayed with a pet,This Airbnb was a great weekend getaway to relax in nature. We really appreciated how dog friendly it was. We found a lovely hike at a nature center nearby too.
2024-02-01,4,Stayed with a pet,Nice little cabin. Enjoyed the fireplace the most.
2024-02-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Wood burning fireplace in a cabin on the lake with nice Winter views. Everything we were hoping for without any surprises and a very peaceful neighborhood at that. We had a great time at Becca and Matt's cabin and would be thrilled to rent again next time we're in the area.

2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Camp Miller is the perfect spotlessly clean getaway nest. A peaceful comfy cabin with the world’s BEST fireplace! The kitchen has everything needed, plus more. We spent Thanksgiving weekend cooking and eating our feast, all while watching movies above a gorgeous and warming fire :)
Becca is outstanding - wonderfully responsive and helpful! This was our 3rd stay and we will definitely return again!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We really enjoyed the peaceful atmosphere and comfortable accommodations. Cabin just as it was described. Will come back.
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We stayed in the fall with our 2 dogs and had a nice long weekend hiking and relaxing by the fireplace in the evening. The cabin had a great view of the lake and trees, and the area was super quiet."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Becca was extremely responsive and understanding when we voiced a concern. The property is gorgeous and I just wish we had had time to take the canoe out!
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Great get away! Clean, comfy. Excellent host!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with a pet,I didn't even realize I grew up 20 minutes from here! the little lake was gorgeous! we even got out in the canoe for a little bit! Swans every morning on the lake was a great bonus! We will be back!
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Becca was awesome. I had already read her post about the naming of Camp Miller, so that made the location even more special. My wife and I have four children and a new Granddaughter, so Camp Miller was an appropriate place for us!
Everything was as advertised and we would recommend this to all."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"As advertised, everything you need and very pet friendly. Clean and charming. Area is very quiet and peaceful."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Amazing stay. We booked it for a packer game plus an extra night. It was the perfect place to unwind for two couples on a kid free getaway!
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great little getaway! Plenty of sleeping space, great views, and so peaceful! Becca was very responsive during the booking process and answered all of our questions. Would definitely recommend this place, any time of the year."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Another amazing, restful stay at Camp Miller! The little cabin had everything we needed. Can’t wait to return ❤️"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Had a wonderful vacation. Wish the lake was a little more clearer for a more peaceful view but very quite location. Perfect location for us and everything we wanted to do. Host went above and beyond with hand written notes and extra amenities such as popcorn for family movie night, toothpaste, razors, soaps in case we happen to forget which we did! Accommodations also for our fur children which we really appreciated! Very responsive to any questions we had during our stay. Cabin is very well kept with updates but also cabin charm. Definitely would recommend staying again. Loved reading all the notes from previous bookings and their own experiences. A++ for the whole experience."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My husband and I were looking for a relaxing getaway to celebrate our 2nd anniversary and our 1st year of parenting. Camp Miller was exactly what we needed. Clean, quiet, cozy, had all the necessities. We enjoyed sunsets from the deck and dock, grilling out, and a day at the beach about a mile or so from the cabin. Becca was super responsive and communicated instructions ahead of time. We really felt at home and would LOVE to come again!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We loved our stay at Camp Miller! It was so peaceful there and a great way to relax and recharge. We loved that we could bring our pup and that there was a lot of space out back for her to run around. We went canoeing, swimming at Shawano County Park, shopping, and visited Twigs. It was wonderful and we would stay again!"
2023-08-01,4,Stayed with a pet,"Liked the house and the clean air. Canoeing in the small water body was good. Nearby offleash dog park at Shawano county dog park was great place for the over active dog. Also went to brown county dog park in green bay which is a pleasant surprise for its rustic ambience.
Wish the water body in front of the house is cleaner and the place has less mosquitoes. Becca did have enough mosquito repellents available but couldnt enjoy the fire pit outside because of mosquitoes. Her collection of books is really diverse and interesting. Overall great place to stay for few days especially with the dog, highly recommended for a short family outing. Her kitchen stock and utensils are also perfect for making simple meals."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We enjoyed our stay at Camp Miller! Central location and close to Shawano Lake, golf courses, downtown, and restaurants/bars. It was a peaceful getaway!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"My dog Misty and I had a wonderful mid-week stay. The cabin was cozy, and the yard and deck were great for reading, relaxing and watching sunsets. Had fun going in to town on Wednesday night to watch the Shawano Ski Sharks water ski show - lots of talent in that group! Thanks Becca for sharing your lovely cabin with me and Misty."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My third time staying at Camp Miller.❤️ Such a great spot for a relaxing getaway. Quiet and peaceful, great bird watching too. Such a bonus that leashed dogs are welcome! Everything you need is provided. I love cooking on the gas grill overlooking the lake. Can’t wait to come back!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Becca's place was wonderful. Perfect place to have a quiet relaxing weekend. We had an issue with the AC once we arrived and she was quick to respond as well as was quick to come out and fix it for us. We loved we were able to bring our dog with as well. I would 100% recommend this place!
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This was our 3rd time back at camp Miller and while we didn't get to stay as long as we'd have liked, our trip was no less loved. We absolutely adore that little cabin and can definitely sense the love and care that went into making it such a special charming place. We can't wait to come back."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,If you are looking for a retreat with your furbabies this is the place to go! Quaint cabin with a peacefulness that cannot be described.

It was the perfect getaway with our dog, Rodgers! 🐾 We enjoyed restful days by the fireplace, as it was still snowy and chilly outside when we visited. We appreciated so much of this cabin: the kitchen amenities for cooking together, the provided WiFi so we could watch a few of our favorite shows, and ALL that space! Our favorite part was being able to bring our 8 year old dog. We’ve never had the chance to take him on vacation with us before, so this was an extra special memory for us to make.
Becca and Matt, you’re doing something right by letting this place be a haven for dog parents!
Keep it up! As a thank you, I hope you enjoy the small cross stitch hoop I made for y’all while we were getting some much needed R&R at Camp Miller!"
2023-03-01,4,Stayed with a pet,"The cabin is cozy and the scenery is beautiful. We had a nice, quiet getaway with our dogs."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This was our second time staying at the cabin. Becca, the host, is incredibly helpful and responsive. I appreciate the attention to detail. The cabin is comfortable and clean. Extremely happy with our stay, once again!"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,We loved it!
2023-01-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Nice, clean stay!"
2022-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Great two-spacious-bedroom cabin right off the lake/pond. Had everything you would need for a brief getaway — Wi-Fi, heat, full bathroom, ample seating, etc."
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Spot was perfect for us and very cozy especially with a fire as it snowed outside!

2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Camp Miller was cozy and peaceful. I had work in the area and it was a perfect retreat after meetings.
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Camp Miller is the perfect spot away from it all. A view of the water in the woods, all the basics and more. The pictures don’t do Camp Miller justice - it was just what we needed to unplug and still convenient to Lambeau Stadium and nearby Shawano, including Stubborn Brothers Brewery. Becca is a wonderful host and it exceeded our expectations - we hope to stay again."
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very cute and comfortable refuge with beautiful nature view just out the dining and living room windows. Wonderful deck to drink you morning coffee watch the wildlife in the pond.
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We had a great time at Camp Miller. It’s a nice cozy getaway and you’re provided with everything you would need. The hosts were great and I would recommend staying here.
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Second amazing stay. Very clean, quiet, and cozy. Working with Becca is a breeze. Dog friendly!"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We loved our stay at this little cabin. It was the perfect getaway for the kids, my husband and I. Close to Shawano and Cecil. The kind size bed was super comfortable, and all amenities included. We hope to be back and would recommend!"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed with a pet,A great cozy cabin for a weekend getaway! Very quiet and a great place to unplug and relax. Becca was great and super helpful!
2022-10-01,5,Stayed with a pet,great Airbnb! we would definitely return!
2022-10-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Amazing cabin, Becca and Matt were so attentive, they thought about everything to make our stay comfortable and memorable.
They surprised us with every detail. Our entire family enjoyed it. It’s a great place to getaway we totally recommend it."
2022-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Camp Miller is a wonderful cabin! It’s comfortable, well appointed and the location is great!"
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We stayed for 2 days and loved the quiet and close to nature set up. The house has everything one needs to calm down and relax: Fireplace, lakeview and a really nice kitchen set up. Taking the canoe for a quick paddle is also fun."
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is an incredible, cozy place on a quiet lake. You can relax on the dock, in the hammock, on the deck, or by the fireplace. Take a quiet ride around the lake in the canoe, or hike around the small lake. You won't want to leave."
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The perfect cabin for an up north getaway. Exactly as described, we had everything we needed. Beautiful lake view and lots of wildlife. Can’t wait to go back!"
2022-09-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We had such an amazing week long stay at this cabin. The whole place is very well thought out, even details concerning our dog. There’s tons to do here, whether it’s relaxing outside or watching a movie and playing games in the living area. We got out on the canoe a few times and had a good time, but the lake is pretty shallow. The kitchen is well equipped and the water is treated. Overall we had a great time and definitely plan to return!"
2022-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,This was a great stay in the Shawano area. It sits on a cute calm pond which makes for a picturesque view. Our little family of 6 had a great time! It was so quiet and peaceful. It was pretty well stocked and had just what we needed!
2022-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,It’s cute little cabin off a little lake. The location is great as there are a lot of accessible docks for fishing and parks for kids to enjoy.
2022-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"From the moment we arrived, we could tell that a lot of thought and care went into making Camp Miler what it is. The neighborhood itself is quiet, without much traffic. The home was very clean and had all amenities described. The deck has a beautiful view of a large pond, and we even took the canoe out a couple of times. (I think probably early spring or late fall would be best for this, in general, because of the plant life in the pond.) We appreciated having a full-size washer and dryer in the home, as well as a handheld shower head, since we travel with a special needs child who needs assistance with this. If you need to message Becca, she responds quickly. The price was quite reasonable for the area."
2022-08-01,4,Stayed with a pet,"My mom, my dog, and I had an enjoyable stay. The location was so quiet and private. The sunsets over the lake were beautiful. The location was great, and it was a short drive into town or to other lakes. They weren't lying when they said it is sandy there. I was really thankful for the bathroom being located so close to the front door so I could carry my dog to the shower and use the detachable showerhead to rinse her paws and tummy off. We liked having access to the canoe. The king bed was really comfortable. I don't recommend sleeping on the bottom bunk bed (you will feel every spring and one at the bottom of the bed will scratch you if you're tall). Overall, we had a great time and are excited to return to the area in the future. Also, don't miss Yoder's Bakery if you're there when they're open!"
2022-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"What a wonderful little cabin! It was the perfect size for our family of four. We spent most of the time we were home on the deck watching the water and relaxing. The cabin was as described and it was just a lovely, peaceful place to stay. The kids enjoyed the games, too. I loved the big square table!"
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a wonderful time at Becca and Matt’s cabin. Becca was quick to respond to our questions and the cabin was clean and cozy. The setting was quiet, relaxing, and just as you see in the pictures. If we’re ever back in the area, we’ll stay again."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This Airbnb was such an amazing place! It looks exactly like the photos and is a perfect size for 2-4 people to stay in. The location is very quiet and is pet friendly. The lake is great for canoeing, however you can’t swim in it. Lake Shawano is about a 10 min drive from this location and they have public beach access there, and they also have a dog beach where your furry friend can swim :). Driving into town also takes about 10 min where there is gas stations and places to eat. The hosts are also amazing and respond to any questions very quickly. I definitely recommend staying here!"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,This cabin is a small slice of heaven. This was our 2nd trip here and we absolutely loved it. We always enjoy our time spent here and love the area. We look forward to coming back asap!

2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very private and quiet. Safe for dogs and children. We loved the atmosphere in the cabin.
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Cozy and rejuvenating!
My wife, dog and I are city dwellers. We unplugged and really enjoyed our handful of nights at ‘Camp Miller.’ We would love to return.
Several recommendations:
-Saturday-only: Yoder’s Bakery. I’m not even a donut lover but holy cow. We bought a glazed donut each, ate em outside then went back to buy more
-Milo’s Poultry Farm is also nearby and has amazing self-serve farm eggs
-Keep your eyes peeled for farms and self-serve stands all over selling anything from meat to honey
-Host’s suggestions are all excellent
-Walks around the lake are 40 min. Watch for turtles on the pavement
Enjoy!"
2022-05-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Just lovely! We truly enjoyed our stay, and I think our pup loved it even more! Perfect deck for throwing the frisbee, and perfect house for unwinding."
2022-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Becca’s place is the perfect getaway space if you just need to escape into nature, but still want the comforts of home. The sunsets over the lake are just incredible and the space inside is clean, cozy, and well kept. My city dog loved the outdoor space to run around and just be a dog. Definitely recommend this hidden gem."

2022-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Hands down one of the best Airbnb’s we have ever stayed at. Usually I wipe down everything in an Airbnb because germs but Becca’s place is immaculate and smells like Tide laundry the moment you walk in. I have never stayed somewhere that is so peaceful and quiet. Truly a slice of heaven here. Book now! I can’t wait to return in the fall/winter 😊
2021-12-01,5,Group trip,The cabin is exactly as advertised. We had ample space for our family of five to sleep and hang out. The cabin was clean and well kept and excellent communication from the hosts. We would definitely stay again and would recommend this cabin to our friends and/or family.
2021-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Amazing little cabin- so cozy. Great amenities. Had a nice amount of cook ware and utensils which was great since we love to cook. Super beautiful view out the back sliding door. Becca (host) was very helpful and had great communication. We will definitely be back.
2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Perfect getaway! This cabin is so adorable and nicely kept. We spent Thanksgiving weekend and absolutely enjoyed this little gem! Our two senior dogs did as well. We relaxed by the fire, played games, watched a movie and simply relaxed. Becca was super responsive and check-in was easy! Would love to go back in the summer to canoe and fish. Highly recommend!!!"

The cabin is very thoughtfully decorated and full of inspiration. We also loved all the recommendations that the host has put together. I'd definitely recommend Becca's place, especially for dog owners!"
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Becca is a wonderful host! She was very communicative and helpful. She even contacted us when she found a sentimental piece of jewelry we left behind and has offered to help get it back to us! The surroundings are gorgeous!

2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Our stay at Camp Miller was perfect. The cabin is modern and cozy and the location can't be beat. We loved the outdoor environment with the canoe and dock for fishing. The stars around the fire pit at night were incredible too. We would definitely stay again.
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Amazing place! The location and views are great! Really nice deck for wildlife watching and morning coffee. Thoughtful hosts that provide everything you could possibly need. Camp Miller is the perfect “up north” getaway.
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What a fantastic place to stay. They provided everything that we needed and more to make our stay great. We enjoyed the wooden decorative touches Inside and out. Watching the wildlife was a big highlight of our stay. It was so nice to be able to enjoy peace and quiet, while sitting on the deck. There is a very nice county park nearby with a beach and playground on Shawano Lake. Plenty of stores and restaurants in town. One of the best places we've ever stayed. Looking forward to
going back next year."
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,My son and I work a lot and this was just the little getaway we needed to recharge. The cabin was super cute and the view of the lake in the morning with a cup of coffee can’t be beat. I loved that I was able to bring my dog and little amenities left just for him like doggie towels! Becca was great and we can’t wait to go back.

2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We had a wonderful stay at Camp Miller mid week to accommodate some work being done on our own home. The cottage is absolutely adorable and eat-off-the floor clean. Becca and her family have obviously put a lot of thought and love into their getaway. It’s in a great location and the neighborhood is perfectly quiet and peaceful. I can imagine a family having a wonderful time there. Can’t wait to stay again in the future!!

We had everything we needed and were a short distance away from anything we wanted to do. We felt so lucky to get to enjoy Camp Miller! Would highly recommend.
2021-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We loved our stay at this little cabin on the lake! The lake was wonderfully calm and quiet — no motorboats — so we got to fully enjoy the wildlife that lives there. We saw and heard tons of bullfrogs! What a delight! The fireflies and dragonflies were such a treat and not one of us got a single mosquito bite or tick. Thank goodness!
The cabin was perfect for what we needed — a clean and comfortable place to retreat to for the weekend. The beds were so comfy and the linens were soft and clean. The kitchen came stocked with all of the cooking essentials, so we only needed to bring the food needed for meals. The living room area was full of comfy seating and lots of options for entertainment — DVDs, books, games, etc. We also had the ability to log into our Netflix channel.
This was such a special trip and I am glad we made the time to visit. We hope to come again someday!"
