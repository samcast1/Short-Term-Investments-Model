2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"It was a nice, quiet accommodation in Decatur. Easy walking distance to coffee, restaurants, bars, etc."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great spot. So close to the some amazing bars etc yet very chilled. I will be back
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Look, we have a house in the area that i needed to clear out as we are renting it out. I know the area well and it is a fantastic location if you're visiting Decatur. I had the apartment as i needed to work and do teams calls with two European countries. The wifi was great, the office space ideal, facilities great. As always with this stuff, its all about sensible perspective. I will need to bounce back and forth and won't be looking for anywhere else. It helps that Raging Burrito is close 😂"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Unbelievable find and really friendly hosts. They took the time to put together a folder with recommendations that were spot on. If I find myself in ATL again I’ll definitely come back.
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Lovely place in quiet neighborhood. Walkable to Decatur square :)
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Extremely comfortable and clean. I enjoyed my stay and would book it again. Bruce was really nice!
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,Great stay with my baby and toddler! Would happily return!
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was the perfect home base for a busy weekend. After a brief, friendly welcome from Bruce to make sure we had everything we needed, we found the space quiet and private, surrounded by trees. My friend had the bedroom, while I slept on the futon bed which Bruce set up. Both beds were very comfortable, with nice spreads. The bathroom was clean and we appreciated the hair dryer. One note to anyone sensitive to light: bring an eye mask if you’ll be on the futon, as it’s under the skylight. Overall, a great experience in a lovely setting, close to eateries and very walkable."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was a great find!
Close to everything we needed, but quiet and peaceful.
Hosts were very flexible with our needs.
Good memories!"

2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We enjoyed staying in Bruce and Karen's Garden Apartment. Bruce was friendly and welcoming. The apartment was very clean and matched the photos. Check-in was easy. They went to the trouble to set up the futon for our son. We enjoyed the short walk to all of the action around the square in Decatur, including many excellent restaurants and some cute shops."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Nice stay in a beautiful area, close walk to Decatur restaurants"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful stay!
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The place was as described and is close to awesome restaurants as well as lovely downtown Decatur. Bruce and Karen were lovely and very engaging. Very lovely people, easy to talk to and have a great place to stay."
2024-01-01,5,Stayed about a week,"This was a marvelous spot to escape from the hubbub of a conference I was attending in the main area of Decatur. The walk wasn't nothing, but very pleasant to move through the neighborhood into the more bustling area. So many amazing restaurants nearby! It was also always easy to get a Lyft in case of poor weather or tired feet.
The welcome/info packet is one of the most personable I've ever encountered! I loved the restaurant descriptions and felt so welcomed by the friendly tone, even through writing. The space itself met and exceeded exactly my needs.
The only surprise was how thin the door was between my bathroom/desk area and what I presume is the kitchen in the main house. This wasn't a problem as I was out most of the time, but it was just slightly less private than I imagined, and I hope my morning routine of listening to a podcast over coffee didn't disturb!"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great location, quick and responsive communication, well equipped space. Enjoyed the visit and will be back."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,This was our second time staying at Bruce And Karen’s place. It’s a great spot and we love it. Bruce is always helpful and quick to respond when we need anything. We will be back!

2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We couldn't have asked for a more pleasant stay. The lodging is in a very convenient location, close to all the Decatur attractions that interested us. Bruce and Karen gave us plenty of detailed information for check-in, and the accommodations were extremely clean, modern and comfortable. I had only a brief personal encounter with Bruce, who I found to be a most congenial and interesting person who's lived in enough interesting places to form a charming world view. We'd stay there again in a heartbeat."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"It is always a delight to stay at an Airbnb that is a gem. This is! Very spacious private apartment in an ideal location for downtown Decatur. Bruce and Karen were exceptional hosts: gracious, responsive, and clear."

2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is a beautiful property. We were attending a dance event in downtown Decatur, and it was very convenient to be staying only a few blocks away. The property is a short walk from two MARTA stops, which was another plus. The hosts were extremely accommodating and flexible."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is a gem of a stay. Close enough to easily walk to downtown Decatur, but far enough to feel private and quiet. I loved the space and location."

Very peaceful and quiet location that is accessible to Marta as well as many restaurants and locally-owned shops."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,My husband and I spent 4 nights at Bruce and Karen’s place. The apartment was the perfect size for us. The living area has a lovely skylight and overlooks the backyard. They have a very nice deck. It was very hot outside but their AC worked perfectly so we were nice and cool in the apartment. The location is walking distance to the lovely square in Decatur where there are lots of great bars and restaurants. Decatur is a great location from which to explore the rest of Atlanta. We will be back and will bring our daughter as there is room for a third person. Great find!

2023-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,My family went to Decatur for a wedding and wanted to stay someplace close to everything but with the added benefit of having a kitchen and more room to spread out. Bruce was extremely helpful and responsive and the location could not have been better. Excellent value for the price and would highly recommend to others!
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a wonderful stay at Bruce and Karen’s apartment. The space was comfortable and roomy with lots of thoughtful amenities like soap and coffee creamer. They had a handmade restaurant guide with their recommendations which was very useful and fun to go through. We enjoyed trying their recommendations. The apartment is an easy walk to plenty of restaurants and two Marta stops. Everything was perfectly clean and exactly as described. We didn’t meet Karen, but Bruce was very friendly and kind. One of the best airbnbs I’ve ever stayed at!"

2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The apartment was just as described and pictured. It’s attached to the main house, but private.
The neighborhood is quiet and the apartment is at the back of the house, far from the street.
The main commercial area of the town is easily walkable as is the MARTA station. Their restaurant guide is expansive and very helpful.
They provided a nice selection of coffee and tea and a few condiments.
We met Bruce as we were checking out. Very friendly. We would stay there again"

2022-11-01,4,Stayed over a week,"A very nice apartment walking distance (3-4 blocks) to town. Lots of restaurants nearby and we really enjoyed the Dekalb Farmers Market! My husband and I stayed 3 weeks which I guess was unusual. I think it is meant to accommodate guests for one week or so. There is no washer/dryer, ice maker, oven or dishwasher, but we adjusted and called it our “ tiny house”! We wanted to be near town and we were. Our kids are in Brookhaven ( the reason for the trip) and we were surprised that it took 30 minutes (7-8 miles) to get to their house. Traffic!!"

Definitely stay here if you want a relaxing, convenient, and comfortable place to call home while you’re in Decatur."

2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Bruce and Karen are great, warm hosts. They are communicative and welcoming, but give ample space to not feel intrusive.

And the amenities were a bonus with multiple kinds of coffee, creamer, etc available, a nice deck to enjoy the beautiful Fall weather, and Roku tv. A very comfortable place to stay in a perfect location!"
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Apt was great. Fantastic location to everything in Decatur. Was well stocked with the essentials. Skylights + big trees kind of made it feel like a tree house in the living room which was pretty great. The neighborhood cat that hung out on the porch was awesome and super friendly. Would definitely stay again!

2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Had a wonderful, relaxing time! The beds are super comfortable and the shower is very spacious.

2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great location, easy walking distance to downtown as well some several parks where we went for our kids to play. Also convenient location regarding public transportation, a friend living in Atlanta was able to visit us and walk from a station to our place."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Excellent location, host and house! We choose this location as it is very close to downtown and Marta, and the closeness to Marta allowed us to take public transportation to reach out to Airport when returned. Everything works as expected, and everything I read is exactly what I experienced during my stay. Bruce is such a nice person to meet and we enjoyed the meeting and conversation with him; he always responded immediately to my questions.
The house is in the quiet street and there is a long driveway to the end where you can easily park and turn around; of course you might not need a car as you can easily walk to Avondale station or you can drive and park the car there for 24 hours.
The rooms are very nice, looks even nicer than in the picture. I felt very relaxed when in the room especially in the hot day. We are happy with the stay so simply booked it again for Fall before we left :-)."

Can highly recommend - will definitely try to come back again."
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great location, great space, and great hosts. Will be booking again if we come back to the area."
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Fantastic location - beautiful quiet neighborhood street! We barely used the car - easily walkable to downtown Decatur. The deck outside was beautiful and felt very private due to all the large trees around. The kitchen was decently stocked and they even had little creamers in the fridge for coffee. Loved the skylights in the main room - made it feel large and airy. Great place to stay if you want to explore Decatur!
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is a great place to stay! It's surrounded by trees in a quiet and safe neighborhood that's close to so many things! Bruce and Karen supplied all that we needed and then some, including a beautiful flower arrangement on the table when we arrived. The place is full of light that's filtered through beautiful greenery from surrounding trees. The place was clean and well-maintained and Bruce and Karen were great with communication. There were no problems and we definitely enjoyed our stay."

They provide their guests with an awesome directory of local restaurants, which include their own personal reviews.
My wife and I found their facility very comfortable and clean."
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Bruce and Karen's Private Garden Apartment is a beautiful Atlanta Airbnb. It's close to many places to eat and visit in Decatur, GA, and they are amicable and helpful hosts. We were in town for an event at the Fernbank Museum, and this was a perfect spot!
The windows and skylights brought the beauty of the outdoors inside. The lovely 2nd-story deck looked out over a beautiful backyard with a stunning tree. The neighbor's friendly cat also stops by to say hi. The kitchen had everything we needed for our meals, and the desk was good for getting work done in the evening. One minor thing to note is that if you are a bigger person like me, the bed might be slightly creaky.
We had a wonderful stay at their home. They made us feel very welcome, and we would recommend their place to anyone looking for a nice place to stay in Decatur! Excellent communication before arrival as well."
2022-04-01,3,Stayed a few nights,"It is never, ever my intent to harm or cause any issues with their livelihood or stream of income, but it is always my intent to be honest in my reviews, especially if it affected my health. I want to see these hosts succeed – they were very kind and responsive during our stay and I wish them the best.
However, I unfortunately experienced getting sick at this home due to poor ventilation/mold. This review will stick out like a sore thumb in a sea of great reviews, and I struggled with writing it, but it was my personal experience.
Let me start with the good stuff.
We’re from Marietta, just north of Atlanta, and chose this spot for two nights to celebrate my husband’s birthday after seeing a show at the Tabernacle (about 15 minutes away). We always enjoy Decatur and were happy to see how close this was to the Square. The setting is lovely and warm. The deck overlooks a lush, private yard. It’s a great spot for coffee, reading, bird watching or having wine with friends before dinner. The birds and squirrels run around the yard and the neighborhood cat comes around for belly rubs and naps on the deck. So cute!
The layout of the space flows well. The skylight adds a nice touch to the living area, where we spent some time on the couch. The kitchen had the basics and we didn’t find ourselves missing anything. There’s a separate space to work and the bathroom was nicely updated.
The hosts were gracious and allowed us to have our friends, another couple, stop by for drinks and allowed them to also park in the back driveway. The four of us walked to dinner - the location is AMAZING. It was a 10-minute walk to the Square that takes you through the cutest streets with many homes to admire, especially during springtime in Atlanta. We felt safe and really enjoyed scoping out the area on foot.
However --
The space seemed clean upon entering but I immediately detected a mild musty odor. I was confused, because it’s repeatedly referred to as 'airy' in so many reviews, and I am sure that is what reviewers have experienced – I am not doubting anyone! Most people cannot detect these their sensitivity to bacteria/mold until they have experienced exposure over time. But I let it go and tried to be fair, until we moved through the space a bit more.
There were crumbs and a good bit of hair from a previous guest on the couch. The rugs need a good cleaning. The bed, while comfy and cozy, squeaked a lot, like every time we got in or moved in bed. There are questionable stains on the pillows which we didn’t realize until we stripped the bed when leaving. The toilet needed to be wiped down behind the lid.
There is a AC window unit in the bedroom that was dusty and not properly sealed. There was mold above the shower stall. There is no fan or ventilation system in the bathroom. There are large transom windows leading out into the hallway but no actual airflow directing the air out, so when it’s warm it just sits there.
We left a night early because by the afternoon of the second day my nose was running, I was coughing, my eyes were itchy and lethargic, and there was a slight wheeze in my chest. I carry an inhaler, but it doesn’t help with mold.
We emailed the hosts the next morning and explained why we had left, telling them they had all the makings for mold, especially the visual evidence of actual mold in the bathroom. This is dangerous stuff, not to be taken lightly, and I told him guests deserve a safe place. Both my husband and friend smelled musty odors, including in the bedroom.
The hosts explained that they employ a refugee with bad eyesight to clean. I appreciate that, but folks are paying their hard earned money for a clean space and also paying a cleaning fee. They also explained that the home was older and suggested I stay somewhere newer next time. It is older, sure, but that doesn’t mean it has to be unsafe. The age of a home should not affect someone’s health. He suggested it might have been my reaction to pollen. I live in Atlanta, I know what the pollen is like here, and I know how my body responds to pollen. Not this.
Lastly, the host assured me that he had 'bleached the mold in the bathroom'. I feel there is a deeper issue to inspect aside from some mold on the surface. They comped me $100 for leaving early, which I did not request, but was appreciated.
Some folks may not detect a thing or realize the effect it may have on them. It’s a great space and the location is fantastic, especially for a quick weekend, but I hope the hosts will take this issue seriously. They made it clear they have their Airbnb to help them stay in their home, and I respect that, but on the flip side, folks are paying their money to stay at these spaces too, and it’s not fair to not be accountable and make excuses if someone can actually get ill. Spending $400 for 2 nights to celebrate a birthday is a splurge for many people. Again, my intent is NOT to hurt anyone. I just wanted to be honest about MY experience. I wish Bruce and Karen the best."
2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Enjoyed our stay at this lovely Airbnb. The place was very clean and airy. It was so nice to sit on the deck and enjoy the sounds of nature.

They have thought of everything: ironing board, wardrobe with hangers, hamper, shampoo and conditioner, lots of coffee and tea choices…"
2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We flew in for a concert, stayed over two nights. Perfect location for getting to trains which stop 100m from the Mercedes Benz stadium - better than parking (probably takes as long to get out the parking lot after a show). The hosts have some really great teas and coffees available. Actual unit is as advertised, neat and tidy."

2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This is our second time staying in this apartment—we love the cozy comfortable space with lots of light and a friendly neighborhood cat (who stays outside and can be ignored if that’s not your thing).

2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Bruce and Karen's place in Decatur is wonderful. The location behind their main house is particularly nice as it is away from the street. The neighborhood is purely residential (and upscale) but near enough to markets and restaurants to be very convenient. I can't think of anything that would disqualify it from being the nicest place in Atlanta.

Best part for me is that I am a tree/nature lover and this outdoor deck space was so special--lovely place for morning nature meditation! I saw about 15 bird species the first day we were there. Hosts are so accommodating, responsive and incredibly kind. They are there if you need them, but have everything set up perfectly so you are completely independent. Can't say enough great things about Bruce and Karen!"

Bruce came to say hello and check on me once when I was out on the deck, which was nice! Otherwise it was very private and quiet."

It was very clean when we arrived and worked well for both myself and my partner to work from home all week. Though the place is close to the train tracks, we rarely heard it and overall, it was very quiet stay. Hosts communicated quickly via the Airbnb app and were very friendly in our brief meeting! Would definitely recommend for anyone looking to stay in Decatur!"
2021-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I loved the deck which had a great view of the back yard. Beautiful location in Decatur and very close to shops and restaurants.

The location was incredible with it being minutes away from right where you want to be in Decatur. We walked the few minutes into town multiple times.
2021-03-01,4,Stayed about a week,"Stayed for a week to quarantine.
Safe and walkable location. Nice back deck to hang out and eat. Internet was solid. Good lighting. Bathroom was nice. Karen and Bruce were good hosts.
I think a train goes under the house or on the other side of the house in back. It's very loud and confusing the first couple of times and then you don't notice it."
2021-02-01,5,Stayed over a week,This bright space is very close to the downtown square. The pictures are accurate and the owners are friendly. Perfect for our needs.
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very good place for a couple of day getaway and the goats make it even more homely. The outside could use a little TLC but all in all it is a great place and would not hesitate to stay again in the future
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,One of my favorite airbnb I’ve stayed at. Spotless and so peaceful. Would definitely come back!
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,A cozy retreat in the middle of the city. We enjoyed the porch and watching the goats frolic. Super comfy bed. Highly recommend.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Such a peaceful getaway with all the amenities. The Nest was the perfect base from which to explore Atlanta. We will be back!
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We enjoyed staying at The Nest! We loved the goats and enjoyed sitting on the porch overlooking the peaceful property. It was quiet and adorable! Thank you! We also appreciated the snacks :)
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I can only agree with the positive reviews.
This must have already been written by predecessors: but the amenities correspond to a 5-star plus hotel. And it's as wonderful as it is on the countryside.
Therefore, we found a large animal in the room the second night. There are still different views of the genus (pretty giant butterfly or cockroach). Just like this categorization question, the possible risks posed by the animal were discussed controversially 😊😊😊"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was the perfect spot to take in Atlanta—right in the middle of everything you will want to do and see, but incredibly peaceful. The goats were too fun! We appreciated the proactive communication, and quality furnishings. This has to be the most comfy bed I’ve experienced in an Airbnb."

Really enjoyed the easy walk to the Atlanta Zoo. Short drive to so many restaurants. Loved the basket of snacks and treats waiting for us when we got there (and excellent coffee!). And, of course, the goats. They are so personable and so much fun to just watch while they're happily playing and eating grass right outside our place. We enjoyed visiting with the 3 goats, I miss them already! That's truly what makes this place one of a kind. Highly recommended to anyone looking for a stay in ATL still close to everything you want to do, but staying outside the noise and traffic of the city."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My husband and I planned a weekend away to reconnect and this place was exactly what we needed. The property is truly amazing and a hidden gem in a big city. You feel almost as if you have stepped onto a farm in the middle of an established neighborhood. I always look for a place that is unique and special and this was that property. I will admit one of the biggest draws was that there were goats on the property and well, who doesn't love goats?! Bruno in particular was mischievous and bonded with my husband. I haven't laughed so hard in a long time! Directions on where to park and how to enter the ""Nest"" were simple and clear. The property had everything you would need and more. Extremely clean, quaint and wonderful. We loved sitting on the porch with a glass of wine while we played cards and watched the goats. So relaxing! Great restaurants nearby & close to the city for excursions. Would absolutely recommend and look forward to staying again. Loved every minute!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Wow this was a very exciting experience! The guest house is nice and secluded in the back and overlooks the goat farm. The goats were so sweet and it was really nice view to overlook in the morning. It was the perfect amount of space with cozy lighting. The bed and comforter were very comfortable. I loved the area of Grant Park nice and walkable. There were some bugs but it didn’t bother us too much. Enjoyable experience!
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Sara was extremely helpful and very accommodating, and the place was beautiful. Loved every minute of it. Definitely stay here!"

2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The goats steal the show but this little cottage would be 5/5 even without them. It’s nicely appointed, super clean, private, and the location is great. Also they offer the most consumables / amenities I’ve ever seen? Chocolates, popcorn, granola bars, coffee, toiletries, you name it - it’s in there.
Loved our stay, would visit again!"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"A lovely nest near downtown, we loved staying here and we're so comfortable for a weekend stay in Atlanta. The place was so cute, exactly as described and super comfortable for a weekend for two. We loved being able to walk to a local breakfast place and the zoo being so close.

This place will be my top choice every time I come to Atlanta."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,A beautiful home and amenities!
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was arguably the best Airbnb experience I have ever had.
The small details did not go unnoticed; the hosts curated the perfect environment for a relaxing two night stay. The goats were the cherry on top of an already perfect setting. My colleagues at my conference were extremely jealous that my Airbnb had goats and theirs did not.
I wish I could rate this stay with 1,000 stars. I miss those goats already!"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The perfect getaway for us animal lovers. Bruno the goat witnessed our engagement! Walking distance from the zoo, and Sarah let us check out late since our flight was in the evening."
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The Nest was honestly delightful. We enjoyed the coziness of the cottage which had so many thoughtful amenities (plus, the bed was SO comfortable) .

We loved getting to visit with them! Would love to stay here again"

2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,My husband and I were in Atlanta visiting family and friends for a long weekend. We really enjoyed our stay at The Nest @ the Fig & Goat Retreat. The home had everything we needed to rest and relax. Sara the host and Mila the co-host were extremely responsive from the moment I booked our stay. We would definitely stay with them again.
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,It is always a pleasure to stay at Sara's beautiful place!
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We could not have been happier with our first Air BnB experience. We celebrated our 25th anniversary at the Nest. Such a comfortable and clean place to stay! We couldn’t believe how close we were to the GA Aquarium, Stone Mountain and the zoo. We actually moved our plans around to spend our last day just being cozy and petting the adorable goats since it rained hard all day. Loved having a hot water tea pot and lots of snacks! I enjoyed doing a morning meditation sitting on the deck listening to the birds and nature all around. Shocked we were so close to Atlanta! I would say to plan for food. There isn’t much to walk to except a little deli which was great! We plan on returning! We cant say enough about this little gem. Perfect hosts and a bed that you won’t want to get out of!! Thank you for making our anniversary special. 🩷"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Our stay at the Nest was wonderful! Everything was clean and cozy. The goats were so much fun! Of all the Airbnbs we have stayed at, this one by far had the most stocked items in case you needed anything. They thought of EVERYTHING. The bed was exceptionally comfortable. We would definitely come back!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"It was so relaxing and peaceful. I really enjoyed playing with the goats. It was hands-down, one of the best Airbnb experiences I have ever had! Amazing hospitality and attention to detail. As someone who was born and raised in Atlanta I’m here to tell you that this is a great location to stay, and have access to so many things Anytime I’m visiting my family in Atlanta I will be checking for their availability. Thank you!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I stayed for the weekend for a concert in town for my girlfriends birthday, and all I can say is coming back to this airbnb felt like a breath of fresh air after being out and about in Atlanta. It was very quiet and in a safe area. When we first arrived I was exhausted and hungry after driving, and the little snack basket was a super thoughtful touch. There was a sweet little handwritten note and rules laid out clearly for when you first get there. They had a bunch of little goodies incase you ended up forgetting anything. The bed was also super comfortable, it was really easy to fall asleep and stay asleep. :) and last but not least, the goats. I loved them all, but probably Bruno most of all. He was super sweet and he really liked trying to eat my sweater lol. Anyways, I will definitely be booking again if I stay in Atlanta! It’s a very nice little place to be. :3"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We rented Sara's place for my in-laws, and it was the perfect spot for them. They loved watching the goats from their deck, and the location was so convenient for us. 10 out of 10!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"the goats were adorable , the place was very comfy, a lot of cool small business around, got food at juniors pizza and it was very good, close to campus, close to downtown, awesome"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This rental was very nice. It was very clean and secluded. Sara was always very responsive and seemed to be very caring of her guests. My girlfriend and I really enjoyed being on the property with the goats. We are both animal people and love anything that includes animals. I really enjoyed the personalized handwritten note she left for me as our check-in date was my birthday. That says tons about the host! We would definitely stay at this place again if we are ever back in Atlanta!
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We absolutely LOVED our stay at the Nest. it's tucked away in a quite neighborhood and just a fee minutes from everything atlanta has to offer. everything was clean and well-stocked, and there was clearly a lot of thought put into the stay/experience. we'll definitely be back! and you can't bea haveling cute little goats to greet you every time you pull up!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Our stay at the Fig & Goat Nest was a perfect for our weekend stay in Atlanta. The property was very convenient to get anywhere within the city all while feeling like we were in our own private oasis. The space was super comfortable and had everything we may have needed. The goats were such a fun touch and made the experience just a little extra special!
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We fell so in love with the Nest @ the Fig & Goat Retreat that it was hard to leave and even brought a tear to my eye. There’s so many wonderful things I can say about the property but the four goats topped it off for us. Every morning we’d look out the window to see if they were up. They were so friendly and Bruno especially stole our heart. The property was beautiful and made us feel right at home. Sara and David go above and beyond to have anything you could possibly need - toiletries, snacks, you name it they had it. The home is a short walk to the zoo and this lovely breakfast spot named HowdyATL. We felt comfortable and safe walking around the area. Everything on our to-do list was a close drive, including the aquarium. Anytime we return to Georgia we will book here with no hesitation!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a wonderful stay at the Nest!
Would highly recommend this spot & Sara as a host! Hoping to be back in the future!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Sara and Dave have thought of everything . It was an amazing few days just relaxing watching goats and sipping wine. We were in town for some concerts and couldn't have stayed anywhere better. I would stay here again and again, the goats are wonderful !!! Thanks yall for a great stay."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Such a wonderful place to stay for a work trip in busy Atlanta. After my appointments, I worked from the deck on my laptop. Great wifi coverage and speed, and the goats were definitely a change of pace. Friendly hosts, and they thought of everything to make guests feel comfortable in the space."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Absolutely loved the location, and if I had to pick one Sonny is my favorite goat. He would come hang out under the porch and smile while I talked to him. Very quiet and peaceful place to hang out in between trips to midtown music festival. Lots of rain over the weekend but we were still able to hang out under the covered porch with a ceiling fan to keep the mosquitos away. Sara was extremely responsive to texts, even left supplies that we wished we had brought! Basically thought of worst possible situation and saved us a trip to the store. We were able to get downtown in 15 minutes on Saturday night, and 18 minutes to midtown music festival at Piedmont Park. If I was going anywhere within 30 minutes Atlanta I would look to stay there again. Place was immaculate when we got there, shower was spacious, fridge was a little small, but with so many amazing places to eat who cares. Easy access to all sorts of good food! Ria Bluebirds for breakfast, 4-5 minutes, and a must enjoy!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The Nest was perfect in every way. We had a little trouble finding it in the dark. We didn’t arrive until mid nite. Our sweet Uber driver would not leave us until he was sure he took us to the right place.
The place was stocked with everything you needed and then some.
Sara was easy to contact, responded within minutes.
The highlight was the four goats in our front yard. If I ever go back that is where I will stay.
Thank you Sara."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This was a great Airbnb experience for us. Location was convenient. Close to many great restaurants. Nice to be close to Grant Park. The space was comfortable and well appointed. The friendly goats and coffee on the porch were a bonus.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place was awesome!! I’ve been to Atlanta before, but I was on tour so I never really got to spend time outside a theatre. So when I booked a place to stay I was kind of guessing on neighborhood. Turns out, this is the cutest neighborhood in all of ATL in my opinion! Right by Grant Park and tons of restaurants and all that. Everyone clearly treats their homes with love here.
Our little place was great. Extremely clean, has all the little extras you may be looking for, lots of hot water in the shower, VERY comfortable bed, great AC.
But what sold me upon first booking was the goats. My husband and I are animal lovers and often foster stray anythings. And here, in the middle of Atlanta, you have a beautiful pasture with 4 super friendly goats. They’re the best. Bruno took a shine to my husband.
I recommend this spot to anyone. You won’t regret it :)"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Had a great stay!
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My stay was PERFECT!
I loved sitting on the deck watching the goats, listening to all the wild life and the beautiful grounds! Inside, it couldn’t get any nicer or cozier! The king bed was super comfy! The bathroom was so spacious! Like it said, perfect!! Can’t wait to stay here again!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The Nest is comfy and cozy! It is quiet and private, and has a great location. The place was clean, cute and looked just like the listing pictures.

2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The Nest was totallywonderful. Our stay was very enjoyable and the hosts were very responsive to any question or request. The setting was so private and serene. We loved having our morning coffee on the porch watching the goats. Speaking of which, my wife was thrilled to have the little ones to visit and pet.
We would highly recommend this place to anyone looking for a quick stay."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"absolutely fantastic airbnb. easily one of our very favorite stays out of all our travels. 10/10 would recommend as it was cozy, clean, and close to all of the things we wanted to do in atlanta. plus, my husband loved the goats!"

2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Such a cute and cozy oasis in the Atlanta area. The hosts truly thought of everything to ensure that I felt welcome and comfortable. The neighborhood was quiet and conveniently located, and the hosts provided clear instructions on how to access the guesthouse. The handwritten note and ""just in case"" snacks/toiletries were a nice touch. A true 5-star experience-- highly recommend."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We had a wonderful stay at this quiet and peaceful retreat. We loved interacting with the goats!
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We thoroughly enjoyed our stay. The bed is heavenly and the goats are a perfect touch! I’d definitely recommend booking to friends.

2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We had a wonderful stay! The cottage was adorable and clean! They had everything we needed if we forgot anything. It felt very private even being in the city. The neighborhood is adorable and we loved our time with the goats :)
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We enjoyed our stay. Thank you!
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The fig & goat is a hidden gem in grant park. Quiet, private and peaceful but minutes away from all the action."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Stayed two days in Atlanta last month at ""chic"" hotel; stayed two days this week at the fig & goat retreat at less than half the cost and 10 times the experience - wonderful peaceful setting, amazing attention to detail, cute goats. Great place!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,A nice cosy place with everything you need. A quiet location not far from the park and the zoo. We enjoyed the Sunday morning market in Grant Park and also the company of the cute goats. Thanks for a nice stay!
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,Thank you for your hospitality. We loved your place.
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I’ve been staying at Sarah and David’s guest cottage since January. Every time I visit it’s such a pleasurable experience. It’s become a home away from home for me. I look forward to my next visit!
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a wonderful stay at the Nest. I would have loved to stay there longer each day but we had places to go and people to see! The goats were so cute and loved to be petted. Our daughter and her family, whom we were visiting, lived very close. None of us could believe what a beautiful and spacious property it is, just tucked into such an urban location."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,My husband and son had a great time. It was a pretty property and my son loved the goats. This was way better than a hotel.
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful Airbnb with all the toiletries you could need and some lovely snacks also. The goats are so friendly and cute! Beautiful property. And definitely one of the most comfortable beds I've ever slept in. Thank you so much for a wonderful stay
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Sara is an amazing host and Mila also helped to ensure our check-in and amenities were easy/easy to find. The place is absolutely beautiful and peaceful and I can’t tell you how much fun and joy the goats brought us. It is the perfect escape but it’s perfectly located in the heart of the city near Grant Park. Truly one of my best Airbnb stays since I’ve had an account. I’ll be back!
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Saras place stands out for being a restored, historic property - a rarity in Atlanta & Grant Park! While I was there alone & for business/ the cottage is likely best for a couple who wants seclusion & a romantic setting. So many details were thought of and they really have clearly tried to make everyone as comfortable as possible ( beautiful linens!)
Very close to the zoo & coffee shops while set back and private. The goats are adorable! There is a little up slope walking up to the cottage so likely not good for anyone with mobility issues. There actually two AirBnbs on the property with the larger one above the garage. There was a small issue with the original cottage that was out of the host’s control; they were VERY responsive and immediately came to address the issue- decided they needed professionals and moved me to the other apartment which was so beautiful! To me- AirBnB is about hosts that care and do everything in their power to make their guests comfortable! Sara does that!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The hosts were wonderful! They were so quick to respond to any questions I had from months prior to my check-in until the last day of our stay. Awesome location, well stocked, cute and cozy aesthetics, and friendly goats and welcoming hosts! We couldn’t have asked for anything more. Thank you for the warm hospitality!"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Another perfect stay! Thank you!
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I loved this little retreat in the middle of the city. Such an amazing property with the loveliest little goat friends that we quickly became attached to. We can’t wait to rebook when we visit ATL again. Thank you so much!
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,LOVED THIS PLACE!!!! Don’t hesitate to book it! The goats are awesome! The place is awesome! Highly recommended and will be back!
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Had the absolute best time staying at the Nest!! The cottage itself was so comfortable and cozy. It had everything we needed and more. Really appreciated the conveniences like water bottles and outlets on each night stand. Sara was extremely responsive and was able to generously accommodate a late checkout given our flight timing. The best part was the goats for sure!! It was so exciting to return from our adventures and be greeted by these 4 adorable little guys. Will be returning next time we are in Atlanta for sure!!
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Another amazing stay. I can’t wait to get back!!!!!
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"It’s hard to write a review about the actual place we stayed in when all we really wanted to do was cuddle with the goats! However, the cottage was very clean and cozy, and had everything we needed for our three day stay. It’s not as close to the beltline as we would’ve liked, but was hardly a problem. The last day we were there we walked through Grant Park over to Memorial Dr, a mile and half away to have breakfast. It was a top-notch weekend. Thank you very much."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We had an excellent second stay! Clean and comfortable as usual. Thanks agains Sara and David!
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Place was very peaceful and just what we needed for our quick trip to Atlanta.
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Again… The Nest is a haven inside a busy city. The goats. The beautiful home. It always establishes a deep sigh of relief as I roll up the driveway. The notes Sarah and David leave are a beautiful reminder that I’m at my home away from home. Thank you for the amazing space to come back to every night. It’s unbelievable. And did I mention the well mannered goats you get to hug and cuddle?
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"If I could give it 6 stars I would! This little place was perfect for coming into town for a couple of days for a concert at the State Farm Arena. The house was very comfortable and in a quiet neighborhood. It was within easy distance of the zoo, aquarium, and concert venue, but didnt feel like being in the city at all. I was really impressed with the extra touches of snacks and everything needed for coffee and tea available. We had so much fun playing with the goats, which was a cool bonus for animal lovers missing their pups. The next time John Mayer is in town, we will definitely be back!"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Another amazing stay. Looking forward to the next months booked stays at The Nest!
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great location for us. Private and secure. Hosts were always available with answers and requests!
2023-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,Loved this place so much. We fell in love with the property and the goats.
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The place was so lovely. I love hanging with the goats and sitting on the porch. The bed is so comfortable and the hosts were so responsive. Perfect stay.
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I can’t put into words how amazing our stay was. My husband and I are relocating and decided to stay at The Nest while house hunting and we had a very pleasant experience from start to finish. The bed was SO comfortable, like sleeping on a cloud. The Nest was very clean and we appreciated the snacks, coffee/tea and having emergency toiletries. Excellent location, beautiful spot right in the middle of the city. Easy check in and clear instructions. And of course I ADORED the goats. I ended up sitting outside with them for a while and they literally lay in your lap. Such sweet babies! Thank you so much Sarah and David. We loved our stay and hope to stay again one day!"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I had a lovely stay!! The place and surroundings were so beautiful and peaceful. I could not believe all the thoughtful extras that were provided. I have never seen that in any of the air bbs I’ve stayed in. Coffee, tea, snacks, toiletries..lots of thoughtful touches. The goats were precious and it made my day coming home to them. When my work trip was cut short unexpectedly, Sara kindly refunded the last night on little notice. She is clearly a kind and gracious host. Thanks so much for letting me stay at your property"
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I can confidently say this was my favorite airbnb experience to date! Sara was extremely friendly, gave incredible recommendations, and made sure we were confident navigating the area. The house itself was spotless and extremely comfortable.
And THE GOATS!!!! They were so precious and sweet I wanted to hang out with them all day!! We had a stellar time.
Thank you Sara you rock!!"
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My husband and I visited Atlanta and absolutely loved Sara’s place! So charming, clean and cozy. Great communication with Sara and very quick responses. I totally recommend this little gem!"
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This was my second stay at Sarah and David’s The Nest. I was up at dawn and meandered into the barn yard to hang with goats. I still can’t believe I was in the middle of Atlanta. So peaceful. The guest house is the perfect respite to come home to after a days work. Comfortable. Thoughtful. And beautiful. I’ll be staying again the next time I’m in Atlanta.
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The Nest is perfect for a quick weekend away. The location was EVERYTHING. Set in a quiet neighborhood, close to restaurants and social spaces. Our weekend was rained out, so we embraced the cozy cabin-like feel, sat on the covered porch with a book and a glass of wine and enjoyed the calming rain. We nodded off mid-day to the sound of rain on the roof, in what is probably the most comfortable bed I've ever slept in.
This Airbnb is clean and well kept. The amenities and essentials provided are perfect for any stay, they offer it all, down to snacks, coffee/teas, sunscreen, and hairspray. It really made the space feel like a home.
Playing with the goats was icing on the cake! They're so inquisitive, friendly, and happy to have you run around and play with them. Overall our stay here was highly enjoyable and I recommend this place to anyone looking for a cozy getaway."
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Amazing! What a beautiful setting in the middle of Atlanta. Quiet. Clean. Loved the goats right outside the door. Such a great spot to come home to after a long day in Atlanta. Sarah and her husband were thoughtful in communications and offer a perfect home base near great restaurants and beautiful Grant Park. I’ve already booked more time there and looking forward to returning.
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"If you’re traveling to Atlanta and you’re looking for the PERFECT place to stay, book The Nest with Sara. The nest is perfect for a quick weekend getaway trip and Sara will do whatever it takes to ensure that you are all set for your stay. The nest was very comfortable, clean, peaceful and Sara and David were great hosts. The location was perfect as well! I will always book with Sara when traveling to Atlanta!"
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The Nest is beautiful, comfortable, and clean. Sara is an excellent host—available and communicative. Would definitely recommend this place to others."
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place is absolutely amazing! The area was quiet and was exactly what I needed to relax, if you like baby goats this is definitely the place for you. The bed is probably the most comfortable thing I have ever slept on, definitely didn't disappoint. The location is close enough the major city and far enough to not deal with any of the loud city noises."
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My husband and I came to Atlanta for a show and couldn’t pass up the possibility of waking up in this adorable spot. How such a peaceful little oasis can exist so close to the amenities of a big city is beyond me - but that’s what makes it so magical! The hosts were incredibly friendly and responsive, and instructions were clear and easy to follow (even in the dark)! We had the best time petting the goats and watching them play from our porch. Location is so convenient, safe, and relaxing. This is the perfect weekend stay for a couple and we’d love to return!"
2023-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,Beautiful accommodations with everything you needed and the most comfortable bed! The goats were so much fun to see and the hosts were absolutely wonderful! We will definitely stay here again!
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Don’t look any further. Literally. Book right now. My husband & I came for a weekend getaway. The coziest Airbnb I’ve ever stayed in. So charming and had everything you needed. I wanted to take the bed home with me it was so cozy! If we come to ATL again we already decided this is where we would stay!
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great place to stay! Very clean, quaint, and comfortable! I would highly recommend!"
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,What a charming space! The perfect location in Grant Park and easy check-in and check-out. All around an excellent stay!
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The Nest @ Fig & Goat is an experience I will never forget. The host were responsive, helpful, nice and accommodating. The nest itself was cozy and felt like country side get away located in the city! I got engaged during my stay and the warm environment that the nest and the goats themselves offered set the tone. I will definitely be back someday!"
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Thanks, Sara, for a wonderful visit! I couldn't have been more comfortable!

2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Enjoyed every minute of our stay! Great place! Great hosts!
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place was very nice and right in the heart of the area that we had our plans. It was convenient to lots of entertainment and good restaurants. Just know that for most restaurants you should make a reservation as there are lines to get in. The cottage was very clean and cozy, and I would definitely stay there again. It felt like you were in a secluded countryside but still in the heart of the city."
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Sara's was everything we thought it would be and more...love love love.
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,My wife and I had a perfect stay at the Nest! We loved being greeted by the goats every time we walked up to the Nest!

The bed is super comfortable and there was plenty of coffee stocked which we appreciated. I would not hesitate to stay here again when in the area!
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great location. Quiet neighborhood and beautiful property. Wonderfully comfortable bed. AirBnB is well stocked with complimentary supplies. Security by “guard goats.”😂 Sara and David are great hosts. This will be my go-to accommodation for Atlanta.
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The Nest is a great place. Wonderful spacious grounds with the goats. Very lovely cozy accommodations. I wish we had had time to sit on the spacious deck under the oak tree overlooking the goat pen. You would not suspect that you are in the city of Atlanta !!
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We really enjoyed our stay at the nest. It was a home away from home. Will definitely recommend to family and friend and stay again.
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Relaxing, roomy, enojoyable, good location"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I had a wonderful stay in this adorable cottage, set in a peaceful and idyllic setting, right in the middle of the city. The big porch overlooks a pasture that's home to some sweet little goats. The hosts are prompt and helpful and even have good snacks ready for you. One thing to note is that the place is tiny -- you walk into a galley kitchen and the bedroom is on your left and bathroom on your right. No living room or other spaces (other than the porch). But the bed is big and comfy and the property was perfect for my staycation."
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My husband and I loved staying at this guest house in Atlanta. It was quiet, the goats were adorable, and the house had all the amenities one could possibly need for a short stay. We would definitely stay here again. :)"

2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"A wonderful gem of a place.
We took uber everywhere and it was very reasonable.
The zoo nearby is one of the best I have seen and the animals are well cared for. Easy walk to the zoo.
If you like birds, this is the place to sit and listen to a variety of birds and watch goats!
Thank you David and Sara!!"
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Sara is a wonderful host. Her and her husband provide everything you could need for a quiet and restful getaway. The bed is the most comfortable I’ve ever been in.

2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We absolutely enjoyed our stay at the retreat. It's central and close to the city yet secluded and quiet. It's romantic and with a rural charme yet comfortable and very well equipped. If you don't mind getting greeted by the cutest goats everytime you come back to the spot go and spend some time there ;-) Beyond that, Sara and David are extremely caring hosts, from any aspect imaginable they put a lot of effort into making our stay a wonderful one and ensured we feel welcomed and ""at home on the road"". Thanks a ton!!"
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,One of the best places I've ever stayed and definitely had themost comfortablebed I've ever slept in!! We'll definitely be back!
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is an amazing place. Exactly as described. Clean, comfortable in a cute neighborhood. Close to many great places to visit. You don’t realize you are in a neighborhood because of the grounds, landscaping and cute goats! The bed, linens and chairs are comfortable. The extra touches are perfect.

2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The Nest at the Fig and Goat is a lovely oasis in the city. Such a calm and beautiful place to come home to after a busy day.

Communication was easy, and the goats super cute. Highly recommend the Nest!"

The neighborhood was friendly, well lit after dark and a perfect place for our daily walks. The little extras were so unexpected! High end snacks, coffee, tea and original Coca Cola! Every toiletry I might have forgotten! I especially appreciated the privacy and green space in the middle of the city! The goats made me happy! We are expecting our first grandchild in the fall and will absolutely be back!"

The accommodations are beautiful and well planned, the baby goats are adorable! David and Sara are very responsive and easy to work with. We can’t wait for our next stay!"
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Sara's place is a city treasure! Would give 12 stars if I could! It was such a surprise to find this small farm in the city with immaculate grounds and beautifully arranged space. Sara's place was easy to find and we had great communication from Sara that not only was helpful but so warm and friendly.
Location, location location! We couldn't believe how close to the Belt Line we were and just steps from the Zoo, Grant Park and East Atlanta! Just short walks from each but the bikes she provided were helpful for our longer adventures on the belt line.
The actual interior space was impressionable - was very clean, smelled great (no chemical smells! Big win!), comfy bed, just enough space to be very comfortable and the little porch outside that overlooked baby goats was dreamy with comfy seating to relax.
I can't say enough good about this little treehouse-esque destination. Will absolutely be back and recommend anyone who wants a safe, picturesque Atlanta experience to stay here - you will not be disappointed!"
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Wonderful quiet place to stay on a visit to Atlanta.

2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I have never before rated an AirBnB with 5-stars across the board, but Sara’s place is hands down my favorite Airbnb experience ever.
On a farm setting in the middle of the city and conveniently located, this romantic cottage is a perfect getaway for a couple or solo traveler. The king sized bed has plushy linens, the kitchenette is well-stocked, and personal touches throughout make it feel homey and welcoming. The porch is lovely.
I was seeking a writing retreat and found my bliss at Sara’s. If the sweet sounds of baby goats and children laughing spark joy for you, you will not want to miss this magical place.
Thank you, Sara! I hope to come back soon!"
2022-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"Amazing place! Communication to book + instructions to get in and navigate their property was so clear.

2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This one is a real gem! Tucked neatly in Grant Park , the Nest is a little oasis of country in an urban sea. The owners clearly have done their homework - everything is immaculately clean and uncluttered , yet still feels cozy and comfortable. The bungalow is not big , but it’s the perfect size for escapes to the city - the beltline is close by , as are lots of restaurants of a wide variety.
Top-notch communication by the owners make everything go seamlessly. We highly recommend this one!"
2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"A beautiful, secluded spot right by the Atlanta zoo and Grant Park! You could easily walk up to the zoo and avoid parking in the crowd. You are 5 minutes from major highways but you can’t hear much noise, very quiet setting. Very large deck for evening relaxation!! Affordable, and we will stay there again. Close to many trendy restaurant and shopping areas!"

Such a pleasant surprise to walk in and be greeted with a lovely hand written note and great snacks! She also provided an awesome amenity basket in case we forget any essentials!
They have really thought about all our needs during our stay! We came for our daughters baby shower and she even gifted a favorite book of hers to our future granddaughter!! The location is amazing and the grounds are outstanding! It was truly a private setting, yet so close to Grant Park! The king size bed was inviting and super comfortable! We will not hesitate to stay here again for all our future Atlanta trips!"

Her gardens were absolutely stunning, I smiled everytime I walked through them. Her home and the rest of the neighborhood were breath taking.

2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Maureen’s beautiful home exceeded our already high expectations. The back apartment was spacious, full of light, thoughtfully decorated, and set within a beautiful garden. The home is centrally located, but best of all, Maureen was a welcoming host who took the time to chat and make sure we felt at home. This stay felt like what AirBnB was meant to be—personal and providing an insight into local life, not a soulless and gentrifying hotel substitute."

Beautifully decorated, amazing location (we could get everywhere we needed to on foot and using MARTA public transit), and Maureen and Michael made us feel right at home. The space is private but still connected to the rest of the house, so you might hear people on the other side of the dividing door. But all in all this was exactly the type of oasis we were looking for and helped us get an amazing introduction to Atlanta. Would highly recommend."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great value in an excellent location. Very close to BELTLINE, Krog St, and Jimmy Carter Library."

The apartment itself is secluded in the back with a lovely view of the garden. The bed is comfy, shower works well, tv options, all the usual amenities you’d expect (though no kitchen per the listing). Maureen and her husband were super nice, easy to talk to and ask questions if we had them. There’s a dedicated parking spot out front, too, so no worries there. All in all, one of our best Airbnb experiences!"

I highly recommend it, the neighborhood itself is lovely and it's also in walking or short driving distance to all the coolest places. It's super close to Krog Street Market, which we really enjoyed, and you can also take a little longer but very pleasant walk to Little 5 Points. Everything is super comfy and it was so nice that there were little extras like granola bars provided! We still haven't stayed long enough to hang out in the space but there is such a lovely porch and backyard too. :)"

I met Maureen one afternoon and she was very welcoming, asking how the space was. The back porch offered a tranquil view out over the garden with a gurgling pond. It is a space connected to their main house with a large door in the living room area, yet locked and still private. The bed was comfy, the bathroom was stocked with hair care and body wash in case you forgot yours and there was a thoughtful selection of snacks & Brita pitcher in the living room as well. Highly recommend for the value, location, and care the hosts have put into creating a comfortable space!"

The house is literally an urban oasis, you’ll feel like be in the jungle instead of one of the nicest neighborhoods in Atlanta. It’s also very well furnished and equipped. The location is great. A lovely neighborhood with so many options in 10 minutes walking distance and very close to Beltline and Dr. Martin Luther King Jr Park. If in Atlanta I’ll be back for sure!"

2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place was gorgeous inside and out. Beautiful decorations, comfy living space, awesome porch and backyard full of lovely plants. An EASY walk to everything Inman Park has to offer, great restaurants/parks/shopping. We loved being so close to Krog Market and the beltline trail! Maureen was extremely accommodating to our needs and helpful with recommendations. It is also a super easy trip into downtown Atlanta. We loved our stay! 10/10 👍👍"

2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,Great location to Krog district. Loved that we could walk to everything.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Where to start? Our hosts Maureen and Michael really went the extra mile for us ensuring we safely arrived at the property late at night.
The location is fabulous, just a short and pleasant stroll to Krog Street Market and the wonderful Beltline.
Sadly on day two of our trip I was struck down with a sickness bug. Michael and Maureen were so kind, ensuring my husband could locate a pharmacy and checking in on me.
We’ll definitely return to do the things illness prevented us from doing and to enjoy their beautiful veranda and garden."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"Lovely home in an awesome walkable location! Perfect, clean and comfortable stay!"

2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"We loved this airbnb. It was clean, decorated really nicely, easy to access, near a bunch of fun cool spots and the place had everything you needed. From makeup remover wipes to an umbrella; the hosts have really thought about every amenity you may need if you packed in a hurry. I care about the small details and was very happy with this stay. Would highly recommend to anyone! Atlanta isn’t the cheapest place to stay and this was well worth it in price than spending a ton more for a corporate hotel. :)"

We very very highly recommend staying here!
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"Maureen's Urban Oasis is just that. The suite, at the back of Maureen and Michael's home, is an upstairs unit that overlooks a fabulously peaceful, very private garden. It is just as pictured, charmingly furnished and super comfy. We enjoyed walking over to the Krog Market as well as being close to other attractions. Maureen is a gracious and welcoming hostess; enjoyed discussing the garden and meeting her pups Lucky and Jamie. A lovely overnight stay; we look forward to visiting again!"

2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Excellent space with a lot of attention to detail. It was clean and non-cluttered. The bed was comfortable and check-in nice. There were a lot of considerations such as parking, umbrellas, coffee, and snacks that were very appreciated.

2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Loved this urban oasis and the Inman Park neighborhood. Short rides to downtown attractions and great restaurants nearby. Highlights for us nearby were the Folk Art, Julianna’s, and Krog Street (especially Ticonderoga club).
Property and neighborhood were extremely welcoming and comfortable. They went above and beyond to make sure our stay was great. Maureen was an excellent host and we would highly recommend a stay here!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Staying with a Maureen was a perfect decision for my fiancé and I who were going to a show at the Fox Theatre. Due to work schedules we got in very late at night (1230a, late at least for us early risers) and she was super responsive.
The space was much bigger in person and the bathroom was very clean. There were plenty of linens and the bedding was comfortable. The bathroom was incredibly well stocked. I was surprised to see an extra toothbrush, disposable razors, first aid kit and more.
My fiancé worked from the desk in the bedroom while I worked out at the table in the main room. There was plenty of natural light which was really appreciated. During a rainstorm I enjoyed sitting out on the second level deck, and was also able to spot a chipmunk in the backyard.
I was able to to get coffee and donuts for us from a local spot for breakfast Friday morning and enjoyed the walk through the historic neighborhood. Parking and the drive to the Fox Theatre we’re both easy to navigate."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Maureen was a delightful host to my friends. Thus us the second time I’ve reserved Urban Oasis. Will recommend her again fir anyone I know coming into town.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We has a great stay at Maureen and Michael’s Urban Oasis. It was clean and comfortable and the location can’t be beat. All of the little things were considered and we felt well provided for during our stay. Our hosts helped us with some planning the week before we arrived that made our two night stay in Atlanta safe and saved us some time and money. Inman park is beautiful with lots of great restaurants and amenities that were within walking distance. Next visit to the city we’ll look for availability at Maureen and Michael’s place first.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Everything you can think you may need, was available here. Walkability score off the charts. I stayed for the weekend during a work trip, so couldn't do much, but being located here allowed me to still enjoy the Krog District and the Atlanta feel, while still being able to unwind and relax in the quiet of the treehouse setting. Would absolutely love to stay again."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"This place worked out great for us. The location is great - we walked to restaurants and the Variety Playhouse. The apartment was clean and neat and Maureen was responsive and helpful. Definitely recommend, especially if you’re wanting to enjoy the Inman Park area."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Maureen’s place is an amazing stay if you want to feel a part of the Atlanta community. It’s so close to everything, and is a part of a beautiful neighborhood. The home was so well put together—from the extra umbrellas placed in the living room to the outdoor area. There were small snacks provided when we showed up, and everything was extremely clean! Totally recommend if you want to spend time in downtown Atlanta and the surrounding area."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"This was a lovelyplace in a really special neighborhood. We spent hours strolling the area enjoying the old homes and admiring the creative details in the area. The apartment felt a bit like a treehouse with morning music provided by the birds. It was very comfortable, and stocked with careful consideration. Quite an enjoyable experience."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Third visit to this wonderful Urban Oasis, and can't wait to book again. The hosts are absolutely delightful, and have provided such a peaceful and relaxing get-away.

She was extremely flexible with my reservation needs and was always responsive in communication. Her backyard is a paradise, yet walking distance to Krog Street Market. I’ll be back!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is the ultimate Oasis in the best neighbourhood of ATL!

A lot of pleasant greenery and also located in a beautiful and quiet neighbourhood, but not far at all from some great bars and restaurants.
Hosts Maureen and Michael were very friendly and helpful. They knew the local area well, and provided some great recommendations for things to see and do.
Highly recommend. Made us wish we had planned to stay in Atlanta a bit longer!"

2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"Maureen’s place is more beautiful than the pictures!! It faces the garden on the back of the house with beautiful plants and fountains which makes the space feel very private. The high ceilings and beautiful interior made our one night stay feel like a real vacation. The neighborhood is extremely walkable with beautiful houses. Lots of restaurants, bars and coffee shops nearby, though the neighborhood itself still feels very residential and quiet. Maureen and Michael are the best hosts. They showed us around the place and gave us great recommendations for food & bars around the area."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"Lovely, comfortable, very clean and Maureen was a great host! There was also a very pretty garden area with seating. Unfortunately, I didn’t get to use that because I got in late. It was still a nice view to see from the deck!"

2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I loved every minute of my stay. I’ve been to lots of airbnbs and this one was by far the most well-appointed with little amenities - especially the bathroom! Maureen left lots of helpful recommendations and the neighborhood is beautiful. Would come back any time. Maureen and Michael are amazing hosts.

2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was the most amazing airbnb.

The neighborhood was quiet and walkable-with plenty of restaurants nearby, their backyard was a lovely space for us to sit in, the bed was extremely comfortable, and everything you could want was there from bathroom supplies to places to charge your phones.

2023-02-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"We loved staying at Maureen’s. It was clean, felt homey and was within walking distance to some local amenities. I wasn’t prepared for the door with the latch lock on it so I didn’t feel completely comfortable/safe. While Maureen was very responsive and kind, when in a new environment, the feeling of safety comes from knowing that you aren’t as easily accessible by strangers. Because of this, I found myself waking up quite a bit and listening for any possible intrusions.
Maureen provided an iron and board, a microwave, coffee machine, toiletries and linen and a tv in the living room. The outside area was peaceful. Minus the situation with the odd door, we’d consider staying here again."

The Beltline, a mixed use paved trail, is also a 3-minute walk and gives you walkable access to Ponce City Market, Little Five Points, and other areas of interest.

2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"This place was stunning, peaceful, and a one-of-a-kind adventure we'll never forget. We especially adored Farrah the emu, who was so sweet and fun to hang out with! There was so much to see on the property, including beautiful landscapes and birds, the hot tub was fantastic, and the home itself was so clean and full of charming details (we even got lucky and got to experience some heavy rain in the morning and it felt otherworldly). Barry was lovely and easy to communicate with. We'd recommend this place to anyone looking for a unique getaway."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Don’t even know where to start, Barry your home is amazing and I’m so thankful we stumbled upon it when searching for a place to stay. We had a busy itinerary but this house was like our favorite part of the trip! It was so beautiful, peaceful and private inside and out. It was also very clean which is so important for us, we always look for the little things. Lastly the little welcome amenity was what put it over the top, it gave us everything we needed for our one night stay and a little souvenir for the road. We’re trying to think of an excuse to come back to Atlanta soon so we can re-visit! Barry, thank you again for opening your beautiful home to us for the night it was such an amazing experience!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,A hidden surprising nature retreat that is also a perfect gateway with that super special someone. It is an intimate and cozy treehouse. It took me about half an hour to take in the outside grounds and see all of the menagerie. An absolute wonder and find. It is a must visit if you are a fan of travel and unique stays. One of the best attractions in Atlanta. A must see and at least a night’s stay!
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"This is a repeat stay for us, and we look forward to coming back again! This place is an amazing oasis that feels almost surreal. The accommodations themselves would be amazing, but an emu following you around and a peacock roosting on your balcony at night just make it over the top! Fabulous find. You won’t regret staying here!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,Excellent. Best stay we’ve ever had.
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We got married on the grounds and stayed for our wedding weekend. Such a beautiful experience we will cherish forever! Barry was such a wonderful and kind host. We’ll definitely be back!
2024-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"Amazing! What a beautiful private space in the city. I loved the decor of the house, the porch, and most of all the trees!! So many bird visitors.
Thank you!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"Staying at Barry’s place is definitely a one of a kind experience. We stayed one night so we made the most of our time by staying put.
We spent 2 hours walking the property and seeing all of the birds. So pretty!
We enjoyed hanging out in the hot tub and listening to music. We brought food to make our dinner- my husband used the grill and we used the stove to make the sides. It was fun just hanging out enjoying the treehouse.
He has k-pods, creamers and various sweeteners - so no need to pack your own- we enjoyed our coffee on the deck off the bedroom."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,I’ve been to beautiful airbnbs but this one by far tops them all! Barry was a very attentive host. He accommodated me with a late check out that was much needed. The pictures do this place no justice! Everything was in pristine condition. The home felt peaceful and full of tranquility. Barry’s hospitality was top tier. The house instructions were concise and extremely reasonable compared to what previous hosts had asked for their guests to do. He’s one of the best hosts ever! I will be back sooner than later😉What are you waiting for? BOOK NOW!! YOU WONT BE DISAPPOINTED!
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,Barry’s place was amazing. The scenery was breathtaking. A hidden gem right in the heart of Atlanta. The pictures really do not do it justice. Can’t wait to visit again.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Really incredible spot. Very unique and cool!
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"There is absolutely nothing like Barry’s Emu Ranch. The moment you step on the property you feel like you’ve been transported outside of Atlanta to the most magical, wild, yet tranquil destination. And don’t even get me started on the treehouse…something straight out of Architectural Digest. We booked the Airbnb for our wedding weekend and hosted our rehearsal dinner and ceremony at the ranch property. Barry was a very accommodating host for these events and went out his way to meet with us and vendors multiple times leading up to the wedding. While he was out of town during our stay, he made sure we had everything we needed leading up to the big day and had a caretaker on property that weekend who helped with any questions/logistics but also went well out of his way to bring out a few special guests (a baby owl, emu egg!) during our events to show our guests. Only negative is we couldn’t stay and celebrate longer : )"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The coolest Airbnb I’ve ever stayed at. Even aside from the actual living space…the surrounding grounds are something special. And the best part, all of it is available for the guests to enjoy. Tons of wildlife and the most beautiful lush green space. I can’t wait to go back!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,This place was awesome! He was a great host and very attentive. 10/10 recommend!
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is one of the most unique and fun places one can stay. Bravo, Barry!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great stay & location, Barry was more than helpful and prompt with communication and assisting with any special request. The yard is gorgeous, with a multitude of scenery to view. We will definitely be returning."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Truly a magical stay here. Surrounded by gorgeous plants and birds. Peaceful, private oasis up in the trees. I wish I could live here. If you’re questioning whether to book here, don’t give it a second thought. Do it! If you enjoy nature, bird watching, quality craftsmanship, or just peace and quiet, this is the spot. I will definitely be back!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great stay
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We enjoyed our stay in this very unique spot. It was fun to walk around the property and see all the amazing birds and to feel like we were living in the tree tops. We would be happy to come back again.
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Barry’s place was amazing. Every detail was perfect! Such a peaceful and relaxing place to unwind.
2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,All I can say is I shoulda booked a longer stay
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We had a great time at Barry’s quaint get away. It was so thrilling to get to interact with the emus and have peacocks right outside of our window. Barry was super kind and welcoming and gave us some great recommendations for things to do in the area. Even though it is located at a guest house on the property it still felt very private and secluded. We look forward to returning soon!!
2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,This was one of my favorite stays. What Barry has done at emu ranch is magical. It was more than what I hoped for. Very pleased all around.

I felt one with nature in the heart of Atlanta, truly unbelievable. Would 1000% book again!"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed one night,Absolutely magical experience. We had an amazing night. I hope to stay again in the summer. Everything was perfect. Every last little detail was perfection.
2024-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"This place is legitimately a one of a kind experience. Barry has done an outstanding job at making this place completely perfect for his guests and is very helpful and accommodating during your stay. Please do not hesitate to stay here, you won’t regret it."

2024-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"Wow, this place is magical! I am long time neighbor of the fabled Emu Ranch, and it absolutely exceeded my expectations. I am amazed how the property is so close to everything yet so private and peaceful! My parents were in town for the Garden Lights at the Botanical Gardens, and this was an excellent compliment to that! Barry was amazing and allowed me and my family to tour the gardens while dropping my parents off. Inside of the Airbnb is so well decorated and cozy my dad didn't want to leave!"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed one night,Such a beautiful place! Felt like we were in our own oasis. Barry was nothing but spectacular. Accommodating and easy/prompt responses on any of our questions. Felt safe and photos don’t even do the place justice. It’s spectacular. I will be back again!
2024-01-01,5,Stayed one night,Top of the birds nest.. thanks for the honey !! Clean and a beautiful sunset definitely try not to miss

2023-12-01,5,Stayed one night,Absolutely magnificent. Very unique Airbnb stay that I would recommend to everyone. My husband and I spent our first anniversary here and it more than met our expectations. Barry was very accommodating. Amazing communication. Thank you!
2023-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"Walk into Archimedes Nest and be transported to another place - far more than an Emu Ranch!
Obvious care has been shown to the animals and to the setting for the people
We lacked for nothing and enjoyed everything.
Great hosts!!"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"Such an incredible spot! We had tickets at State Farm Arena for the night, but if I had known how great the place was I would have rather just stayed in & enjoyed the house! Grounds are so beautiful. Farrah is a sweetheart. Can’t wait to go back ❤️"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This is my third time at Archimedes Nest. It is a lovely and peaceful stay. I appreciate all that Barry does to help us feel at home.
2023-11-01,5,Stayed one night,Very unique and cozy place. We enjoyed our stay so much. Can’t imagine there is a place like this in the city cause it makes so you feel you are far away in the woods. Barry is an excellent host as he is super friendly and responsive. Would recommend the place to anyone.
2023-11-01,5,Stayed one night,Super peaceful! Wish we could have stayed another night! The hot tub was awesome and the place was really unique and we loved hanging out with the emu!

We were just blown away! Thank you Barry and Farrah and all the beauty! You were all so welcoming and we needed no decorations because the space is a natural decoration! 🙏🥰💗
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This was my first vacation is over two years. Extremely worth it! Everything was so beautiful and Barry was such a wonderful host. I’d give him 10 stars if I could.
2023-11-01,5,Stayed one night,Barry’s space is amazing and he is a wonderful host. The home is full of eclectic and thoughtful pieces making it a comfortable space. The pictures are accurate but could not adequately show just how gorgeous the space is… Barry had plenty of local recommendations though you would never want to leave to go find anything else. The land is beautifully landscaped and full of wonder. The animals are majestic and friendly. I petted the emu and talked to the parrots… all while staying in the middle of Atlanta! Thank you Barry for a great birthday!
2023-11-01,5,Stayed one night,One of the best stay I ever had..
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"Had a blast berry was super nice and helpful it was very peaceful but ice maker, jacuzzi and toilet needed to be cleaned better but overall great stay and had funny"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We had a wonderful stay and we wish we could have stayed longer! It was so nice and unique to have such a large space to walk around in a well kept mini forest with birds of all kinds. Very easy to pet the sweet and friendly emu you share the forest area with! Definitely would stay again when I'm in Atlanta.

2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"almost missed the review window because Ive been so busy, but I have to take the time to say that this is the nicest place I've ever been in my life. It is more expensive then some other houses in town but it is 100% worth every penny. The Space is huge, the treehouse you stay in is decorated beautifully inside, it has 3 large porches that overlook the property. there's a private patio with a hot tub. Next to that there is a trail that leads to a pond with paddle boats you an float around in, there's a small creek that waterfalls into a zen garden with a gazebo and massive koi fish. There are giant sweet Emu birds that loved to be petted. There are 50 types of birds all over the property. This place is like another world tucked away in Atlanta, and it's super close to everything in the city too. I definitely would love to return here one day. book this place now, money comes and goes, but memories are forever, and you'll never forget this."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Had our small wedding here. It was beautiful.

2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,Barry was a great host and the Emu Ranch was the perfect getaway. I couldn’t believe this place existed in the middle of the city! I couldn’t decide whether I wanted to stay in the treehouse or explore the grounds more; both were fantastic. The animals were respectful and gentle. I would securit definitely recommend this location to anyone.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place exceeded our expectations! We hung out with friendly emus and other animals, enjoyed Barry’s incredible land and the house was AMAZING. Highly recommend!!"

Absolutely amazing .. thank you again for sharing your space. #hippiegirlsdream"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"My friend had come to Barry's treehouse for her anniversary and would always show me pictures of it on her phone, I hit a really low point in my life was just feeling down and needed an escape from reality for a second, I instantly thought of this place and booked it.
It was exactly what I needed and it was so much more beautiful in person, located In East Atlanta but feels like you are in another world, it was so peaceful and so therapeutic there are really no words to describe how good it was for my soul. I was able to be surrounded by nature, and for the first time in a long time I felt like the world slowed down for a minute. I cannot rave enough about this place, a hidden gem! Berry & Igor were so friendly, responsive they showed me around took a pic of me with their gorgeous EMU and it was exactly what I needed."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Barry is a genius! His collection of birds is astounding and it was so hard to leave such an awe-inspiring place. We fell in love with so many of the birds. They all have different personalities. This stay was unforgettable and we will be regulars!
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,A beautiful well designed and thought out space with so many details...you wont be disappointed.

2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"Barry's bird sanctuary has quickly become our Atlanta getaway from real life - our second visit in 7 months !!
The words don't really do it justice, so you need to experience it for yourself."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"The Emu’s nest is a truly magnificent and magical place. The emus and peacocks are just the start of the birds. There are dozens of gorgeous tropical birds, owls, parrots, and more. The property is amazing and gorgeous. The Tree house is something just as wonderful. Everything is cute and cozy, you have a true bird’s eye view of the property. I would recommend this property to any one who wants a romantic getaway or a nature getaway, or just an escape from everyday life."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Unique place to stay in the city. You won’t find anything like this! We can’t wait to stay again.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,Barry's place was marvelous. It was unique and comfortable and provides the perfect getaway inside the city for the luxury of both nature & city at your fingertips.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"Gorgeous guesthouse and grounds, even better than the pics, magical experience. Will return again and again."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"An amazing experience! It literally is an in-town oasis. Imagine, being right in the coolest of neighborhoods, yet, as soon as you step onto the grounds, you feel transported into your own little world. Even though Barry lives on the property, it is extremely private. The home was spotless with many thoughtful touches. The decor was magnificent.
The grounds are set up like a nature preserve, with beautiful trails, ponds, and exotic bird sanctuary spaces throughout the lush, green environment. The sounds are as if you are in an actual sub-tropical forest, as if you could close your eyes and be on the other side of the world. The friendly Emu was the cutest.
As we walked, I searched for the gorgeous peacocks I'd seen in the photos. We did not see them on the trail. Then, we arrived back to the front door of our lodging, and I was ecstatic to see the two lovely peahens perched right on our balcony, welcoming us back. Truly a magical, unique getaway."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Had an amazing stay at the treehouse! This was my second time there, and we loved every minute of it.
The treehouse is comfortable perfect for a weekend getaway.
We also hosted a party that we know guests will remember forever. Barry went above and beyond to help us with logistics.
Thank you, Barry for the beautiful set up, responsiveness, and flexibility to make sure we had a wonderful stay and event!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place is amazing. Such a pleasant surprise and stay. Can believe that a space like this exists in urban Atlanta. Would highly recommend - and have to thank the hosts for creating, providing and hosting such a great space and experience."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,Words don’t describe how great this place is…you just have to stay here and experience it. Where else do you get to relax in a hot tub with a friendly Emu in an amazing surrounding?? It’s was absolutely incredible!
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"You get everything you see in the photos, plus more. Our time at Barry’s Emu farm has become a core memory- This is the best way we can sum up our experience.
Igor is a kind and patient man. Thank you for everything!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place is a unicorn in Atlanta! Magic, whimsy, tranquil, beautiful - book it now!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Barry’s place was amazing! The most unique Airbnb I’ve even stayed in so far. Even better than the pictures. I took my lady there for a few days and she loved the place. It’s was pretty cool to get up close with the animals too! 10 out of 10 definitely recommend!
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,Great stay! Beautiful home and wonderful host!
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,Had a great time at the Emu Ranch / Treehouse! Enjoyed all the animals and the scenic views were perfect for our photoshoot. Barry was very accommodating and quick to respond to any of our questions. Thanks for making our stay/proposal magical. Will highly recommend 5/5.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,Barry's place was magical and a one of a kind experience. Barry was with us every step of the way explaining and giving us instructions on how to navigate his beautiful grounds. Farrah became a great friend and companion on our walks throughout the property! Would highly recommend this EXPERIENCE to anyone looking for a great spot place to stay in a beautiful area of Atlanta!!!
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Barry's place was beautiful and quiet. Was a great place for some relaxation. We really loved being able to interact with all his birds!
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"WOW! Paradise in the city. We were blown away by this unique AirBnB. Not only is Barry a great host, but the fact that he shares it with others is truly special. Every detail inside and out feels personally curated. It is a nature lover’s dream.
We were late to arrive but Barry was so understanding and accommodating. You drive through the gates of his property and suddenly the loud hustle and bustle of Atlanta disappears. Walking up the stairs of the treehouse, we were greeted by a peacock sleeping on the porch railing! The next morning we met Farrah one of the resident Emus and we spent the day meeting the ducks, swans, and rare birds. It was magical. All we wanted was a little staycation, but we got so much more.
We can’t wait to go again!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I don’t have enough words to describe the magic in Barry’s home. I could have stayed there for a month and would still not have noticed all of his beautiful attention to detail. His passion for his animals and his gardens and his home furnishings are remarkable. It was an honor to be invited to stay in his home! And his menagerie of animals who greet you once you enter the property… I’ve never seen anything like it!
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Cannot say enough good things about this stay. Barry’s place is unlike anywhere I’ve ever stayed. Truly a one of a kind destination. We walked around with an Emu and looked at exotic birds. The space was very cozy and well thought out. My girlfriend and I had a fantastic time. Don’t think twice to book this!!
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"This place was AMAZING! I booked it for Mother’s Day and couldn’t have gotten a better spot. The pictures didn’t do it justice as the house and property was extremely beautiful. Farrah the emu was such a cutie, the swans were beautiful, some of the birds spoke to us, and there was a peacock who kept watch for us on the deck at night! Barry was also very pleasant to work with, super hospitable. Such a great experience!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"When my husband and I arrived, Barry greeted us and showed us how to get into the Airbnb and talked to us about his property. He also left us a wonderful gift bag with snacks, drinks, and even some honey he makes on his property. He also gave us a paper with great restaurants and things to do close to his AirBnb. The property was absolutely stunning. The treehouse looks exactly like the photos but the best pet was getting to see all of Barry’s beautiful birds & the property in which they lived on. Every morning, we were greeted by a beautiful peacock just outside the entrance door & we were able to get up close & pet one of his friendly pet Emu’s. Barry’s place is a jungle paradise! You will not regret staying here. We hope to come back soon because we are already missing the beautiful oasis and the birds!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Loved every second of our stay. Barry’s Emu Ranch was amazing! Highly recommend!
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"Absolutely incredible! You truly cannot understand how peaceful and beautiful this place is unless you go in person. I have never felt so far away, so close to home. I will absolutely go back again!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"This place is magical. If you are questioning to stay here or not, don’t. Do it! You won’t regret it. Barry is such an accommodating host and Farrah is the best welcome committee ever. 20/10 stars!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,We can’t find the words to explain how cool this place is. Berry has obviously put a lot of thought into everything here. We will be staying here again “Amazing Place”
2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"Lives up to the hype, plus more."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,A truly unique experience - Farrah the emu was the icing on the cake!
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful!!
2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,Words cannot describe the beauty and serenity I experienced during my stay at this airbnb. Barry was a gracious host who explained everything in detail when he greeted us during our arrival. The birds on the grounds are breathtaking. We were greeted by Farrah a very friendly emu when we arrived and saw a peacock on the balcony outside the window before going to bed. This was a magical experience and am looking to stay here many more times in the future.
2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"My husband and I got married at this venue. Barry was AMAZING!! My husband and i had booked incorrectly and Barry worked so hard to make our wedding still happen in time, even finding us contacts for other places in case his wouldn’t work out. Throughout the entire stay he was awesome and super communicative and helpful. We'll definitely be coming back!!"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Barry’s place was amazing and we were in love with Farah the Emu!
2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,A last minute find that turned out to be a magical experience. We loved everything about this one-of-a-kind place. Thank you Barry!
2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,This was the air bnb of my dreams! Barry was an excellent host. He met me once I got to the property and showed me around. The animals that live on the property are such a beauty. The property looks like a fairytale. I will definitely be coming back!
2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"What an experience!! I would stay here again, and again. We had our morning coffee sitting on a balcony next to the most beautiful peacock (who slept there the whole night prior)!! Barry's attention to detail (for both the guesthouse and grounds) is unparalleled. The guesthouse/treehouse is cozy and immaculate, while the grounds are magical and wild. I left with a full heart and a desire for an Emu of my own. Thank you, Barry!!"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place is amazing. Barry has created a beautiful home nestled amongst the gardens and animals. You dont feel like you are in the city at all. The house itself is beautiful, unique and peaceful. The gardens and all the animals are a jot to walk around and visit each day. The location is less than a mile from East Atlanta Village and within 10-15 minutes of Ponce, Krog St, the beltline, the Zoo, Grant park, Virginia Highlands and more. Barry was friendly and a great host. We greatly appreciate him for opening his little oasis up for others to enjoy."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed one night,Barry is the best host!!!! I have nothing bad to say about him. I would definitely go back with my fiancé. She fell in love!!
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place was amazing!! Way more beautiful than pictures could ever show. The birds were all beautiful and friendly, we particularly liked the yellow napes Amazon parrot who told us she was a “good girl” and she was! Farrah the Emu was the perfect guide and came with us everywhere we walked. Waking up to the gorgeous peacock every morning was awesome. The host was very kind and close by if we needed anything, but left us to do our own thing. 1000/10 recommend!"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Amazing getaway adventure. The most beautiful place in Atlanta. Book it now!
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Perfect place for our elopement. Beautiful property and whimsical gardens that make you feel like you're in another world. Thanks to Barry and his wonderful hosting. Wouldn't change a thing!
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Absolutely loved this place!! Words can’t describe how beautiful the grounds are and how wonderful Barry is!!
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Barry’s place is a hidden gem. The location is perfect to go anywhere in Atlanta, no more than 20 min each direction. Barry was super friendly and nice to talk to and more than willingly to help at a moments notice. The house definitely feels like a getaway and does not even feel like you are in Atlanta. The Property is just as breath taking as the house. The amount of time and energy Barry puts into the property is what makes it special."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"This was our 4th time staying at Barry’s. Absolutely love this place. This is a secret hidden gem in the United States. If you can find it available, then book it! You won’t regret the experience. Barry and his incredible animal family is why we keep coming back. The tree house is incredible also."
2023-02-01,5,Stayed one night,Thank you so much for that experience. In my life it was honestly needed and I appreciate the hospitality and all the extra amenities and accommodations you had. Please tell my new best friend emu that one day I will see you again and you are already missed. Lol.
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Our stay was amazing. He greeted us at the door to make sure we could get inside with the door code and there was a little gift bag waiting for us inside. The place was beautiful and very clean. We had a great time walking through the ranch and checking out all the birds. It was a wonderful and relaxing stay.
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I booked this airbnb for a surprise proposal, and it was amazing. The airbnb is so beautiful and looks even better than the pictures: I am beyond grateful to been able to make the memories of asking the love of my life to spend the rest of our lives together. The airbnb was the prefect touch of greatness! It’s honestly like a hidden treasure in atlanta. You would never knew some so peaceful and beautiful was in the city"
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Barry's ranch was absolutely picturesque. I was so impressed by the attention to small details. I can't say enough good things. This was like a private and peaceful getaway in the heart of the city of Atlanta.. the perfect getaway to accommodate whatever you're in the mood for. The animals were all so beautiful, especially the peacocks and Farrah. We fell in love with Farrah. We were apprehensive because it's an emu, but she was so sweet, kind, and gentle. We were fascinated from start to finish. I definitely plan to go back. Thank you all for everything. It was amazing!"
2023-02-01,5,Stayed one night,It was just wonderful. You never would have known you were in the middle of Atlanta. Everything about it was great.
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Perfect birthday getaway. Host was very accommodating to my early check-in request and other special requests. Place was wonderful and looked like the pictures. Will definitely return!
2023-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"Unbelievably Fantastic! more than I expected! Wonderful, perfect, highly recommend!"
2023-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"The photos will not do this place justice. This is like it’s own little sanctuary. If you are conflicted at all, book this place and you will not be disappointed. Beautiful birds, you might get lucky and the peacocks will show up in the deck. It is a perfect get away from being “in the city” but being in nature at the same time. Take a walk in the backyard it is amazing and like I said, the photos will not do justice. Have fun!"
2023-02-01,5,Stayed one night,This place is a MUST visit if you’re planning on a weekend getaway or want to visit Atlanta. We had our wedding ceremony here and it was absolutely beautiful. The place looks just like the pictures and the accommodations are fantastic. We can’t recommend this place enough. It’s amazing!
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Amazing spot. Super clean. Fantastic host. Must stay. If you’re looking at the listing right now and it’s open, just book. Outstanding."
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was our second stay, and a very much needed break. The accommodation itself is luxurious and fascinating, with so much to see without even leaving the building. I can't speak highly enough, and we can't wait to visit again."
2023-01-01,5,Stayed one night,Fantastic as usual. I adore this place. Thank you Barry. I notice all the special touches.
2023-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"Just a magical place to have a couples retreat. Barry is a great host, the treehouse is amazing, and the wildlife is something to behold. You will be greeted by an Emu, sing with exotic parrots, and sleep in the trees.
We have been here twice and will definitely go back!"
2022-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"It’s a magical place, even much better than some must to see places in Atlanta. We had a private treehouse, lake, woods and lovely parrots and owls. The owner put lots of love in the treehouse and I do enjoy every corner and every moment of my stay. Thank you Barry."
2022-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"My husband and I came here for our one year anniversary. Barry was a great host and very responsive! The backyard area is incredible and one of a kind! Even in the 20 degree weather, we were so excited to be out there! We absolutely loved the backyard and the interior decor was so well thought out. Would 100% recommend to family and friends - we might even be back during warmer weather! Thank you, Barry!"
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"There are really no words to describe this place. It is truly magical and unique. The house is classy and cozy, but the grounds are amazing. It felt like staying in a jungle in the heart of Atlanta. You can hang out with an Emu over coffee on your porch and then go out to East Atlanta village for dinner- what is better than that? If you love the outdoors and birdwatching then this is the place to go. I would definitely go back!"
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We were taken aback after first getting to the Nest location. It’s SOOO beautiful and peaceful! And all of the animals in the photos actually live throughout the property!!! They are so friendly. This place over exceeded my expectations and an AMAZING HOST to go along with it all. Thank you Barry!!!
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"It was beautiful. I loved the birds n emu
Barry was an awesome host"
2022-12-01,5,Stayed one night,Wonderful home! Barry is definitely living his lives passion to the fullest and sharing the experience with others.
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place is truly a hidden gem in East Atlanta. Property is peaceful and beautiful. Hidden away and very private but close enough to the city if you want to get out. Barry was an excellent host, very responsive and friendly. Highly recommend if you are in Atlanta."
2022-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"Such an oasis!
The pictures does this place no justice.
The host is extremely kind and helpful, and the space speaks for itself.
From the lakes to the swans and emus, you’ll forget you’re in the city. Or at least 5 min from it.
I recommend this as a staycation or a vacation for anyone."
2022-11-01,5,Stayed one night,Everything was top-notch and exceeded our expectations. The opportunity to meet Farrah was a delight and Barry was a great host; even including a welcome gift that included various snacks (and a helpful guide / instructions for the property).
2022-11-01,5,Stayed one night,My husband and I absolutely loved staying at this treehouse! The host was so great about communicating with us and we felt very comfortable and welcomed. Getting into the property was easy and the location was great. The property was beautiful my husband and I were up at dawn exploring the land and watching the birds we were like a couple of kids haha. The place is stocked with a great selection of wine for a fair price which really added to the fun! Privacy in the bedroom at the top of the treehouse is on point as well.. it’s super romantic :) The host even sells honey that is harvested on the ranch. It was also a short walk to restaurants in East Atlanta Village. I recommend ARGOSY! We can’t wait to return!
2022-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"Beautiful place!! I actually eloped here which was amazing because I didn’t need to decorate at all, the property was the perfect background. Barry and Igor were great hosts with quick communication. Definitely a must stay with at least 2 days if you can !"
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The treehouse is an ideal alternative to bustling downtown. A true retreat hidden in the midst of a neighborhood. High quality and natural elements tastefully done throughout.
2022-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"This was one of the best stays I’ve ever had. The place was truly amazing and beyond all expectations. As an Atlanta native, I honestly forgot I was even in the city. Will definitely return and recommend you check this place out!"
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"BE AWARE: I never stayed at a property like this before. The communication was quick, the location was ideal, and the property was so peaceful and simply beautiful. Highly recommended!"
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Book this Now! You will not be disappointed! We stayed here for our 11th Anniversary. We had our very own private oasis for the weekend. We made many feathered friends but Farrah was our favorite. Barry gave us all the information we needed and was very helpful. This is a luxury experience and the home has all the bells and whistles. There's so much to explore around the beautiful property. We loved watching the coy swim in the pond. The parrots even talked to us. We cooked dinner in the full kitchen and watched TV. We had a date night in Atlanta going to Ray's In The City for dinner only 15 minutes away. We definitely recommend this one! Enjoy!!
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,A magical getaway in the perfect central location. Barry’s home and property feel like a complete oasis while still having easy access to East Atlanta Village and all it has to offer. We had the most beautiful two night stay and will never forget how enchanting this property and home was. Thank you for sharing it with us and if we ever return to this area we would not hesitate to book again. Highly Recommend!
2022-10-01,5,Stayed one night,The ABSOLUTELY BEST AIRBNB EVER! My husband and I had a wonderful time here! Thank you so much Barry for this amazing tree house and sharing your animals with us. Outside is just as awesome as the tree house. It’s unbelievable of what you will experience on this oasis! Definitely made my birthday and anniversary enjoyable. 10 STARS RECOMMEND!!!
2022-10-01,5,Stayed one night,Fantastic hospitality. Barry was wonderful. The home and property are absolutely beautiful and all the details are thought out perfectly! The animals are super friendly and make your stay memorable.
2022-10-01,5,Stayed one night,Beautiful hidden gem in an awesome neighborhood. This place is walking distance to The Glenwood area which features many bars and restaurants. Barry is very accommodating and maintained communication when necessary. Loved the garden. We had a chance to shoot in the garden for our wedding photos which turned out beautiful. And very friendly birds!
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My best friend and I thoroughly enjoyed staying at this property. The interior was beautiful and tastefully decorated. The grounds outside were astonishingly large for being so close to downtown Atlanta. We thoroughly enjoyed seeing the emus up close as they curiously followed us across the property. The other birds were quite beautiful, too! Would absolutely recommend, particularly to bird lovers!"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed one night,Excellent!

2022-10-01,5,Stayed one night,Barry’s place is truly unique and magical. We loved walking around the beautiful grounds that smelled of lovely tea olive and visiting with all the birds. The apartment was very well appointed and had wonderful style. Location was great and we wish we could have stayed longer!
2022-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"Even though we stayed for a single night, it was a fantastic experience. The house and grounds are lovely, eclectic, and unique. This place manages a secluded feel despite being a short walk from many restaurants. Highly recommended!"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We absolutely loved our stay! Batty was a perfect host. We have been to many places and have to say that Archimedes Nest has been one of the absolute top places to stay. The grounds are beautiful, the home immaculate, and we loved sweet Farrah (the resident emu). Thank you so much!"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"10/10 would recommend! Unique and gorgeous grounds, cozy accommodations, so many thoughtful details to make our stay even better."
2022-10-01,5,Stayed one night,Barry’s property was the most unique I’ve ever stayed in. You feel like you’ve been transported to another world but your 10 minute walk from downtown East Atlanta Village. Barry had great communication all weekend. Can’t wait to come back!
2022-09-01,5,Stayed one night,Me and my man celebrated our Anniversary I. The tree house and absolutely love it! We wished that we could have stayed longer :)
2022-09-01,5,Stayed one night,Barry was very welcoming and the place was peaceful the landscape was stunning!

2022-09-01,5,Stayed one night,Barry was an amazing host! The treehouse was beautiful and so unique. Highly recommend!
2022-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"Absolutely beautiful oasis near downtown. You would never know such a unique space existed amongst the trees.
Space was clean and inviting.
We will most definitely be visiting again.
You want to arrive at check in time to give yourself the time needed to relax!"
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I recommend this to any one who loves nature and just wants to relax in a really cool environment. My girlfriend and i loved every moment of being there !
2022-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"What an extraordinary place! I was nervous it wouldn’t live up to its pictures. This was way too cool to just be some house in East ATL. It’s even better in person! I was delighted by every moment. This stay delivered everything and then some: impeccable accommodations, amazing animals, and the gardens that feel right out of a dream. Don’t hesitate!"
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Barry’s emu ranch is such a peaceful, unique and thoughtful property. It is truly a hidden gem in East Atlanta Village and offers a beautiful sanctuary for anyone looking to escape away to a little oasis. The treehouse is incredibly thoughtful down to every detail - it is such a nice place of top quality, design, style and warmth. We would recommend Barry’s to anyone looking to treat themselves and have a calm, beautiful place to stay to set the scene."
2022-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"Barry’s place was more magical than we could have imagined. Farrah the friendly emu was sweet and even a little bashful as she followed us around the property. The swan pond was gorgeous too. The birds, owls, peacocks, additional emus, parrots, and more were just incredible. There was so much to explore that we also didn’t leave much once we arrived! The woods give way to this beautiful Japanese pond and garden. What a wonderful gem. Inside, I felt like we were in an art museum with fossils and gems and interesting things to look at. Barry has a wine honor bar along with a stocked kitchen with coffees, teas, pots, pans, etc! He kindly showed us how to use the gas stove (we have one at home and thought we would know how to work it) but still somehow were confused with the knob for the oven part. Regardless; we ate great food in atlanta and heated up our leftovers on the gas burners. We sat outside with a beautiful male peacock to drink our coffees while the females roosted in the trees. The treehouse is so cool and well-designed and it felt very private inside."
2022-09-01,5,Stayed one night,I would highly Recommend!! I haven’t stopped talking about this beautiful place since we’ve returned home.
2022-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"Don’t hesitate, book this amazing Airbnb now! The plants, animals, water features, and attention to the smallest details…. I can’t say enough, how fabulous this property is!!"
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is one of the most beautiful, unique Airbnbs out there. The home itself is gorgeously decorated and is full of amenities to make your stay comfortable, and the grounds are absolutely stunning. We had a mini wedding here and it was amazing - the dock was a perfect ceremony site, and there was plenty of space for us to wander and eat and dance. Barry was super responsive and helped us get the place ready for the event. I definitely recommend it!"
2022-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"Even if it’s just for a night, do it. It’s absolutely worth it."
2022-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"Beautiful home in a great location. I had my birthday party here and the event fee was high, but everybody loved the property and the vibe. So worth it."
2022-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"One of the most unique places you’ll ever stay! You feel like you’re staying in a 5 star hotel in the Amazon Jungle that also happens to be in the middle of a city. When you’re on the property, you feel like you’re in complete seclusion but then you step off the property and are close to everything Atlanta has to offer. Barry and Igor were amazing hosts, I can’t recommend this place more!"
2022-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great stay. Everything was well thought out and great communication. The set up and animals made it hard to believe you were ""in the city"". You will be doing will be doing yourself a disservice NOT booking this. We will definitely be staying again ."
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Truly a hidden gem! Barry is a wonderful host. Would definitely stay again.
2022-08-01,5,Stayed one night,Absolutely stunning! Every inch of this place is meticulously designed and is gorgeous from top to bottom inside and out. Barry goes out of his way to provide comfort to his guests and was beyond accommodating. He allowed flexible timing to fit our needs and answered every question we had immediately. We spend several days seeing what Atlanta had to offer and the best part was easily his home. I cannot wait to stay again.
2022-08-01,5,Stayed one night,The treehouse is wonderful! Everything you could ask for and a beautiful property to explore. Highly recommend.

2022-08-01,5,Stayed one night,Phenomenal experience at Archimedes Nest! I can’t say enough great things about the beauty of the property as well as location. 10/10 recommend!
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Barry and his place were amazing! Already planning another stay.
2022-08-01,5,Stayed one night,Amazing stay. Well worth it!
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Can’t say enough about how perfect this place is. Barry is a wonderful host and the house has everything you need. Igor greeted us at the gate and was extremely helpful. The gardens and the birds are beautiful. Archimedes Nest is a magical getaway.
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We enjoyed sitting on the deck with one or more of the peafowl and listening to the birds and the frogs. A great place to spend our anniversary. Barry was super responsive and we'd stay here again.
2022-07-01,5,Stayed one night,Wow! We were so impressed with our stay at Archimedes Nest at the Emu Ranch! The airbnb itself was stunning. The decor and details were so well thought out and so cozy! We were absolutely blown away by our outdoor experience. We are now in love with Emus! The landscaping and trails made me feel like I was in a secret garden right in the middle of Atlanta. I had coffee in the morning with a super friendly Emu and two swans who I wanted to take home with me. I can't wait to book this airbnb again in the future!
2022-07-01,5,Stayed one night,My daughter and I had a wonderful stay at Barry's exotic treehouse. We loved meeting Farrah and all the animals. STAY HERE!!
2022-07-01,5,Stayed one night,Mr. Barry is a very nice man.
2022-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"It was my husband and I anniversary ! When i say it was amazing to stay in a treehouse, i was so elated and didn’t want to leave. Farrah (The EMU) was so friendly, we enjoyed the nature trail and the greenhouse. Barry was super nice and made us feel at home. At night it was so romantic to have the fireplace going and drinking wine. Thank you Barry for making our one year anniversary a memory to never forget!"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"Everyone says magical….I will have to do the same. MAGICAL!! We came for a night to celebrate my husbands birthday. He kept calling it “an experience” and it really was! We walked the grounds for probably 2 hours and I’m sure we still missed things.
My opinion is that it’s the best of both worlds….inside luxury and outside adventure. I felt like we had a private mini piece of the Zoo and Fernbank!!
I kept having to take videos because pictures just wouldn’t do it justice. I wanted the story behind EVERYTHING! The inside was so meticulously thought out it’s beyond impressive.
Please go yourself and splurge on this unique luxury adventure!!"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Book this place!!! The pictures do not do it justice. The architecture, views, animals, attention to detail and art work make this stay so amazing.!! The property has something new at every corner. The animals are beautiful and Farrah the Emu was the star of the show. We loved giving her love. Barry’s home is a masterpiece and his recommendations for things to do and see around the area were all spot on. Super nice and accommodating.
We will absolutely stay here again! 10/10 recommend."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"Such an incredible stay! Beautiful space inside & out. I hope to come back one day.
Thank you Barry and Farrah!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The place was amazing. I felt very comfortable in the time I was there, I stayed because of the Momocon at the Georgia World Congress Center and was conveniently close, it is also about a 9 minute walk from Marta station.
There were condiments in the refrigerator and also tea and coffee, in addition to quite a few snacks they left for me, the place was comfortable and I was able to feel at home during my stay.
It's totally worth the price, it's perfect. If I go back to Atlanta I will definitely stay there again"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Super cute tiny home in a great location! Walking distance to the park, coffee shops, & not too far from the Beltline. I would definitely stay here again! Thanks for a lovely stay!"

2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What a great little spot!! Man, this place is all that's right about AirBnBs! Great host, great location, in the heart of Atlanta, but somehow still feeling quiet, secluded and peaceful. Every thoughtful amenity of a full-size home, tastefully loaded into a quiet backyard tiny house. Just minutes from the Summerhill and Inman Park neighborhoods. I will definitely look to stay here again when visiting Atlanta for work!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great spot, would book again!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Drew’s place was beautiful and his responsiveness was fast and very helpful. I just loved the place and wished i could have stayed longer. I’d definitely recommend it to others and hope i can come back later this year!

2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,What a beautiful stay we had in Atlanta thanks to this sweet little tiny house! We walked to coffee/breakfast in the morning and dinner each night and even to the show we came to Atlanta to see! Loved the walkability so much. The place was quiet and comfortable and had everything we needed. It is furnished beautifully and we greatly appreciated the snacks and tea! The Oakwood Cemetery was a welcomed surprise (just steps away) and we spend hours walking around learning so much about the history of Atlanta. An added bonus was that the Carolina Jessamine was in full bloom throughout the neighborhood.

The free street parking was also great, I would 100% stay here again!"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is one of the best rentals I have stayed in. Beautiful space with every detail thought of, we thought it was designed by an interior designer. Cozy and spotless, plus they left us snacks, coffee, and tea! The neighborhood has lots of places to eat and walk, and the rental is down a dead end side street. We really enjoyed touring the MLK historic district which is less than a mile away."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"A comfortable and peaceful getaway, within striking distance from all of Atlanta's main attractions. This Grant Park guest house is one of the best deals I've ever found on Airbnb. The decor and ambience are of the highest quality.

Stay here, you won't be disappointed!"

2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,My husband and I visited for a week in the way of football games. The location was great and the house was perfect. The neighborhood was very safe and easy access to the airport. Can’t wait to come back.

2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My stay at Drew's was seamless and peaceful. There was quite a bit to do within a walkable distance, and it was conveniently distanced from the nearest train spot. Despite the proximity to these, there were no issues with noise and the neighborhood was very quiet. Nice amenities including a full kitchen. Overall a wonderful stay and I'd absolutely stay here again if I'm in Atlanta. I highly recommend it!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"It’s the best spot in Atlanta! I’ll never consider a dingy airport hotel ever again. Just a few steps away from the most beautiful cemetery and close to many other attractions. Parking was a breeze and we felt very safe leaving our car in front of the house on the street. It’s a very quaint and cozy neighborhood area.
The tiny house itself is PERFECT. You will want to move in after staying here. I enjoyed everything about it, including the extra random amenities such as half and half for the Nespresso coffee in the fridge, butter, a strainer, seasonings, aluminum foil, etc. I always find myself needing these things in other AirBnbs and it’s a pain to run to the store. The house was extremely clean and organized upon arrival. Comfy bed, smart TV, cool lighting, hot water, multiple places to set your luggage, and mirrors where you need them. 10/10!!!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Drew’s place just as described and even better. The neighborhood was quiet and safe but within minutes from the convention center. Perfect for alternative to downtown hotels.

2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Stylish and cozy place, perfect for a couple. Easy access to highway and then everywhere in the city if no traffic. But the neighborhood is also nice and peaceful, walkable to bars and restaurants around."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The tiny house was perfect for our 2 night stay in Atlanta. Our plane was delayed but there was still no problem accessing the home in later hours. Drew was very explanatory of the self check in. The accommodation is just as described, but when you are actually there you can see just how much thought they put into their place. The wall colors, the lighting, the comfort of the bedding and towels, the cleanliness . I have to say I really appreciated the fact that they had a freezer with an ice machine. This might only matter to summer time visitors, but when you are walking and touring a city and it’s 103 degrees outside… ice to make your water cold is so appreciated! The neighborhood is tree lined and felt safe to walk to local restaurants. The MARTA train station is 1/2 mile. We walked to it during the day. We did find there were some unhoused people sleeping under the bridge that you have to walk under to get to the station. Totally recommend the tiny house!!"

Drew and Meg were responsive and were great hosts. Highly recommend staying at this air bnb, 10/10 experience."

It felt like staying at a private studio. The location was great - everything I had planned (aquarium, zoo, ponce city market, shopping district, etc) was all less than 10 minutes away. The location itself is in a residential neighborhood that was great and made you feel safe in a big city; there were also many restaurants and places down the block from the location for a quick bite.

2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,me and my husband had an awesome time at this location. the tiny home had all of the necessary amenities and was conveniently located close to downtown atlanta without too much traffic around the area. parking was a breeze and the home was easily accessible with plenty of privacy
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This tiny house, located on a quiet street near Grant Park and historic Oakland Cemetery, is clean, comfortable and stylish. I appreciated the thoughtful amenities, including a well stocked kitchenette with an array of condiments, organic half and half, fresh butter and popsicles in the fridge. Best yet a Nespresso! The double bed was just fine for one although a couple might find it a tight squeeze. (But, hey, it’s a tiny house!) Given that the host apparently lives next door the house and yard felt surprisingly private. And while I never saw Drew, he was always quick to respond to messages. Final note: I didn’t have a car but those who do might find the street parking problematic."
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This place was super cute and functional and very conveniently located. We parked our car out front and took short and cheap lyft rides to our shows at central park and were able to get Grubhub delivered when we stayed in. Would definitely stay here again!! Popsicles in the freezer was a big and pleasant upside lol!!
2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Quaint, impeccably clean, and beautifully well-appointed--this lovely guest house was perfect for our stay. While you are in the city at this location, the area has a very neighborhood-like feel and was close to several eateries. We felt safe here, and the supplies and amenities at this small cottage were everything we needed for a comfortable and enjoyable stay. I would definitely rent from Drew again if I'm ever in the area. He was responsive and helpful throughout our stay. Highly recommend his property!"

2022-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The place was nice and small, just enough for two people. I love the set up, it's very comfy. They got a nice little espresso machine which was great and some snack which came in handy for me since I was traveling with a toddler. They got netflix and disney plus which was great on rainy days we were there in atlanta. The house is in a backyard, in a city neighborhood. Location was great. We felt safe the whole time. I would highly recommend this place."

2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Drew’s tiny house in Atlanta is beyond stunning. Every detail was so well thought out and you could tell a lot of love was put into the space. It was spotless, had everything we could’ve needed (including extra towels, pillows, and blankets), and was super cozy. Drew was super easy to communicate with and gave easy to follow instructions. If she could, my fiancé would move in! Parking was a breeze with a spot right outside of the house and it’s only a 10 minute Uber/Lyft to downtown. There’s an amazing tequila bar just down the street, which made our dinner choice easy. We will definitely book with Drew the next time we’re in Atlanta!"

2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I thoroughly enjoyed my 2 day stay at Drew’s tiny house. I am a local and I know this neighborhood well.

2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is a great place to stay! Clearly, a lot of thought went into creating a lovely and comfortable place for travelers to stay. Loved every little detail including the light switches and the carefully selected books.
Drew is a responsive host who gave clear directions and instructions.
The location is great with coffee shops, stores, and restaurants nearby. I highly recommend Mezcalito's just a block away! There's also a Marta stop within walking distance which is convenient for those who aren't traveling with a car. All in all, it was an A+ experience."

2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Everything you need in this house and great communication with the hosts. Would definitely recommend and stay again. Felt safe and secluded which was much needed for my escape from the city to write and relax. Fully stocked amenities and very clean house.
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Drew’s place was great. It looked nice, it was clean, it was quiet, and it wasn’t far from things we needed. One of the best places I’ve stayed and i will be staying again"

Contacting Drew was really easy and my stay was delightful! Highly recommend!
2021-08-01,5,Stayed about a week,"I stayed at the tiny house for 8 days because my son was doing something at Georgia Tech. It was by far an amazing experience. The pictures don’t do this house justice. The decor, the colors, the whole house is amazing. It was very peaceful. When I did have questions, Drew answered it within the hour. I went to Tin Lizzy’s(which was right by the house) and food is awesome. The cemetery is nice to explore. If you are looking for a peaceful and laid back safe, this is the home for you!!!"
2021-07-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"The location is great. It’s in the city, but the neighborhood is fairly quiet and full of Victorian and old craftsman homes that are being beautifully revitalized. There are tasty local restaurants a short walk or even faster drive away. I highly recommend The Little Tart—best almond croissant I’ve had outside of Paris.
The tiny house is smartly appointed. You’ve got everything you need in a tight space, but it doesn’t feel cramped. It’s also beautifully decorated with high ceilings and lots of natural light.
Check-in and check-out were both super easy. Communication from the host was timely and clear. The listing pictures are accurate. Overall, I think it’s a great value.
Reasons for 4 over 5 star rating:
Although generally clean (and I’m picky about this), there was a lot of noticeable dust in some areas.
The bed was not the comfiest. The mattress and pillows felt low-quality and like they had seen better days."
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Such a lovely tiny home! We had everything we needed and more. Great location!
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,An utterly charming tiny home that is stylishly appointed and has everything you need during your stay. Just big enough and just cozy enough for travelers to Atlanta. Walking distance to quite a few restaurants and amenities. Easy Uber/Lyft ride into the city. Great communication from the owner and an easy check-in/check-out process. I'll definitely be back!
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This tiny house is wonderful! Extremely clean and felt very spacious thanks to thoughtful choices of furniture/storage and tall ceilings. Drew was extremely responsive and check in was as simple as a text telling us the passcode, so we could arrive any time. There were complimentary snacks, a coffee maker, and a brita water pitcher available as well as the other amenities like Roku TV. This house is in a safe neighborhood and we had access to multiple restaurants within a short waking distance. We loved our stay!"
2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This tiny house is great! Very clean, cozy and the location is the best, very close to all the activities (zoo,aquarium,world of Coca cola, downtown) is around 10 minutes drive so is awesome.

2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The place was easy to find and it was around MLK’s childhood home. I would love to come back around here. The neighborhood was peaceful. The only thing that I would advise that the living room tv had more streaming services.

2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,Fantastic stay in an incredible location!
2024-04-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Booked this property in central east Atlanta by chance as relatively close to golf courses we were playing. The Old Fourth turned out to be a fabulous spot to base ourselves . Close to some great restaurants, Krog St Market, Ponce City Market and the Beltline. Vic host was excellent and accommodating when we needed to book another night. Great and upcoming neighbourhood. Strongly recommended."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Met our needs perfectly. We were in town for a tournament at World Congress Center. Great neighborhood, nice stay."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The gold standard of Airbnbs. This house just radiates peace and contentment. When Vic says his house is your house, he means it. Plenty of great restaurants and historic sights and running trails nearby, but you'll enjoy every minute around the dining room table, in the cozy beds, and lounging on the porch. Stay here--you will be back. I promise."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We loved staying at this house for our trip to Atlanta. It was an easy walk to Krog market and some really cool restaurants and bar. It was also in the MLK district.
Getting an Uber to go other places was super easy and we were able to get to airport, zoo, aquarium, world of Coca Cola and much more with ease.
Vic was flexible with our check in time which helped us make the very most of our first day in the city. Would definitely stay here again!"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Vic had a great home in Atlanta. Such a wonderful host! The off street parking was very convenient. The place is comfortable furnished and neat as a pin.

2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great descriptions and helpful with every step.
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Really nice spot that felt like home away from home. The hosts were so nice and clear with instructions and expectations. Definitely recommend for any length of stay!
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Vic’s house is in a great neighborhood literally on the edge of the Martin Luther King national park. I don’t mind walking and from VICS location You could walk downtown, to the Carter library, to 5 points and many other interesting neighborhoods. The neighborhood was super quiet and safe, and I would stay there again in a minute!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Vic and his family treated my wife and I very well.
Great location: Auburn Avenue/MLK district, Beltline, and other neighbor are really accessible. The neighbors are friendly and respectful.
The home is historic, yet modern and appointed with the latest technology: TVs, Smart heating, humidifiers, great stove, and a kitchen that has EVERYTHING, from china and glassware to paper plates! This kitchen accommodates cooks or those who prefer carryout.
The house is one of the cleanest we have ever seen. Top rate.
When in Atlanta OFW again, I would definitely stay again.
E. Miller"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The location couldn’t be better! The street was tree-lined and lovely and steps away from the King Historic District, with lots of restaurants and the Beltline super close by as well."
2023-10-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Fantastic location.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"quiet, cozy home close to downtown. Vic was super responsive when we called and we met his sister, who lives nearby, and she was so welcoming.

2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I enjoyed the stay .. the decor was nice and I like the fact that it's located in a historic area.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Mr. Vic’s place was great & he was an awesome host. He lives close by so he was able to respond quickly to anything. The house was very clean, comfortable and welcoming.
In the house there are prohibited areas that may seem strange and make you feel uneasy but Mr. Vic was very gracious enough to put my guest mind at ease. There is a 3rd room labeled “prohibited” but don’t be alarmed that room was for storage. There’s also and small closet in the hall labeled the same, that is the washer and dryer. Also in the primary bedroom there is a chained chest. That is personal family heirlooms. Like I said it would make you uncomfortable to see these things but Mr. Vic had no problem coming over to show what was there to put her mind at ease.
There’s a lot of things to do in the area. All the major things like Coca Cola World, College Football Hall of Fame and the National Civil and Human Rights Museum are all about a 10 minute drive. Mr. Vic also had some great recommendations for things."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This is our second stay here. And we'll definitely be coming back next year. Vic's place is an excellent location in a nice quiet neighborhood.

Very walkable, and close to MLK Jr. National Park, Krog Market, Ponce City Market, and the Jimmy Carter Center, as well as a local market where you can purchase groceries/wine, etc. We enjoyed relaxing in the mornings on the front porch with our coffee, and later in the evenings. The home is very private, and the space is very relaxing. The bed we used was very comfortable. Vic was awesome in communicating before, during, and after our visit; he gave us a lot of suggestions on things to do before we arrived. Hope to return!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We had a great stay at Vic’s property. Will be back.
2023-08-01,4,Stayed with kids,Vic’s place was what we needed while we moved our scholar into her new home. We felt at peace and felt right at home. I would stay again.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Vic was a fantastic host, allowing us to check in early and check out late as our flights were early and late. Vics home was EXTREMELY clean and very easy to find. His red folder provided EVERYTHING we needed to know. We enjoyed our time and if ever in the area again, I would for certain book with Vic. Sidenote.... Agave restaurant was AMAZING!!! Thanks Vic!!"

2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great location, comfortable home, walking distance to Krog Street Market & the belt line. It was a great, safe location to see Atlanta.
My only improvement would be the wifi - there are 3 different ones to choose from but I tried them all and still had to hot spot occasionally for work through our stay"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Vic was a great communicator - it was a nice place, and an even better location. So close to a lot of the major attractions in Atlanta!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Vic's place is a perfect home away from home for 4 people. The house was very clean. Kitchen was overly complete :) Beddings were very comfortable and sheets all very nicely prepared and we all had very good sleep after a tiring day. We were so happy with Vic's home. He was expectedly very responsive. Vic has an ACE with his airbnb. His sister Jacqui lives nearby and is very very gracious and kind in welcoming us to their nice, quiet neighborhood. Dont look too far. We highly recommend staying in Vic's home for sure."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great location! Sweet house!

2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great location; around the corner from MLK Historic Park, walkable to Krog Market, Beltline, neighborhood restaurants and a bit longer walk to Carter Center. Quiet neighborhood and bedrooms had light tight shades and blackout curtains, comfortable beds so excellent sleeping."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Felt like home. House was clean and as described. Dedicated parking spot was key because many cars are parked on the streets. Great location very walkable to near by restaurants and MLK historic sites. Easy walk to trolley ride to downtown park and museum locations. Felt safe and were surrounded by other beautiful homes. Highly recommended. Would stay here again if returning to ATL. Try Yay Beignets just down the street easy walk or drive they have great beignets and coffee.
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We had a lovely stay at Vic's house. Vic provided thorough instructions before our arrival so there were no surprises. The beds were comfortable and the house was well appointed. Jacquee, the host designee, was also super friendly when we met her, and she was flexible and responsive when we had to leave a rental crib on the front porch. The only thing that perhaps we didn't expect was just how wonderful the neighborhood is, and how many great spots are within walking distance. It's a perfect jumping-off point for Atlanta. Many thanks to Vic!"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Vic's home was just perfect for a few-day stay in Atlanta. We loved that it was in walking distance to so many things--the Beltline, Krog Market, the MLK Historic Area, and the streetcar that took us downtown for just $1 each way. We didn't drive at all while we were there.
The home was very comfortable and had a lovely front porch. I loved that there was lots of dresser space and lots of hangers in the bedroom closets. There was a ton of counter space for toiletries. We didn't really use the kitchen since Krog Market had so many great choices.
Vic sent us very clear and helpful directions about how to get into the house, where to park, and what to see. I really appreciated that each one was a different email so I didn't have to sort through one long email just to find the house code. He was great to work with.
I would definitely recommend Vic and his home if you're traveling to Atlanta! It was a fantastic place to stay!"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is a wonderful accommodation. The front porch is especially delightful with lots of birds, a friendly neighbor cat, and comfortable breeze. Vic's place even has an electric teapot. Lovely bed, cozy couch, I felt right at home."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"A very comfortable place, neighborhood and location"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great location with parking and 2 bathrooms, perfect for 4 people! The friendly neighborhood kitty who we dubbed “Mr. Whiskers” was also a bonus. :) We grabbed some scooters from the Beltline and used those when we didn’t want to walk, but so much is within walking distance. Amazing deal!"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Vic was a great host. I booked the home for my Grandmother who was visiting and she felt right at home. Thank you Vic!
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Such cute place in an amazing location. We walked everywhere! MLK's home is around the corner, the King Center is down the street, Krog Food hall is within stumbling distance. We even walked to The Carter Presidential Library and downtown (we like to walk). The home was cozy without feeling cramped, and when I bungled locking the door Vic was very quick to help. We got great recommendations and communication was abundant and clear. I highly reccommend!"

It's very convenient to downtown and located in a very peaceful and safe neighborhood. Everything about this stay was a plus - clean, quiet, comfortable, and convenient. Vic is very kind and quick to respond. I would recommend Vic's house to anyone who wants to feel at home while they are traveling. I'll be staying here again and again."
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Vics place was clean, well stocked. it provided everthing we needed for this trip. The location was perfect for our intended itinerary. our trip consisted of visiting the Jimmy Carter museum, MLK birth home and center, and the Capitol building. everything was less than 10 minutes away.

We had a lovely vacation in Vic’s house!"
2022-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Very good stay at the house! The house is spacious and super comfortable. Positive point that there is parking inside the property for two cars.
For a fee of U$S25 you can use the washer and dryer during your stay."

2022-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We loved our stay at Vic's home. The house was so cute and a perfect location for us! The beds were comfy and the bathrooms clean and all kept. There was plenty of extra towels as well. There were minimum toiletries, shampoo, soaps, ect, but I always bring my own anyway. The kitchen had everything we needed, though the dishwasher wasn't working. My only complaint was the keypad lock gave alot of difficulty and wasn't always engaging.
Vic answered any questions or concerns we had very quickly. We definitely recommend staying her and we hope to again. Thanks Vic!"
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Probably the best airbnb I've stayed in yet. The location was perfection, so many things to do within walking distance and so easy to to get other parts of the city as well! The house was clean and comfortable, beds were so great.

Very close to the MLK historic district, thr Krog Street Market and the Beltline. At MLK historic district departs a streetcar that brings you directly Downtown to all the touristic highlights, such as Georgia Aquarium etc. Vic was a very nice host, giving all the information we needed for a perfect stay."

2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Excellent location! Walking distance to so many wonderful parts of the Beltline. Krog Street is a must but so is LottaFruta which is only a block away. Best fresh fruit! Host was super easy to communicate with and the house was just as pictured! Will stay again!

2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is the best value I’ve ever found in Atlanta! There is plenty of room and Vic is probably the best host I’ve ever had! My favorite part about the house was the beautiful porch. There is a nice breeze almost all the time and there were beautiful twinkle lights. This house is also in a perfect location for getting around the city. We found a ton of interesting things to do very close by. Martin Luther King Jr.’s birth home is within walking distance, as well as many restaurants and shops. I highly recommend this home and can’t thank Vic enough for his help during our visit!"
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,First time in ATL and this was the perfect place didn’t realize I was around so much history. Vic’s place is excellent has 2 parking spaces. You don’t have to worry about finding parking. Very comfortable setting inside and outside. Neighbors are friendly. Plenty of restaurants & attractions in walking distance. I will definitely be staying here again. Perfect location.

Recommended"
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a great time staying at Vic’s place. It was right around the corner from a bunch of bars and restaurants, and it wasn’t hard to get to downtown/midtown either. However, aside from the construction going on nearby, it was a very quiet and peaceful neighborhood."
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very nice location. Highly recommend.
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Can’t say enough nice things about Vic’s place- what a fantastic stay we had! The location is amazing, the house is beautiful, spotless and with everything you would need. After spending long days at a music festival, the big comfy beds were much appreciated. Vic was super quick to respond to any questions and a wonderful host. This will definitely be our “go to” spot for future visits!"

Vic is also a great host, responding very fast to any questions we had."
2022-03-01,5,Stayed over a week,"Home away from home in a centrally located friendly neighborhood. Clean, tidy, well equipped two bedroom, two bath home. Located a short walk from Atlanta's beltline trail. Vic and his sister Jackie are great hosts. Would stay here again in a heartbeat!"

2021-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great Place, Great Location! Was beyond satisfied with everything, thanks y'all ~"
2021-12-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Vic was an incredibly detailed and communicative host, both before and after the stay…which we very much appreciated. The house was quite clean and in a great area/neighborhood. Incredibly happy with that aspect of the stay.
The only thing I’d say is that only 1/4 of the stove burners worked, which was a bit of a bummer. And we did have some issues with the streaming services on the TV in all rooms. Neither of these things bothered us too much since we didn’t visit to stay in the house all weekend, but if these things are on your radar, just be sure to keep this in mind.
Overall, we very much enjoyed our stay and appreciate Vic’s hospitality letting us stay in his home. Would certainly consider staying here again in the future!"
2021-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great place to stay! Cute house, safe neighborhood, and perfect location. Many attractions were in walking distance which was great."

We felt safe and comfortable.
Super clean, great communication and easy instructions for parking, entry and use of items in the home.
Highly recommend for anyone wanting a sense of home away from home."
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"A friend and I stayed at Vic's home for a few nights while visiting from out of town. The location is great-- walking distance or a short drive to anywhere we were interested in going to. The house itself was clean and very comfortable. We ended up spending a good amount of time on the front porch, which was really nice. Instructions for everything were clear, and Vic was great about communication. Couldn't have asked for a better stay."
2021-10-01,5,Stayed over a week,Great home in a great location.
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I highly recommend staying here. It is clean and comfortable. The bedrooms have air purifiers, beds and couches are comfortable, and the off street parking was a huge plus for me. Vic’s place is close to all of the best stuff in Atlanta."
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Vic’s home was beyond amazing like super awesome. I misread the check-in instructions so I had trouble opening the door (lol) but Vic was quick to answer and not make me feel dumb even though I did! Haha - also the house was a couple of blocks from Krog Street Market (like a 5 minute walk), the porch was lovely as I drank my morning cup of coffee out there and my friends & I played cards out there too. The kitchen was stocked with all the items we needed to heat up or cook food. Bathrooms were stocked with extra towels and each room had a air purifier! The beds were so comfortable like I never slept better. We had such a blast and it was made possible because of Vic."
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is an awesome AirBnB! Vic was so kind and communicative!
The best combo of space, comfort, location and affordability.
Check in and out was easy.
$10 uber to downtown and cheaper if you use the Bird scooters.
Everything was great! We definitely will be using this place again if we come back to Atlanta."
2021-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,Great location! Close to the MLK sites and the Beltline. Host communicated in detail and frequently. We would definitely recommend and we be back next time we visit ATL!
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is a great space and perfect for what we needed. it was near many of the places we wanted to see. Krog market, beltline, MLK home and center were all within walking distance.
it's a beautiful neighborhood.
I got the impression that it is a family home, which for me is always nice, the home had character. it was clean and comfortable.
I would definitely stay here again."
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great stay!
2021-08-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Overall it was great. There were a few things that I found frustrating.
There were ""Prohibited"" labels everywhere they don't want people to get into. Although it's understandable to have off limit areas, there were a lot and it felt very unwelcoming. No big deal.
Vic is very quick to respond and willing to be helpful in any way.
If you are wanting to cook we felt there were really not all the supplies one needs when staying and using the kitchen. One reason we chose an AirBNB vs. a hotel was this fact. There were no serving and mixing bowls available - I had to use a pot and I really needed multiple bowls while preparing food . There is no blender, which is also a necessity.
There is a nice coffee pot but bring your own coffee.
The kitchen light SOMETIMES works. We had to turn it on and off multiple times to get it to work, each time.
The other thing was that there are no bathtub plugs. We had to makeshift our own to use the tubs...
The beds were extremely comfy which is probably one of the most important things!
Overall I would rate it as a 4.5."
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Location. Location. Location. Super walkable area. Close to everything. The house is so cute. Perfect for a laid-back girls trip. Would definitely recommend and would absolutely stay again.
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Travelers this is an awesome place to stay. The neighborhood is so quiet. We had off street parking and everything about the area was nice. If you're truly looking for home away from home, stop by Vic's Place - I assure you, you will come again"
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great location. Great price.
2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Second time my mom and I have stayed at Vic's place. The gold standard for an AirBnB! Great location, off-street parking, full kitchen amenities, tons of space. If you haven't stayed here yet, do it!"
2021-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Great central location, safe and quiet area, close to several restaurants and a few blocks from the beltine if you are interested in running. House has all amneties necessary to cook. Has for our visit, house is within 10-15 minutes from Georgia Aquarium/
Downtown Atlanta and Fernbank Museum"
2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,A great house to stay at and the location is good.
2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Nice place, clean, great location. Host was quick to respond"
2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Nothing lacking in this comfortable home plus off street parking in a very quiet neighborhood yet very close to downtown Atlanta.
2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"If you are looking for a convenient place to stay, this is the location for you. Excellent place to stay. The house was very clean and had all of the amenities' we needed. Conveniently located to every place we wanted to see and do. Quiet neighborhood. Loved sitting out on the front porch each evening."
2021-05-01,4,Stayed with kids,"The location of this house is wonderful. It's a 5min walk to the Beltline, which is lovely for family walks or a morning job. Ponce City Market is about 20mins down the Beltline. We walked to Krog City Market a couple times for yummy food. The street is lovely with lots of big trees and lovely yards.
Vic was very responsive in his communication. We had a few concerns about kitchen appliances and cleanliness and they were addressed."
2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great place to stay, clean porch and near beltline. Highly suggest!"
2021-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The location is unbelievable. Very short walk to the MLK site, Jackson Ave Bridge, lots of restaurants and only about half a mile from the nearest MARTA train station. Very convenient and in a quiet part of the neighborhood."
2021-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We wanted a nice quiet place to stay that was convenient to everything but away from the busy city. Well Vic's place was exactly what we needed. The two bedroom house was like coming home to grandma's house. it was clean, warm, and very inviting. The front porch was great to relax on in the morning and in the evening after a day of sightseeing which was just steps away from our doorstep. We walked to breakfast every morning and spent the rest of the day just exploring the culture, sites, and shops. All of this is within walking distance. This house is definitely the perfect location that I highly recommend and hope to stay again the next time I visit the ATL."
2021-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Loved, loved, loved staying at Vic’s! The location was walking-convenient to everything! We were able to park our car for the weekend and walk to great restaurants and coffee shops, historical sites, Krog Street Market, the Beltline and more. Vic made check-in super easy too. We’d definitely recommend Vic’s Place to anyone looking to explore all that Atlanta has to offer."
2021-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"I can’t say enough. Perfect location, extremely clean and inviting, and a super responsive host. When we come back to Atlanta, we won’t hesitate to stay here again."
2021-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Vic’s home is great! Spotless, comfortable, and has everything one could need. Beautiful historical area. Easy walk to many restaurants and coffee. If we are back in town there would be no question as to where we would stay again. Thank you!!!"
2021-03-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Great location, Vic was very responsive."
2021-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Vic's place is beautiful, comfortable, and perfectly located. Would definitely book again!"
2021-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Vic's place was amazing! A million stars.
The house is very comfortable and clean. The bedrooms and bathrooms are spacious. The sheets and towels smell amazing. The dining room chairs are surprisingly comfortable! We spent a lot of time sitting at them. The kitchen is very well stocked with fun mugs, glasses, plates, and silverware. It was also really great to have off-street parking.
Vic's house is within walking distance to so many places (the Beltline is literally three minutes away). There were always tons of people out and about in the neighborhood, walking their dogs or jogging. We usually stay in a hotel in the suburbs when we come, so it was so nice to be in the heart of the city and not have to drive everywhere. If you are a vegan or have dietary restrictions, know that Vic's place is walking distance to Slutty Vegan and Revolution Doughnuts! There's also non-dairy ice cream options within walking distance (Jeni's Splendid Ice Cream and Jake's).
We've already booked our return trip, so book this place whenever you get a chance!"
2021-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great location, nice place. Comfortable, well appointed. Easy to communicate. Would stay again."
2020-11-01,5,Stayed over a week,"This home is an absolute gem. Located in one of Atlanta's most important, most historic, most convenient, most exciting neighborhoods. Walkable to MLK's birthhome and the Sweet Auburn district as well as the Beltline, Inman Park, Ponce City Market, Edgewood, and so many other Atlanta landmarks. The house has everything we needed for a stay - a great porch, plenty of space inside, a fully stocked kitchen, everything. Vic was an excellent and attentive host - thorough, kind, and responsive. A truly special place."
2020-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great home!!!!
2020-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This place was perfect. It’s located in the perfect little neighborhood near everything downtown - very quiet and it feels safe. The house was clean and had everything we needed. Parking around back was a plus - didn’t have any worries there. Vic was very responsive and communication was great. Would def recommend and stay again !
2020-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Love this place very clean
2020-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"My family and I absolutely loved Vic's place. He worked with us when we needed to extend our stay and the house is in a wonderful neighborhood, so calm and quiet. Everything was great! We would love to stay at Vic's place again."
2019-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Unbelievably quiet neighborhood! We loved the location of this home. It was very close to our son’s apartment and to many restaurants, as well as the interstate. The house is tastefully appointed and Vic is very responsive. He had water bottles and snacks for us on arrival. We loved that we could park behind the house, even though street parking was available. The neighborhood is very pretty and surrounding homes very well maintained. We had my elderly parents with us and so we drove most places. If they hadn’t been with us we would have walked to Krog St and Ponce City Market. Great home in a terrific location. We highly recommend!"
2019-07-01,5,Stayed about a week,Vic was a great host - very accommodating with a couple of special requests supporting my son’s wedding during our week stay. Vic’s home is very clean and the location is outstanding...quiet neighborhood and friendly neighbors. One recommendation - internet coverage within the home was a bit weak.
2019-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"First and foremost Vic was an outstanding host. Quick to reply to any needs, concerns or just simple questions. Not a single question or request was met with an ounce of frustration or more than a few minutes of time before a response. He was extremely helpful in planning the specifics of our trip and made things easy from the word ""Go"". Communication is such a huge part of a great experience and Vic hit a home run.
As far as his location and property. In my opinion, was perfect. If your looking for a luxury accommodation in posh area of town this isn't your spot. However, if you're looking for a beautiful home that provides the comfort of your own home, in an area so full of rich history that was so critical in our countries history that is surround by other amazing homes. This is your spot! Streets line with blooming trees and well maintained yards surround this location.
It's close enough to be able to experience Atlanta and all the surrounding areas simply using Marta trains, buses or an occasional UBER. We flew in , took Marta to his location (with help from Vic on the right routes to take) and stayed there without ever using or needing a car. If you take this route beside you're okay with walking 5-10 mins depending on your Station needs and enjoying the area as you walk to Marta station. Otherwise you may be a tad disappointed, but we loved it.
I'd absolutely book this location again and plan to next time we're in Atlanta!
Thanks Vic!"
2019-06-01,5,Stayed over a week,"The house is the best location. Its on a wonderful little street and is very walkable to Krog Street, Beltline, MLK museum, many restaurants etc. Vic is a great host. Would definitely stay here again."
2018-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is a charming small home in a historical neighborhood. It definitely gave me the sense of Dr. Kings environment and upbringing. It is also a neighborhood that is very walkable to downtown, yet quiet and peaceful. Good coffee and cafes close by. Very hip Krobs market with lively restaurants and the Atlanta Beltline walk within blocks.
The home is clean and comfortable, and has a lot of real home feeling, with a fully stocked kitchen and logical seating and lighting. It is not a fancy place, and not renovated to those expect modern kitchen, bath, etc., but I liked it perhaps because I like some diversity and authenticity in where I stay and like to feel a taste of the local area and community. Not for people who prefer the anonymous, predictable, hotel."
2018-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,Great location and neighborhood! We really enjoyed our stay.
2018-11-01,5,Stayed about a week,"What a lovely home! We had a wonderful time in this clean, well equipped home. From the excellent location to the easy check in and comfortable beds, we couldn't have asked for a better place. Vic thought of everything to make sure our stay was comfortable and stress free. We arrived late and were happy to find the beds already made, toilet paper and paper towels and clean, fresh bath towels. The kitchen has plenty of pots and pans, dishes, silverware and cooking utensils. The bathrooms are a nice size. Parking was easy. There is a spot behind the house via a shared driveway for one vehicle but, when family came to visit, there was always plenty of parking on the street. The living room and dining room are comfotable and nicely decorated. Vic is a great communicator, answered our questions promptly and checked in with us to make sure everything was going well. We will definitely be staying here again on our next trip to Atlanta!"
2018-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Stayed here for 4 nights and found the house to be just what we needed. Sizable living room and two well-sized bedrooms. One bedroom has an en suite bath, the other has a bath directly across the hall. The mattresses were fantastic. Nice dining room and functional kitchen.
The street that the house is on is adorable. Close walking distance to Krog Market (a food hall), and a little further to Inman Park (via Belt Line) make restaurant choices plentiful. Safe. House entry is a little confusing at first - you have to go around the back and then further around the far side and enter there.
Location is also ideal to all MLK sights and the streetcar line ($1/trip). About a 20 minute Lyft ride to the airport.
Communication with Vic was polite and speedy. A small hiccup with our check-out arrangements but probably just a miscommunication and it was resolved quickly and to everyone's satisfaction, I believe."
2018-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This is a great location for downtown Atlanta. It is in a nice neighborhood and the house is very well kept. I would recommend this super host.
2018-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful home- great neighborhood!
2018-10-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Very quaint. Central to everything. My parents enjoyed venturing through the historic MLK district. Vic maintained timely correspondence throughout our stay. He and his sister make a great team as she helps guests when needed.
We had some issues that were addressed including Vic sending someone to dust. We recommend getting a deep clean. This place is a charm and just need extra care in cleanliness to feel fresh and super cozy.
Overall good stay. Thanks!"
2018-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great location, very clean and homey! We loved walking around the area, we rented bikes from Atlanta Bike Barn a few blocks away, and rode all over the Beltline up to Piedmont Park and Virginia Highlands (would recommend bikes to those inclined, or the scooter share apps like Birds and Lime are cool too). We also loved the smoothies and sandwiches from Lotta Fruitta just down the street, highly recommend! Also close enough to walk to some of the bars in Edgewood like Sister Louisa's Church of the Living Room & Ping Pong Emporium (AKA Church) which is fun and very lively on the weekends."
2018-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,It was a great stay. Wonderful house in a great neighborhood.
2018-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Vic’s place is super clean, and tastefully decorated. It is conveniently located for visiting all the main attractions in Atlanta. Check in is very easy, and Vic responds quickly to any of your questions. I would not hesitate to stay at Vic’s lovely home again."
2018-09-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay in Atlanta!
2018-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Vic was absolutely wonderful as a host and went the extra mile for me on my final day in his home. Highly recommend.

Next time we visit Atlanta, we hope to stay at August's again."

2023-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Great place if you travel with pets. Small but very comfortable studio apartment with heavy curtains to guarantee privacy. Walking distance to a couple of restaurants ( less than 1/2 mile). Short drive ( 5 minutes) to downtown Atlanta. Great Basecamp for day tripping in the Atlanta area, close to the highway also. August answers inquiries within minutes."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,We had a lovely one-night stay and found everything exactly as described in the listing. It was great to meet August and her sweet pups.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"August's place was a beautiful, comfortable and convenient. There are many great activities near her place. It was so clean and included many thoughtful amenities. The bed was very comfortable! We will definitely stay again."

If I could give it 10 stars I would!"

2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Really enjoyed our stay here. Loved the thoughtful touches like individually packaged Neutrogena makeup remover and snacks and drinks.

2023-05-01,5,Stayed with a pet,My stay here was wonderful and the home was as advertised. Would definitely stay here again.
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I enjoyed August’s place. 10 minutes to State Farm arena even with traffic. Place is quiet. I love the NEST thermostat and being able to control temperature to my liking.
Keypad did not work on first few attempts when I first checked in. Mattress was saggy, TV was small but place is fully equipped with refrigerator, snack items and drinks. Nicely decorated bathroom. Shower door doesn’t shut completely but water does not leak onto floor. Parking is street parking but I was fortunate to be allowed driveway access. Does not take away from five star review in my opinion but worth mentioning."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,Absolutely wonderful place to stay.
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,Always a delight!
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Wonderful, thoughtful, well prepared, clean space! We were relieved to arrive here after a long day of travel.

Great location! Surrounding area is great for walking and Piedmont park was the cherry on top!
Thank you, August for letting us stay with you!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This was our third stay here and won’t be our last. We love this little house, it’s so comfortable and clean. The location in mid town can’t be beat. It’s easily walkable to parks, restaurants and we always enjoy just walking around the neighborhood with our dog. August has always been so friendly and accommodating, and her dogs are just as friendly. Can’t say enough good things about this space, always look forward to our next visit."

2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I really enjoyed staying at August’s beautiful Airbnb. Street parking and check-in are easy. Her home is in a lovely area of Atlanta with amenities close by. She is very accessible if you need anything.
Once inside, you’ll appreciate all the lovely touches and how cozy her place feels. It’s spotless and we’ll decorated with lots of designer features. The kitchen and bath are well stocked and you’ll feel right at home. I highly recommend August’s place for your next stay in Atlanta!"

2023-04-01,4,Stayed with a pet,"The accommodations were clean and private. Stocked snacks and beverages was a really nice addition. Questions to the owner were answered in a timely manner.
The only disadvantage we saw was needing to park on the street and the need to completely empty the contents of our vehicle for safety reasons."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,August was a great host and was very accommodating with us and our dogs. The Airbnb was in a perfect location close to everything we needed. Loved our stay here :)
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We couldn't have been happier with August's guest house. It was clean, cozy, dog friendly, and had all the right amenities. We were able to park easily on the street outside and didn't really need our vehicle after that as there was so much we could walk to in and around the gorgeous Midtown neighborhood.
August was responsive and friendly. We couldn't have asked for a better host."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"August's space was just what we needed for a weekend trip. It was very clean, well-stocked, comfortable, and in a great location. Street parking felt very safe and it was easy to come and go whenever we needed. Do remember, you are in her backyard so you might run into the host every now and then. Regardless, I'd highly recommend!"

I highly recommend staying there.Thanks again for a wonderful stay.
Natalie"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Very cozy, good and lovingly equipped guest house, we were missing nothing and we felt right at home. The proximity to the Beltline (and accordingly Ponce City Market) was both on foot and with the bikes, so we were there several times."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed one night,Always glad when I can find any opening at this lovely location!
2023-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Our stay in the guest house was wonderful! It was only 1 quick night, but the place was perfect for us and our pup. August had extra amenities around the guest house as well, like makeup wipes, small snacks, and even a bowl of water and bed for our dog. The bed was really comfortable, and we watched a movie with the Roku TV. Everything was clean and it was easy to access. Thanks for a great stay!"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed one night,Amazing place in midtown Atlanta. Close to Piedmont Park and lots of shops and eateries. Highly recommended! So charming and such a good getaway!
2023-03-01,5,Stayed one night,It was real nice.
2023-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Of the best (if not the best) Air B&Bs I’ve ever stayed at! Super clean, comfortable and I had everything I need and then some! I was traveling with my pup but had easy access to grass and it was fenced in. Host was super responsive and kind. 10/10 recommend"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"An absolute hidden gem, I will be staying again the next time I'm in town!"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,August's place was comfortable and we felt right at home. We both love to walk and enjoyed being able to walk to where we needed to go! Our host was very responsive as to any needs.
2023-03-01,5,Stayed one night,Can’t say enough about this cute spot!! Very clean and well appointed. The host was very responsive and helpful. Would definitely stay here again.
2023-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"August was super friendly and the Airbnb had so so many more amenities than I expected. she has friendly dogs so if you stay with your pup, you want to make sure to supervise them when they're outside in the fenced backyard. It's only about a five minute walk to Piedmont Park. it's a great quiet spot to stay and I will definitely stay again!"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed one night,Excellent place to stay. Super clean. Very responsive host. Would highly recommend.

2023-02-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Great home. Great location and all the details were accurate. We will be back
2023-02-01,5,Stayed one night,The cutest place ever!! Great host!!
2023-02-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"My husband and I came to Atlanta for an event at the aquarium. This was the first time either of us have been here, so we weren’t sure what to expect (i.e., where to stay) but I’m glad we stayed at August’s place! It was in a quiet section of the city while still being close to attractions and restaurants. We had our dog with us, so we really appreciated the fenced in area outside right off of the guesthouse. The whole place felt secluded and homey! The host does well with explaining upfront what is provided and what isn’t. There’s no oven/stove, but we knew that from the description and didn’t miss it. All we really needed was the microwave and coffee maker. I was worried about parking on the street but there was always space. All in all, it was a great few days!"
2023-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"This was a great place to stay close to the Georgia Center for an expo. Easy to get to and park your car, safe area and clean. The owners do a great job managing this rental which is why I recommend this as an Airbnb for anyone needing to stay near downtown Atlanta."
2023-02-01,5,Stayed one night,August’s place was great. It was convenient for the event that I was attending. She was very responsive when I reached out
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Clean, comfortable, excellent location--walkable to all of Midtown, easy check-in, great communication. Space is surprisingly large for a studio, room to relax and work as well as sleep. The fact that snacks and coffee were provided was an extra bonus. Highly recommend"
2023-02-01,5,Stayed one night,I loved this place! It’s beautifully decorated private and comfortable! I would definitely stay here again. I only wish there was a designated smoking area.
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Stay here full stop. Private, quiet, and comfortable. Beautifully designed. Easy, anytime street parking right out front. 5 minutes to great eats and Piedmont Park. A perfect Airbnb! Thank you August for another great stay!"
2023-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"We loved this home, the yard is perfect for a dog and the location is great in a beautiful, walkable neighborhood. The space is beautiful and the bed is super comfy. Thank you August! We hope to visit again soon!"
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great host. Beautiful home and peaceful neighborhood. We were close to restaurants and other things to do all while spent half the day in bed veryyy comfortable bed. Enjoyed our stay definitely a good place to stay to come back to. Thanks again ❤️
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was my second stay at August’s guest house. The location is in a safe neighborhood and close to many restaurants, including Ponce City Market. The home is very clean, comfortable, and includes all the essentials. I plan to book again!"
2023-01-01,5,Stayed about a week,"I feel we picked the best place to stay in Atlanta. I think The airbnb is a lot bigger than the photos looked. I liked that the lights were on when we checked in, that made us feel welcome. The couch and bed were very comfortable. August left snacks, cold drinks, coffee and creamers. It was perfect since the stores had closed early due to it being New Years Day. We were able to have our coffee in the morning without having to go out first thing. Everything is well stocked, plenty of paper towels, soap, toilet paper, etc. We appreciated the cups and lids to go. We had an early morning walking tour one day, and were able to take our coffee with us. I felt August thought of everything that we would need. The location was perfect, quiet and close to everything we wanted to do. We were within 10 minutes of MLK Center, Coca Cola World, Jimmy Carter Library and only 20 minutes from the Swan House, which included an amazing Atlanta museum. We hope to come back again sometime soon."
2023-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"Perfect location for mid town, private, turn key."
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was a great Airbnb stay. The apartment was very clean and nicely decorated. She even had some Christmas decorations but not too many. We never had a problem with the street
parking. August's pricing of the unit was on target and her fees were considerably lower than most. Cleaning fees and service fees have skyrocketed on Airbnb rentals and I always
factor in this when choosing a location."
2022-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This was the perfect place for us and our two dogs! The space was super nice and clean, and the location was great. It is in a beautiful neighborhood and a short walk to piedmont park."
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Love, love, love
We were impress with everything, beautiful place, great location, super clean and August always ready to help with anything
Love all the beers you left for us and the yummy snakcs
Location is great, close to everything
I'd stay with you guys next time
Thanks for everything"
2022-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"My husband, pups and I loved this spot. Cozy and homey, a safe neighborhood feeling with everything in reach. Would love to stay again if we're in Atlanta!"
2022-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,One of the best airbnbs I’ve stayed at!
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great location. Comfortable bed. Nice home.
2024-06-01,5,Stayed about a week,"My favorite Airbnb in Atlanta. I haven’t stayed since pre-covid and it was good to be back. Over the detached garage so no shared walls, with anyone. Being a stand alone building with its own private entrance, this is very quiet and private space. The hosts were very responsive when I couldn’t figure out the full size washer and dryer, which was clearly user error on my part. I was there for a week so that was a nice asset. Central A/c controlled by you and works great. The studio is directly across the street from Piedmont Park (where I took multiple walks) and within easy walking distance to restaurants, bars, groceries, etc. What a spot. I am guessing you will enjoy as much as I do."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Location made it very walkable to restaurants and parks!
2024-05-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Awesome place!
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Probably the best Airbnb that I have stayed in. Very clean, great location, easy parking, great instructions and you could tell that the host has an attention for the details of the space. Already book my second trip here."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Beautiful home, AMAZING location, and excellent communication with hosts.
Highly recommend, and will definitely stay here the next time I’m in Atlanta!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Lovely place, clean, close to everything. Very pleased."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Steven’s place is in a great spot. Close to most everything and literally half a block from beautiful Piedmont Park and the Beltline. Much of our trip we used bikes on the beltline to get around. Tons of great food nearby. Steven and Oscar are great hosts, they were incredibly responsive with very clear instructions.
Also, off street parking was a huge bonus."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We had a wonderful time!
Lovely place and the location was great.
We appreciate having our own parking space. Thanks again for being a great host!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place in a wonderful part of town.
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful place, great location!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This apartment was perfect! Steven and Oscar sent detailed videos ahead of checkin that explained location, parking, TV control, Nest settings etc. Dedicated parking space was easy and access to unit simple. Stairs leading up to unit were steep but well-lit/marked. Very comfortable bed and unit was clean with adequate towels and kitchen supplies. Across the street from piedmont park on a very quiet one way street. Hosts were quick to answer any questions. Would absolutely stay again!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Wonderful place!
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had an amazing stay with Steven and Oscar, so glad we found such a great location in Atlanta. The area was pleasant and the neighborhood seemed friendly. We had a quiet and peaceful trip, and definitely reccomend staying here. We'll definitely be choosing Steven and Oscar when we make another trip to Atlanta."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Really enjoyed my stay here! The place was beautiful and felt safe. I loved that it had a parking space so that I didn’t have to try to parallel park. The bed was pretty comfortable. Videos were provided to explain a lot, the videos were clear and easy to understand.
Really happy with this experience and would stay here again!"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place was a perfect hub for visiting our daughter in Atlanta. It is comfortable, private, and is very nicely put together (nice sitting area, big bathroom and shower, nice kitchen, and comfortable bed). We would stay there again!"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Cute little neighborhood! Loved the convenience of having a parking spot and self check in. The only minor downside was that the room is located directly above the garage so I heard the garage door open/close early one morning. I also wasn’t expecting stairs, so carrying my suitcase up and down was a bit of a challenge. However, the place itself probably looked even better in person and smelled really nice/clean. The bed was super comfortable!!"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very neat and well kept unit. It’s very close to piedmont park
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Delightful spot with great attention to detail and terrific style. Loved being across the street from the park for morning runs. Super friendly and helpful hosts. Highly recommend and would stay here again!
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Loved Steven’s place. The location was fantastic - nestled in a quiet neighborhood AND walkable to everything. Will definitely return next time we visit our daughter in ATL.
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,More than perfect. Amazing place! Steven is a great host.
2024-01-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We had a great stay! The hosts were very responsive, helping us with permission to bring along our slightly larger fur baby and providing a ton of helpful info on their space. The guest house was very comfortable and surprisingly quiet considering its position near a main road - we were hearing owls instead of traffic at night! The location is the major highlight of this spot. The door is just steps away from a big park great for running and walking the dog and a quick walk along mostly residential streets to a ton of great shops/restaurants, including the Ponce City Market. Would definitely recommend this spot and hope we get the chance to stay again!"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Steven and Oscar were great. I really liked the area and the studio. They were very responsive & liked the check-in videos (very helpful)!! The only issues were (1)fabuloso being used (flared my allergies, but wasn't a deal breaker); and (2) wish there were thicker curtains on the front door & throughout. I could see the neighbour & he could most definitely see me. I would stay here again & recommend."
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great set up and location. Perfect for an extended stay. Host was awesome. Highly recommend.
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Excellent stay! The apartment was spotless and had absolutely everything we needed. Great neighborhood and base camp to explore Atlanta. Would happily stay again!
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Perfect midtown location near Piedmont Park! Very walkable!
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,This place was in a perfect location for us. It's practically right across the street from Piedmont Park and a short walk to the Atlanta Botanical gardens. There are some great restaurants nearby. The place itself was clean and cozy and nicely decorated. The place and neighborhood is pet friendly. We would definitely stay again!
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Steven and Oscar’s place is an absolute gem! Immaculate, well appointed and just what we needed. Walkable to piedmont park and the belt line, also very quiet and peaceful. If it’s available, book it; you won’t regret it."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,Perfect!
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,The space is a wonderful and comfortable location with plenty of room for our puppies to come along thanks to prior approval. Immediate access to the park made taking trips or walks after work a breeze. Accessible to a series of restaurants and places to entertain ourselves after being able to walk our dogs and drop them off before hopping over to dinners. Thank you!
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,"What an excellent and cozy little place in the heart of Atlanta. Our family had a great time and we were able to move around the city easily from this location. It’s right across from Piedmont Park so we were able to enjoy the outdoors and walk to grab food. Our hosts were excellent as well. Clear instructions, very responsive, and they have a beautiful place. We really enjoyed the stay. Highly recommend!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We had a short weekend in Atlanta but had a great time and were very comfortable at the Airbnb. The place was clean, furniture was tasteful and comfortable, and bathroom was spacious and beautiful. Their instructions for accessing the place and utilizing features of the cottage were very easy to follow. The neighborhood is beautiful and conveniently located near restaurants and some shopping. Having a designated parking spot in the driveway was a plus. It was a wonderful stay, we’d recommend this Airbnb to other travelers!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The cottage was exactly like what was described. This was perfect for a weekend getaway. We felt right at home and very safe. Off the street parking was a plus and the area was within walking distance of Piedmont Park. Everything was labeled and self explanatory. Steven sent recommendations in addition to very clear instructions for check in. My wife and I will definitely book this location again when we come to visit family. Well worth the price.
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Wonderful spot right across from Piedmont Park. Such a bonus to have on-site parking. Everything you could possibly need for a great stay in Atlanta!

2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What a wonderful little cottage, it’s located right on Piedmont park, which we love, so as soon as we saw it we booked immediately! The location was ideal, it was surprisingly quiet for the location as well! Everything was as advertised, clean, quaint and in the heart of Midtown. Thank you Steven and Oscar, we will definitely be back!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Our stay here felt like being home. The apartment was cozy and beautiful. I felt very safe even though we were in the heart of Atlanta, with a gate that locked leading up to apartment. The neighborhood was gorgeous with a beautiful park across the street and restaurants within walking distance.

2023-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This beautiful carriage house is located in the perfect spot to explore Atlanta starting with Piedmont Park and all it has to offer. My daughter and 13 month old granddaughter took long walks through the park, walked to the Botanical Gardens and the Famers Market. We walked and ate at neighborhood restaurants and explored the homes in this beautiful neighborhood. Steve and Oscar's place is beautiful, clean and comfortable. We are already planning our return trip to Atlanta and booking this home. We did take our car to the Atlanta Zoo and the Atlanta Aquarium. We choose to drive to Ponce City Market and walk the beltline to the Kroger Street Market. There is so much to see and do in Atlanta; however, just staying across the street from Piedmont Park in this home would be more than enough for anyone looking for some R&R."

There’s a good amount of storage in the closet so you can keep your luggage out of site, plenty of hangars and hanging space as well. Good iron. Great tv with a wall mount so you can watch from any spot in the main room.
Plenty of clean fresh linens, towels, and shower products made for a lovely stay. The bed was very comfortable and good king size!

2021-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great location and great place to stay
2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Former Atlanta resident here. If you're looking for an efficient studio in an amazing location, this is it. Off-street parking, fast wireless, walkable to both Midtown neighborhood and the Beltline, across the street from Piedmont park, complete amenities, and sparkling clean. It's a studio (no separate bedroom) but the space is large and there's a pull-out sofa if you have a guest with you."
2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I had a great time here! Clean, cozy, and a wonderful location. Highly recommend."
2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Absolutely the best location, park is literally across the street and everything is within a 10-15 minute drive. Very spacious closet and bathroom, great host and easy check in, highly recommend!"
2021-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,great place and outstanding location. exceeded our expectations. we will be back for another getaway!
2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We stayed in the studio for four nights and loved it. The bed is super comfortable with really soft sheets. The bathroom is luxe with plenty of room to store your bags in the walk in closet. It was clean and very comfortable for the two of us for a long weekend. The location is fantastic, a quiet neighborhood right across the street from Piedmont Park, plenty of good restaurants within walking distance. We appreciated the dedicated parking space and easy check in. We'd definitely stay again!"
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Couldn't ask for anything better.
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We couldn’t possibly have had a better experience with this rental, and with Steven! The apartment was clean, spacious, and unbelievably well-located, and Steven sent us detailed instructions walking us through every step of the check in process. We would absolutely stay here again!"
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great host and fun location, if you love a morning run there isn’t a better place to stay!"
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"WOW! This lovely little place was absolutely amazing! It was perfectly located, nicely appointed, and quite comfortable. The check-in process was easy, and Steven communicated very well. I always knew what was going on.
I loved how much light came into the unit. The bathroom is huge, with a large walk-in closet. It was nice to have a washer/dryer, as well.
The bedding sheets were nice. However, the bed was a bit lumpy but wasn't too bad.
All in all, I loved my stay here. It was one of the best AirBNBs I've ever stayed in."
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great location in the heart of Midtown and across from the park. Good communication with the owners and very clean.
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place is worth the hype. Ideally suited for two, especially if you and your person are - how shall we say - in amour. I stayed with my lady friend (read, beard) for a quick trip to visit family and had a delightful time here. Steven & Oscar are magnificent hosts, providing a well-thought out space with beautiful finishes and great neighborhood recommendations - including Blake’s, a family friendly watering hole just up the street where, depending upon the time of day, you may find your amour. Or, at least, something amour adjacent. 10/10 would stay again!"
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very nice and spacious studio with a huge bathroom. The location right across the street from the park was awesome.
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Loved the location of this air bnb. We could walk to many restaurants, Piedmont Park, stores etc. We had no car and didn’t miss having one!"
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is an ideal spot for anyone looking to be close to everything (park, restaurants, the beltline, Trader Joe’s, etc) and have their privacy. The guesthouse is the perfect size and has a lot of windows for letting the light in during the day. It also has basic cookware if you want to stay in and cook. As someone that drives a relatively large truck, I think the biggest perk is the parking spot in the driveway in front of the garage! The hosts, Steven and Oscar, were very responsive and I couldn’t have asked for a better experience."
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The cottage’s location and price cannot be beat! Super clean and comfortable. Off street parking and great videos explaining everything you need to know about your stay.

2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Comfortable spot in a great location at a reasonable price…and helpful hosts! Can’t ask for much more than that!
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is one of the best Airbnbs I have ever stayed at. The location in Atlanta is great - just about everything you might need to see in the city during a trip is within 15 minutes - and it is within walking distance of a beautiful park and several dining options. The cottage itself is very modern and has all the amenities you would need, even during longer stays. Neighborhood was quiet and felt safe at all hours. Highly recommended!"

2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Really great stay. Amazing apartment above a garage located right near Piedmont Park and midtown -- there is a designated parking space and you can easily walk to Midtown. Everything was very clean, new appliances, a separate living room with a couch, had great central AC, full kitchen and bathroom, TV with cable, quiet, easy check-in, nobody bothered me so really could not ask for more. Highly recommend."

2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,What a wonderful location! Just a short hop to Piedmont Park and a 1 mile stroll on the Beltline to Ponce City Market. It's really close to everything Midtown has to offer. The Airbnb itself is clean and comfortable. It had everything we needed. I definitely would recommend!
2021-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Steven's place is in the best location, directly across from Piedmont Park and the Atlanta Beltline which gives you access to many restaurants and bars. everything you need is within walking distance or you could hop on one of the public scooters that are everywhere. Great choice in Atlanta."
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The oasis provided everything promised. The location gave us the opportunity of enjoying the park while having easy access by foot, car, or transit to anywhere in Atlanta."
