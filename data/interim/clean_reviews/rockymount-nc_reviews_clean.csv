My 85yo Mother in law lived 2 blocks away for 40 years before moving to Charlotte and we wanted her to feel at home instead of staying in a hotel. The house was fantastic! Extremely clean. There was one hiccup: The furnace stopped working on our 2nd night there, but Karim got on it right away! That can happen ANYWHERE. When we got home last night, our own furnace had crapped out and we can't get anyone to fix it until tomorrow. Karim had his back to cozy temps in no time! Thanks Karim! We hope to do it again next Thanksgiving!"
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Property was as described in listing and as pictured.

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"My family and I had an absolutely wonderful stay at this Airbnb in Rocky Mount, North Carolina. The beautiful decor of the place immediately caught my eye – it's evident that the hosts have put a lot of thought and effort into creating a warm and inviting atmosphere.
What truly sets this Airbnb apart, though, is its peaceful neighborhood. Nestled in a quiet area of town, it offered a much-needed escape from the hustle and bustle of big city life where I am from.
Overall, this Airbnb is a gem in Rocky Mount. If you're looking for a relaxing retreat with beautiful decor and a peaceful neighborhood, I highly recommend booking a stay here. It was a delightful experience, and I can't wait to return for another visit."

2023-07-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"A good Airbnb in a relatively quiet neighbourhood. Honestly, we were a little put off initially by the message from the host which listed numerous rules including not eating on the couch, warning us our reservation will be cancelled if we park too many cars, telling us the property is monitored 24/7 by security cameras and telling us ""this is not a hotel""! In case we hadn't got it the first time the rules were also printed out on the wall in the house with additional rules like ""no eating in bed"". That said, the property was actually fine and we had an OK stay!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Wasn't familiar with the kuerig coffee maker,so didn't use had to go out buy a cup or coffee, instructions please. Plus only a couple coffee cups. The mirror in the main bedroom bath was up too high for us short people . So only minor things that probably don'tmatter to most people. The rate was well worth it The beds were very comfortable. Would recommend to everyone"
2023-07-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,"The home was very clean, however someone else’s personal belongings were left in the master bathroom (not a big deal though). However the side door railing, which we were instructed to enter was loose and disconnected and one of the guest fell on the concrete outside. We were also questioned by someone who drove up the first day about why we were there and whether we knew the owner. We are all senior citizens and have no reason to be questioned. I did not report either incident to Karim because they did not return. I also didn’t report that one of the guest had a bad fall. But I am reporting now in the hope that the railing has been repaired. I’m sure Karim would have responded. I reserved two locations there were no problems on Cedarbrook."

2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The house was beautiful and clean. If I had to complain about one thing it would be the position of the mirror in the master bedroom bathroom.

2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Couldn't have been more pleased. Karim was a wonderful host, quick to respond to
questions, and his home was exceptional. It's less than 2 miles to the Rocky Mount Event Center, which was perfect for our Carolina Classic Volleyball tournament.
Quiet neighborhood, and close to restaurants, grocery stores, and shopping.
Exceptionally clean, and you can tell Karim has taken pride in your home away from home.

Not only was the entire place charmingly decorated and super comfortable, Jamie was a wonderful and caring host. We wished we could've stayed longer! There were plenty of restaurants nearby and the neighborhood was peaceful and quiet. Jamie provided lots of thoughtful and useful little things that made the stay even better - our little one was a huge fan of the applesauce and instant oatmeal left for us. If we're ever in the area again, we'll definitely stay here!"

2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Jamie went above and beyond any host we have dealt with, and we have stayed in many Airbnbs in many different areas.

2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Jamie was an amazing host!!! She was incredibly kind and responsive. Jamie has literally thought of everything you could need in the apt and left the cutest little notes all over to show where things are. We were in town for a dance competition and Jamie’s place was perfect for our small family and it was only 10 mins from our venue.

The place is spotless, so much fun to explore, and the answers to any possible questions are always right at your fingertips. The bed was super comfy and we so appreciated the breakfast foods included which saved us from shopping after a very long drive. We honestly didn’t want to leave. Even my super picky husband, who doesn’t like to try new places or things, had to admit that Jamie’s place was so much better than a hotel! If I could give this place a 10 star rating, I would!"

2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,The apartment was so comfortable and clean - we definitely enjoyed our stay here!
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"From the moment we stepped into this apartment, it was clear that we were in for a special stay. The space exudes warmth and comfort, filled with loving touches that transform it into more than just a place to stay – it's a place to live, even if just for a short while. The apartment was a treasure trove of delightful details. Every corner held a new discovery, from quaint decorative items to personal photographs that added a unique charm to the space. It's evident that a lot of thought and care has gone into making this apartment not just functional, but also inviting and homely. Organization and cleanliness were top-notch. Everything was in its place, which made it incredibly easy for us to settle in and find what we needed. The attention to detail was remarkable – from the neatly arranged kitchen to the perfectly fluffed cushions, every aspect of the apartment was meticulously maintained. The communicate was very smooth with Jamie. She rocks in my opinion for hosting Airbnb guests."
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Jamie has an adorable place and she is very welcoming.

2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Jamie is a very considerate host. She was great from the first contact to the last. It's obvious she enjoys her guests and wants to take great care of them. It was very homey and I felt safe. She even had it decorated for the holidays! The comfort of the primary suite was better than most - the bed comfort was excellent. I didn't use all the features offered as I was just basically sleeping one night and hitting the road early the next day. I think you will enjoy staying here.
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"My husband and I enjoyed our stay at Jaime's place! The location was wonderful, and her apartment was cute and cozy! Everything was very clean and thoughtfully decorated. Comfortable bed. Jamie makes every effort to make you feel at home and communicates well. Cracker Barrel is nearby for takeout. Coffee was provided in a well supplied small kitchen. She leaves nice breakfast items in the refrigerator for those who have time, and her little notes are very helpful! Convenient parking close to the entrance. It was a pleasure to stay at Jaime's place and we recommend it!!"
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Location is quiet but close to everything you need. It was an affordable and ideal for 2 people on a 2 night stay.

2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Jamie very responsive to questions. Her directions and descriptions were spot on.
The guest accommodations were well appointed and thought out, spotless, and for us most important very quiet and able to make very dark for sleeping. Everything needed for a peaceful, relaxing and rest full stay was provided. We will stay there again and highly recommend Jamie and her home."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My wife and I loved staying at Jamie’s AirBnb when we were in town for the weekend! She was so responsive and helpful and we felt so at home there. The place has such a cozy feel and it was a great place to come back to each evening. Good decorations and peaceful spot in the neighborhood. Also, we even took the Roku remote on accident when we left the house and Jamie gave us a call and was so gracious about it (we swung back by and returned it to her, by the way).
About a week before our stay, I needed to extend our reservation by 1 day and Jamie confirmed quickly and had no problem.
We wholeheartedly recommend this Airbnb to anyone! Especially those who are looking for a homey, cozy feel in the little town of Rocky Mount, NC.
Thanks again!"

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Another lovely restful quiet stay at Jamie’s place. This is such a perfect clean easy breezy and special place. Everything you need and so many special extras I keep coming back and look forward to my next visit. A great value and delightful environment just off the highway.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Stop looking.
You've found it.
Whether you are visiting the area for friends and family for the weekend - or for a getaway (why I chose it), this place is peaceful and has all of the amenities that you need.
I chose it as a respite to do some writing, and it had all of the quiet I needed. the backyard is spacious and lovely to sit and read, and there are stores nearby in driving distance for your food and/or libation needs.
Jamie has thought of everything in regard to the notes of instructions that are left in the abode for you to know how everything works.
The hosts are very friendly and will engage with you as much or as little as your heart desires.
The place is probably (fit wise) compatible for two adults at max (and possibly a small child). (The coziness of the space would probably make it more challenging for three adults).
Stop reading this right now and go select this AirBnB.
Like...now."

2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Jamie’s apartment is so nice and clean. The notes she left was really helpful. It is convenient to Rocky Mount and close to our family we visited. We enjoyed it and are looking forward to staying with Jamie again.
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This was our very FIRST Airbnb! All I can say is, why have we been wasting time with hotels? Jamie was wonderful. The apartment is directly adjacent to her home, which gave us a sense of security in case anything went wrong. The house is located in a nice neighborhood and I felt safe there with our 4 month old baby. The Airbnb was stocked with everything as described- and more! When we arrived we realized we hadn’t packed our sound machine (the only thing that helps our baby sleep), and to our surprise there was one plugged in and ready to go! It saved us from having to buy another one. Safe to say we will be rebooking with Jamie for our next trip to rocky mount. 11/10 reccomend !"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,I can’t say it loudly enough that Jamie was the best AirBnB host that I have worked with. She was very responsive and was super nice. I will certainly stay here again. Don’t hesitate if your party is 3 or less! You WILL NOT find a better place. The price is just the icing on the cake! 5 Stars! ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Jamie’s apartment had everything we desired for a comfortable and peaceful 2 night stay. Her directions and instructions prepared us for an easy arrival and entrance. Upon driving up, the private back yard and garden called us to walk and sit after long hours of driving. The apartment was well acquainted with art, comfortable furnishings, and good lighting for reading and relaxing. Both quiet ceiling fans and lights greeted us with a warm and delightful feeling. Though there were TVs, we had books to read and rested well in a lovely en-suite bedroom. The kitchen had everything necessary for eating there, and we enjoyed our breakfasts before heading out for our days’ activities. We hope to return when we are in the area again."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Very comfortable stay close to 95. So much nicer than a hotel.

2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is such a cute place, and very comfortable. It’s in a nice, safe neighborhood. It is clean and well kept. It is connected to the home of the host, but very private and personal. I felt comfortable to freely move about and come and go as needed. They provided light snacks and coffee as well."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We had a great stay at Jamie’s place. We rolled in pretty late and we were very grateful to be able to get to sleep right away. The bed was comfortable so we slept great and were energized to continue our road trip the next day. You have everything you need in the apartment. The outside garden area looked very nice too. Jamie was very helpful making sure we had a great stay.
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Excellent cute clean very efficient sweet apartment. Nice walking neighborhood. Everything’s there that one would need. Hope to be back in the future.

2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"What a wonderful stay! I have never stayed in a place that was so meticulously cleaned. Jamie had everything you could have ever thought of needing and more. Kitchen had everything needed to make meals easily . She even had snacks , which were an added bonus. The location was so quiet and relaxing. Jamie was always quick to respond . She provided her number to call her is anything was needed during our stay, but never had to call because everthing was PERFECT! Hope to be able to stay at this gem of a place again."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Wonderful spot with lots to see. You can even go a nice peaceful walk through the neighborhood. Met some nice folks there.
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Everything was great and exactly as described. loved the decor, very homey. Everything was very clearly labeled, and anything that needed instructions had them written out very clearly which was super helpful. We chose this over the nearby hotels to help break up a long drive, and it was definitely the right choice. I recommend this place to anyone looking in the area!"
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Jamie’s place was a great place to recharge after a long drive. Place was pretty spacious, and very clean. Kitchen had everything you might need for your short stay, we appreciated the snacks she had ready for grabs. I slept in the bedroom with our daughter, the bed had super comfy mattress and the bathroom was super cute and spacious. My husband slept on the day bed in the living room and said it was very comfortable as well. The entire place has very nice vibe, makes you feel at home. Lots of pictures and paintings, nice decor and i love the sticky notes Jamie has all over the place with directions and instructions. Place was very quiet, unfortunately, we didnt get to enjoy the garden because we were in and out. There is a parking spot for you in the back of the house, super easy check in. Jamie is very quick at answering her phone and is there if you need her. The place is attached to their house but has its own entrance. Would definitely stay again!!"
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This is my second trip to Jamie's place..very consistent ..and a wonderful host..everything you need is there even snacks and a little nite to eat for breakfast..will be staying again..may God bless her

2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Very cozy, quaint little apartment. Hosts had just about everything you may need for a short-long stay. Very clean, close to many of the places we wanted to visit but in a quiet neighborhood. Would definitely recommend for a quiet relaxing getaway."
2023-03-01,4.0,Stayed one night,Great location and a nice option to a hotel for an overnight stop if traveling via Interstate 95. Jamie accommodated our late check-in and the check-in process was easy.
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This place is very charming. The hosts have many unique items that my husband and I really enjoyed looking at throughout the space. Additionally, there are thoughtful notes everywhere that guide you and answer any questions you might have. We felt very comfortable here. Highly recommend!"
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,An absolutely peaceful treasure. Close to great restaurants yet very private. It's obvious that the hosts go out of their way to make sure you are happy and comfortable. A+++
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The place was fantastic and the host is very friendly and understanding! Always made sure to respond and answer any questions.

2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I have stayed in quite a few Airbnb places, and I must say this one was the best I’ve ever seen! Jamie’s decor was just amazing, everything there was unique and interesting and beautiful, from the most adorable and quaint to the most stunning. Jamie has thought of and added EVERYthing a visitor might need or want! She emailed every day to check if we needed anything, which we didn’t because she had already put it all there, right at hand. The bed was awesomely comfortable. The place was sparkling clean. The cost value was simply terrific. We would love to stay there again, and definitely will if we can think of any reason at all to go back to that area. Jamie was born to be an Airbnb hostess, and she is #1 in my opinion!"
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This was the second time that my husband & I stayed at Jamie’s place on our way south. The apartment is so much better than staying in a hotel. It’s very close to major highways, yet quiet and private. Jamie does a great job communicating and goes out of her way to make our stay comfortable and easy."
2023-01-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Excellent hosts! Everything was so nicely labeled with many notes inside of the rental to tell us how things worked and where things were located. Very convenient location for the volleyball tournaments. My only complaint is that the floors are extremely squeaky. So squeaky that they woke me up from sleeping as my daughter crept into the shared bathroom. The walls are also pretty thin, so we were able to hear the hosts in their home which is connected."
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We absolutely loved Jamie's place! It was quaint, adorable, and homey and had everything we needed. There were informative notes everywhere throughout the place indicating how to use all features. It was easily accessible to 95 with lots of options to get something to eat or anything else that you might want, easy to find, had a nice private driveway and parking. We couldn't have asked for a better place and we will definitely be coming back. Thank you Jamie!"

2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Jamie simply could not have been a kinder, more thoughtful host. My daughter had a one night stay there on her way to Florida. Jamie was in full communication, made herself available for my daughter, and even left her some soup, snacks and a breakfast bowl knowing she was
arriving late and leaving early. If the place was t already spoken for my daughter would have stayed there again on her way home as well. I cannot recommend enough the hospitality of this host and will pass the information along to anyone I know traveling that way. Thank you again Jamie!"

The guesthouse felt like it was a main character in our stay with so many neat decorative pieces and Jamie’s amazing storytelling sharing notes throughout the house. It was fun to run into the wonderful stories of her loved ones and the house as well as thoughtful labels as we moved around the space. While we didn’t need them, we thought the courtesy snacks were a step above and beyond. Jamie was also great at communicating with us while also giving us privacy.

2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Perfect stop after a long drive. Hosts have created a most welcoming environment. Close to restaurants, I-95 and the historic cotton mill."
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"And here I am once more. I keep coming back to Jamie & Rusty's AirBNB and for good reasons. It's my #1 pick for Rocky Mount. It's always just what I need. Always good, happy, easy, clean, comfy and well equipped. Will always continue to book here whenever it's available when I'm passing by. Already looking forward to my next visit. It's like, I may be on business travel, but it never has to feel like I'm on business travel. I highly recommend!"
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Just what I wanted. I've stayed here before. Always good, happy, clean, a good value and comfy. Will always continue to book here at this AirBNB whenever it's available when I'm passing by the nice friendly and well-equipped town of Rocky Mount. Jamie and Rusty were wonderful hosts. The place has friendly pointers about its features and some of its history that adds character in a way that makes you smile. I received an email during my stay and needed to print and scan a contract. Jamie straightaway pointed me to a store only half a mile away that did that and also mailed boxes right here in town and got the job done before I was on the next stretch of my trip! Highly recommend!"
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,This was our 3rd time staying in this sweet AirBnb and we enjoyed it again. We love the convenience from the interstate and it is the perfect spot for our little family to stay on our way to the OBX. We cannot recommend this place enough!
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"What a beautiful stay! It was so cozy and outright adorable. My girlfriend and I loved all the little notes and personal touches around the house. We only stayed the one night but I wish we could have stayed longer it put a smile on your face and made you feel happy. The host was quick to respond and had different snacks and food available for guests. They even had a map and journal showing were previous guests were from and what they said about their stay. It was definitely more of a homey, bed and breakfast like feel, so if you prefer something more hotel like this may not be for you. That being said I highly recommend it and would stay here again no doubt about it."

Jamie has really thought of EVERYTHING that one might need to be comfortable in this space. Even MORE than I would have ever thought of! There was even a ""white noise machine"" in the bedroom!! I use one every night at home and was so happy to see it on the dresser! I have never been to an Airbnb that was as well-equipped as this one! Jamie should give lessons (or write a book) on how to become the very best Airbnb host as she has definitely hit the mark for me!! Highly recommend and will absolutely re-book her place if I am ever in the area!!"
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I was actually sad to check out because I was too cozy! (LOL)
I’ve stayed at many BNBs in many cities & countries and this home was by far one of the coziest homes I’ve stayed in.

2023-08-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is a charming house that is located in a quiet, safe neighborhood. It is clean and nicely decorated. The photos are very accurate.
If you're looking for a place to bake cookies and drink wine, this is not the house for you! There are few cooking supplies and no wine glasses. Oh and you have to be a giant to reach the microwave! Hopefully you don't intend to lounge around the house here. The couch (that you should not eat on ) is not comfortable and the backyard...needs lots of work. There are no desks in the house. I found the dining room table and chairs to be a the best for telework.
This is a home to sleep and shower. Two full bathrooms and decent beds. TVs and ceiling fans in all three bedrooms. Never found a full length mirror but I did see an iron.
For the price, I'd recommend and do it again!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Highly recommend staying here as a couple or family. Plenty of room and very comfortable. Everything you need to feel at home. The only suggestion is to add clear glass in the door or a peephole to be able to see outside before opening the front door.

2023-07-01,3.0,Group trip,"The house is as it is in photos. Nice home
, good area. Furniture was nice and beds we’re comfortable. However the lock was terrible. We kept getting stuck inside , often needed someone stronger to open the door. The knob was literally coming out the lock and had tape on it. The communication was not great and the host was a bit snarky as I discussed checkin issues with him. The property manager was dismissive of my checkin complaint. I’m not trying to tear this place up in the review but those are my only complaints. I felt the host could’ve took accountability of the agreement we clear as day made for early checkin but instead he commented on me being a host and suggested I should know about last minute bookings which I told
Him I’d simply let my guest know before they arrive ESPECIALLY when they tell me they have a 9am flight and booking is contingent on early checkin ! He took no accountability for not updating me."

2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,I rented this AirBNB with my cousin and her husband. I had an emergency at home and could not be there. They had a little trouble getting in initially but it was actually user error not the lock itself🙄 Nice place and close to everything they said that was planned for that weekend. Will definitely be back!
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very cozy home we loved it
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"House was very comfortable, clean and super cute. The neighborhood was nice and felt safe. There are train tracks behind house, but we never heard a train go by. The only downside was the driveway. We tried not to bring in any sand but it was hard to avoid. Over all a great house, and it was a great place to rest after our long days on the baseball fields."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great stay at Karim’s as usual. Had a small hiccup and when I contacted him he was helpful and immediately responsive. Will always return.
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,I really enjoyed staying at this place. It was small and cozy and reminded me of my grandmother’s home.

I would definitely book this place again and I definitely recommend it. 😊"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This cute condo was exactly what we needed while traveling across the country for my friend’s wedding. The inside was freshly updated and clean. The neighborhood seemed nice and the park behind the home was pleasant. The big empty fridge/freezer and clean kitchen was exactly what I needed to make my friend’s wedding cake. I appreciated the good washing machine and dryer along with laundry soap. The keyless entry was handy for our comings and goings! This place had everything we needed and we enjoyed our stay!
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very clean place. Super nice host. A great place to stay for just you or your family. I stayed there as a night shift nurse and it was dark during the day just like they described and I really enjoyed my stay. I was just a little caught off guard by however remote the location was.

The Stowe Away is a great place to get away and relax, the house is very comfortable and is very well stocked. We loved having a pool on the property. Our host Dorothy is amazing, she is very responsive, friendly and accommodating, we highly recommend The Stowe Away."

2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I booked both The Stowe Away and The Stowe Away II for a group of co-workers attending a workshop. Both properties were beautifully decorated, clean, and spacious. Some of the bedrooms were extremely roomy with seating areas. The pool and tiki area with BBQ grill were a definite plus! And there were numerous outdoor spaces for enjoying coffee/cocktails and conversation. Dorothy was very responsive when I had a question about our reservation...and she checked in via text to make sure everything was satisfactory. Overall, it exceeded my expectations...I would definitely recommend both properties!"
2023-06-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Loved the stay at Stowe Away. There's a plethora of rooms to choose from and the kitchen was nice with lots of utensils, pots, pans, etc. However, be aware that the floors aren't completely level so there is a fall risk for those who may not be steady on their feet. It has the old timey cottage feel, and like a real old timey cottage the Wifi sucks. A great place to stay if you want to relax and take life slowly not so much if you want remote working conditions. Another thing to note is the pool area while great is a shared area so be aware other guests may show up and with the copious amounts of windows (which let in tons of light and are great to sit by) you may feel like you're in a fishbowl with the curtains open and guests in the pool area."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We loved our stay at Stowe Away 2! It was perfect for us, our daughter and her husband and our 3 grandsons. The actual house exceeded our expectations. We came for our oldest grandson’s baseball tournament and the location was great. The grandkids ( ages 12-5) loved the pool! Dorothy and her husband were so responsive when we had a question. Highly recommend this house and if we are ever back for a baseball game, would definitely stay here!!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Perfect for our trip! Spacious and comfortable!

2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"I was reluctant about renting an AirB&B that you shared space with, but it turned out to be fine. The house was amazing and the backyard was extremely beautiful."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The location was in a good proximity to stores and restaurants. The house was accommodating with lots of amenities. The room close to the deck was warm and could use a unit but overall 5 stars and would definitely stay again! Dorothy was a great hostess!

Dorothy i’m already planning a trip back your way, top of my list for stays for sure!"
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This will be my families go to place when we need to travel to the Rocky Mount area!
The house is incredible and Dorothy is excellent at communicating!
I would recommend this home to anyone!"
2023-02-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,"After visiting relatives all day it was nice to have a place that we could come back to in the evenings and relax in the quiet. Also, it was a huge plus that we were able to have our little dogs stay with us in the home. The home is nicely decorated, but could use some repairing. The tile in the bathrooms and decking around the pool area were not fully attached and/or secured. The home is not handicap friendly-lots of steps, and very low toilets and furniture, except for the king size bed. I tried to get into it and it was too high. I ended up sleeping in one of the smaller beds. Since it was February we could not use the pool, but it did look lovely outside. Lastly, it was nice to have the cold water and snacks as a welcome gift."
2023-02-01,5.0,Group trip,Dorothy and her husband were very accommodating and I would recommend this Airbnb to anyone considering staying!
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Dorothy was a fantastic host. The house was perfect for our needs and we definitely be reaching out again for our next Rocky Mount visit.
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We loved the house, a lot of room to roam inside, the warm touches of snacks, water in the fridge, lights on upon our arrival…were icing on the cake. And although it was too cold for us to enjoy, the pool area was like something you’d see in Key West. The pool was really clean, even in January! Super convenient(5+mins) to I-95 and Rocky Mount(10+mins). And even though the other house connecting was empty, I’m sure things would have been fine sharing the pool area. Definitely a great Airbnb."
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"I can’t say enough great things about this hideaway in NC. The area is quiet, peaceful and just what I needed to rejuvenate. The house was cozy and quaint…it definitely felt like a home away from home. Thank you for your kindness and hospitality."
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Dorothy was outstanding.

2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Dorothy is great!!
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"This place was a perfect getaway and the pictures didn’t do it justice. Plenty of room for a large group of us with a nice patio by the pool. We had everything we needed and more! (Jenny the donkey is also very sweet, we fed her lots of carrots and apples) Definitely would stay again!"

2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We loved it even though it rained every day. Very quiet and relaxing. Spacious bedrooms. Pool was clean and fun. Dorothy very responsive to all questions. Thanks Dorothy! We will definitely do again.
2022-08-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"The Stowe Away was a good stay. The two houses are attached so there were times when we heard the family in the other house. Also, it was a little awkward trying to navigate the shared pool with the other guests. It is important to travel with the right group of people as the layout of the house makes it so that you have to go through two of the bedrooms to get outdoors and the laundry room. The internet was kind of slow which impacted our ability to watch TV."
2022-08-01,5.0,Group trip,"It was a pleasure to stay at your place. The house was beautiful, clean and perfect for fellowshipping with friends. The pool makes it a 10 star property 🤩"
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,thanks Dorthy! We had a great stay as usual and would love to come back!
2022-07-01,5.0,Group trip,Nice clean spacious house!! Really nice getaway and Dorothy is Super Nice!!
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"5 STARS!! Highly recommend.
Great place to stay! We used both homes and could not have worked out better. Lots of great space. Both houses were impeccably clean and so beautifully decorated, accommodating, warm & cozy, with all the comforts of home (including snacks). We had everything we needed and MORE than expected. This place was Perfect for our group!
Love the open well stocked kitchen, the bedrooms are great (comfy beds). Everywhere you look you spot something new. Charming rooms to all hang together and yet roomy enough for everyone to have their own room to hang out. There are quaint areas for privacy, like a reading nook & private courtyard outside one of the of the bedrooms. Then there’s the outdoor space, it was so relaxing sitting by the pool everyday and great fun splashing in the pool with our dogs. In the evening we could enjoy each other's company at the tiki bar or go for a midnight swim. We had a great time and really appreciate the great service. Absolutely love this place.
Both Dorothy and Jerry were very friendly and personable attentive and responded quickly to any needs or questions right away and always happy to help!
Thank you, for not only sharing your lovely home, but for a memorable experience."
2022-06-01,5.0,Group trip,"The floorplan is a bit quirky, but we appreciated that it was very clean. We also loved the personal touch with the linens & guest soaps being set out in each bedroom. The pool helps make this a fun place to stay, plus there are several board games & LOTS of books."

2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I rented the Stowe Away for my mother and I to visit my brother and his wife, who also stayed with us at the Stowe Away during our stay. The house was impeccably clean and so adorably decorated. Four BR's and 2-1/2 baths was awesome and the pool was incredible. We had everything we needed to enjoy our stay and we did enjoy it. Getting to the pool was a bit odd as the only convenient way was through one of two bedrooms, but it was not a big deal for us. We will definitely book again next time we visit my brother. Thanks Dorothy."
2021-08-01,5.0,Group trip,"Absolutely great to stay! It was super clean, and the owners were extremely nice! They even let us connect the two houses since it was going to rain the next day! We would definitely stay there again!!"

2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Dorothy is a fantastic host! Her homes are clean, beautifully decorated and so comfortable. The pool area is so inviting.
Dorothy is personable and attentive without being overbearing.
When there was an issue with the A/C, I notified Dorothy and she had a repairman on the spot within minutes. She was also very understanding and forgiving when one of our kids accidentally broke a household item.
I couldn't have asked for a better experience that was enjoyable for the adults as well as the kids in our group.
Will definitely look to stay there again when I'm in the area."
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great family vacation. We love the yard and pool. Third year visiting and we will come again. Thank you Dorothy!

2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This was by far our favorite family vacation, thanks to Dorothy's amazing hospitality. The Stowe Away was absolutely beautiful... much better than I had expected. The pictures simply don't do it justice. We marvelled at the design and decor during our stay... you spot something new and exciting almost every day. My parents were happy to have their very own reading nook, since my dad is an avid reader and this gave him a private area to read away from my two rambunctious boys lol. My mother loved getting acquainted with the large kitchen and the small, private courtyard outside of their bedroom. My children shared the large room with the wrap-around windows and it gave them a large area to play. My husband and I loved our room because we could sneak out after everyone was asleep and share each other's company at the tiki bar or go for a midnight swim. We were so sad to leave, but we are already talking about coming back again soon. This may be our annual family vacay spot going forward. Thank you, Dorothy, for not only providing a lovely home, but an outstanding experience as well."

2021-03-01,5.0,Group trip,"Highly recommended! Everyone was incredibly kind, the house was awesome and plenty of space inside and outside for everything you need.

2020-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The Stowe Away is definitely the coolest place to stay in this area of NC.! The outside area was so cool and convenient and it is perfect for a large group of people or a large family if you need to rent both sides of the space. It was super clean, very easy to check in, and such a quirky and cool space. You really have to see it to believe it!"

2020-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place is a well-kept secret. The houses are very spacious and well kept. The outdoor pool area reminds me of a movie set in the Caribbean Islands even though you are nowhere near the ocean. You are a few minutes from a grocery store and restaurants, but you occasionally hear the sounds of farm animals which I loved. It was great for our weekend away from reality without traveling far from home."

2020-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"When I first booked the Stowe Away, I contacted Dorothy to find out if it was quiet during the fourth of July because of the impact they have on my son due to Autism.

We will definitely return for another family vacation! Thanks Dorothy for everything!"

2019-09-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"We used this stay for a weekend wedding at Rose Hill Plantation. It was about 22 minutes away from the wedding venue. There isn’t much around the house but there is food and grocery stores within a 5-10 minute drive. The house was being enough for our whole group comfortably. The pool and the tiki bar lounge area in the back was a great place to relax in between wedding activities. However, there were some cleanliness issues on the inside but it was minimal, there was also some on the patio but it may have been due to Hurricane Dorian which passed the day prior to our check-in. Overall, exactly what we needed!"

2019-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great house with lots of space and great host! The pool is an added bonus!
2019-06-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"The Stoweaway was great for my family's weekend. We were in town for a graduation and reserved both properties. The convenience of having both properties made the experience worth it. The shared backyard with the pool was great for the kids. The house was clean and looked better in person than it did in the pictures. There were a few ants, but that is not an indication of the cleanliness of the house. It just so happened to be ant season. Any issue we had, Dorothy responded very quickly with a response and a solution. The rooms were spacious and comfortable."
2019-05-01,5.0,Group trip,"Great place to stay! Enough space for my whole family with some more room to spare. The only downside was the house needed some repairs that would have made the stay perfect! For instance, the beautiful bedroom doors leading to the pool were broken and had a big gap that let some outside bugs in and the outdoor area had some wasps, but I'm from up north so this is new to me. Other than that it was a great stay and I would definitely reccomend it to everyone!"

We walked in and the place had a nice scent and clean air, a spacious area with no clutter, and even a very attractive assortment of welcoming snacks. After a long day out, we were able to watch Hulu on a large flatscreen and cook dinner in. There was no noise from the house or cars the whole time and we never felt intruded upon. Will definitely stay again, probably the best AirBnB for the value in the county."

Cozy studio located in a quiet place! Family and baby friendly! So clean and quaint. Lots of morning sunlight. Perfect and way better than staying in a hotel for the same cost.

It was meant to be a “home away from home” but there were so many rules that with small children caused me stress (no shoes on carpet, no drinks in the bedrooms, no makeup on towels or may be charged a fee)."
2024-02-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,This house was perfect for what my family and I needed it for. We all did agree that some of the rules were a bit excessive for the quality of house but all in all we enjoyed our stay and would consider returning in the future. I believe the wifi could use an upgrade since the TVs only had streaming services no cable. The two master bathroom’s were great with a jacuzzi in both. Good size house for the price!
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Well decorated and squeaky clean. Everything needed for comfortable stay! George is very responsive and helpful! Thank You!
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Was in town for work and this was the perfect location.

2023-12-01,5.0,Group trip,"It was a very good space for our needs. George was extremely responsive, helpful and accommodating."
2023-11-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"George was a kind and responsive host. The house was a great size for our amount of guests. We left a personal item and he was kind enough to send it back via mail for a fairly small charge. We found the kitchen to be lacking in overall essential items (utensils, plates, cookware, etc.) for the ability to host larger groups it needed more. Some good TLC is needed, but overall a wonderful host and good size place."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"George’s place was fabulous for our needs. We stayed in the house with 5 adults and 5 teenage girls and had more than enough space for everyone. The home was clean and in a quiet, safe neighborhood. Lots of space to enjoy the outside as well. George went above and beyond to communicate well and quickly for all our needs. We would definitely recommend this home and will plan to stay again if we are ever back in the area."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The house was perfect for our group. The house is spacious, the beds were very comfortable and the kitchen was perfect for cooking for our group. George quickly responded to any questions. We will be staying there again."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Hello George
i am telling you about this, we stayed at AIRBNB for two days . my friends and I love this beautiful house. I love it. It was a nice quiet place . I suggest you need security light off and outside for the parking because of dark and hard to see on the sidewalk . also need toaster in the kitchen that all . Thanks for staying at airbnb . Awesome!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We had a wonderful stay. The home itself is beautiful. Situated in a peaceful residential neighborhood and close driving distance to grocery stores and restaurants. We literally felt like we were home. Would stay again and recommend to others.

2023-09-01,5.0,Group trip,"Wanted my out of town guests to be able to stay together and not in a hotel. George’s house was perfect!!

2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,George's place is another home outside your home. Very spacious for a big family. The house and George were phenomenal. The house is in a great neighborhood and close to everything. Thanks George!
2023-08-01,5.0,Group trip,"We would definitely recommend George's house, it was clean, peaceful and nice. Sorry we didn't get to spend more time there, we stayed two nights. Also George was available if we had any questions, he would get back to you in a timely manner. Thanks again for having us."
2023-08-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"little things, the living room tv has a blue tint (thats not good for the eyes) the lights off the backporch were either blown or intentionally off.. shame bc the backyard seems to be inviting with the exception of those HUGE poodles next door JEESH!!! There really should be way more funiture in the home to accomodate large families. Please get rid of the stuffed parrott, It creeped us out the night we came back in. Also dishwashing fluid is helpful to keep the dishes clean and kept in between dishwasher loads. The bedrooms are huge but again the rooms could use some sitting furniture to avoid committing to the bed the whole visit. Beds are extremely comfortable we slept very well, love the area!! We would definitely reserve again! THANK YOU FOR ALL OF YOUR FLEXIBILITY! YOU ARE A TRUE GENTLEMAN!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Group trip,"Very quiet and peaceful location with a beautiful, spacious home. Extremely clean and a pleasure to spend time at. Only wish I rented for longer!"

2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We were visiting family in the same neighborhood. It was perfect for us, my in-laws stayed in the suite on the first floor and we were upstairs in the master bedroom with the other 3 bedrooms. There was plenty of space and the back yard was nice and private."
2023-06-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"Good place to stay with kids - especially if you have a little one in a pack and play. Closets are big enough to put a pack and play in (this is a feature I always look for!).
Comfortable and clean. Thanks for a great stay!"

2023-02-01,5.0,Group trip,George’s place is awesome great wifi plenty of space and well stocked would definitely stay again!
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"George is a wonderful host. I'm glad his home was available. It was large enough for 10 of us to stay and sleep comfortably, from Sunday through Thursday. Upon arrival, the ambiance of the home is welcoming. The washer and dryer are located upstairs. As well as the King bed - bedroom w/ a beautiful full bathroom. If you're not comfortable with stairs, there's a Queen bed - bedroom on the main level w/ also a beautiful full bathroom. In addition there's a half bath on the main level. The layout worked out well for the family and my knees. We were interested in finding a home that our immediate family could stay in together, while we were in town for our son's funeral. This lovely home was the perfect fit for that. My husband and I are grateful for George and his home. We'll definitely use this home again if George will have us back and if it's available."
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"The house was big, spacious and in a safe neighborhood. I would use it again if in the area."
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"My family from Baltimore, MD and Greenville, NC needed a house to accommodate all of us to attend a funeral in Rocky Mount. We found this beautiful house in a wonderful neighborhood. Some family came by for dinner and was amazed at the house and the value. We enjoyed our stay so much. The host was very friendly and I'm glad I found this listing. No more hotel stays for me. If this is available when I plan to come to town, it will be my first choice."
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great stay, definitely recommend for people coming into town for work or for families visiting the area! Safe neighborhood and just an overall great house."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Enjoyed my stay
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Pictures do not do this home justice. It is absolutely beautiful. The neighborhood is very nice and we saw tons of wildlife driving in. The hot tub is huge and was a wonderful way to end our night after a long drive. Vicky was extremely nice and made sure to check in with me to see if we needed anything. I would absolutely stay here again!
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Beautiful place to stay. I will definitely stay there whenever I have to visit the Rocky Mountains. I love it.

I love the modern feel of this home. I will definitely book my stay here when I return in the future."

2024-06-01,5.0,Group trip,Great place just as described. We were in town for a wedding and enjoyed our stay. Great host with great communication.
2024-06-01,4.0,Stayed about a week,"This place is located very well - close to restaurants, services, and main thoroughfares in Rocky Mount. The street is quiet and we used the neighborhood for walks. This house will sleep up to 6, but the dining and living areas will be a little tight for that many people if you want to spend considerable time in the house. The kitchen is complete with stove, refrigerator, and a small washer/dryer combo. There is no dishwasher. There is one full bathroom and another 3/4 bath. The 3/4 bath is tight, but manageable. We provided some feedback to the owner to improve the experience at this property. With that said, this property works well for short stays. The owner was responsive to all our contacts."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,it was a great house with an exceptional host!

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"I loved the home so much and this host. I asked for a listing of all his homes. Home looks as pictured, beautiful. Felt comfortable. Host responded to all my messages right away even at 11p or 7 am. If I could give over a 5 star I would, host was able to accommodate my last minute guest change.Don’t look any further book with karim but save a spot for me lol. Will definitely only book here when I’m in town."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Me and my crew had a great time here!
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Hated the fact my husband’s and I trip ended and we had come back home. Spotless, clean, down home feeling. Response time within 30 minutes. Home sits in a quiet and safe community with restaurants and shopping center within a mile. Plenty of thoughtful touches inside home."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Karim’s place was great! Very comfortable and everything was as pictured. It’s central to everything and surrounded by other similarly well maintained homes on a quiet street. We have no complaints and would happily stay again!

2024-03-01,5.0,Group trip,"Our trip was a last minute trip. I can not say enough great thing about this airbnb and to find such a clean accommodating beautiful peaceful and relaxing place. I would definitely recommend this airbnb to every one.
Also very convenient concerning to location it is right off of the main strip. It looks just as the pictures seen on the website. I will definitely rent this particular airbnb again. Thank You so much ."
2024-03-01,5.0,Group trip,Great place to stay while we were down for a wedding. Karim was super responsive and flexible with our schedule.
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"The first thing I noticed when entering the home was the smell of cleanliness. I wiped everything down just as I have done since Covid and not one speck of dirt was returned! I would definitely recommend this home to anyone looking for a nice, cozy spot!"
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"What a great place to stay! The house was better than expected. Quiet, safe, clean and with a nice styling touch made it the perfect place to stay while in town. Dont hesitate to book if in town, the home was just what we needed. We will definitely book again!"

2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Great place to stay at while in Rocky Mount.
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,We had a very nice stay! We will definitely book again!
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great location right off Sunset Avenue. As a Rocky Mount native staying for the holidays, it was helpful to be close to everything in reasonable driving distance, or even walking distance for a few things.
The house was comfortable, with enough space for my fiancé, sister, and I to stay in separate rooms, and to host my brother and his wife as well for a night.
The kitchen was decently equipped, which was a plus for us as we chose to cook.
Check in and out were remarkably easy, and the parking available was welcome as well.
Would recommend to anyone looking for a space to spend a few days, or a large group for a night or two."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Clean, organized, quiet space. so nice to have a King bed, queen, and twins. good combo. Very comfortable layout. Responsive host."

2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Lovely home in good location
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Karim’s place was very nice and modern. I love the decorations. The bedrooms were a nice size overall. The place was kinda small but was just enough for what we needed. Karim’s place did not have enough paper towels or toilet tissue, but once we contacted Karim, he had his cleaner come over the very next day to bring more tissue and paper towels. Unfortunately by that time we had already gone to the store to get paper towels and tissue. It was no biggie. I will still give this home an overall 5 star rating because the home was cozy, comfortable, peaceful, and Karim was very responsive to my messages."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Everything was as described and the host was responsive and communicated well. Accommodations were exactly as described. Location was very convenient as stated but neighborhood was not well lite; nothing host could do about it truthfully, but it made it more difficult to find late (due to work we arrived around 8pm). Address number on mailbox/house was not easy to see.
Overall, if we have future baseball tournaments in the area, I would be comfortable and very satisfied to bring my family back."
2023-10-01,5.0,Group trip,Another great stay! Karim is always very responsive!

2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Place is awesome.
2023-08-01,4.0,Group trip,"The owner of the home was very clear about their expectations. Extremely. However, the tone of their communication clearly indicates they've had issues in the past that they're attempting to address with clearer communication. My primary issue is that while they're clear, the guest is not treated as a guest but more of an inconvenience. It's clear they do not feel you are worthy to sleep in their home as you would your own.
This was in the initial email I received -

These are not deal-breakers obviously but personally, I prefer property owners that are thankful for AirBNB'ers given the higher rental cost but I didn't get that vibe from this owner."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We came to town with my husbands family for a wedding and this house fit our needs perfectly. It had the space for his nephew to bring his family over to visit after the wedding and they had the best time. The house has been redone beautifully.

Anything you need for your trip, from food to travel essentials, you can walk or make 5 minutes drive to get them."

It was a very
Nice house and we enjoyed our time there. Karim was responsive and went above and beyond to answer a question we had.
The only suggestion I can think of is that the place needs measuring cups and a working can opener."
2023-04-01,5.0,Group trip,"I didn’t say much in the chat because I was so busy with family the whole weekend, but Karim made sure to stay in touch in a comfortable way.
He never overstepped, trusted you, and just made clear what his rules were. Very easy and very simple to handle. His place was great and very neat.
Highly recommend if you’re in the area. He’s a phenomenal host, especially if you’re a private person."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Enjoyed my stay at Karim’s place. It is in a great location in a quiet neighborhood. 5/5 would recommend.
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Adorable house!!!! So clean!!!!! Lines were comfortable! Host even had shampoo and conditioner which was a nice plus. Host and cleaning service was wonderful.

The beds were comfortable and we had everything we needed for a couple of nights. The decor was super fun and we loved the mid-century furnishings!
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This is my go to rental when visiting family. Great neighborhood and the house has everything you need! Hosts were fantastic and very responsive. Location is well situated for getting around town and a short distance to anything you need, including a Harris Teeter, Target and Starbucks. Plenty of sleeping space, Great for families and /or group of friends. Highly recommend!"
2022-11-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"Cute and refreshing decor, we loved the set up and it was easy to coordinate entry. If you have sensitivities to heavily perfumed detergents (bedding and towels), you may want to check in with Karim before your stay to see if he is still using the strong perfumed detergents. They were so potent that we had to open all the windows during our stay and we got headaches overnight."

There was plenty of room for our family and the three TVs allowed people to choose to be cozy together or to watch your own program in your bed if you needed to rest.

The house was super clean and decorated so nicely. The 2 full bathrooms were nice to have as there were 5 adults. We appreciated the small touches of some coffee pods, washer pods, shampoo/conditioner and other small things. All questions were promptly answered by Karim who truly made our stay perfect.

The proximity to the Sports Complex was great if you are traveling to the area for sports!"

Lots of extra little touches that were really nice - snacks, waters, a fully stocked kitchen to cook, and the beds were SO comfortable! I appreciated getting an email and the entry code early enough, without having to ask for it too. It was a really great AirBNB experience and if ever we're in Rocky Mount again, we'll be staying here. Thanks!"
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We stayed in Rocky Mount, quite a bit both, in hotels and Airbnb. This property is historic and extremely well renovated and updated. Even though the house sits on a busy street, it’s peaceful and quiet. Parking is great as well.
The layout of the house is fairly open, if you like with a lot of window covering this probably isn’t for you can see right through the house . We enjoyed that, but my mother in law wasn’t too comfortable at night (she’s a bit old school about blinds and things).
The host has been extremely meticulous about instructions,, as well as leaving games and things for families to play with. Check out was extremely easy and effortless.
I would definitely stay at this place again the next time we come to town. This is a poster child for great AirBnBs!!!"
2023-12-01,5.0,Group trip,This place is very cute and clean. The updates are very nice. Conveniently located next to the Mills.
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We have stayed in many home rentals over the years. Greg’s home was by far the most thoughtful and welcoming. You felt the love and attention to detail in every room. They excelled in their hospitality and we hope we get another opportunity to return. If you are in doubt of where to stay in Rocky Mount look no further!!! You will be glad you stayed with Greg.

2023-08-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful preservation of an old home with modern furnishings. We stayed here August 2023 and at that time there were still houses on the block that were not inhabitable so you could tell how much love the owners put in to bringing this house back to life. Despite the ""transitional block"" we were two females traveling solo and we felt safe walking in the neighborhood and staying in this home.
It is very close to a fun hub of restaurants and breweries.
Greg was very responsive and helpful."

This house is beautifully designed, has two pretty bathrooms and comfy beds and linens in every room. We had everything we needed for a successful weekend!
The Mill was in walking distance and included at least 5-7 breweries and multiple restaurants. We had top notch burgers at Barley and Burger (a 5 minute drive away). We walked over to the tipsy tomato for some awesome pizza. Had all different kinds of appetizers at Tap 1918. And amazing breakfast sandwiches at Books and Beans.
Greg is a wonderful host, very responsive and kind. This Airbnb will be my go to too reserve for future stays in Rocky Mount!"

2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Myself and a coworker stayed at Greg's house for a week while working in Rocky Mount. It was in a great area that was centrally located near where we needed to be, and was within walking distance of some great restaurants and breweries that we visited. The house is much bigger than it looks in the photos and is really spacious. The kitchen is well equipped with most everything you need if you'd prefer to stay in and cook a meal also. Thanks Greg!"

2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We travel to Rocky Mount every year for a dance competition. This was the first time we've had the chance to stay away from the highway & the hotels! We love The Mills & LOVED Greg's Airbnb. The house was super clean, had the cutest decor & amenities. 10/10 would recommend over any hotel, any day!
It was a bit loud in the master bedroom, because it sits on a somewhat busy road, and the houses surrounding Greg's are in a state of transition. But you can tell that if the area continues to follow Greg's lead - it will be the place to be in Rocky Mount!
My trip was with a friend of mine & our two young daughters, we felt very safe & very comfortable in this house. It's much larger than I expected. Modern decor with intact historical charm. Mistakenly told the other dance moms & will likely have to fight for this place next year :) Thank you Greg!"

2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Just had a wonderful weekend at this newly renovated home. It was less than a 5 min drive from Rocky Mount Sports Center where we were in town for a vball tourney. Everything is decorated with wonderful taste. Absolutely spotless. Cannot think of a single thing we could have asked for to make the house itself better. Even the quality of linens was above expectations. If you are a light sleeper you should know it’s an active one way street - basically all night. Master window faces the street. Even so, I slept fine in the wonderful bed! Greg was quick to respond to questions! I will definitely stay here or one of his other properties next year if we come to Rocky Mount again!"
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We stayed at Greg’s place while attending an event at the convention/event center. Event center was less an a mile away, but I do recommend vehicle transportation to the event site.
The house was very clean. We brought our food to cook and the kitchen was extremely well stocked for all the essentials. We also greatly appreciated the washer and dryer that was available.
There was a welcome book available with great recommendations on restaurants. We tried a few out (breweries in person and delivery for Mexican) that were great!
As another person noted, the house is in a transitional area of revitalization. I stayed there the first night with my three young girls. The following night my husband and was able to join us. I felt very safe in the house and area. Great access to the Highway, great food/breweries, and the event center.
When we are back in the area, we will without a doubt try and stay again in this rental."

My family loved the coffee bar! Very nice linens and beds and comfortable attractive furniture. We enjoyed our stay very much."
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Great to finally have a great place to stay in Rocky Mount. Past rentals we stayed in were limited and not nearly as nice as Greg’s place. The interior was immaculate and comfortable. Close to Rocky Mount Mills so there are breweries and restaurants. The area is changing and growing, so some of the area is not as nice, but my family and I felt safe and secure. Greg was quick to respond with questions and was flexible with checkin/checkout. I would definitely stay here again and would recommend it to anyone visiting the Rocky Mount area."
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I’d first like to say….. you had me at Coffee Bar!
My family and I spent 3 nights at Greg’s place and would definitely return. The place is just as pictured. Everything was spotless and the decor was nice. Both check-in and out were a breeze.
I was especially impressed by the Welcome book and Coffee Bar! This house was Old and Charming with a Modern feel and little touches like multiple chargers, extra toiletries, a snack box and even a cute little waffle maker with pancakes and syrup.
I even got to spend some time sitting out on the front porch in the rocking chairs, which was Icing on my cake. Greg was a responsive and gracious host.

The Host was Awesome. He communicated with us with fast responses and thorough instructions. I will definitely be recommending and staying here again."
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Honored to have been their first guest and the property is even more lovely in person. To know they’ve poured their hearts into restoring the community makes it that much more special. It’s perfectly finished giving a warm home feel while being updated and modernized keeping the original character of this historic home. They were the perfect hosts and I would stay at any of their properties again if the opportunity presents itself. They left the most thoughtful touches and items and the home was very clean and inviting. Thank you Greg and family.

2023-11-01,5.0,Group trip,"I traveled to Rocky Mount, NC to visit family for Thanksgiving 2023, and found this adorable home. When we arrived the code to the door worked perfectly. It’s in a very well maintained nice neighborhood, so we felt very safe. We walked in to find this home extremely clean which exceeded my expectations. There was plenty of room for my family of 5 to sleep comfortably. Very quiet neighborhood, we were able to sleep without any disturbances. Love the decor in the home with lots of natural sunlight and plenty of space to move around. The host Mettu was very responsive and tended to all my needs. The house is fully stocked with everything we needed. The Kitchen is stocked with pots, pans, plates, bowls, glasses and utensils. Their is also complementary coffee on the kitchen counter. I would definitely stay at this home again. This place is worth considering if your in the Rocky Mount area."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,I can’t say anything negative about this property. The only thing I would recommend to the host is to provide more towels and wash cloths. We had 6 adults and 5 children staying the weekend for a baseball tournament nearby and we had to wash towels several times because there were only 2 bath towels in each bathroom. No hand towels. Other than that it was great!!!!

2022-09-01,5.0,Group trip,Clean house in a quiet neighborhood cul de sac. 3 bedrooms with 8 beds. There’s an empty loft room and full bathroom upstairs that has a couple nice blow up mattresses but could fit way more than just a couple if needed. Mettu was extremely accommodating as a host. Appliances and televisions were all new so it was easy to stream tv and relax. Will definitely pick this house again if I’m ever back in this area
