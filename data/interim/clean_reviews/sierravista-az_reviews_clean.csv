2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Theresa I was in the middle of a busy day when I left such a short initial review, but I now get a second chance. Theresa was so kind to get us out of a bind when another Airbnb was not suitable by responding within minutes to our request. Always kind and responsive. She takes pride in her Airbnb and it shows with the attention to detail and immaculate condition. The hot tub is a bonus to such a lovely home. She had filtered water, ice, and made an extra trip to make sure we had goodies in the morning to eat. You will not be disappointed with this Airbnb."

2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We stood on the porch in the morning listening to a cacophony of birds all around us. We heard at least 10 different bird calls- it felt like we were in an aviary, or a forest. Two massive mules behind a fence that were curious about us. It was nestled right against the mountains and beautiful. Quiet. The house was clean and gorgeously furnished. The bed was comfortable. Allyson was helpful and responsive, calling my sister after her SOS text about how to get in, talking her through the process. I'd definitely stay again."

The cottage offers privacy and all the features needed for a comfortable and relaxing stay. The history of this part of SE Arizona is right outside and available for you to explore and enjoy.

We both like to hike and rock climb, and the cottage was conveniently located close to both activities. It was peaceful, quiet, and had beautiful views of the mountains around Ramsey Canyon. The kitchen was well equipped and surprisingly spacious. Allyson was very thoughtful and welcomed us with a heartfelt note and a delicious bottle of wine to help us toast our 40 years together! I highly recommend this place for anyone desiring a quiet romantic getaway with lots of outdoor activities just minutes away from your front door!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Awesome little spot!
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"We loved Allyson's Sky Island Escape Cottage! From the time we drove up, with quail running across the driveway, to the time we left with roosters crowing in the distance, we had the most relaxing, peaceful stay ever! The cottage is stocked with everything that we could have wanted - Keurig pods, nice shampoo/conditioner/soap, full laundry, well stocked kitchen, and a really comfortable bed. We could easily stay comfortably for an extended period. Allyson even provided pasta and sauce for an easy dinner! One of the nicest features were the most comfortable glider/rockers on the front porch! We loved them! We had a glass of wine and appetizers as the sun went down, then chatted well after dark. Just perfect in every way. If we are back in the Sierra Vista/Bisbee/Tombstone area, we will definitely stay here again. FYI - loved the coffee at Nirvana's Cup of Joe and Urbano...just minutes away!"

2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a wonderful time in Sierra Vista! Allyson communicated so clearly and we immediately felt welcome upon entering the guest house. Everything was as described - the kitchen had everything we needed and it was so convenient to be able to use the washer & dryer. The house was a perfect launching point for enjoying the outdoors in Ramsey Canyon, Carr Canyon, and Ash Canyon, and there were great restaurants just minutes away. We also loved spending mornings and evenings on the porch in the comfy glider chairs - and even saw and heard barn owls and great horned owls from the back yard!"

2023-02-01,5,Stayed over a week,"This lovely, quiet, and well appointed cottage had all the amenities we could have asked for. It's location is in the back of the owner's property. It is fenced in and felt very private and safe. We thoughly enjoyed the cute donkeys next door who were very quiet and well cared for. Allyson anticipated every need we might have had. She went the extra mile in providing great quality bathroom products, such as shampoo, conditioner, soap, and lotion. She provided a generous quantity of kitchen cooking supplies (pots and pans), utensils, dish towels and dish soap. The seating area was very comfortable. The TV only has Roku, but we were able to keep up with the news. I think they do have vdeos, too. We would go back in a heartbeat!"

2024-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Our stay was great - would highly recommend! This was one of the best places we’ve stayed in terms of providing a kid-friendly space that was still comfortable for adults. Everything felt clean, new, and well maintained. We’ve stayed in Airbnbs with our daughter all over the world, but would easily rank this as one of the best."

2023-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We had a 3 night stay at the Desert Nest.
The house was very clean, stocked well, and the beds were comfortable.
The house was smaller than we realized and cozy for 8, but it worked. Everyone enjoyed the foosball.
The pool was a short walk from the house and had a hot tub as well. We did not get a chance to use the hot tub at the house.
The yard was small but had a nice picnic table where we had morning coffee and caught a couple of beautiful sunrises. A more comfortable chair on the porch would be nice.
This is in a neighborhood of closely built homes, but the noise was minimal.
We enjoyed our stay."

2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Loved our stay! We make frequent trips to Sierra Vista. Landlords and representation of homes definitely vary. This place was exactly as it was represented, and Ali went above and beyond. There was a notable attention to cleanliness and details. Place has a ton of natural light. Ali was super attentive. We enjoyed relaxing in the jacuzzi at the end of our day. This landlord is cognizant of her neighbors and clearly makes an effort to avoid disrupting their peace, which I really respect from an Airbnb landlord. We hope to revisit soon!"

2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The house was great, clean and spacious. I would highly recommend this house because it’s close to everything and very easy to get to everything you want and need.
My advice is to check in before it gets dark.
My flight was delayed, which caused me to arrive at night fall and I couldn’t figure out how to open the gate and I was a little confused on where the front of the house was. But, once I figured it out the next morning, my stay was great!"

2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Best AirBnB we’ve ever stayed at! Gorgeous 4 bedroom house with hot tub, fire pit, comfy beds, laundry options, etc. We will be staying here any time we are in town!"
2023-03-01,5,Group trip,"We enjoyed our stay at the desert nest, and Ali was a great host. Very responsive and easy to reach. The home is very comfortable and I felt very safe in the neighborhood.
There were a couple of things we weren’t expecting, some of the skillets and utensils had to be scrubbed to remove left behind cooked food. The sheets were clean but had some stains that looked as though they may have washed with something that may have left a color stain.
To me, these are minor things that never bothered me and they would not change my overall impression of this home.
I would stay at this property again without question."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I just have one complaint.... the King Size bed is just too darn comfortable. 😃 I almost didn't get up in time to check out. Amazing home. Just Outstanding!

I definitely want to stay again!
Thank you Ron & Zoe! 🤙"
2024-04-01,4,Stayed one night,"Beautiful place, a little hard to find but all the better for privacy. Probably best suited to longer-term stays to take full advantage of all the amenities provided! When Zoey heard I was in town and needed a place to crash asap, she responded almost immediately."

2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The property is just beautiful, so peaceful. Every direction is spectacular. Walk across the street and climb a mountain, drive a few miles to Brown Canyon Ranch! The pool was another highlight!
Probably our favorite was the pool table and darts! We haven't played those games in years!
Sorry we didn't get to meet Ron and Zoey, even out of the country, they responded to our emails! Their son came over and checked in on us to see if we needed ""anything"". Super sweet.
Loved it!!"
2024-02-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"A very quiet, scenic location with all desired amenities. Good Wi-Fi. Good access to the Huachuca Mountains, Coronado Nat. Monument and the Ramsey Preserve. Straight shot into Sierra Vista for supplies. Would stay here again!"

2024-01-01,5,Stayed over a week,"Ron and Zoey's place awesome! It's very clean and peaceful, and offers an amazing view of the mountains. They were also very accommodating and ensured everything I needed was available for my wonderful stay. Highly recommended!"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Wonderful stay!
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We absolutely loved our stay here! The setup was perfect! We were there for a graduation at the local military base. The location was perfect. It was exactly suited for our needs. They had lots of extras, too. The views are spectacular. The owners are exceptional hosts! I highly recommend this spot to anyone visiting the area."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"This casita was amazing, beautiful mountain views. It has a game room with a pool table and dart game, it was perfect because it gave us something to do indoors as it was pretty chilli out, windy, and raining. Zoey was amazing, she communicated quickly and friendly. She was very informative, and just as we were getting ready to leave she came outside to meet us and thank us. She gave us a lot of recommendations of things to do and when the best time to go again would be. I highly recommend this place. I am sure we will be back in Spring/summer to enjoy some hiking and pool area."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We had a wonderful stay. Ron and Zoey are perfect hosts. I would recommend to anyone and will stay again.
2023-12-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"We enjoyed our stay at the Aloha Ohana. The location was great. It was quiet at night and just a short drive to many hiking trails. The condo was well stocked with bottled water, snacks ,coffee and tea. The view from the sitting area outside is spectacular.
Ron and Zoey were gone most of the time we were there but they responded to us quickly with our questions."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Ron and Zoey place great with beautiful mountain views and lot of fun things to do. Ron and Zoey were great friendly kind and very accommodating hosts. We would recommend them other travelers. We would definitely stay there again.
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Can see how they became super hosts! I’m into privacy more than most, so I wasn’t a huge fan of the unplanned meetings, but all three times were so Zoey could offer my kids home-made treats, so who is going to complain about that? And Zoey is an immensely talented baker. I sampled all the treats for my kids and sheesh! She doesn’t miss! I think I also misunderstood what they meant my the pool being ‘solar heated’. I think they meant ‘heated by the sunlight’ whereas I thought it was heated by a solar cover. It was really cold and hot tub was covered. But my daughter had fun with the pool and playing ‘avoid the water’ anyway. Very clean, well-appointed property with everything we needed and more. Was not surprised to see Ron is a real estate agent. Stellar property. Great hosts!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Ron & Zoey were friendly & made us feel right at home! Their home is lovely!
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Ron and Zoey really made me feel welcome. The accommodations were so much better than a hotel. It's easy to see they take pride in their casita and ensuring their guests don't have to worry about a thing.
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Our stay at Ron & Zoey's was exactly what we were looking for! Great location and amazing attention to detail. We enjoyed having the extra space in the game room to play pool & some darts. Thanks again!
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Super beautiful sstting with views from heaven! Really great parking right next to the casita. Comfy bed and nice linens and towels. Shower a little short on hot water but really nice, roomy shower with a phenomenal selection of shampoos and body washes. Didn't use the rec/workout room nor the pool nor the ramada but they are just as nice as pictured. Quiet and private but not far from a lot of amenities."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful carriage house with million dollar views. We enjoyed our morning coffee watching the sun rise over the mountains. The outdoor kitchen and pool were a wonderful bonus that enhanced our experience even more. Thank you for sharing your magical property with others!

Awesome hiking opportunities. Surprisingly large variety of restaurants in the nearby town. Spacious guest house, fabulous pool and ramada area."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed about a week,"We felt welcomed and were sad to leave. Spectacular views and sunsets. Super private. Very friendly host. Great, well appointed Ramada where all the cooking is done. No cooking inside the small casita. We will be back whenever we need peace and quiet. Fabulous bird watching on site! The huge pool is an added bonus."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful place I loved it
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What a beautiful place to stay! Ron and Zoey are excellent hosts, and very responsive. There wasn't anything we needed that we couldn't find. They provided lots of extras, including some yummy snacks for us. The pool and the views were awesome, and the outdoor kitchen was a nice bonus. We loved seeing the javelinas walk through the yard in the morning. We hope to be back!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We highly recommend Richard's Ohana! It really is a slice of paradise in the dessert. The guest casita is very well appointed and the ramada/outdoor space is fantastic! The big highlight was the wildlife! Ron and Zoey were perfect hosts! We sincerely appreciated their extra efforts, ensuring we had everything we needed for our stay."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We had a wonderful stay at Ron and Zoey’s place! The location was beautiful and very quite. We enjoyed the pool and all the wildlife in the area. We highly recommend the ATV ride into the mountains! Ron and Zoey were great host and we would definitely stay here again!
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place did not disappoint!! It was more than we could ask for. We were able to arrive on our own time due to some expected events they were more than understanding provided the code as well as clear tips for the road leading up especially driving at night. We arrived with a welcome board with our names on it. Zoey greeted us in the morning to provide the area updates and suggestions of where to visit and less than 30 minutes away. Because I lived in Hawaii and going to return Zoey graciously gave my husband's and I the updates and suggestions as they were just there the week prior. She then scurried off and encourage us to take advantage of the time and property. We had an event taht evening however she messaged about a dish I mentioned earlier and had made some which had me in tears. Not to mention the hiking trails, the deers and javelina sitings. Well needed rest and super duper hosts. We will be back!!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,A perfect night away from home! See you next year!
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Lovely quiet getaway in the foothills, small but cozy with many ammenities and thoughtful supplies cleanly laid out for guests."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The Casita at Ron and Zoey's home is one of the sweetest places that we have stayed in, during the years that we have used AirBnB for travel.
It is very unique because you have access to beautifully peaceful surroundings and amenities like, an excellent pool and even an exercise room with a pool table and games
It is best for a small family because the main room is a nicely furnished efficiency without a full stove top.
These hosts are very thoughtful and responsive, even though they were out of state, while we used their Casita. It is a very special place!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is truly a can’t miss property and destination. The area is beautiful and is centrally located to many things from Bisbee, to Tombstone, to great restaurants and groceries, it’s even just a 10 minute drive to the top of a mountain! Ron and Zoey are amazing, everything is private, hands down this is a must stay!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Wow. What can I say? Absolutely not enough! Zoey and Ron have created an amazing oasis. We (girls trip from NJ - myself and 2 daughters, aged 20 & 17) stayed at their incredibly hospitable cottage in the heart of the Southern Arizona mountains & canyons. Having never been to the Southwest, we were greeted with the most amazing views around Zoey & Ron's place. Birds, wildlife, peaceful quiet and a gorgeous pool! Our hosts provided everything we could ever need and then some. We had very busy and packed days and every day we were so excited to head back to the comfort of the cottage. It was so cozy and inviting that we felt like we were headed home. It was that much of a welcomed feeling. We relaxed by the pool in the early evenings and the girls even swam under the moonlight. There are so many cool things to do in the area and Zoey helped guide and us every step of the way. She was unbelievably helpful and caring. We did NOT want to leave and will miss Arizona and our awesome hosts!!!!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Aloha in the desert! I can’t thank Zoey & Ron enough for creating a place of serenity, calm, quiet and beauty! This was a perfect staycation, and we’ve already recommended their place to several of our local friends. The pool & veranda was a place of tranquility and relaxation. I will definitely be booking for a longer stay next time!!! Thank you so much, Zoey & Ron!!!!!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed over a week,Ron and Zoey were the perfect hosts. The setting was outstanding with beautiful views wherever you looked. Zoey was very helpful any every way and we look forward to returning at some point.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,What a fun stay at Ron and Zoey’s Airbnb!!! Zoey gave me so many wonderful suggestions on what to do and see at this beautiful location. If you love thunderstorms hit this place during the monsoon season and hopefully you witness some incredible sunsets while you sitting by the pool due to these storms. The actual room so cozy and warm. Bonus was the exercise room or game room adjoined with your room. Loved my stay there and yes….I will be back. Thanks again Ron And Zoey. God Bless
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We really enjoyed our stay. It was so peaceful, clean and flexible. Thank you for welcoming us in your home. Would definitely stay there again."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Just stayed here for the second time, and it's beautiful as ever! We particularly liked the pool -- even swam under the stars one night. We spotted hummingbirds, mule deer, and javelinas in the desert. In addition to the thoughtful amenities, Zoey was very sweet with my young daughter, chatting with us and sharing fresh mangoes. Hope to return again soon!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Super comfortable bungalow in an absolutely gorgeous setting at the base of the mountain! The place is clean and comfortable and super quiet, and Zoey was a fantastic hostess. And the grounds are incredible! A sparkling pool, and several sitting areas where we saw deer, rabbits and quail as we sipped our coffee. Next time we stay here I will remember my swimsuit and good hiking shoes -- we didn't have time to hike on this trip, but the trails sound amazing. Also, this location is an easy drive to Bisbee, Tombstone or the wineries near Sonoita, so it's a great base for seeing southern AZ. Can't wait to come back!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Thank you Ron & Zoey it was a peaceful experience somewhere to get away and enjoy the Mountain View’s and your casita was very welcoming again thank you for the experience . 🤗
2023-06-01,5,Stayed about a week,I read the reviews about how great of hosts Ron & Zoey are and without exaggeration they are the best! Ron & Zoey are genuinely friendly and caring people. They greeted us as our hosts and we said good bye to good friends!
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"What an incredible, peaceful, wonderful overall experience! Zoey and Ron were A+ hosts! They went above and beyond with kindness and generosity and special extras to make our experience extra-special. We were very grateful! Their communication was outstanding and description was very accurate of the accommodations. We without hesitation would return and highly recommend this special “home away from home” to everyone."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,A wonderful little oasis!
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Such a beautiful serene home. Hosts were very accommodating. Relaxing and comfortable.
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"Though I am very familiar with this area(, my house was having a major overhaul cleaning episode as I only live a few miles away) was very impressed with the beautiful area, quietness, and beauty that surrounds this home. Its beautiful, easy to locate, full of amenities including a workout room which came in handy as the wind was an issue to be outdoors. very comfortable, fully stocked. Owner very communicative with abundant information relating to the property as well and was impressed with the wealth of hiking trail , area information."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Loved the stay! Amazing area and beautiful scenery along with an incredible room. Will absolutely be back. Thanks for making our trip easy and enjoyable Ron & Zoey
2023-04-01,5,Stayed about a week,Beautiful place and perfect for our trip!
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We were so well taken care of! We got tips on what we could do and there was a whole book of info which was great! Our 2-year-old got both cookies and borrowed toys! We were also surprised with breakfast! I myself have been thinking about starting my own Airbnb and was so inspired by Zoey!!!
2023-04-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Very nice, safe and beautiful neighborhood. The hosts were easy to communicate with. Comfortable bed."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Stayed 2 nights for a work trip. From the first moment I arrived I felt welcomed. Zoey asked if I’d had dinner yet and I told her I was just going to go into town to find something, but she insisted I stay put and brought me a plate of amazing homemade food (talapia, shrimp, and fried rice with bacon). She even offered so graciously to do a small load of laundry for me. I couldn’t have imagined a better hostess and overall stay.
My time at their place was nothing short of perfect. The kindness, hospitality, and generosity, was something I’ll never forget.
When I’m in town again, there’s no quest I’ll reach out to Zoey. One of the nicest people I’ve met in some time."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed over a week,"This is the most beautiful location in canyon country. Ron and Zoey are most kind and accommodating. Their place is lovely, and had everything we needed. It is well appointed and comfortable."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"A little off the beaten path, but cute and cozy. The scenery was beautiful, and it was relaxing and peaceful. The hosts live on the property but didn't intrude. While I was leaving, I saw three young deer, and they didn't even run away. Great rates, too."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Very nice, outside table & seating area. Sparkling clean, hostess went out of her way to be helpful with questions & information we needed. The area was beautiful. Bird watching was outstanding."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Highly recommend., great hosts, great stay. Perfect location for birding, very close to Ramsey Canyon. Highly recommend “Red Start Birding Tours” … Kristy was a great guide. Also we had great Italian food at Pizzeria Mimosa. And if you’re going to go to Bisbee, highly recommend getting a reservation at Cafe Roma … worth the trip, but make your reservation as soon as you book Ron and Zoey’s place."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed one night,Ron and Zoey's place was perfect! The scenery was absolutely beautiful. The home was elegant inside and very comfortable. The hosts were very thoughtful and accommodating. We would 100% stay there again when we visit.
2023-02-01,5,Stayed over a week,"Wonderful place to stay! Cute, clean and had everything I needed. Being single I wanted to stay out of town and I felt very safe with Zoey & Ron close by but not intruding. Zoey was so gracious & kind and her knowledge of the area was so helpful for hiking & sightseeing. I enjoyed my 2 week stay and definitely will be back! Thank you Zoey & Ron for everything!"
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Zoey and Ron are the best hosts we ever met on AirBnB. And we travel a lot. We are painters and Zoey provided a list of places we needed to see. It made our trip (and art) unforgettable.
Zoey provided other benefits that were over and above what is expected. I hope you are treated as well as we were.
I honestly cannot expect they treat everybody this well. The Home is a bit unorthodox, but worked very well for us.
We have become friends of Zoey and Ron and would of course stay with them again in the future."
2023-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"Ron and Zoey’s comfortable Casita had everything we needed for a single night stay while visiting family in the area. The bed and fold-out couch were both very comfortable, the bathroom and roomy shower a pleasure to refresh in, and the location couldn’t be beat. You’ll feel as if you’re much further out in the country, but it’s only a quick 4-minute drive to Highway 92. The Huachuca Mountains rise in splendor behind the Casita and watching the morning sun illuminate them with a hot cup of Joe was memorable. We especially enjoyed the small placards with words of wisdom scattered about. It’s clear a great deal of loving and careful thought has been put into every detail here, and we can’t think of a better place to lodge again when we’re in the area."
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This space was so cozy and inviting; we felt at home as soon as we walked in! Intimate and yet just the right amount of space! Zoey kept in touch with us all the way from before we landed til we arrived at their place! She thought of everything, including the suggestion that we stop and get groceries on the way since we were arriving late so we could relax once we arrived! Her recommendations of things to do couldnt have been more spot on….the hikes, places to eat etc. I have never had a host be so responsive every time we reached out! We felt so taken care of. We were lucky enough to meet Zoey and she is lovely! Private location but close to Bizbee and Tombstone and more!"
2022-12-01,5,Stayed one night,Cute and nicely appointed. Great colors. They've thought of nearly everything. So clean and tidy. Peaceful and quiet. I would go back and would have liked to stay longer.
2022-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Fantastic hosts!!! Very clean, very hospitable, and warm welcome!! Could not have been better!!! Thank you!!!"
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Wonderful place near incredible hiking and… Of course… World-class birdwatching. Place is perfect for one person or a couple that are just looking for some access to nature. They are also Incredibly nice and thoughtful people.
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great stay!
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Perfect little guest suite for a couple. Loved our 3 night stay here. Very well stocked, clean as a pin, very comfortable and quiet as a church mouse! Ecen has a treadmill, pool table, etc. right next door.
Super hosts that are more than accommodating (Zoey is one of the best I’ve ever experienced) and very responsive. A 5 star stay .. and then some! Highly recommend!"
2022-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"If you want to explore several locations like Bisbee, Tombstone, Benson, Sierra Vista, etc. this is the perfect place as its in the middle of all that. Very accommodating hosts, the casita has everything you need & more! Communication was exceptional, will come back soon! Thanks Zoey & Ron!"
2022-11-01,5,Stayed one night,What a great place to relax at night. This place is a gem.
2022-10-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Ron and Zoey’s place was comfortable and private. It was clean and fun. The bed was comfortable and we had everything we needed. The views are lovely too!
2022-10-01,5,Stayed one night,This place is right at the foothills with lots of great hiking and birding around. The hosts were super communicative and fast to respond for a last minute adventure.

2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The listing doesn't do this amazing property justice! The views are breathtaking, the room is roomy and very comfortable, the huge pool is spectacular (and warm), Ron and Zoey were super friendly, there's so much privacy you almost feel like you're the only people for miles, and did I mention a huge game and fitness room? Ron and Zoey's accommodations had everything you might need or want. The room smelled great and was impeccably clean."
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"A wonderful place to stay with fantastic views! Very easy and quick communications with Zoey and Ron. Nice neighborhood with friendly neighbors. The very clean casita had everything we needed with many extras- coffee, breakfast bars, etc.
Also, enjoyed the entertainment options that included pool table, dart board, and board games along with sitting on the patio and simply viewing the scenery! Seeing Carr Falls was an extra bonus!"
2022-08-01,5,Stayed one night,Would leave 6 stars if I could! Ron and Zoey are gracious hosts and have a BEAUTIFUL home with a lovely view of the mountains from the pool.
2022-08-01,5,Stayed one night,Exceptional mountain views from this very comfortable casa. Great hosts too!
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Top notch hosts. Friendly and very customer service focused. This is my second stay and will continue to revisit when I come visit SE Arizona. Can't ask for any better. Zero Complaints.
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This is such an amazing space! My husband and I were looking to take a trip to see Tombstone and just relax. We got just that and more! We were not sure what to expect in regards to its location but we’re blown away by the views of the mountains and property. The pool is breath taking all on its own! The room is separate from the house and connected to the game room. We definitely enjoyed some healthy competition with the pool table. We also enjoyed every second of the pool and had it all to ourselves. The owners were absolutely kind and offered tons of ideas of things to see around the area. We were beyond appreciative by our experience and hope to visit again in the future! Thank you so much Ron & Zoey!
2022-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"It was a great location, very well stocked and maintained property, and it was comfortable and clean. Owners were very responsive."
2022-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"I really liked staying here. The hosts were prompt in answering any questions I had. The pool was a huge plus, so my child and I enjoyed swimming between busy wedding activities."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This was our second stay with Ron and Zoey and it was just as great as the first! The casita is clean and in a beautiful location. We thoroughly enjoyed a day at the pool. Their place is also located about 30 minutes from historic bisbee so we were able to go up there for a nice dinner. Zoey is extremely responsive and helpful. We would recommend booking this place for a little summer getaway!
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place and excellent hosts. Near some spectacular sights. If visting someone at Ft Huachuca and like a perfect private place with pool this is for you!!
2022-07-01,4,Stayed with kids,"Excellent, very nice place"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great hosts that are communicative, friendly, and knowledgeable of the area. Cool hidden gem in SV and close to plenty of trails/hikes."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Completely awesome and unique experience. Perfect Sonoran desert location. Short and easy hiking trail nearby for sunset or rise views. Highly recommend to everyone traveling in the area. Don’t miss an opportunity to drop by closely located Bonnie’s bar and chat with a local.
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Stunning property with gorgeous views. Super responsive hosts that have literally thought of everything. Very happy!
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,What a fantastic and peaceful oasis. We cannot say enough about the accommodations and the amenities provided.

2022-06-01,4,Stayed one night,"The setting is spectacular, Zoey is very friendly and warm, and the place is really clean! We enjoyed sitting by the pool while the sun set and had fun playing billiards in the game room. Deer and lots of birds around. Communication was good, and check-in and keypad access were easy. It's a nice, private property. Had a good stay and would enjoy coming again!"
2022-06-01,5,Stayed one night,Great place.
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Zoey is delightful host and answered all my questions!! A great place. I recommend it to anyone especially if you have kids! The pool is fabulous!!
2022-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"Ron and Zoe are great hosts. They are very responsive to messages and answer almost immediately. Their Casita is very comprehensively equipped - it's hard to imagine what else you might need. We had a very comfortable stay.
The location, close to Ramsey Canyon, is ideal for Birders and Hikers who are interested in the area. There is the usual range of Restaurants and shops close by in Sierra Vista."
2022-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This is an amazing little spot!! A beautiful casita in a very scenic and quiet area. Gorgeous mountain views, amazing pool, and wonderful hospitality from the owners. I would definitely stay here again!!"
2022-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"Our stay was very brief but everything was wonderful. Ron and Zoey were friendly, gracious hosts who gave us our privacy. The accommodations were clean, the bed was very comfortable (more than my bed at home). We had everything we needed. Unfortunately, we weren't there long enough to take advantage of all the features available to us such as the beautiful swimming pool. The highlight for me, as a birder was the Phainopepla that visited the pool area and the location was great for accessing all the birding hotspots in the Huachuca Mountains. Excellent value, much better than staying in a generic hotel."
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Ron and Zoey's casita was perfect for our time birding around SE Arizona. It's just a 10 minute drive from Ramsey and Ash Canyons with a beautiful mountain view from the yard. We thoroughly enjoyed the pool and game room, which were great amenities to come back to after hiking in the morning. Zoey was a warm and generous host who gave great suggestions on things to do around the area and provided a lot of little touches to make us feel welcome. We'd definitely recommend staying at their casita!"
2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Ron and Zoey's place is the best. Had a great time Its clean cozy and quiet. It is tucked away form hustle and bustle. Saw lots of stars enjoyed the pool and the outdoor barbeque area. Took a ride to Bisbee which was great visit there are lots of shops and restaurants.
2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great location for exploring and hiking in the Huachucas. Very convenient to Ramsey canyon. Apartment had everything... comfortable bed, great coffee, nice shower.

2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Ron and Zoey’s place was our first experience with Airbnb. They were both so friendly and helpful it made it all easy. We had the most contact with Zoey. She was so full of great information about the area. And was excited to share! We tried most of her suggestions and she was spot on! They gave us our privacy but was sure to let us know how to contact her if we needed anything. Nice town too! Highly recommend !
2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Clean, cozy, quiet, and safe space. Our flight caused a late check in and key pad entry made it easy. A binder of everything you would need was made available in the room which took any guess work out of the stay. We will definitely stay here again if in the area."
2022-03-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Zoey and Ron are very accommodating and generous hosts. Although the space is small, it's perfect for a couple's getaway. Having only an outdoor kitchen could be challenging but if the weather is right for being poolside, it's great. There are also plenty of great local restaurants. Zoey made every effort to make sure we had everything we needed and were comfortable. The house is on the road to Ramsey Canyon and very near Ash Canyon, so if you are a birder, this is a perfect location. Roadrunners and Gambel's quail were seen from the property and in season, Zoey has many hummingbird feeders around the pool."
2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The place is a beautiful spot to relax. It's tucked away but still close to town. I will definitely visit again.

They make themselves available to answer questions or provide their guests with any needs. They also have much information about the local attractions and give great insight into the available adventures to be had in the area.

We would highly recommend this place as a perfect getaway!"
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is my second time staying at Ron and Zoey’s. After staying the first time by myself, I had to bring my kids back.

2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The description of the place is perfectly accurate and can’t convey how special of a place it is. The location at the base of the Huachuca Mountains is beautiful, the casita is cozy and fun, the pool relaxing, and Zoey and Ron are generous and welcoming hosts. It was a perfect place to get some quiet and have some real human connection at the same time. I’ve already booked another stay and will be bringing my sons with me this time."

We highly recommend staying here.
2021-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"Everything you want and more from a perfect getaway destination. Wonderful and thoughtful hosts, fully stocked guest house that will make you want to stay forever. The pool area blew away my expectations. The temperature of the water was absolutely perfect. There is also an area to sit and watch the sunset or enjoy your morning cup of coffee looking out over the trees and mountains. You don't even realize you're in a populated area. Truly a wonderful little gem with gracious hosts. Thank you again for sharing your home!"
2021-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"Beautiful secluded spot, very thoughtful and all around one of the best places I've ever stayed. Ron abd Zoey really know what they're doing. It was so cozy we didn't even want to leave! ❤"
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is exactly what is listed, and more. A perfect location to enjoy the scenery of AZ, close to many hiking/biking/off road trails. Additionally, the drive to Fort Huachuca is manageable. Not only was the Casita a sanctuary, it is adjacent to the garage with games, darts, and pool table for fun times! What makes this Airbnb so special is not only the place to sleep and relax, but the generous hospitality of the hosts, Zoey and Ron."
2021-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great place, see my second review!! They accommodated a last minute change to add a night to our stay!"
2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,What a terrific place to stay and the hosts are awesome. Zoey went above and beyond to make our stay special!

2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I needed a weekend away, and access to water (pool) and quiet. I reserved this location a few weeks in advance, and I'm so happy I did. The owners took a lot of time to make the Casita feel welcomed.
The pool was Perfect! the snacks, water, coffee, TV, games etc were great to stay in for a while. it's close to hiking trails too!!
I will book it again!"
2021-06-01,5,Stayed one night,This is should be rated as 100 star.Zoey was the best host ever.The place is beautiful with more than everything that you need.You name it and its over there and also she is very thoughtful and kept alot of varieties such as shampoo conditioner creamer everything you name it.The swimming pool and the view of the place was the best.We loved it and specially her hospitality was the best.At so low charge she cooks amazing food.She invited us to her house to have food and felt like we went to a relative house.She was so positive and always has a smile in her face and also cared what we need.
2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Private, spotless, luxurious, peaceful serenity in paradise... This beautiful casita has it all. From the hosts, who are absolutely some of the most genuine and caring people I’ve ever met. Ron was very friendly, and Zoey and I visited daily. She’s a treasure. We really connected on a soulful level. I actually felt sad leaving their space as she now feels like family and I miss her calming energy and loving demeanor already. She went above and beyond to accommodate myself and my family. To the weather, which was perfect during our stay. The pool and Ramada were functional, beautiful and felt like we were living the life of the rich and famous.. The amenities provided made everything convenient and and stress free. Zoey has thought of it all. Plenty of clean towels, bath and body products, snacks etc.. The space was extremely clean and we felt very safe and supported during our stay. The property is about 10 minutes outside of town, but close enough to everything that a quick trip to the store or restaurants were a breeze. They even were able to accommodate my 32ft RV, and when I had a mechanical issue offered to assist me with getting it resolved. So amazing!! My heart is so full as I reflect on our unforgettable time there. I highly recommend this space as a restful retreat for a single, couple or small family. They have another property which can accommodate a larger family. I am looking forward to returning as soon as possible. This was hands down the best Airbnb experience I’ve ever had!! Easily 10 + stars. I feel blessed to have been given the opportunity to stay here and connect with truly pure souls. Don’t hesitate to book your stay! Take care, Ron & Zoey! Until we meet again!! Xoxo"
2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Excellent! I live in Tucson but would be happy to travel much further if I knew I was going to end up here. Zoey and Ron were excellent communicators, helpful, friendly, and gave us lots of good tips for hiking and sight seeing in the surrounding national park. Would give more than five stars if I could!"
2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"If you are traveling in the Sierra Vista area, you can’t ask for better accommodations then Ron and Zoey’s gorgeous property! They have thought of everything and they make you feel so welcome!"
2021-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"The location, privacy, and relaxation factor is unmatched. It was 100% private and felt like home. The pool was amazing and staring up at the mountains made it tranquil and exactly what we needed. Communication was constant to include while we were there and after. Check in was seamless and I had mentioned it was my girlfriends birthday and they added personal touches like fruit, a flower, and even a personalized sign. I have never seen her so happy. There was not a single thing out of place and was much better then described. If you have a chance to stay here, even as a staycation, it'll be well worth it. We are looking for a way to come back in the very near future with no need to look anywhere else."
2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Ron and Zoey are the best Air BnB hosts that we have ever had. Their Casita was not only a spotless and comfy place to stay, it offered an entire experience. Pool! A Ramada! Stargazing! Birdwatching! We highly recommend Richard's Ohana."

Ron and Zoey were very responsive and answered any and all questions we had.
Ron and Zoey graciously welcomed my fiancé and I to their home and we left with new friends and mentors! They are the kindest and most generous people, and anyone would be lucky to stay with them."
2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Zoey is the definition of an amazing host! I had several questions ahead of time and she always got back to me promptly!

2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We based ourselves here for a three-day birding experience to visit the hotspots in the canyons and along the San Pedro River. Great location for this. Short drives to where we wanted to go and could take a midday break after morning outings to recharge before heading out for a late afternoon/early evening outing. Even the house’s patio area had some bird activity.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful, spacious, secure home with private outdoor sitting areas in both front and back. The location provided easy access to anything in the area. We were two couples on a vacation and the home provided ample common space as well as private sleeping/bathing space for each couple. Incredibly clean and comfortable; and even more lovely than the awesome pictures."

Accurate pictures and description. Really enjoyed the house, location, and price.
Highly recommend!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was the first time trying an AirB&B and was not disapointed. It was minutes to base and in a very quiet neighborhood. The house was very spacious in the living room to allow for visiting guest and the decor was very beautiful. The unit was also very clean. The host did a geat job on the refurbishing.
Plus the money we saved on hotel rooms with the added bonus of home amenities made it all worth it. I would recommend this location. The Host were great from begining to end.
It was perfect for our needs."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Loved it! A very spacious and comfortable home. Nice neighborhood. Close to shopping and restaurants.
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The house is newly renovated and spotless. Bathrooms large and very nicely equipped, likewise large kitchen with everything we needed and a gas grill on back patio. The house is in an established, tidy subdivision with no view, so not an exciting location per se, but great access to hiking and birding sites around SE Arizona. There were 4 of us but could easily have 6 in this home."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Loved this home. We didn’t have good weather so we stayed in a lot. It’s a beautiful place, super comfortable and clean. Comfortable furniture and beds, soft linens, nice fluffy towels. Can’t say enough nice things about how wonderful a property it is. Would most definitely stay again."
2024-02-01,5,Group trip,Photos do not do this place justice. So cozy and cute. Tracy and her husband were amazing and so sweet. Loved our time here.
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a fabulous stay! This home was 5++++ stars!
From the very start, Tracy & Doug were friendly and quick to respond to any & all questions or concerns.
The keyless entry with your own personal code is awesome. One tip: give the door a good push after keying in your code. Once we learned to do that, getting in was easy-peasy.
The house is IMMACULATE. Cleaner than mine, that's for sure! It is beautifully furnished in a southwestern motif, very tastefully done. It looked brand new. Also very comfortable. The sofa was comfy and the beds were comfy as well - nice & firm, but not rock hard.
The kitchen pantry is full of appliances to choose from. We used the drip coffee maker & toaster. Coffee filters were provided. Dishes were ample & adequate.
Location is great. It's in a quiet neighborhood but close to shopping and places to eat. It was a good home base for our adventures to Tombstone, Bisbee & Kartchner Caverns.
We would definitely stay here again!"
2023-12-01,5,Group trip,This is a beautiful home with lots of space to relax. Kitchen was well stocked and many small “extras” such as USB outlets and games available. Hosts were amazing to work with and extremely responsive to questions. We would definitely stay here again!

Super clean and spacious. Fully equipped kitchen. Great keyless entry."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great home wonderful host- definitely recommend it and will be booking again in the future
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Tracey’s house was the cleanest AirBNB we have ever stayed in. I agree with a previous guest; the pictures don’t do this spacious, lovely home justice. We enjoyed watching the beautiful birds while enjoying the patio. It was in a great location - centrally located in Sierra Vista. Highly recommend this home and host!!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"A beautiful, clean and comfortable home with a lovely courtyard located centrally within the city. Much effort was put into details and quality amenities. Would definitely return and highly recommend to anyone. We loved our stay."
2023-08-01,5,Group trip,"The house was perfectly clean and very spacious. We loved that there were specific instructions for unusual things in the house: where hidden usb charging ports are, which light switches control lamps, etc. It was also very nice to have clear instructions for check out. The beds were comfortable and did I mention the house was perfectly clean? Highly recommend this place!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Thank you Tracy for being such a great hostess. Your home was lovely and even bigger than what appeared on the pictures. You thought of every thing to make us feel right at home making our stay restful and enjoyable. Again, thank you. Susan"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Definitely one of the best airbnbs i have ever stayed at! The home was absolutely beautiful, fresh fruit from the trees, and a wonderful mountain view all around. The host was very quick to respond to any questions and was SO friendly. I 100% recommend this place to anyone looking in the area, if we ever come back to sierra vista, this is where wed stay again. Thank you again!!!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,Worth every dime. Was a great first experience. Host made sure we got to the home and it was up to the standards. Responsive when I reached out. I will be checking to see if this location is available the next time I have to visit!
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This house was even better than the photos in my opinion. Everything was super clean, and cozy. Inside and out was beautiful. The host were also very kind and responsive. I had absolutely no issues from booking, all the way to check out. It was definitely worth the money, and the nicest house I seen on this app for Sierra vista, whenever I booked. 100% loved it."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We really enjoyed our stay at Tracy’s place. The renovated home, in beautiful southwestern decor, was comfortable and very roomy fir our party of six. It’s located in a quiet, safe neighborhood. We were so close to attractions like Bisbee, Tombstone, Ft. Huachuca, Karchner Caverns, Colossal Cave, and the Sonoita wineries. There was an ample supply of both Keurig and drip coffees and the plentiful kitchen appliances and utensils made preparing meals a breeze. There’s even a gas grill on the back patio! Our timing was perfect as Tracy reminded us the apricot trees in the backyard were ripening with fruit - what a special treat! Thanks Tracy & cohost Doug! We will certainly look you up next time we are in southwestern Arizona."
2023-06-01,5,Group trip,"We have stayed in many Airbnb’s. While all were nice, this home has been the best hands down. Highly recommend it if you are in the area.
Host was amazing as well. You will not be disappointed."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed over a week,"I stayed at Tracy’s home for 3 months and my experience was wonderful. Tracy’s place felt like a home away from home! I appreciated the hand written card and treats welcoming my family. Additionally she provided basic amenities to start my stay such as Coffee, Dish Soap, Laundry Detergent, toilet paper and paper towels. That was a bonus in my book, especially since I reserved an extended stay. Overall the home was comfortable, peaceful, and extremely clean. I’d recommend Tracy’s home to anyone needing a place to stay in Sierra Vista. Well worth the price!"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed over a week,My stay was perfect. The home and decor was practically brand new. It was very comfortable and I had all my needs met. Tracy was always helpful and quick to provide feedback regarding my questions. The value exceeded the cost of the unit. The neighborhood was quiet and safe with nice sidewalks to meander. I would absolutely stay at this house again.

2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We were thrilled with this place! We spent a few nights for hiking in the Huachuca Mountains and a festival in Veterans Memorial Park. Everything about the house was perfect for us: Even games and coloring! We always eat breakfast at The Landmark Cafe when in town, this time we had a superb dinner at The German Cafe which was great and all just minutes away. Eddie's kitchen was fully equipped so we really didn't need to go anywhere. We'll definitely stay here next time if it's available."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This is our second time to Eddie’s place and it was just as great the second time around!
2024-06-01,5,Group trip,"This house was absolutely beautiful. WiFi info was a bit tricky to find but Eddie helped me very quickly. One of the beds (wooden frame) seemed more like a full rather than a queen and squeaks quite a bit with little movement, but worked fine. Great TVs in each room. Relaxing backyard and the house is very comfortable and homey.
The house had everything I needed and Eddie was so helpful. Beautiful place and would absolutely stay again."
2024-06-01,5,Group trip,"Perfect location to get to Fort Huachuca

Multiple bathrooms, bedrooms, a big kitchen, and a big living room. We couldn't be happier with our visit. The house was spotless and the owner was very responsive to questions that we had. We cannot recommend staying here enough. It was worth every dollar."

The house offered plenty of room for our group to spread out and relax, with well-appointed bedrooms and common areas that felt like home.
Situated in a prime spot, we found it easy to explore the local area and take advantage of nearby attractions.

2024-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,Comfortable
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This 4 bedroom house in Sierra Vista was just what we were looking for! The space allowed us to play games and relax with our son who graduated from AIT at Ft. Huachuca. Visiting from Wisconsin it was a real treat to be able to get up and go for a sunny morning walk in February! I felt very safe in this neighborhood! The fireplace was a delight to warm up by and I enjoyed the patio to catch some morning rays as well as sunsets. Eddie had lots of snack already on site - we enjoyed the popcorn and selection of teas and hot chocolate! My favorite amenity of all though was his very comfy couch! 10/10 for napping, reading, and watching movies!"
2024-01-01,5,Group trip,Eddie was very communicative and friendly. The home was just like the pictures; very lovely. I would definitely rent again for my family.
2024-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Who needs a Ritz Carlton in Sierra Vista when you have Casa Sierra Vista! This home feels cozy, clean and host provides small extra details. The kitchen is amazing to cook in and ample space to have a family meal inside and outside. Comfy beds and clean linens. Would highly recommend and will stay again when visiting Sierra Vista."
2024-01-01,4,Group trip,I enjoyed my stay
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Eddie’s place was wonderful. He provided so many extras, It is impossible to list them all. Suffice it to say you will feel right at home (plenty of snacks, towels, comforters, pillows, toiletries, fully stocked kitchen, extremely safe neighborhood, plenty of parking…his airbnb is spacious, beds were comfy, loved the huge kitchen, living room, dining table…had it not been in the middle of winter we would have been able to use the fenced in backyard and patio more. I highly recommend!"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,Eddie was a kind and responsive host. He took the time to get to know us. I felt like I was renting from a friend.
2023-12-01,5,Group trip,"Eddie's place was perfect for us, especially since it had separation between some of the bedrooms for our adult children (and us!). The place was spotless, convenient and plenty large for our group. Eddie was extremely responsive and helpful. We will definitely look to stay there next time we are in town!"
2023-12-01,5,Group trip,What a great place! We had eight people stay and it didn’t feel cramped at all! Very clean and charmingly decorated. No more than 5 minutes from everything in Sierra Vista including the base. Eddie was very responsive anytime we reached out and so helpful!
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,Will return!
2023-11-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Awesome place to rent, easy access to any location such as restaurants or shopping within 5 miles from rental. Felt very safe, neighbors made us feel welcomed with kindly waves of hello/goodbye. When in the Sierra Vista area I would definitely see if the rental is available. Layout of home and colors add to the beauty of the home. Back yard is relaxing. Eddie was quick to respond to any question or concerns that we had, and was polite to check up on us to make sure we were comfortable or needed anything"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,An amazing place to stay in Sierra Vista. Great location and clean place with plenty of space.

2024-04-01,4,Stayed one night,"Great simple place to spend one night in the area - clean, comfortable. The only issue was noise from dogs & rooster in the middle of the night - earplugs would have helped."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very nice private room with gorgeous views. Hosts were great!
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"It was a great stay, clean and easy. Enjoyed the stay and it was like home. Centered around lots of restaurants and not far from main town at all. We would definitely stay here again !"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"Just a quick trip, this place had everything I needed and I would definitely stay here again. Unit was clean and heater worked well on a winter night. Dogs barked a bit while I was walking in, but were separated in the backyard. Honestly I thought they were cute and they made me feel safer. Location provided very convenient access to the mountains and local trails."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Steven was really friendly. He gave me advice on where to get food. He is bery responsive, which gave me a ton of confidence. The place was very clean. Steven was proactive in making sure that everything was good. I would definitely stay here again if I needed to!"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place had all I needed and the host Steven was on point, really nice people here. Close to some of the best mountain biking in Sierra Vista.

2023-12-01,4,Stayed one night,"Steve provides the clean and necessary food and coffee machine and shower items for us to use. But still there are several things are not what we expected
1. There are 4 dogs. When we arrived, they kept barking. That was scary to us and we barely dared to go through the backyard and went to the room though they were locked in the house or another part of the yard. Steven was responsive after I messaged him.
2. There was only one thin blanket on the bed. And it was cold on the night of Dec though we opened the heater.
But the price was reasonable."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I stayed at Steven’s for about a week. The room is clean and well put together. There is a keurig coffee maker, microwave and mini fridge. The bed is comfy and the heating unit works well. Bathroom is clean and nice. I appreciated the fenced patio area as I had my dog w me. The location is a bit rural but good for getting to Sierra Vista or Bisbee. There are dogs on the property that are very friendly and bark a little but got along well w my dog through the fence. Steven was very responsive when I requested more creamer and other items. Friendly host and the value cannot be beat!"
2023-12-01,4,Stayed a few nights,If you want a clean and smoke free place this is it!

2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Amazing location
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,My dogs and I really enjoyed our stay here. The house was clean and in great condition and my dogs loved the yard. The host communicated well and I was very comfortable throughout the stay. My only note would be that there are dogs next door that are fence reactive and interested in fence fighting. This wasn’t a problem for my trained dogs but something for visitors to be aware of before letting the dogs out into the yard. I would absolutely love to stay here again next time I’m in the area!!
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,A great place to stay and easy check in!
2024-06-01,3,Stayed with kids,Easy check in. Host responded very quick with my questions.
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"What I liked was how quiet the area was and yet very adaptable. The Gathering fits the atmosphere- one can have a BBQ, small fire in the fire pit, cool home in the AZ heat and so many spaces to sit and chat or eat comfortably inside or outside.
We were transitioning from our home to moving to another state. I highly recommend"
2024-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay, the house was peaceful and had everything you could need.

Would definitely book again!"
2024-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"The hosts have worked hard to make sure the space has everything guests might need. The kitchen is well stocked, there’s a propane grill, and the house is located in a quiet neighborhood on the outskirts of Sierra Vista. If you like birds, this house is close to Ramsey Canyon (about 10-12 minutes by car), Ash Canyon Bird Sanctuary (12 minutes), and San Pedro House (about 17 minutes). Staci was a very responsive and accommodating host, and we enjoyed our stay."
2024-04-01,5,Group trip,"Cute and Cozy, had all amenities you could forget when traveling. Clean. There is privacy, and a nice screened outdoor area. Will stay again for sure. Plenty of room for all 6 of us, multiple areas to gather."

2023-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"The Gathering Place was exactly what we were looking for! Easy to get to, private but not remote, close to the location of the wedding we attended and spacious enough for our family of five plus a cousin and small dog. The best part: super homey, and cozy feel!
We had THE BEST time and would 100% stay again!"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Loved the easy access and keypad entry. Everything needed for a long weekend. Bonus was finding a game drawer, however after I already purchased dominoes which I gifted. I would definitely stay on my next trip to Sierra Vista"

We appreciated the space it offered and loved being able to be so comfortable during our stay. This is the only place we will be staying at in sierra vista from now on!

2023-09-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Lovely home with beautiful views! Very clean and had everything you could think of and then some. The host Staci was very responsive , friendly, and polite❤️"
2023-09-01,4,Stayed with kids,"We had a wonderful stay at Stacis home. The view was absolutely beautiful, it was close to everything but removed enough to where we didn’t feel like we were on top of people. There was plenty of space for everyone and was very comfortable. Drank coffee in the screened in area every morning and watched the sunrise. The only issue we had was we didn’t realize it had a swamp cooler and it kind of made everything feel damp. We also had a night after it rained where the door wouldn’t open. Luckily we had the emergency key with us. Would gladly stay there again though and thoroughly enjoyed it."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This was our second time staying at the home, and it was perfect. centrally located to bisbee and sonoita, it was perfect for our day trips. We will definitely stay here again."

2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Beautiful place, we will definitely be back"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"I adored this home and had NO idea of all the Sierra Vista had to offer. We visited Tombstone on Staci's recommendation and my entire family loved it. I definitely have so much to return to this area of the US for, completely based off the brochures that Staci left for us. Not only was the house welcoming and cozy, but it was spacious and comfortable. Pretty much everything you have at home was provided for you. Couch blankets, extra pillows, tea kettle, even candy treats for my children, and so much more. The design of the home was thoughtful and yes, has a washer and dryer too. This was an excellent stay! Thank you Staci!"

2023-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"The Gathering Place was wonderful for our short two day stay there. Spacious and comfortable, with a full kitchen with many items stocked. The bed (we only used the king size) was very comfortable for the two of us. Our dog used the fenced yard and had room to roam. I'm sure that we'll stay again in the future."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"Came back to Staci’s for a second time and was just as great as I remembered it.
Thank you for having us! Super cozy and cute house."
2023-05-01,5,Group trip,The Gathering Place made us feel right at home. The attention to detail from the owners was impressive. All the little things were thought of in advance and we will continue to stay here in the future! Great place for families!
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This is a great place to stay- very clean, spacious and well stocked. We appreciated the dog door and fenced in yard for our dog - she enjoyed having the freedom to run. It is in a quiet location, where we could enjoy breakfast on the porch as we listened to birdsong and watched a vermillion flycatcher feed its baby. We would love to stay here again."

2023-04-01,5,Group trip,We stayed at the Gathering Place for just one night while on a west coast trip from NY and this was part of our plans to take my parents to Tombstone while in Arizona. We couldn’t tell much about the area because we came in after it was dark but we still loved how peaceful it was. The home is so cozy and Staci did such a wonderful job making sure everyone felt at home. She left us chocolates and the bathroom even had amenities that you wouldn’t even find in a hotel room. Beds were super comfy and we woke up to a beautiful view with birds chirping all around us. We had breakfast out on the front yard and we absolutely loved it. The Gathering Place has everything you would need and then some. Would definitely want to stay here again if we’re ever back in the area. Thank you Staci for being so thoughtful about your guests.
2023-04-01,4,Stayed one night,"Comfortable stay with 2 full baths which was nice. Older overall, but clean."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"Staci's place is incredible! She has thought of every little detail from available toiletries to clear instructions to little welcome gifts to snacks and coffee for the morning. She even has Tombstone on DVD in case you want to relive the drama after visiting the town! The rooms have everything you need, and everything was spotless! The yard is lovely, the front has an incredible view of the mountains, and the patios (front and screened-in back) are perfect gathering places. This is a great house for multiple people or families because there are so many living spaces to go to if you need a little alone time. Finally, Staci was so quick to respond! We felt really taken care of, and it was a wonderful stay!"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Great place to stay for Birding. Located on the south end of Sierra Vista close to all of the canyon sites, 10-15 min drive away. About 20 min drive from San Pedro River Preserve, and 50 min to Patagonia. Very quiet at night for a good nights sleep! I highly recommend staying here for birding! We saw vermillion flycatcher in the backyard :-)"
2023-04-01,4,Stayed one night,It was just like the description and we were happy with the property. There were ten of us and we had plenty of room.
2023-04-01,4,Stayed with kids,"Great place for a large group. I will say though that the beds have reached their prime and should be replaced. Some of the mattresses we down to the springs, one of the beds were bowed and one was rock hard. Overall it was a nice place and easy to get to. It was also a quiet area."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Not Staci's fault. The double needs to be replaced...soon...uncomfortable for our friends. Everything else was wonderful and up to expectations

The beds are comfortable, the sofas are great to lounge on, and there is plenty of room just for hanging out. The kitchen is well furnished so you can cook easily. The outside space is inviting. We all liked the mountain views and hearing the owl nearby. I hope to have a chance to stay here again."

2022-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,"What a wonderful place to call “home” for a week as our family got readjusted to the area after an overseas move. With 4 little ones they were desperate for comfort and The Gathering place provided just that and more!

The house is very well organized & decorated (including a Xmas tree & house decor) with a completely stocked kitchen to meet your every need, literally! Every little detail was thought of which I absolutely appreciate. Perfect house for family garherings including with a fenced in yard for the dog & fire pit, only 10 mins from Ft Huachuca.

They wrote us a personal welcome note with some chocolates and there was basics stocked in the bathrooms and kitchen. Things like LOTION which you might not think to pack if you aren’t from the desert. Also coffee with some paper cups in case you need to run. Seriously I don’t want to stay anywhere else."

Thank you Staci!"

2021-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,Had a great time at the location

2021-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This place is amazing! Our parents live stayed with my 2 sisters, 6 of our combined teen/young adults, and a toddler. Couldn't have asked for a better stay. Snacks, dishes, lots of space inside and out for everyone to visit or separate as necesary. Definitely better than getting everyone individual hotel rooms. Staci was very communicative and we felt very welcome!"

2021-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This house was perfect for our stay. We came to Arizona for my Daughter and Son-In-Law to get married. He is in the military, and this house was pretty close to his base. We had everything we needed here, plus extra things like, shampoo, conditioner, soap, and lots of other stuff. Really all you need to pack is clothes and phone chargers, lol."
2021-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This was our second time staying at Staci's place. The house is extremely comfortable and well-appointed for a family. We really appreciated the portable crib (a small pack-and-play type), the booster seat high chair, baby walker, and various other toys/items. Additionally, the hosts have screened in the porch since our first visit. We had a nice evening grilling and eating in the new screened in porch with views of the mountains. As before, the place was immaculately clean, the bed was very comfortable and there was plenty of hot water. There were also various extras that were much appreciated--a bottle of wine, box of girl scout cookies, etc. The cooling in the summer is via swamp cooler, so it's a bit humid but the temperature remained comfortable, especially with the ceiling fan in the master bedroom. We'd definitely recommend this house for a stay in Sierra Vista."

2021-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,The house was just what my family needed! we are on a 2 week road trip with 5 kids and 2 adults. the house was a great place to get a good night's rest. shower. eat. we enjoyed eating dinner out in covered patio with the lights. they have literally everything you might need. very clean. the only negative was the pull out couch was broken (both were) so we just had one of our kids sleep on the couch. no biggie but just incase you have a large group but it looked like there was a futon in the other sitting room. the bedrooms were very clean and nicely decorated. perfect location to to visit Tombstone! thanks for the great stay.
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Staci’s home was comfortable and provided everyone with room and privacy. You will love the quiet mornings out on the patio listening to the birds.

It's only a 30 minute drive to Bisbee, to Tombstone or to Sonoita. The house is clean, cool, spacious, and well-stocked with everything you need to have a great time. The full kitchen was spacious and the gas stove made cooking for ourselves very easy. We enjoyed our morning coffee on the back patio, watching the roadrunners and other birds, and enjoying the peacefulness. The next time we take a long weekend to go exploring in that part of the state, we will definitely re-book."

This place is very kid/family-friendly from the little plates I saw in the kitchen, to the play toys for the tub! Our main purpose was to hike. Many trails to take in all directions! We will book again!"
2020-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Staci was a pleasure to work with and her place was perfect for our needs. She had everything we may have needed covered and then some. I could not have been happier with this place.
2020-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,Our family of seven stayed overnight. Excellent communication: let us know when the house was ready and answered questions quickly. I would suggest checking in before you go grocery shopping because there is many amenities and food included. This added so much value when you want to cook here. Beautiful view of the mountains and lots of outdoor seating options. Would highly recommend staying here.
2020-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great space, Beautiful home very nice layout with all amenities you would need. Location is great, Outdoor area is a very nice touch and we really enjoyed sitting outside. Home away from home Would highly recommend and would stay again."
2020-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"My family and I booked The Gathering Place for the weekend exploring Southern Arizona and had such a great stay!
We loved the front porch swing and table at sunset and sunrise. The 6-year-old with us loved the big tv and floor space for dancing and playing. The kitchen was so well equipped and had everything the six of us needed to cook breakfast and drink many pots of coffee. There was even a coffee grinder! The well-stocked game cabinet turned out to be a great addition and we spent many hours playing and laughing.
Everything was super clean, easy, and comfortable. Thanks for the home away from home!"
2020-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Amazing stay! Highly recommend
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Absolutely incredible
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place was perfect for us. The house was immaculate with all the amenities you might desire, and plenty of space. It was quiet with a beautiful view of the mountains. As a serious amateur photographer, especially wildlife, I chose to come to Sierra Vista because it is one of the top three birding areas in the country. Lupita's place is convenient to all of the popular sites for birding. It took no more than 15 minutes to reach any of them, except for one that went up a mountain on a really rough road. But, no matter your reason for visiting Sierra Vista, I highly recommend this place."
2024-06-01,5,Group trip,"very lovely home and Lupita was easy to work with, very helpful!!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a very pleasant stay here. The home was clean, comfortably furnished and equipped with everything we could possibly need. It's on a large lot and felt very private. The neighborhood is quiet and the location is very convenient to shopping, restaurants, Fort Huachuca, and many hiking trails and birding areas. Communication with the host was great. Would definitely stay here again if our travel plans bring us back to the area!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed over a week,"This is our third time at Lupita's place and if we are coming to Sierra Vista, this is where we absolutely love to stay. Great access to trails and birding, everything is well stocked and Lupita is very responsive any time we have a question and the sunrises and sunsets from the upstairs bedroom are fantastic."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed over a week,"In the last few years we’ve stayed in quite a few Airbnbs and Lupita’s place is by far the nicest we’ve ever had. What a beautiful location, right on the edge of town next to the Hauchuca mountains. Hiking and biking trails everywhere. The house has absolutely everything you’d need for an extended stay. We stayed there 5 weeks and didn’t want to leave."
2024-01-01,5,Stayed over a week,"If you want to take advantage of birding, hiking and relatively easy access to the trails around Sierra Vista, this is your perfect place. Lupita has stocked the house with everything you could need for a stay and the upstairs bedroom is a scenic wonder. We have already reserved twice for 2025 and once more in 2024 we like the place so much. Lupita also responds quickly when you have questions or need any assistance."
2024-01-01,5,Group trip,"The house worked great for our 4 night holiday stay with family in Sierra Vista. Our stay included three adult couples, three generations under one roof, and everyone agreed the place cozy, clean & welcoming. The beds and linens were comfy and the kitchen was well supplied. We were able to walk a nice trail to Brown House from the house. Our granddaughter was pleased to find toys in the kids' closet & it kept her busy when she visited. We felt like we were staying in family's home as it was warm & accommodating and had everything we could ever need. Thanks Lupita!"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Of all the places we have stayed over the years, this was definitely in the top 3. The pics don't do the house justice. It was clean, updated and comfortable. The beds were comfy and warm, the kitchen was awesome and stocked with everything we could want. She even added some extra goodies that were appreciated and tasty.
Bathrooms were spotless and plenty of hot water for 3 adults. Bedrooms were good sized and super clean as well. The fire pit out back was nice even if it WAS a bit cold. lol. The neighbors were friendly and quiet and there were restaurants and stores within an easy drive.
Lupita responded quickly to our few questions (mostly about where to get something to eat) and was friendly the whole time. We would absolutely stay here again if in the area. We were in the area to check out Bisbee and are 100% glad we stayed here vs hotels. If you're looking, this is the place you want."
2023-12-01,5,Group trip,"Site was clean, close to my residence so that my children who occupied the facility had no problem meeting up with us for Christmas celebrations. I would gladly use this location again in the future. Lupita was courteous and helpful from start to finish."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful home, great views of the mountains, well stocked & host was communicative & helpful!"
2023-10-01,5,Group trip,Well located very comfortable. Very peaceful area.

2023-10-01,5,Group trip,"This place was exactly as advertised. Clean, spacious, and in a very quiet neighborhood. The morning roadrunners and night owls were a big bouns."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Lovely location near the mountains, quiet and very clean."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed about a week,"We were in town to attend Southwest Wings birding festival - our stay was a week. What a fabulous home. We felt right at home the minute we walked in the door upon arrival. As birders, we were super excited to see the wildlife in our own acre+ yard. The views of the mountains was spectacular - we were blessed to see a sunrise and the full moon setting one morning over the mountains with our expansive view. The neighborhood is very quiet and walk-able. Sierra Vista is not a humongous town so even though you are a little south of the stores/restaurants - it's only a few miles to get anywhere. Lupita has everything you would ever need - plus more - provided in the house. We only cooked one night but found everything we needed. The beds and furnishings are comfortable. The house is quiet and large enough for a few couples or a family to share. Again, Lupita goes above and beyond with what she provides for your comfort. We had a fabulous stay and would come back in a heartbeat!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The house was beautiful, comfortable and perfect for an awesome stay. The amenities were plentiful and everything and more we needed for our time there. First time with Airbnb, and I'm now a fan!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay and wonderful host
2023-07-01,5,Stayed about a week,"This is a really nice house with a host that makes sure you feel welcome. I was surprised how well stocked it was when I arrived. Again, Lupita wants to make sure you feel welcome. The reason I picked this place is because there are many bicycle and hiking trails nearby and because of the view of the Huachuca Mountains (the view from the 2nd floor balcony is simply amazing). And if you're a stargazer, this location will not disappoint. I'd definitely stay here again on future visits to Sierra Vista."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What a gem! We were so happy with the house, location, & many amenities. Lupita was a wonderful host & very responsive. She let us know we could check in early and finding the house was really easy. The property is in a great location, had great parking & it was lovely to watch the sunrise from the yard.
The house was incredibly well stocked with all kinds of special touches. We enjoyed the great kitchen, spacious bedrooms & patio space. Everything was very clean & we immediately felt right at home. I wished we stayed longer. Would highly recommend!"

2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This home is perfect!! Perfect location for family visiting Fort Hauchua. Lupita was an amazing host, very welcoming and responsive. The home has lots of amenities and was very nice. The neighborhood is very quiet and excellent for an evening stroll at sunset. The views of sunrise from the master bedroom was exquisite. We very much enjoyed our stay here."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed over a week,"We absolutely adored this house. The views, particularly from the second story master bedroom are fantastic and both being inveterate walkers had so many great places and trails to walk to directly from the house. The house was well stocked with basics which saved running out and buying things like toilet paper, dish soap, and laundry soap. The Wifi worked great and the place was very clean. We have already booked for next year and can't wait to get back."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,I am happy I chose this place. All in our group enjoyed the place. We will definitely choose the same place for our future visits. thanks once again.
2023-03-01,5,Group trip,"Excellent communication, well stocked kitchen, small snacks and coffee was so appreciated. House was clean and had everything for family meals and what we needed for our stay. We loved the backyard that was set up for family time around the fire pit after BBQ."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed over a week,Lupita’s place was great wonderful location and very private. Well stocked. Will definitely stay again.
2023-02-01,5,Stayed over a week,"This beautiful home in Sierra Vista is the most perfect place one could hope for. The house is large, private, beautifully decorated, spotlessly clean, and comfortable. Lupita is like a best friend, always caring, always available, kind, and compassionate. It is truly a relaxing vacation to stay here. We have stayed at her home in the past, and will continue to return year after year. I can't imagine a more wonderful place to be."
2023-01-01,5,Group trip,Loved our stay will be returning
2023-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Spacious, super-clean, and quiet - a perfect home base for our visit! Many thoughtful touches - a handful of breakfast and snack options for the first night’s stay, coffee choices, kitchen and bath essentials (including great towels!), extra pillows and linens, lots of snuggly blankets, and easy-to-use smart TVs. The house had a great setup for our group of 4 to spread out and each have our own space. Our host, Lupita, was also very responsive! I’d definitely recommend this property!"

2022-10-01,5,Group trip,"Great place to stay in Sierra Vista - very good location if you have a car. We loved that it's on acreage with a nice view of the Huachucas. We were in town for a funeral and loved that we could gather around the firepit on our last night and enjoy the fresh air after an emotionally exhausting week. The place is stocked very well in all the rooms and it definitely felt like a home away from home. We especially appreciated the supplied firewood, kitchen staples, and water bottles."

This place has all you could ask for and then some. Book your stay now. You will not be disappointed.

2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We truly enjoyed our stay here. We were in town for spring hummingbird migration and other birding experiences, and this was a wonderfully central place to stay. The house is exactly as described and shown in the pics, and very comfortable. The patio is lovely in the mornings and evenings, the balcony provides a fantastic view, and the neighborhood is extremely quiet. Bottled water in the fridge was a thoughtful touch. Highly recommended!"
2022-05-01,5,Group trip,"Beautiful house, very clean and in a quiet neighborhood close to town. Loved our stay."
2022-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"There aren’t enough stars to give to this place! Lupita’s home is not only spotless clean, unbelievably welcoming and cozy but she goes above and beyond by having a few snacks available and some bottled waters, coffee/tea/sugar/creamers and even some pancake and muffin mix available. These things are so nice especially after a long day of travel to actually be able to walk in and not have to immediately find a store just to have a few things. The kitchen has anything you would need to make any meal from the plates to the strainer to the cookie sheets and anything in between!
My husband myself and our 6&9 year old were here. We didn’t even use the upstairs at all since we didn’t want to have kids downstairs alone.
(that’s just us since unfamiliar area/people.... we wld do the same anywhere we don’t know). The downstairs bedrooms are so roomy and she has the greatest futons in each bedroom. Beds were so comfy even the blankets and pillows were super cozy.
How amazing that there was even shampoo and cond and body washes in the bathroom!
I could just keep going on here!
As far as I’m concerned Lupita is the gold standard for what AIRBNBs SHOULD be!
If you considering booking this place ...... just go ahead and do it.... you won’t be disappointed !!!"
2022-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"I love a well stocked kitchen. Had all the tools I needed for meal prep (can opener, peeler etc)"
2022-04-01,5,Group trip,"Do not miss this beautiful place! Peaceful, beautiful surroundings! Lupita's home is sparkling clean and stocked like a real home. Beautiful mountain views, quiet area, and lovely patio spaces. We enjoyed the fire pit each evening. Great location minutes from Ft. Huachuca, groceries, and restaurants. Lupita even graciously extended our stay when we realized our dates were off. Highest of recommendations for this host!!"
2022-03-01,5,Group trip,"Great views, great location, great price!!!"
2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Lupita's place is great. The location is private, and we really enjoyed the patio.
Inside, the furnishings are wonderful - had everything we needed to make our stay perfect. The entire place was clean and comfortable.
Although we didn't need anything during our stay, we felt as though Lupita was available via text or phone.
All in all, a great stay in a great location!"
2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We can't say enough about how perfect this Mountain View home was for our long-awaited (post-COVID) reunion with family. The home is so well appointed and stocked, that you feel like you've walked into your own family home not a temporary rental. The location has stunning mountain views on all sides and close proximity to a paved walking / biking trail which we enjoyed each morning.
Communication with Lupita was superb, and she had thought of every detail to make finding and staying at her home a pleasure. We have stayed at many Air BnB's all over US and abroad, and this is one of the best we've ever seen. If you have the opportunity to book with Lupita, don't hesitate. You'll be rewarded with a home-like, relaxing experience."
2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This entire home has good views, a well stocked kitchen, and lots of privacy. Lupita is a great hostess and very responsive in communications. The house was clean, comfortable, and located close to good birding spots while still not far from services in town. Worked out well for our family of four and we would definitely consider staying there again if back in the area."
2022-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,The house had a great layout and was very very clean. It had all of the amenities you could ask for or need. The house is on a large lot and while there are neighbors everything was very quiet. There were some nice views of the nearby mountains with snow. There are some nice outdoor features including a balcony for the master. Great place!
2022-03-01,5,Group trip,"We had an ideal stay at your home. All 5 siblings got together (from VT, PA, and AZ). We travelled to Hereford to spend some time with a brother in law’s family and the house was a perfect location. It is a beautiful home, so clean and the sleep arrangements worked well for the siblings to have comfortable beds. You stocked it very well and we were just thrilled with our visit and thank you for sharing your home with us. We will be back."
2022-02-01,5,Stayed over a week,"We spent two weeks here in Sierra Vista at Lupita’s house. It was even lovelier than the pictures. The house was clean, well stocked and had lots of privacy. Lupita was very responsive to our one small concern and it was fixed promptly. When we return to this area in the future we will definitely stay here!!! A 10 on our scale for AB&B’s!!!!"
2022-02-01,5,Stayed over a week,"This beautifully decorated, roomy, and very clean home in Sierra Vista is everything you will need for your stay. Lupita has done a wonderful job as a host, her home is fully stocked with everything you will need. The location is perfect , while private, very close to nature, food stores, restaurants, birding locations, and Fort Huachuca. The view of the mountains off the second floor balcony is breathtaking. Lupita is the perfect host, I highly recommend this home for your visit to Sierra Vista."
2022-01-01,5,Stayed over a week,Lupita is a great hostess. The house was everything she said it would be and we found it very comfortable. We loved the location and the quiet neighborhood. It has a country setting while being close to the center of town. We loved our stay and will be back in the future.
2022-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,everything is incredible Lupita is an excellent host :)
2021-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We really appreciated staying at Lupita's. She had a pack n' play ready for us to use. There are toys and kid books to help keep the kids occupied. We appreciated that she had things like soap for the dishes, and laundry detergent available so we didn't have to buy new items for just a couple of uses. The kitchen had everything we needed to prepare meals. Check out was easy. Lupita was friendly and helpful in our communications with each other. If we need to come back to the area, I would come back to Lupita's."
2021-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The house was very clean and organized. Anything you needed you could expect in the home. The kitchen especially was stocked with supplies. The area was very quiet with a gorgeous view. The owner was also very helpful, responsive, and friendly. Overall, the experience was very enjoyable and highly worth it!!"
2021-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is a very spacious house, with some great amenities including a gas grill in the back yard. There are great views of the mountains, and of the nearby military blimp. We found this a comfortable base for exploring the wineries, which are about 30-40min from Sierra Vista."
2021-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Lupita’ place is lovely. The pictures do not do it justice. Everything was exceptionally clean and well-stocked. It exceeded my expectations. My family will definitely stay here again if we are in the are.
2021-12-01,5,Group trip,Wonderful experience! The house was fully equipped with everything we needed – wonderful communication with the host – loved staying at this place!
2021-12-01,5,Group trip,"WOW!!! We rented this AirBnB for the purpose of a large family get together, and it did not disappoint in any way! Lupita was so thoughtful in the way she has the house stocked. We had plenty of cooking utensils, entertainment options, miscellaneous supplies… just about anything you might need and forgot to bring. She was also very available for any questions or special requests we had. The house is very comfortable and has a cozy vibe with a spectacular view of the mountains. We really enjoyed our time here."

2021-11-01,5,Group trip,"The host and home were wonderful. So many nice little extras - sewing kit, lint rollers, plenty of kitchen utensils and dishes. Felt like home right away. Instructions were very clear and tons of amenities. Close to town but still quiet. Would definitely stay again."
2021-11-01,5,Group trip,Wonderful place to stay with amazing sunrise views. Everything you need for a relaxing stay with family. Enjoyed the space for everyone to have some privacy.
2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,great home with beautiful views
2021-11-01,5,Group trip,Spotlessly clean. Plenty of extra bedding and towels. We really appreciated the extra pull out beds in every room. Also having some food and water bottles provided for us was a real treat after a long drive. The only thing I can possibly think of to improve our stay would be a small step stool for better reach. We would rent this Airbnb again.
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The house was amazing! So clean & very roomy. The master bedroom is the best part. Lupita was very helpful with everything needed. 10/10

2021-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,Loved the property. Beautiful view. Beautiful home. We’ll be back.
2021-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"I haven’t been giving reviews on the places we’ve stayed just because by the time we are home from traveling and usually exhausted, our lives get back to craziness and I just don’t have the time. I usually just tell friends, that we’ve had good luck with Airbnb. With that said, as I settled back into my own home tonite and thought how nice it was to be home and relax, I felt I really wanted to give Lupita a review. This home was just a beautiful place. Peaceful, comfortable, from the moment we walked in. Very spacious for my husband and I and two adult children that came with us. It was clean and smelled nice and Lupita had extra little amenities tucked everywhere. She really thought of everything that one might need while they were there. We had a couple of long stressful days of funeral services and this home was a place we could really just retreat to at the end of the day to relax and unwind. It’s in a wonderful location on the edge of town, so very quiet but yet just a very short drive to everything . I really felt at home here. We took a beautiful walk one morning and saw wild life and spent evenings in the private back patio looking at the mountains and sunset. I truly hope it’s available the next time we come to Sierra Vista. Definitely the best Airbnb we’ve stayed in."
2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Lupita’s place in Sierra Vista was clean, safe, quiet, and close to the base. We enjoyed all the extras including the beautiful sunrises and sunsets from the balcony."

2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Lupita was an excellent host! The house was very clean and worked perfect for our stay. The location is great, some of the best views in town, and still close to some good restaurants."
2021-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,Check in was really easy. House was super clean and smelled amazing! Close to tombstone and Bisbee. Had a really homey feel. Definitely will come back!
2021-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,This place was absolutely gorgeous. Lupita is absolutely a triple AAA 1 hostess. It could not have been any better. She had so many amenities and the place was sparkling clean and so comfortable I would recommend this stay for anyone!
2021-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Lupita was an outstanding host, the home was very clean, and had a lot of options for breakfast to get our morning started. The home is located in a quiet neighborhood, we enjoyed our stay and will be hopefully returning again soon!"
2021-05-01,5,Group trip,"A very nice place, clean, private, spacious and relaxing, if in the area again I would definitely try to book it again."
2021-04-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"The house was everything we had expected and more. The beds were comfortable. The kitchen was well stocked. It was very quiet and the location was perfect as a home base for our birding adventures on the West side of the Chiricahua mountains and the canyons around Sierra Vista. I took off one star because there were plug-in air fresheners placed in every room and hallway, which I was allergic to. Luckily we were able to unplug them and air out the house."
2021-04-01,2,Stayed a few nights,The unit was very clean and had everything anyone could need. The problem was the unresponsiveness of the host. We had no idea if we even had a place to stay until less than two hours before check in.
2021-04-01,5,Stayed about a week,The house is in a marvelous location on the edge of Sierra Vista with great sunrises and sunsets. It is perfectly located for hiking and birding in the local area-loads to do for at least a week. The house is well equipped and very comfortable. We particularly liked the upstairs master bedroom with its large picture windows and views of the mountains. Wonderful stay!
2021-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful home in a scenic area. Quiet, clean and comfy!"
2021-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful home situated in the mountains surrounding Sierra Vista. All the rooms were super spacious, and the home seemed much larger than described. All the comforts of home were intact, including large smart TVs in every room. Fire pit out back was nice for the cold Arizona nights. Everything about this place was so accommodating, and we really appreciated all the extra amenities."
2021-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,A great place to stay and very private
2021-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This residence made the trip extremely pleasurable.
2021-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This is by far the best airbnb my family has stayed in. Extremely clean, roomy, and comfortable. Thoughtful touches like snacks and water bottles. The bed linens and towels were soft and plentiful. My teenagers loved having their own rooms. We would definitely recommend this place. Local eats we enjoyed: Papa's 50's Diner and Vinny's NY Pizza."
2021-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Amazing house at a great price. Very easy drives to Benson, Tombstone, and Bisbee. Excellent host who is very responsive. We will definitely stay here again."
2021-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Lupita’s place was probably one of the cleanest AirBnbs we have ever visited. The towels and sheets were clean, fresh and in very good condition. The beds were comfortable there were so many sleeping options with the fold-out beds. The master bedroom gets bright, warm light all day with beautiful mountain views but all the windows have blinds to block it out if you need to nap. Lupita left a well-stocked kitchen and bathrooms. Everything we needed was provided. It’s a quiet neighborhood and Ramsey Canyon was less than 10 miles away. Easy check in and quick responses. We would definitely return!"
2021-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great Property
2021-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,My family had a wonderful stay at Lupita's Airbnb. The location was beautiful and very close to nearby canyons for hiking and birdwatching. She had really anticipated everything we might need and had it available in the home so the only things we needed to purchase were groceries. We will definitely be staying here again when we return.
2021-02-01,5,Stayed over a week,"Lupita’s place is very clean, comfortable & well stocked. Lots of homey touches. Plenty of good towels, bedding, pillows & blankets. Kitchen has all the necessities.

2020-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is possibly the perfect place. It's clean, comfortable, stylish, and picturesque. The house is at the edge of town at the base of the mountains. There are neighbors nearby, but it is nothing like suburbia. The outdoor spaces are well designed and maintained. Beds are comfortable. Towels are fluffy. There is a lot in the area to do, but my daughter and I also enjoyed binging on junk food and Netflix. Just a perfect little getaway with room for everyone."
2020-10-01,5,Group trip,"My daughters and I had a wonderful time! We enjoyed the extra item in the house. My girls were still able to work out on our trip away from home. We forgot a tooth brush and extras were available. Thank you for having items on site. Definitely a place to stay in Sierra Vista. The view was amazing. The room upstairs was warm during the day, but it did cool down some at night. I’ll definitely put this on my lists to visit again."

Well stocked pantry and very clean!!! Thanks Lupita"
2020-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,My experience was amazing. This was my first with a Airbnb and now I am a lifetime user.

Lupita and her husband were both friendly and compassionate for me and my family. They truly cared for the people. This was an amazing experience. They truly went over and beyound to to make our weekend enjoyable. They are super hosts. I will definitely use them again when I am in the area. Thank you Lupita for a great experience.

Everything was clean. Amazing amenities. Fire pit in the back yard. Master bedroom is to die for up stairs!! Everything about the house was great!!
2020-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The home was perfect! Lots of space for families traveling together. The listing said not intended for children but the host was easy to contact about questions as to why, and basically it was just to caution that there weren’t any safety features/child proofing in the home, having steps and stairs through out the home. Host was thoughtful and even left some snacks for the kids. We’re a military family and this would make an excellent tdy home that we would refer to our friends. Very clean and tidy, peaceful and quiet. The Mountain View’s were amazing!"

Hosts were very responsive when we had difficulty getting TVs to work for us and children. It was great having a BBQ grill and all the kitchen gadgets, utensils, cookware and dishes to use. We had Vinny's Pizza our first night and the pizza and antipasto salad was delicious!
We were in town to attend a special friend's wedding. We were also our recent nuptials and family fall break with our 4 year old twins we are adopting.
It was a special trip and I'm grateful to have found this beautiful home as we traveled around Arizona enjoying God's country."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"What can I say? Such a great place to stay, it’s better than the home we just bought! We were so comfortable and happy, even with 4 small kids and 3 adults. The kids loved the bunk beds and the backyard, and it was clean and spacious, plenty of room to play and watch tv in different rooms. We enjoyed the “mood lighting” and the beds were very comfortable. The kitchen was well appointed and large. We definitely hope to come back!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed over a week,"Casa Blanca is an amazing place!

The kitchen was fully stocked, we cooked multiple family meals and even ended up hosting Christmas dinner.
Jorge brought in a Christmas tree to help the home feel more festive for my 2 year old nephew, and the house was decorated for the holidays. There was a small snag prior to arrival, and Tessa worked tirelessly to come up with great solutions. Even the smallest details are important to Jorge and Tessa. This is THE PLACE to stay in Sierra Vista....10/10."

The place is well kept, updated, and has great accommodations. We had the things we needed while we were there.

Everything we needed was included: toiletries, plenty of towels, Netflix, info on what to do and where to go. Even things I didn’t expect like ice cube trays, batteries, and laundry detergent. All of the beds are super comfy and the pillows were the best pillows I’ve ever slept on lol. This place is 10x better in person. The photos don’t represent how beautiful the layout truly is.
Tessa is very responsive, accommodating and very kind which was refreshing. We will be staying here every time we come back to visit our family.
Thank you for such a great stay Tessa!"

2022-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This is hands down the best place to stay in Sierra Vista! We’ve been traveling here one-two times a year for 20 years. We’ve stayed a variety of places but now have found our home away from home.
The house is clean, bright, spacious and beautifully decorated. Small touches like corn hole, puzzles and games make for great family time.
Close to Fort Huachuca, numerous hiking options, the mall/movies and lots of restaurants but nestled in a very nice neighborhood.
We had zero issues. Our one request was handled immediately by Tessa. Hosts are very friendly and responsive.
We highly recommend this property for your visit."

2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Tessa and Jorge's house was perfect for our birding/sightseeing visit in the area. Communication was close to instant when we had questions.
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Really great place and even better hosts!
The house is very clean and nicely decorated to welcome you. We are actually looking to move to Sierra Vista and took a weeklong trip out, to make sure we like the area (coming from San Diego). We've scooted the area for property listings to buy and a rough idea what to expect. When we walked in my wife Jen said ""I want this one when we move here"" and I agreed.
It was just Jen and I on this trip, but this place would comfortably home a family. SV is a smaller community anyway, compared to what we are used to in San Diego, but everything is located close by. Read the other reviews and you will see that you will be happy here!"
2022-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We stayed here for our son's AIT graduation. The home was perfect for our family of 6. It was beautiful, clean, modern, and cozy! There was plenty of space for our family to hang out and watch movies. It was just minutes from Ft Huachuca."
2022-05-01,5,Group trip,"I had to book a house in southern AZ with very short notice for an unexpected family trip. I found Tessa & Jorge’s place & was thrilled. The house did not disappoint!

2022-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This place is amazing, and affordable. Don’t be fooled by the price it’s a top notch place. We have stayed in many Airbnb’s. This is very close to amenities. It is also very close to Ramsey canyon, Bisbee, and Tombstone. The hosts have thought of everything to make you have the best stay possible. The rental is super clean, tastefully decorated, spacious, and the furniture is very comfortable. You won’t be disappointed in this place I promise!!"
2022-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We had a fantastic stay at Casa Blanca - easily one of the top 3 Air BnB’s we’ve stayed in. We had 4 kids and 3 adults in our group and had plenty of space to spread out for down time as well as to gather together for a movie night or board games. The kitchen was well appointed - even having an ice cream scoop which we usually don’t find in Air BnB’s. The beds and pillows were comfortable, the temperature of the house was fantastic and the hosts were responsive and helpful.
We were in town to celebrate our son’s 9th birthday with a cowboy theme. We enjoyed going over to Wilcox and over to Tombstone. We even got to go to the batting cages, thanks to a tip about them in the guidebook when it rained and hailed the first day of our trip. We missed seeing several things on our list and are looking forward to coming back to explore more! Thanks again for everything!"
2022-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Great place for a family! If you find yourself in Sierra Vista, check this place out!!"

2022-03-01,5,Group trip,"Beautiful neighborhood, beautiful house! Comfy couches, entire house has been recently remodeled. We ourselves and our adult kids and a +one for a house of 6 and we were all very comfortable. Tessa lives close by and was able to pop over and get us some extra trash bags. We are Sierra Vista once or twice a year and if we bring a group, this will the first option for us."
2022-03-01,5,Stayed about a week,"This is a wonderful home with beautiful and comfortable surroundings. A very nice and quiet neighborhood to come back to each evening. I loved the location, and it was perfect for visiting my son and grandchildren who are stationed nearby at Fort Huachuca. Several Great hiking spots are very close. Grocery shopping trips were just a short drive away. Thoroughly enjoyed my stay here. Looking forward to coming back in the near future!"
2022-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,Gorgeous home that has been completely remodeled. All amenities you could need. Exceptionally clean. Host and Hostess were excellent.

Nice large bathrooms. The beds are extremely comfortable. The house is beautifully decorated and the neighborhood is quiet. Tessa was always quick to respond and friendly. We will definitely be staying at Casa Blanca again in the future.
2022-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Quiet, secluded neighborhood. Attention and care paid to every detail. For those who enjoy cooking, the gas stove is top notch. Great layout with many places to gather or curl up. Will give you ideas for what touches you might want to add flourish with to your own home. Whether watching amazing nature shows or old Westerns, the screens abound. Super clean and comes with a robot vacuum."
2022-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Decided to make a family trip to visit Bisbee, Tombstone, Tucson, and a few parks in the area. Casa Blanca is located within a comfortable driving distance to all these wonderful places. The house is absolutely clean, with a beautiful renovated interior, in a safe and amazing area. Great communication with the host. Highly recommended!"
2022-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,Comfortable beds and a well stocked kitchen. These are important things for me and this house hit the mark.
2022-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"A fantastic rental in a prime location in Sierra Vista. We stayed here for 5 days while bird watching in the area. The owners are extremely responsive answering all of our questions quickly and fixing a couple of minor issues the next day. Reservations and check in was easy. The house is newly renovated and beautiful! The kitchen is well equipped. Ice cube trays are available in the freezer as the refrigerator water and ice maker are not hooked up. There is every appliance that you would need and even storage containers for leftovers. TV is available but you must use your own streaming services and remember to delete the devices from your account. The location is great with grocery stores not far away and prime parks within short drives. The yard is all stone (arid area) yet corn hole game is provided for added fun. A great rental for a family or couples (3 bedrooms, 2 baths). We would definitely return."
2022-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Phenomenal home in a great neighborhood. Wouldn’t change a thing. Second time staying here and NOT my last.

2022-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Too much to say, this is a gorgeous home in a quiet neighborhood that has been beautifully redone. Jorge and Tessa were amazing hosts and thought of everything to make this a “home away from home.” This is definitely not my last stay at Casa Blanca. Thank you!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is a comfortable, well designed, peaceful place. The kitchen is fully stocked, the furniture is comfortable, everything is clean & uncluttered.

2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We are so glad we were able to stay with Sarah and Adam while visiting the area for a wedding. The cliff notes version of what we appreciated is still lengthy: proximity to wonderful trails, a very comfy bed, a well appointed kitchen, a squeaky clean space, and the super sweet four legged welcoming committee!"
2024-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had the most positive experience staying at Sarah's casita for four nights. She has thought of everything a guest may want or need for comfort and convenience. Highlights were the beautiful view, birds/wildlife (hummingbirds), Sarah's wonderful responsive hospitality, and most importantly: the resident dogs Barley and Alfie, who welcomed us and kept us company throughout our visit. It truly felt like a home away from home! We even enjoyed water from their new machine that makes water from the air (water vapor). We'll be back - THANK YOU - this is a Sierra Vista gem :) So much hiking nearby - We explored the Coronado Cave and hiked Miller Canyon this time around."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed about a week,"This was our second stay at the Casita, and it didn't disappoint. The location right off Ramsey Canyon Road makes a great base for hiking and birding nearby. The Casita itself is very comfortable and really well-equipped. One of the best Airbnbs, including the best kitchen, we've ever experienced. Really great views of the mountains and the valley. The hosts, Sarah and Adam, are very welcoming, helpful, and friendly. Their two dogs, Barley and Alfie, are cute, friendly, and a joy to interact with. We definitely hope to stay here again next time we visit the area. Thanks for a lovely stay!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Sarah’s casita is truly wonderful! It is beautifully decorated, completely outfitted with everything a guest could possibly need and spotlessly clean! All of the appliances are in excellent shape and looked new. In the kitchen and all over the casita, everything is clearly labeled for use so there was no need to fumble around looking for things. The casita has a very nice front porch that we loved. We sat there every evening with wine and cheese while we watched the hummingbirds and sunset.
Sarah is an outstanding host. She is a lovely person! We really enjoyed meeting her and Adam. She was very helpful and gave us recommendations for restaurants and grocery stores. We ate at 2 out of 3 of the restaurants she suggested and they were very good.
I highly recommend Sarah’s casita. We will definitely return in future trips."

We couldn’t believe how wonderful the casita was for such a low price."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Sarah's place is so very neat, clean and comfortable. We instantly felt at home. The fact that we felt safe and slept well says a whole lot 😊. Hopefully we will be able to return someday! Loved our stay and Sarah."

I loved the on-site wildlife and the view was amazing."
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Fantastic casita! The photos in the listing really don’t do it justice. The casita is super comfortable and very well equipped.

Everything was labeled so we could find anything we needed easily. The location of the casita was perfect...beautiful, quiet, but close to hiking, restaurants, and stores. The addition of our precious hosts, Barley and Alfie, was an unexpected pleasure! We are still talking about them....and missing them! We can't wait to return. Thank you, Sarah and Adam, for a memorable, enjoyable stay!"
2022-04-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"We came out to Arizona for our Niece's wedding. Also to visit our nephew and his new baby. The Casita was in a great location and reasonably priced! The scenery around the property was beautiful, and we saw a few different types of birds while there. The Casita was well stocked with everything you could need! The bed was very comfortable. The best part of our stay was our daily visitors, Barley & Alfie! Sarah & Adam have lots of knowledge on places to see or where to eat etc. Thank you again, Sonny & Krys Ouellette"

2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Extremely well-appointed, convenient, clean, and comfortable separate house on property. Sarah met us at check-in and was very nice, helpful, and informative. The place was in a quiet neighborhood and very convenient to access our places of interest, mainly canyon hikes and birding spots. Two cute little dogs that share the yard added amusement and were in no way a problem. The house lacked for nothing to make our stay comfortable and efficient. Highly recommend."

2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place was everything we wanted & more. I'll admit I was a bit nervous about the dogs before we came. I'm not a huge dog person, but Barley & Alfie are extremely sweet & easy to love. We enjoyed their company. Sarah & Adam are great hosts. They did a fantastic job stocking the casita & the labeled cabinets & light switches were helpful & every place should do that. :) The view of the Huachuca Mountains were wonderful. Thanks for the wonderful stay."
2022-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Sarah and Adam are thoughtful hosts who put care into every aspect of my stay. I didn't have to worry about arriving late because Sarah sent detailed self check-in instructions with photos.
The casita is the best stocked Airbnb I've ever stayed in. Tupperware for leftovers! Flashlights and gloves for exploring a nearby cave! Treats to bribe their delightful little dogs! A welcome basket of snacks! Tasty coffee beans! A fire pit with logs and firestarters! Bird feeders (one for hummingbirds) outside the windows! A shampoo/conditioner/soap dispenser!
The location is a quiet street on the edge of town with views of the mountains. I came to hike and the casita was a great basecamp to explore a surprising variety of trails and attractions."
2022-02-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Wow what a great casita! It’s super fantastic and I loved staying there. Because it’s usually a winter home for their parents, it’s super sweet inside the casita, and it has everything you might need. And I mean everything.
And I’ve never had hosts who are more likable and generally impressive than are Sarah and Adam. They are truly kind and they absolutely have their acts together. It was great meeting, and getting to know, them.
Highly recommend. No complaints whatsoever."
2022-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This listing is a gem! I couldn't recommend it more highly. Sarah is a gracious host, extremely helpful, very knowledgeable about the area. She responded instantly when I had to adjust my reservation dates. All communication was timely. She provided additional photos (illustrating the parking area and passageway to the back of the house) and driving directions the day before arrival. She greeted me on arrival, when I had a chance to make friends with Alfie and Barley, the two dogs.
The listing description and photos are completely accurate, concise and precise. If anything, the spaciousness and comfort of the casita are only better when you see them in person. A comfortable bed with plenty of blankets. A full kitchen with utensils/pots/supplies galore. A gorgeous bathroom. Instant hot water! A desk the size of a door. Travel guides, maps, birding books. A firm reading chair and footstool. And the views to mountains - in two directions - are magnificent. A quiet, peaceful, relaxing place to stay!
Business at Ft. Huachuca? Working on your screenplay? Studying for finals? Biking on or off road? Hiking the nearby nature preserve? Tracking birds? (I saw hummingbirds at the feeders). Exploring southern Arizona? Day-tripping to Tucson? Sarah's casita is for you!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"LJ’s house is situated in the center of town and you can walk to Memorial Park literally in 30 seconds. It was so nice to be close to the park as I was traveling with small kids and they loved it. The house itself was so well furnished and look so much better than the photos. If you want to be in a nice, clean house in a great location, THIS IS THE PLACE!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed about a week,Wonderful place and tucked away so nice and quiet. Super close to everything and within a couple of minutes of the Army Base.
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a very nice stay. If you’re looking for a resort feel, this will not be your place to stay. If you want a quaint, cozy, one-bedroom cottage, with all the amenities, this is your place! So clean and comfortable. Great shower!
We will definitely be back!"

2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"This was a great stay! The way the checkin instructions were formatted on Airbnb was different than I was used to (this is not a criticism - I just couldn’t find them!), so I messaged Allen and Priscilla and heard back from them immediately. They were excellent hosts. We had a quick one night stay in Sierra Vista and this place was perfect for us!"
2024-03-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"good space, the bed was not for our comfort. The bed dipped and sqeeked everytime one of us moved or got up so for light sleepers this can be a point of disturbance. From the pictures it was a little brighter and didn't show the cinder blocks which made the home feel on the colder side and less homey but overall that's personal preference. It was overall clean and great location. I would recommend!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Really cute spot, felt right at home, had everything one might need!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,Another gem! It’s absolutely wonderful how Allen & Priscilla think of everything to make your stay comfortable and hassle-free. Cute set up and what a bang for your buck!

2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,The place was very nice and clean
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This space is well laid out for a couple. The full kitchen is a plus. Even has a nice big thick cutting board. Didn’t try the AC but the two small electric oil radiant heaters worked well. A big plus is the walk in shower with endless hot water. The location right on a Main Street was sometimes a little hard to get in and out of, but the actual apartment entrance isolates from street noise. All in all a well executed and reasonably priced stay!"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We had a great stay! The instructions to get inside were very clear. Comfortable bed and it was a great space!
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The place is comfortable, location is kind of hidden and the parking space is a little inconvenient, other than that no complaints here."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Impressive! Tastefully decorated. Cozy and cheerful. Private and quiet. Great attention to detail with everything we needed to relax while visiting family. Very well appointed kitchen. Wonderful home away from home. We so enjoyed this place to bake cookies and assemble legos with our grandchildren. Allen and Priscilla have put a lot of thought and care into making this a lovely, comfortable space.
We did have trouble checking in due largely to being two old rustics unused to keypads, but Allen was available immediately by phone to talk us through it. He was very helpful and kind. Great host!"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Our staying was really good, we felt comfortable like in home and all details you add in the bathroom and coffee table was a plus for us. For sure we will stay again if we come back."

2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"A fine little place, an economical choice for a quick 3 day stay for the 3 of us (one using an air mattress). Would work even better for 1-2 people. As advertised, has a lovely kitchen and large refrigerator. Hosts were friendly and very helpful, even came over one evening to help with a flipped breaker. Happy to recommend!"
2023-12-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Very quiet place with good amenities. A bit chilly as only two portable radiators to heat the place, but was enough."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Allen and Priscilla are wonderful hosts!!! Their place is comfortable and cozy and super clean!!! We would stay there over and over! Highly recommend
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,perfect little cozy place. check in instructions were very clear. Clean space with all the amenities are needed. easy parking. 100% would stay again. thanks so much!
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great host, the place was a little bit difficult to spot at first but other than that, I felt right at home."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"Priscilla and Allen were excellent hosts, everything was just like in the pictures, so cozy that you felt at home, I would definitely stay again."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,Great stay! Great air bnb
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great location in Sierra Vista. Off a main road but quiet. Had everything we needed and loved the recommendation book on the table. Would stay here again.
2023-11-01,5,Stayed one night,Allen and Priscilla's apartment was a comfortable stay. Had all that we needed and it's a nestled place in which you felt safe. We had a high school mountain bike race to attend in Fort Huachuca which made it very convenient that the apartment was so close. Will definitely stay again if it's available.
2023-11-01,5,Stayed one night,Great little apartment
2023-10-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Private parking right outside of a locked front entrance (appeared to be shared with 1 other unit). The step by step instructions/ photo allowed easy self check in. The residents of the next unit will walk by the 1st patio when getting into their unit. However, there is a bamboo private screen/wall between the 2 units. Our patio was peaceful and private. The 1 bedroom apartment was quiet, private and had everything one needed for a very comfortable stay. A true home away from home. Allen and Priscilla were also kind enough to receive a small package on my behalf and to drop it off for me during our stay.
They were welcoming and went above and beyond.
I will definitely stay with them again. Highly recommend!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great private place, very clean and cozy. Definitely would stay there again.
Hosts very responsive and friendly."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Clean, quiet, and hosts were very responsive! Enjoyed the stay!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed about a week,"If you plan to visit Tombstone, Bisbee, or Benson this is the place to go. Restaurants close by, Dollar tree within walking distance, peaceful very comfortable. If you just need a getaway this is the place to go. Perfect for a couple."
2023-10-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Overall, I think they did the best you can do with this setting and small apartment. It is clean inside and they have everything you could need minus a washer and dryer. Overall for the price I think it is good value. Our only complaints are that the AC does not go in the bedroom and there was a musky smell in the apartment. The entry to get to the apartment is compact and next to a busy road, but the apartment is quiet and you don’t hear too much. I think it is priced right, and the hosts are very responsive and helpful."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,What can I say Allen and Priscilla was there for all our needs as our situation was very unique since we just at moved to town. They were very accommodating and helpful. All three of their rentals were great.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,These folks were amazing and so so helpful. Would definitely stay again ❤️
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This is the second time I’ve staid at Allen & Priscilla’s place. It’s a very convenient location and comfortable. They’re very quick to respond to any questions and very helpful if you need anything.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful place, very clean, and private.
They were very helpful with directions. I had a small issue finding the air bnb at first. The listing did not describe the area into the air b n b well.
However they were super helpful!
The directions they did provide in the listing helped, just wasn’t super clear on the location exactly.
Once again super clean and private perfect for someone like myself."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great second visit. Very convenient to get to my mom’s house down Fry Blvd. The hosts are responsive and very nice. Clean place and easy check-out instructions.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed about a week,We absolutely loved our stay. Location was perfect for our needs and close to everything. The place itself was spotless and welcoming. I will definitely look to book this again next time i’m in town.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Hosts were super helpful. Feels private but right on the main street, so super close to everything. Was exactly what I needed. Thoughtful amenities. Excellent heat and water pressure in the shower!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay while I visited family.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Priscilla and Allen's place, Sunshine Point, was an excellent place to stay. It was very clean, well kept, easy to find, and a great centralized location for anything you need in Sierra Vista and the surrounding area.
Priscilla and Allen are very kind, prompt, and responsive. They went above and beyond to make sure we had a wonderful stay. They even have a booklet with different recommendations for the area, which was nice!
We highly recommend them as hosts and had a great overall experience at Sunshine Point."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"Sunshine pointe was a great place to stay for my quick trip. I will say though, that I was surprised by the location. It is right off of a busy street and behind a business complex. As someone who was staying alone and not very familiar with the area, I felt a little exposed to be the only car in the parking lot with lots of cars and pedestrians around. However, once inside the gate you do not feel like you are off a main road. It was quiet and peaceful. Allen and Priscilla have done a great job with the space and were very communicative."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Sunshine Point is such a peaceful, private, tucked away retreat! Everything was perfect! Comfy bed, clean spaces! Even some cold water bottles waiting for us in the fridge! Thank you for that thoughtful touch! We'll be back!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Cute little place close to Fort Huachuca. The little apartment was perfect and close to all the cute little restaurants. Priscilla and Allen have the place looking great. Thank you

2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay and great hosts!
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"The apartment is nicely set up and tidy inside as well as outside. Things I appreciated most included a spacious shower, a comfortable bed, and a cozy atmosphere. The location is terrific with several restaurants within walking distance. This was my first visit to Sierra Vista and I thoroughly enjoyed myself."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I stayed at Allen & Priscilla’s Air BnB over the memorial weekend with my boyfriend. From the beginning, Priscilla was communicative and responded quickly. She accommodated our check in time, which we appreciated very much. The apartment was exactly what we needed, perfect for a couple or somebody traveling alone. Since our main interest was visiting Tombstone, I can’t say much about what to do in Sierra Vista, but the apartment’s location offered privacy and was close to gas stations, grocery store, Starbucks and a few fast food and non fast food restaurants. The apartment itself was very clean and offered many amenities. Overall, it was very comfortable to stay in. Thank you Allen & Priscilla!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed about a week,I cannot say enough about these wonderful hosts. Great communication. They went above and beyond to make it a great start.
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,Great hosts. Nice space close to everything. Rental had everything you could need and more. I definitely recommend this Airbnb.
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"The hosts, Allen & Priscilla, communicated so well. Their detailed instructions made a late night check-in very easy, and a warm lamp glow welcomed me into the home. It was pristine, spacious, comfortable and well-appointed. I sank into the soft bed and immediately fell into deep sleep. My only regret is that I couldn’t stay longer, as this place is quite a gem. The hosts obviously put a lot of thought and care into creating a home-away-from-home."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,Great place would recommend!
2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,Owners are fantastic. Easy to work with and very responsive.
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Cute place! Very convenient for me during my stay. I met the owners and they’re very nice and responsive. I felt safe with three sets of locks between street and my room (door from parking lot, metal mesh screen door, door to room). Very clean and they thought of everything! Thanks so much for the stay. I’ll be back."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,Great stay
2023-04-01,5,Stayed about a week,"A great base for exploring Sierra Vista and beyond. Quiet, secure and yet central, the location is hidden away from the main road, with a lovely sun trap for sitting outside. Allen & Priscilla were lovely and we had several chats over the days I was there. Spotless property, everything you could need for a week’s stay."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Very private, amazingly clean, easy to get into and had great instructions to get in."

The place was amazing with the amenities like kitchen, microwave, hair dryer, Wi-Fi, television, shampoo, body wash and conditioner. This little oasis was a true gem 💎 to stay at and I wish I could stay longer. I would stay again. They genuinely care for their guests and put a lot of thought in their Airbnb. I was impressed with their kind hospitality. Thank you."

2023-02-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"The location was good because it is close to several nice restaurants. Especially liked Wanderlust Coffee house. The apartment was quiet because it's set back from the busy street. We appreciated the full kitchen supplies.
When we reached out to Allen and Priscilla with a question about the apartment, they responded immediately and offered a good solution. They were great hosts!"
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,An extremely clean and comfortable apt.- comfortable furniture and bedding. Fully stocked kitchen with coffee and snacks. Quiet because it's behind a business and the street noise. Very convenient to all the stores in town. A much better place to stay and more spacious than a motel room !!
2023-02-01,5,Stayed one night,.
2023-02-01,4,Stayed over a week,The outdoor area was lacking but the apt. was good and had everything we needed. They were helpful and took care of everything that came up.
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We loved our stay in Sierra Vista! This is a great central location for visiting tombstone, Bisbee and hiking in the area. Allan and Pricilla are lovely hosts. Their place is very cozy, nicely decorated and well equipped. If you’re planning on doing the Queens copper mine tour which is excellent, then make sure you book online ahead of time! Coronado monument is a must! Amazing view at the top!"

Thank you for creating a home away from home for us."
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Allen & Priscilla's place was small and quaint. The location was perfect. We had a family member at the Fort Huachuka and it was very close for them to come over and visit. The directions for check in was spot on. We walked in and it was cute. There's a patio that we sat out on in the evening. The scenery wasn't the best, but that didn't bother us. Many close restaurants with in a couple of block's. This place has everything we needed. We didn't cook while we were there but it appeared the kitchen stocked. Allen and Priscilla's place was very clean. If I were to go back to Sierra Vista I would stay here again."
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The space was perfect for us on our visit. I had room to visit with my son, daughter in law and baby granddaughter. I also had plenty of space and comfort for working remotely when time permitted. Only my second time in the area but with a new grandbaby on the way I will be back and this will be place I stay!"

2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Stayed in Sierra Vista for a few days to visit my sister and Allen and Priscilla’s place was absolutely perfect!

I will definitely be staying here again if I get another opportunity to visit Sierra Vista.
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We were in Sierra Vista for a few days to see our son graduate at Fort Huachuca. Allen and Priscilla's place was exactly right for our stay.

2022-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"Sunshine Point is such a sweet, tucked away, private retreat! The colors, layout and decor felt fresh and inviting. Nice cold A/C unit and beautiful full kitchen. In the bathroom we loved the surprising, roomy full-sized shower. Slept comfortably all night!
Such great hosts! We will definitely be back!"
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Sunshine point was a lovely place to stay. It was well stocked with all the comforts of home. It was clean and easy to navigate from start to finish. It's obvious lots of time, thought and love were put into this cute little space. We travel to Sierra Vista for work on occasion and fully intend to book again. Thanks Allen & Priscilla for making our stay comfortable, clean and affordable!"
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Interesting location and the process you go through to access the apartment. My husband is a big guy so there is one lane walking traffic from your vehicle to the apartment. There are no stairs, just a super narrow walkway. The inside looks newly remodeled. We had what we needed as there were lots of provided amenities. The outside area was decorated to make for sitting outside comfortable. No views of the surrounding mountains, however. Maybe a mural of mountains could be painted on the brick wall. The inside is cute and comfortable. I'm just not sure how the entry and outside area could be more inviting, albeit, they are trying to have it be an inviting area. We had a bit of a problem with the TV receiving a signal, but worked through it with the host. It seemed quiet for being located a little ways back from the busy street. I guess we would stay there again"
