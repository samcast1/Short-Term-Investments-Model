2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"The perfect AirBnb -- clean, quiet, fully equipped, overlooking a rapid river that lulls you to sleep. And more important, the perfect AirBnb hosts: Friendly enough to invite you to dinner with friends and even go out for a night on the town (where the host himself took over the microphone and played a few tunes).
I'll be back."

2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"A truly wonderful Airbnb experience with two of the nicest and most welcoming hosts I’ve ever met.
Tom and Carol greeted me right when I walked through the door & made me feel at home immediately. They are warm, welcoming, friendly, and made great conversation. I stayed here for a WFR course I was taking at the Mount Hood Town Hall. It was the perfect location between there & Hood River itself.
The suite is sparkling clean and perfectly cozy. I couldn’t have asked for a better place to come back to after spending all day fixing pretend broken bones in the cold. The bed is SUPER comfortable & I slept better than I do at home. The whole place is just so cozy, calming, and warm.
Thank you, Tom & Carol, for making my stay so wonderful. I hope to be back soon. Highly recommend this Airbnb. 15/10 ⭐️"

The river is right outside your door with a cozy covered patio. Tom and Carol are wonderful hosts who take great pride in the beautiful home they built.

2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Two of the kindest Airbnb hosts I have come across. The place is really beautiful, plenty private for being a suite inside the house, and comfortable.

My highest recommendation and I hope we can stay with them again someday!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,Great little spot in hood river!
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,The house is absolutely gorgeous and right on the Hood River! The apartment was private and very clean. The bathroom was super nice. We would definitely stay here again!
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,Had such a lovely stay! We really enjoyed this peaceful area and beautiful view of the river. Tom was a very friendly and helpful host! Would definitely come stay here again.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"this was an absolutely beautiful place, both inside and out. the outdoor patio was a lovely place to rest and read while listening to the peaceful sounds of the Hood River running just behind the property. inside was clean, comfortable, and spacious. I felt right at home and slept very well. the hosts were very welcoming and fun to talk to! the kitchen was great for making coffee and reheating leftovers and enjoying a peaceful morning. the Internet was good for a bit of remote work before I started my day. this place would also be good and fun for a small family to stay because of a cute children's bedroom camping-cabin style. I can't wait to come back next time I'm staying in the area."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"Tom & Carol's place was a beautiful place to stay for the night. we enjoyed having a glass of wine on the patio overlooking the river. They definitely put a lot of attention to detail into the place as well. Loved the kcups that not only had coffee, but hot chocolate and tea as well. The towels were oversized which was really nice and everything was extremely clean. Very quiet and peaceful. Was neat to see the ""kids area"" which was a couple beds off the kitchen in a ""hidden closet"". Price point was awesome for what you get at this place. If you are on the fence about renting this place, just do it. Pictures don't do it justice for the ambiance and homey feeling you get here. We would definitely stay here again!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Tom and Carol are gracious and welcoming hosts. We enjoyed their lovely Airbnb and relaxing on the patio which is located by the river. It's an easy drive into Hood River or to wineries, orchards, distilleries on the Mt Hood Fruit Loop. The space is very comfortable and well-equipped. We'd highly recommend a stay with Tom & Carol!"

2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"Our stay with Tom and Carol made our one night in Hood River a truly memorable experience. Tom was. quick to respond to messaging, and Carol greeted us when we arrived and made us feel right at home.
Their local recommendations were perfect. Tom, thank you for sharing your talent (Hallelujah), and thank you both for the wonderful conversation. We will be back."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Tom and Carol are great hosts, very genuine and friendly, even picked us some apples and pears. The grounds are fun and beautiful, as well. Their attention to detail goes above and beyond. They are there if you need them, but really unobtrusive and allowed us much privacy. The house is a beautiful setting, and the apartment is clean, comfortable, and has everything you might need and all that was promised. Very comfortable in the 90 degree heat. Tom and Carol were very gracious about seeing that anything else needed was provided. Being able to start the day with the sound of the river and sitting outside near it was perfect. The house location is near to the town of Hood River, White Salmon, etc, but the location makes you feel miles away from civilization."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Tom and Carol's place is comfortable and quiet. Located right on the actual Hood River with a spacious outdoor living area, this space is perfect for hanging out with friends or just relaxing. Tom and Carol are very friendly hosts and allowed us to explore their private orchard and try some delicious fresh fruit.
The indoor space is cozy and clean, and the bed is comfortable.
Don't forget to stop at the Apple Valley Country Store just down the road for a huckleberry milkshake."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great place right on the Sandy river. Very quiet and peaceful, but not too far from Hood River."

2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"The place was pristine and comfy. There are many amenities in the kitchen and in the bathroom. The hosts were extremely friendly and gave great local recommendations for hikes! The hosts were also very helpful as they showed us how to use appliances in the room. The place is just a short drive from stores and the Walmart, as well as restaurants and local gems. It is also close to Mt Hood. It was quiet, peaceful, and relaxing. We enjoyed our stay and would come back again!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"Tom’s place was a perfect getaway. The river is so beautiful and serene, and he was so friendly! Also, Tom has great suggestions for local stuff (Bette’s Place for breakfast!). I’ll definitely be back."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"One of my favorite Airbnb’s I’ve ever stayed in! The hosts were so nice and welcoming, and I could have sat in those chairs listening to the river all evening. Thank you for the great stay!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Suited us perfectly. Beautiful riverside place. And, we’ve never stayed in a cleaner place!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,Beautifully designed and laid-out suite. Tom & Carol were very welcoming and the place was comfortably stocked. They were accommodating with our late check-in time. Great value!!
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,We thoroughly enjoyed our stay. It was even better than we expected! We want to return someday when back in Oregon.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"Tom and Carol provided the best experience. Their home is beautiful and comfortable, and they are friendly, helpful, and welcoming. We definitely want to return someday!! It is clear that they enjoy hosting by their efforts to make our stay the best possible experience; they have thought of every detail!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Just a beautiful location near Hood River and in the middle of the Fruit Loop. The sound of the river made it really peaceful and Tom was great as a resource for everything in the area. Great getaway. We were here for a wedding and couldn’t have picked a better spot to stay.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Tom and Carol are excellent hosts. They showed us around the apartment to make sure we understood how to operate everything. The apartment is well appointed. They invited us to sit by the river and use the grill if we wanted. The bed was comfortable. The towels are large and soft. The kitchen has a microwave oven, refrigerator and a nice coffee maker. Tea, coffee, salt and pepper are in the kitchen."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was one of our best Airbnb’s to date. The attention to detail that Tom has used putting this studio together is incredible. They have not forgotten any detail. Everything is there that you would need. We were greeted at arrival by Carol and Tom making us feel right at home. Conversations with both of them were excellent and we look forward to having a lasting friendship. If you were looking to stay in the hood river area, look no further for 12 or even maybe a couple of kids included. This is the place for you. There are abundance of fruit trees on the property, there is a fruit stand at the end of the road, there’s a river that runs right behind the house that is very relaxing. We can’t wait to come back and spend some more time in this area and time with Tom and Carol. What a great day didn’t want to leave."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"we stayed just one night for a wedding at mt hood organic farms and immediately said to each other that we have to return again soon to do a long weekend in hood river.
tom and carol are two of the nicest most hospitable and personable airbnb hosts we've ever encountered. even though we were barely there they made us feel so welcome and i could tell that if we'd been visiting for longer they wouldve been so helpful with tips on how to best enjoy the area.
even though the kitchen doesnt have a cooktop the grill under the cozy covered patio would make staying for 2-3 nights easy for still being able to cook meals there as opposed to always having to eat out.
carol was so kind by letting me borrow a pair of socks as i'd (stupidly) forgotten to pack the pair i had for the wedding in my overnight bag.
we cannot say enough good things about this space that is so well taken care of and is 100% pristine.
plus its location is perfect with easy access to places whilst being quiet and private."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"Tom and Carol are such kind, gracious, and attentive hosts. Their beautiful and spacious apartment is immaculate, cozy, inviting, and well equipped with everything. It was a haven of peace and tranquility, and it was the perfect place to land and feel renewed after a long day of travel. I slept so well and woke up feeling refreshed. They went above and beyond to make me feel welcome (including picking me up!). I enjoyed talking with them, and in addition to sharing their experiences in a genuine and heartfelt way, they were also interested in learning about me. They took the time to connect and make me feel at home. I am grateful and would love to come back. They are lovely people offering a serene space in a gorgeous setting. I am deeply grateful!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Such a nice and cute place to stay! Very friendly and great recommendations for food, hikes, anything."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"Lovely, quiet spot on the Hood River. Hosts were super and had great food recommendations! Spotless room, plenty of privacy."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"I stayed in Tom & Carol's guest suite while exploring Mount Hood and Multnomah Falls. I chose it because it was the only affordable accommodation for me in Hood River, but the cleanliness and comfort of the suite added to my first ever Oregon visit. Bed was very comfortable. Bathroom was nice with hot shower after long day of driving. Tom and Carol personally greeted when I arrived early evening and gave a tour of the suite. I highly recommend this stay to anyone visiting the area."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"This was a lovely, quiet, very comfortable place to stay. We had a quick visit but hope to be back in the not too far future for an extended trip! Tom and his wife were extremely nice and despite our short stay, gave us some recommendations we could fit in. The surroundings were absolutely beautiful."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"We absolutely loved Toms place, beautiful surroundings on the river, gorgeous room with everything one needs, friendliest hosts, peaceful, amazing gardens with fruit, can’t say enough, we will definitely be back, would have stayed longer but already booked:))"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The Hood River Apartment is an excellent place to stay while in the Hood River community. The apartment is located on the Hood River and there is a quiet place by the river sit and read in the shade. The apartment is everything a traveler could want; spacious, clean, lovely setting, quiet, relaxing, full of amenities, comfortable bed, and a special place for children to play and sleep. The hosts are friendly, helpful, and live on the property. In fact, the apartment is on top of the garage of the host's house.
We have friends in Hood River and plan to return. We will definitely stay in the Hood River Apartment . In fact, if the apartment is already booked, I would reschedule our trip so we can stay there."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"I only wish I'd been able to stay longer to enjoy the beautiful spot! Very comfortable, convenient, and lovely with several outdoor spaces to enjoy. Cute decor, useful kitchenette amenities, and adorable, creative use of space for kid's sleeping area. I would definitely stay again."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Loved staying here! Felt like I was in the countryside but was only 10 minutes from nice restaurants. Comfy bed too! Tom and Carol are super friendly - felt like home.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a wonderful time at Tom & Carol’s place. We felt right at home thanks to their warm welcome, the great conversations and many local tips. The apartment was beautiful and spacious, and had everything we could possibly need. We especially loved the patio at the river with BBQ and the peaceful surroundings. We would absolutely stay here again and hope to return one day!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Wonderful stay! Very affordable especially for all you get, and such beautiful, peaceful location."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,This was a great place to stay during our Hood River Fruit Loop trip and I would recommend it to others. It’s on the loop next to one of the farm stand stops with the Hood River right behind the house. The hosts greeted us when we arrived (a first for me!) and showed us the space. They were very friendly and welcoming. The space was clean and cute and had everything we needed during our one night stay. The “bedroom” was more than big enough for a queen size air mattress that we brought with us for an extra bed. Lots of little homey touches and a very easy check in/out process.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great stay at Tom’s place, only complaint is that I wish I was staying longer to explore the surrounding area more! Easy to find and enter, and Tom is great to speak to with plenty of information to help during your stay."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"This place is very clean , nice and warm welcoming by Tom and his wife, Hood river is at the back of his house . He also provide good recommendation for my next trip at Mount Hood . Everything is nice . Thank you so much, i’m sure to highly recommend this place .
Thank you so much
Tanasit"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Carol and Tom greeted be upon my arrival. They were super nice and showed me around the room as well as “how to’s”.
I felt very comfortable and their home is beautiful!
The room was clean, organized and literally had everything that I needed.
The bed was so comfortable and their shower also amazing! Very quiet and I had no noise issues.
Very peaceful area which is what I like. I really appreciate that pets aren’t allowed in the space.
The owners had great restaurant recommendations. Everything is very close 10-15 minutes from wineries and downtown. Honestly, one night wasn’t enough!
Overall, I was very happy and pleased with my stay. Definitely one that I’ll be keeping on my favorite list for when I head out to HR again. Great space, great room and friendly hosts!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Very cute guest suite in a very cute area! Best bang for your buck. Tom & his wife were wonderful hosts and welcomed us to their home and gave recommendations for places to eat in town. Clean, cozy, and has all the amenities you could need. Highly recommend and would love to come back."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Tom and Carol’s checkout motto is “just leave!”. That is so funny because A. They’re such welcoming hosts, and B. You’ll really want to “just stay”! So clean and well maintained, we felt like their first guests. Beautiful suite in a lovely property, beautiful location, warm hosts who personally greeted us, showed us around, and gave local recommendations. The private patio is gorgeous, as is the river overlook. Mattress is a supportive cloud. A little bright in the morning if you’re a sleeper-inner, but WHATEVES, you won’t want to sleep in here… too many things to do and see. Wonderful value, no service or cleaning fees, and you have to do NOTHING at check-out, “just leave”. Then you’ll want to come right back"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was a repeat visit for me. Tom’s place is beautiful, comfortable, and a great value. Highly recommended."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Comfortable, clean and overall great place!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great, peaceful spot in the Hood River. Spacious!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We chose this place because we had a wedding to attend to in the area and it has great reviews. But the experience was so pleasant and I’d love to come back again soon for a quick get-away. The kitchen and bathroom are on the same floor which made everything so easy. The river’s right outside the door. Staying for 2 nights wasn’t enough! It was very clean and small decors here and there were so cute. The kitchen has everything and they provide so many towels! We didn’t use that many but it was nice to have them. My hubs and I will definitely come back. Thank you Tom for the great space! :)
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"Tom's place was fantastic! Great location, super clean, and peaceful . Tom and Carol were great hosts, you can tell they put a lot of thought and care into this place! The property was beautiful and the apartment had everything we needed. The bed was super comfortable which was very nice after a long day of hiking! We very much enjoyed our stay and would 100% stay here again!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,Wonderful location and very comfortable. I highly recommend this place. I’ll be going back.
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"We had a quick trip to Hood River for a wedding and it was the perfect place to stay! It was cozy, clean and the bed was so comfy. Tom was there to welcome us and show us around and gave us a great recommendation for breakfast! Very quiet and peaceful but still very close to the downtown area."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"Such a beautiful setting! We felt so privileged to sit by the river on a private patio. Gorgeous house, stunning location, and super friendly hosts. Thank you Tom!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,Fantastic hospitality!
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,Wonderful location. Very nice home.
2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"Tom and Carol have put a lot of thought and care into this apartment. It is well designed and has a lots of fun and creative touches, including a kids sleeping area and skylights with tree views. It is in a beautiful location near orchards.
I had a short stay, but they greeted me right away and showed me how to use everything in the apartment. This made it easy to relax and settle in right away. The kitchen and bathroom were well supplied and I didn't need anything that wasn't already there.
It was a special treat to sit on the patio and watch the river in the evening."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great stay! Love the beautiful setting, openness of the main room and separate entry. Everything was super clean and the bed was very comfortable. Loved the shampoo & conditioner provided as well. Very nice hosts and will definitely book again with them when in Hood River in the future."
2023-04-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Comfortable place with very friendly hosts, a lovely bathtub, and great mattress. Private entrance from the outside. Close river views and plenty of space for one or two people. Hood River is a wonderful spot to explore with lots of activities close by (by car), and a rich history. Heads up: there is no stove and no coffee maker that takes ground coffee. Cooking option is the microwave. They do have a coffee pod-machine. The apartment is separated from the main house with a cool sliding barn door, and while the design of the apartment is cozy and well-done, I could hear the hosts. They were super nice and considerately quiet, so it wasn't a problem, but there was more shared soundscape than I anticipated. I highly recommend this place for anyone who wants a good base to explore the area from, and who enjoys engaging with their hosts and learning about the area. Tom and Carol are a wealth of knowledge."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Very friendly and welcoming space! I had an excellent experience. They are just out ofntown enough to get privacy and quiet, but close enough to get everything you need. Bed was super comfy and may have prevented me from hiking more because I was relaxing!! Highly recommend!! Thank you!!!"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Tom and Carol where outstanding hosts. While we need not need any assistance during our visit, we knew that Tom and Carol were there eager to help if needed. Tom and Carol are very friendly and welcoming while also giving guests their own space. Beautiful location above the river."
2023-03-01,4,Stayed about a week,"Tom and Carol are very nice folks. The place is impeccably clean, and Carol’s attention to detail really shines through with all the little touches she includes to make your stay comfortable. It is a lovely place for a great value!
Head’s up though: it is a barn-door style door which separates the staircase to the guest suite from the hallway which leads to their main living area. This barn-door style doesn’t fully close onto a door jam, so it does not make much of a sound barrier. Tom insisted that they couldn’t hear anything, but then also happened to mention how much I work, so, had to have been over-hearing that I was in meetings.. If you are a remote worker who needs to be able to take calls privately - the only room with a full door is the bathroom."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Delightful stay! The place was well furnished and very clean - enjoyed the setting by the Hood River and the hosts were friendly and helpful
2023-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"Close to Mt Hood and Hood River. Beautiful setting.
One unique thing is that there is a barn door style closure that does not lock. The entry connects the stairs to the apartment with the hosts living area - you can hear them and they can hear you;-)
Not bad, but not a completely separate entrance."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"Beautiful apartment upstairs in a lovely home right on a river, an amazing spot. Spotlessly clean, every little detail covered. Lots of light, comfortable bed. Met Tom & Carol, they couldn’t be nicer or more friendly. Wish we could give more than 5 stars. We’ll be back."

2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Tom's place was a very affordable and comfortable stay for a long weekend! The kitchenette is well-stocked and has a big enough mini-fridge for several items, and the bed was very comfy! A wonderful, cozy little place for a Hood river getaway."
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was my second stay in this beautiful location. The space is roomy, very clean, private, and extremely comfortable. I highly recommend this spot. The host is very responsive and this is one of the best values in the Gorge."

2023-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,Carol and Tom are a lovely couple and uber friendly. They were happy with me staying in their place on very short notice. The apartment was very clean and cozy and lacked nothing that I needed. My stay was brief. I hope I can stay there again in the future and soak up the calming sounds of the river that flows close by. I highly recommend Tom and Carol’s place for anyone visiting the area.
2022-12-01,5,Stayed one night,Tom and Carol received us at arrival and ensured we were well acquainted with the space. Great communication. Comfortable setting. Lovely area!
2022-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"Although our stay was short, we had a great time. The hosts were very friendly and accommodating. They gave us great suggestions on places we should visit, gave us a tour of the room before we came in, and made sure the bathroom and kitchen areas were fully stocked. The shampoo, conditioner, and body wash were all great quality. There was a heater in the room, which was adjustable. Tom also let us park under the covered patio, since the weather conditions were rainy. Overall, the experience was great and I would recommend staying here."
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Tom and Carol’s place was a fantastic stay for our end of year getaway at Hood River. The weather was unseasonably cold (-13 degrees Celsius…) but we felt right at home in their warm and cosy AirBnB. They are the kindest couple and we really enjoyed getting to know them during our stay. Would definitely come back again!
2022-12-01,5,Stayed one night,Tom and his wife were excellent hosts. They welcomed me with great conversation and excellent local recommendations (a great local brewery at night and a local diner for breakfast). The living area was not only clean but very cozy. The bed was comfortable and the bathroom was nice and clean. I can’t recommend this place enough. If I’m ever in the area again this is where I’m staying.
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had such a wonderful visit!! Tom suggested great places to eat and he kindly showed us around the Airbnb. Soon after we arrived, we visited the apple store right next door, and brought home a delicious strawberry- peach pie, which we devoured. We slept well, in such a comfortable bed. It’s really nice being centrally located in the “ fruit loop” area. We would love to go back and stay there again."
2022-10-01,5,Stayed one night,The place was perfect. Tom and his wife were the best hosts. They thought of everything in the surprisingly roomy apartment. Very comfortable and inviting. The place is located on a river so the sound of the river at the covered sitting area was so relaxing. We will be back again in the future.
2022-10-01,5,Stayed one night,The space is just adorable and I really appreciated Carol saying hi. I was very comfortable and felt at home.
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Tom and Carol are super friendly and knowledgeable of the area. The accommodation is luxurious and ideal for a couple. There are spots to sit and enjoy the Hood river with a peaceful ambience. The town of Hood River, the Columbia River Gorge and all its waterfalls and trails, the Fruit Loop provide so many options to explore."

2022-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"The pics don’t do this place justice. A total GEM! Beautiful quarters for our stay with all the amenities.

2022-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"Tom was very welcoming, he provided us with a very friendly greeting and a tour of the vicinity and room we'd be staying in.
The house is beautiful as is the room, it's spacious and very clean. Kitchen and bathroom are very organized and tidy, TV is connected to Netflix and is ready to catch up on your favorite shows.
Air conditioning is a plus but so are open windows with a Iovley summer breeze and the river flowing through just a few feet away. Would definitely stay again! Thanks Tom!!!"

2022-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"I really enjoyed my stay at the apartment, the beautiful property, and meeting Tom and Carol. I appreciate the thoughtfulness they put into designing and outfitting the space, the clear communication and easy check in, and the invitation to stroll around the grounds. They have made a very special spot. One does often hear traffic when outside because of the proximity to a main road, but can choose to listen to the river instead, which is right there! I hope to return soon!"

Thanks"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed over a week,"Not only perfect for a night or two, but also for the entire two weeks we were able to stay at Tom and Carol's place. Our plan was to ""live"" in Hood River for a bit, to explore the summertime environs, and to visit with our grandchildren (and their parents) for some part of every day (two minutes away). The location is not only convenient for it's proximity to town and the Gorge proper, but also it's distance from the center of things that offers a sense of privacy. The accommodation, the ambiance, and the hospitality were beyond compare. Can't make a better or more meaningful review than all that precede this one, so recommend browsing a handful or two of those for their consistently positive and accurate description of what's in store when you book this spot for your Hood River stay."
2022-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Highly recommend this as an option for anyone staying in Hood River. Beautiful location on the river … the house, and property itself is just fun to wander and roam through the veggie gardens, orchards etc. the description of “apartment” is accurate … very welcoming and well laid out space. You never feel hemmed in. Also, special shout out with respect to your hosts - you will have a hard time finding such nice people!"
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This air bnb is definitely a gem! The pictures do not do it justice. The owners have cutely decorated and stocked the place with everything you could need. The outdoor patio is equipped with comfortable furniture and a gas grill (added bonus right on the Hood river). The owners are very friendly and know the area well. I would highly recommend staying here!
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Heaven on the hood river! This spot is perfect for a single, couple or even family with 2 Littles. The home was so updated and beautiful and the land sits right on the Hood River. Gorgeous doesn't describe this spot. The hosts are so amazing and just awesome people...we can't say enough about it. Space (indoor and outdoor), facilities, location...all perfect. Best part is the checkout procedures. Tom and Carol are living a dream life and we were so fortunate to find them and have a few days of Heaven on Hood River."

A fully stocked bathroom, nice little kitchenette with plenty of coffee and tea, the cutest kids’ room, and an extremely comfortable bed help make this place perfect for a Hood River getaway. We enjoyed exploring the area, and can recommend the historic Gorge Hotel on the Columbia River, the Marchesi Vineyard, the Kick Stand for a great evening meal, and Bette’s Place for an incredible breakfast, served until 2. And this sweet apartment on the Hood River is certainly the best place to stay!"

2019-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We appreciated how clean and private this space was, and Virginia was very quick to respond to our messages. We had a separate entrance and no interaction with the hosts (our choice). You share a hallway with the rest of the home, separated by a sliding barn door that wouldn't block noise if we made it, so we were careful to be quiet. It was great for us because we just needed a place to get ready for a wedding and somewhere to sleep after. Similar to a hotel in no kitchen and no living area, but a nice space to make tea/coffee."

2019-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Really clean beautiful spot in an awesome location
2019-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Fantastic amenities but keep in mind that the location is a about a mile from downtown in case you plan on going drinking and don't want to drive. If you don't plan on drinking or staying out late than this would be the perfect location for you. There is a pedi-cab and van shuttle available if needed.
2019-06-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Virginia's home was very comfortable and roomy. The mattress was excellent, one thing I find very important and often unmentioned in reviews, so that is why I include it here. There were nice touches in the space such as exercise mats, some straps and light weights, plus lots of guide books and maps for outdoor adventuring.
If you are sensitive to light while sleeping an eye mask might be a good thing to pack as there was a fair amount of light entering through the blinds from the street.
A question the host texted to us after our departure left us feeling a bit off about our stay."

We had people coming in from far and wide and they were all taken with the home, its quintessential PNW touches, and proximity to fun activities and delicious food. Each day began with a walk downtown for coffee and ended with drinks and games in the cozy family room. Could not have asked for a better place to spend time with friends and family!"
2024-04-01,5,Group trip,A great place - will come again!
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great stay, love the lodge!"
2024-02-01,5,Group trip,Lodge 902 was perfect for a work retreat! Plenty of space for team dinners and strategy sessions.
2024-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,This was a perfect spot for our team retreat. We loved that everyone had their own lockable room with a private bathroom. Great common areas and the sunroom worked perfectly for our meeting room.
2024-01-01,5,Group trip,Lodge 902 is a favorite! We reserved the entire property for a retreat and it was perfect. The hosts are super communicative and quick to respond. The location is perfect and so convenient to all that Hood River and the surrounding area have to offer. A bonus was the off street parking to accommodate our group! We'll definitely book again.
2024-01-01,5,Group trip,"We have a 16 person real estate team and it's hard to find a place to accommodate all of us. This was our 3rd stay for an annual trip and we always have so much fun at Lodge 902! It is spacious with fun decor, old world charm, close to everything and best of all the games! We hung out in the living area and played game after game and laughed a lot. The spacious porch with rocking chairs is lovely, great linens and cozy beds. It's right in town so there is traffic driving by but we don't mind that at all and didn't notice it inside. It's so close to everything in Hood River Downtown. The parking lot is great too!"
2023-12-01,4,Stayed with kids,"Our whole family 6-67, really enjoyed our stay. This house, built in 1911, is exquisite. Beautiful woodwork, large rooms and fun just to explore and experience. All updates were done with top quality materials and workmanship. Nothing lacking in terms of fun games, kitchenware, glasses and linens. HC and beds were top notch."
2023-12-01,4,Stayed with kids,"Nice bathrooms in all the bedrooms. Large kitchen and dining area and a very nice breakfast nook for morning coffee. Downtown Hood River is within walking distance.
We held our 2nd annual family gathering at Lodge 902 and had a great time. There were 15 adults and 1 toddler and had plenty of room to move around.
Our hostess was terrific in responding to our phone calls and making sure are concerns were answered.
We'd definitely would recommend Lodge 902."
2023-12-01,5,Group trip,"We had a wonderful stay with our big group. They had so much stuff for cooking and tons of space for people to play games, watch movies or just hang out. We dug the funny signs and instructions through out. The place has great personality. We also enjoyed the fire and games to choose from. Would definitely stay again. Oh and so close to restaurants and breweries."
2023-11-01,4,Group trip,"Very cool concept. House is setup like a hostel, great decorations and lot's of thoughtful touches on the decor. Having an ensuite for every bedroom was great. Host was responsive to all our questions. Only disappointment was the cleanliness. The house was very dusty and many of the dishes and pans were dirty with dried on food from previous guests. Had to do some basic cleaning before we could feel comfortable. Host did offer to send cleaning crew but we were already settled in and once we cleaned up we were fine."
2023-11-01,4,Group trip,"Wonderful location with an easy walk into downtown shops and restaurants. The house itself has a ton of charm, perfect for hosting a large group with an expansive dining table and kitchen facilities. It's a little drafty in the house, so some additional space heaters would be nice. It seems like the party prior to ours left quite a lot of garbage in the bins, which had exploded into the parking lot due to wind or animals or both. It was a huge eye sore and rough first impression as we welcomed team members into the house. Overall, we'd go back, though!"
2023-10-01,5,Group trip,Phenomenal stay and setup for six couples. Can’t say enough about how cool this gem of a place is!
2023-10-01,5,Group trip,"We hosted our wedding party at the Lodge, and it was an incredible experience! Everyone commented on how unique and beautiful the space was, and the views were gorgeous.

2023-10-01,5,Group trip,"Booked the lodge for the bridal party of my daughter's destination wedding in Hood River. I wanted my gift to her to be time to enjoy with her dearest friends. The Lodge did not disappoint! It was a wonderful gathering place for all. Everyone enjoyed their own impeccably designed bedroom (and bath - a big plus!) and the funky and eccentric ""vibe"" of the house fit them perfectly. It was spacious, clean, and with fun little touches everywhere, Lodge 902 made for a truly unique accommodation. Highly recommend!"
2023-10-01,5,Group trip,"This is a great place to stay if you have a large group visiting Hood River. It’s very walkable to restaurants and shops.

Few small things to note: some things in the house were broken (ceiling fan in Room 1, fridge missing handles) and some of their extensive board game collection is unusable due to broken items and missing pieces. Pillows get super flat as you sleep, so bring your own if you can! Lastly, we didn’t get responses to questions around check-out, but we were so appreciative that we weren’t required to do a ton of check-out responsibilities! None of this really impacted our stay overall and we would definitely return!"
2023-10-01,5,Group trip,Great option for a family to stay all together and have their own space.
2023-09-01,5,Group trip,"Beautiful gorgeous house! Looks just like the photos with some minor issues but overall great place for a big group. We hosted our wedding party which was perfect, there were multiple areas to get ready and beautiful natural light for wedding makeup but 10am check out is very early the morning after the wedding so something to be mindful of! Overall loved our stay and would recommend!"
2023-09-01,5,Group trip,"Lodge 902 worked perfectly for our small group retreat! There was a great conference room area with tv that we used for meeting times. Would highly recommend, and hope to be back again!"

2023-08-01,5,Group trip,"This place was perfect for my large family pre/post wedding stay. We were 13 adults so used one of the additional apartments. The on-suite baths were a real winner with this group. Loved the large deck with many rocking chairs. My favorite place to sit was the old chairlift swing. Sarah was incredibly responsive. Go, you’ll enjoy the easy walk downtown and the comfy/quirky hang out spaces!!!"
2023-08-01,5,Group trip,"Charming, comfortable, cozy, and overall amazing place! If you are staying in Hood River with a big group, couldn’t recommend lodge 902 more!!"

It’s great for families, girls trips, or even just couples! Close to shopping and food! Just a short 5 min drive down to the river too! Don’t pass this up!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,We stayed here for our wedding weekend and it was perfect! Very spacious and has a lot of character. Felt homey and beautiful view. We especially loved the side and front porch and big windows in the back. Highly recommend for a large group. Great walking distance to downtown!
2023-08-01,5,Group trip,We stayed here with fourteen friends during our wedding weekend. We couldn’t have asked for a better experience - what an amazing space to host friends in. We couldn’t recommend this place more highly for a large group looking for a memorable time.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We loved the house and the excellent decor. Very cozy and inviting home with lots of spaces for gathering with your loved ones. The host Sarah was super helpful about everything that we need in and around the home.
We highly recommend and would visit again!"
2023-07-01,5,Group trip,"We rented this house for our groomsmen and their partners during our wedding weekend and it was absolutely perfect for the occasion!

Our hosts were also extremely accommodating and responsive throughout the entire process. Thank you Lodge 902!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Our daughter was getting married in White Salmon and we were looking for a base for us and our extended family Lodge 902 was perfect, it was a great size, everyone had their own bathroom and it was spotless! It had everything you could possibly need during your stay and the owner was super responsive to all my questions We will definitely be back"
2023-07-01,5,Group trip,Great place. Great location. We loved it!
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,We were a large family staying here for a summer trip. Lodge 902 was a perfect fit! Each family had their own space and bathroom. The kiddos even had a play area just for them. The place was also very walkable. Lots of hills but nothing was too far. We especially loved the playground a little further up the hill. It seriously had everything! I would totally recommend this house for a large group wanting to see Hood River for the first time or anytime really!
2023-07-01,5,Group trip,Perfect for our friends and family during our wedding weekend.
2023-06-01,5,Group trip,"Wonderful place with endless character and timeless decor.
Comfortable beds and private baths with each room."
2023-06-01,5,Group trip,"Lodge 902 was our home base for a family reunion for wedding week for our daughter's wedding. The lodge was beautifully outfitted for large groups that you felt that there were so many places you could hang out with others and so many spots you could tuck yourself away for some quiet time. The kitchen was well equipped for the family dinners that were whipped up every night. The location is fantastic as there are so many shops, restaurants, coffee shops, wineries that were just a short stroll away. The host was very responsive during our stay with any questions that arose and provided a great list of places and activities to do upon arrival. Our whole family enjoyed the stay immensely. We will definitely come back again!"
2023-06-01,5,Group trip,Lodge 902 did not disappoint in any way. Perfect for large family group to be together yet have private space as desired. Location allowed walkability to restaurants and bars plus had breathtaking views of the surroundings! Highly recommended!
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,Perfect AirBnB. Very charming and large house located on a beautiful street which was walkable to town. The layout was perfect for a large group. Each room had plenty of privacy and their own bathrooms. Very cool game and entertainment room in the basement. A nice view from then dining room. Would love to come back!
2023-06-01,5,Group trip,Amazing place!
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We rented the entire lodge including the two apartments for our family. It was great to have enough room to hold our family and friends who traveled from all over the country to celebrate our son's wedding in White salmon.
There was plenty of space for everyone, including space for the children to play and be loud away from the adults!
The rooms were quiet, the kitchen was well equipped. We cooked multiple meals for multiple people with all the pots and pans we needed."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,Perfect for our daughter’s wedding party and family. Everything was “as advertised” only better. Plenty of space for everyone to move around or spend time in their rooms. I would highly recommend for a large group.
2023-05-01,5,Group trip,"Super cool house, full of character and fun decorations. It felt like something out of a Wes Anderson movie! This is a great place for a large group - each bedroom has a queen or king size bed and an en suite bathroom, plus abundant parking."
2023-05-01,5,Group trip,"We rented out the whole place for our wedding party for our wedding weekend! Our wedding party enjoyed their stay and found the amenities and its location in pristine condition! They really enjoyed how thoughtfully decorated the place was and how comfortable the beds were! Some bathroom drains were slow, but these all tracked for the age of the house. Everyone had a great stay and loved the mountain views and the walkability into downtown hood river! It's a great spot and we look forward to potentially staying there ourselves for a bed and breakfast experience one day!"
2023-05-01,5,Group trip,This place is AWESOME and the host was great! Highly recommend
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Awesome house with great layout for our group. We had 4 kids with us and the private bedrooms away from the common area were great for quiet naps, and the games and puzzles were perfect to keep them entertained. The design and decor were so cute and made the house feel so cozy. The location was great, in a quiet safe area but still super close to shops and restaurants that we could walk to."
2023-04-01,5,Group trip,"We have stayed at Lodge 902 twice now and love it! Communication is effortless and the house itself is amazing, clean, and has everything you need. Would highly recommend!"
2023-04-01,5,Group trip,"What a fantastic place! We were in town for our son’s wedding. The Lodge offered us the perfect place for family and friends to stay. The location was perfect to walk to town for meals and R&R time. The kitchen was perfect for a large group and for some food preparation for the wedding events. The game room offered hours of fun and laughter, the fireplace offered the perfect place to hang out and tell stories. The weekend turned out to be the best weekend ever!! So much fun. Thank you Lodge 902"
2023-04-01,5,Group trip,It’s even better in person. The unique design of each room was very well thought out and made for a fun stay.
2023-03-01,5,Group trip,"Lodge 902 is so cute and in probably the best location in Hood River. Coffee, restaurants, tasting rooms, and shopping is all within 10 minutes of walking. The house was huge and very cozy."
2023-03-01,5,Group trip,Everything was great for my team. Perfect set up!
2023-01-01,5,Group trip,"The lodge was a comfortable, clean, and cozy place for our large group. We loved the thoughtfully decorated rooms and cool books to hangout. Communication with hosts was good and checkin super easy. We would love to stay again."
2023-01-01,5,Group trip,"We rented the entire lodge for a retreat and it was perfect! The en-suite bathrooms for each room is what really sold us and the availability of two extra ""apartments"" if our group grew in size, which it did. The hosts are extremely responsive and offer a list of great restaurants etc that I would completely agree with."
2023-01-01,5,Group trip,"Excellent! The Lodge had everything we needed for an enjoyable corporate retreat. Every bedroom had a dedicated bathroom, and there was plenty of common space for us to meet, eat and play games. Highly recommend! Easy booking, very flexible host considering our changing headcount, and great communication. Would definitely consider staying again."
2022-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Lodge 902 was a great spot for our family gathering of 14, grandma; children with spouses and grandchildren. It was an historic building with a variety of interesting memorabilia. It had room for our group to gather together for meals and games.
Skiing at Mt. Hood was nearby and super. Cheers!"
2022-12-01,4,Stayed with kids,"We rented the lodge for my wife's birthday weekend with several families. The house is well set up for group fun, and in a great location. Big and functional kitchen but if you're planning to do any cooking bring your own knives / peelers, the ones there were dull verging on unusable."
2022-12-01,5,Group trip,Great place for a business retreat!
2022-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We loved the 902 Lodge! The host was so friendly and helpful and the Lodge was beautiful. Plenty of parking, walking distance to the main attractions, quiet area. Would definitely recommend!"
2022-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This is a great place for a gathering of friends or family. It's a massive house and the downstairs apartments have full kitchenettes and front rooms in addition to bedrooms. Every room in the house has an en suite bathroom. It's a bit quirky and old fashioned in some respects but cozy, spacious, and ideally situated to walk into Hood River."
2022-11-01,5,Group trip,10/10! Loved all of it!
2022-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"Awesome house for a family or large group getaway. Our adult slumber party was super fun, with tons of game options, lots of fireplaces and both gathering and private space for everyone. We’ll be back - one of the most fun homes we’ve stayed at!"
2022-11-01,5,Group trip,every bedroom has a bathroom which was a huge bonus for our family. the place was fabulous and we will be back
2022-10-01,5,Group trip,"We used the lodge for our 16-person annual gathering of college girlfriends and it might be the best place we've rented in 20 years. The lodge itself offers very comfortable sleeping (the six rooms on the top two floors all have private baths and the two units on the lower floor are small one-bedroom apartments). It's really nicely equipped with all the dishes, seating, and games/puzzles/books a large group needs. Plus, it's just a few blocks from downtown HR and the beautiful riverfront. Sarah and her partners were extremely responsive to any and all requests and questions. Be aware that the lodge is right on Oak Street, which is a busy road, so there's traffic noise on the street-facing rooms but that calms down a bit during nighttime hours. Also, read the listing details carefully if you want to sleep 16 people because the two downstairs apartments require an additional fee. All in all, this is a fantastic place for big groups."
2022-10-01,5,Group trip,Awesome place to stay! Perfect location and lodge was awesome!
2022-10-01,5,Group trip,"Lodge 902 was the perfect place for our large group to stay for a week! We truly had the best time! Our group all felt so comfortable/safe during our time. Everyone had their own space to decompress and relax after long days, as well as their own bathroom! We loved being able to make dinners all together in the fully equipped kitchen. The location was perfect for our needs - close to certain spots we wanted to explore, just down the street from the downtown area with tons of shopping, food & grocery stores. Check in/check out was super smooth & easy. There was a minor hiccup during our stay and let me just say, they’ve got your back! :) The views were incredible! Would definitely stay here again and again!! Thank you for the best week, Lodge 902!"
2022-10-01,5,Group trip,"For big groups, there's not a better place to stay in Hood River. It's super unique and fun with lots of space for everyone. We're definitely going to stay again next time we go to Hood River with a big group."
2022-09-01,5,Group trip,Great location and very responsive hosts!
2022-09-01,5,Group trip,We were here for one side of a family wedding and had a wonderful stay here. The lodge has a wonderful kitchen and common areas so a lot of people can eat and talk. The location is really great. It is a very nice place!

2022-08-01,5,Group trip,Lodge 902 was the perfect home base for our group’s Hood River adventures. It was great for each couple to have privacy in their individual rooms while sharing the awesome common areas. We appreciate the attention to detail and had so much fun at the lodge!
2022-08-01,5,Group trip,Awesome place and location. Enjoyed the character of the place! Owners were excellent with communication!
2022-08-01,5,Group trip,This place is perfect for a large family gathering. My family stayed here during my wedding weekend. There's enough space for everyone to still have privacy and their own bathrooms. It's easy to make family meals in the kitchen. My family especially enjoyed the side porch. Lots of memories made here!
2022-08-01,5,Group trip,"Had a fun stay here with a group of close friends! We appreciated the unique charm of the Lodge and its proximity to downtown Hood River. The house was even more spacious that we imagined and it was very convenient that each room had its own en suite bathroom. There were a few small issues with cleanliness and plumbing, none of which detracted significantly from an overall wonderful stay."
2022-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This house was perfect for our large family! Every couple had a room with a bathroom! the rooms were larger than pictured. And what was really surprising to us was the shared spaces, there was plenty of hang out space for our large group. And the views were incredible. This place undersells itself! We will be back soon!"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Beautiful house, great for groups."
2022-07-01,5,Group trip,"We rented this house for a family reunion, and it worked perfectly for all our cousins who now travel with their spouses and significant others. It was well outfitted for large groups including a large game closet, huge glassware cabinet & extra refrigerators. Each room had its own bathroom, which helps when 12 adults are in one house. The house was in the perfect location just blocks from downtown. We are definitely planning on staying at lodge 902 again!"

2022-06-01,5,Group trip,"Lodge 902 is the perfect stay for large groups. We rented out the lodge and apartments for our wedding party and everything was gorgeous, guests were comfortable, game setup is incredible. This is a must stay!"
2022-06-01,5,Group trip,"We are so happy that we decided to splurge on Lodge 902 for our son's wedding weekend. It was everything we hoped it would be -- a gathering spot for friends and family and perfect for hosting informal get-togethers throughout the busy weekend (including being the spot where the groomsmen got ready on wedding day). The lodge had many areas where people would gather - living room, sunroom, dining room, side porch, lower level (with pac-man game table) and of course the kitchen. We could also easily walk to town to grab coffee, sample breweries/wineries, or just explore. Our hosts were very responsive on the few times we contacted them with questions. We would highly recommend Lodge 902 for your gathering. And don't underestimate how nice it is to have a bathroom for each bedroom!
(note: we also rented the 2 apartments on the lower level)."
2022-06-01,4,Stayed with kids,Great location! Great for large groups. Loved that each room had its own bathroom and there was plenty of space for us to gather.

2022-05-01,5,Group trip,"Lodge 902 was the perfect venue; renting the entire lodge for 2 nights for the families to stay together as we gathered in Hood River for a micro wedding. Before heading out to the Gorge for the ceremony we enjoyed appetizers and cocktails with a fabulous view of Mt. Adams and the Columbia River. Each bedroom has its own bath, the beds were comfy, the games, the giant wall Scrabble board plus the fun décor and vibe had everyone smiling! The exceptionally well stocked, large kitchen was a huge plus for the private chef/caterer we hired to prep and serve dinner. In the mornings, the coffee/tea bar has everything you need to welcome a new day on the balcony with that awesome view.
A big shout out to the hosts, they were responsive and helped to make sure every aspect of our stay went well.
Everything exceeded our expectations; it is all that it promises and more! If you are looking to gather family or a large group in Hood River, Lodge 902 is the place!"
2022-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,This house is amazing! It is so well thought out and the decor is so fun! There’s so much to see without it being too overdone. The games that are there are great. My husband and son played many games of donkey Kong downstairs! And the view is spectacular! I can’t say enough good things about this place! I wish I lived closer so I could stay there more often!
2022-04-01,5,Group trip,"We loved our stay at the Lodge. We used it as a work offsite and having private, ensuite rooms that locked was so nice. The rooms were charming and the beds were super comfortable with great quality bedding. It was super clean and had everything we needed for a relaxing, productive stay. Wifi was spotty in a couple areas in the house but we were able to easily take video calls in the main parts. The view, walkability, and charm really made our work gathering special."
2022-04-01,5,Group trip,Very comfortable accommodations and the view is outstanding!
2022-03-01,5,Group trip,"Our stay at Lodge 902 was absolutely perfect! We had people in from all over, and we couldn't have asked for a better space and location. We definitely want to come back! Thank you for everything!!"

2022-02-01,5,Group trip,"We could not have found a better fit for our group of 13 to enjoy a weekend retreat together. A well stocked kitchen allowed to make our meals with ease. The eating and living spaces are large allowing for easy flow through the house. The decor was cozy, thoughtful and eclectic… we very much appreciated the attention to detail. We will be back!"
2022-02-01,5,Group trip,"Highly recommend! Perfect set up for multiple couples. Lots of space, cool house with a great location. We can’t wait to stay again."
2022-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This is a special place! The entire house has fun little surprises and clever decor. The feeling you get when you stay at Lodge 902 is that you are going to have an experience.

The layout was perfect for a group of friends to all comfortably be together, cool meals, while still having enough room for each family to have their own private space. Communication was excellent, and the hosts were super helpful with any questions. Would highly recommend, and I definitely plan to return again!"
2021-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The house exceeded our expectations! Fifteen of us across three generations met for a family reunion over the holidays. Some of us hadn’t met for three years and we could not have imagined a more comfortable and well equipped house for us to spend this time together. Ellen communicated with us regularly as we navigated late changes due to the snow. We felt welcome and taken care of even before we arrived, and throughout our stay. With the snow and colder than usual weather, we spent a lot of time indoors. The house had a lot of character and was a fun space to hang out - with plenty of room and a wide choice of games. The kitchen was well equipped and the large dining table was perfect for family meals.
We hope to be back in the future."
2021-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We had a great time at Lodge 902! Great location, clean and beautiful house! It was fully stocked and a great place for a large group. The beds were comfy, the kitchen was stocked with the pots and pans we needed, even the shampoo was great! Thanks for hosting us!"

2021-08-01,5,Group trip,This was the largest Airbnb we've ever rented and it was amazing base for our low key wedding weekend. The whole family and most of the bridal party was able to stay together and everyone raved about the decor and views towards the water. The only thing that would have made it better was one extra day to enjoy the space!
2021-08-01,5,Group trip,Amazing stay!! We stayed here for our wedding and had an incredible time. One of the few perfect AirBnBs out there.
2021-08-01,4,Group trip,Fun place to stay and convenient to downtown Hood River. Was ideal for accommodating a large group for our daughter’s wedding. The instruction book should be updated due to missing amenities ie. espresso machine and dining recommendations of places that are no longer around. We were grateful they transferred our reservation from 2020 to 2021.
2021-07-01,5,Group trip,This large house/b&b is perfect for a large group and family visiting the area. Great location. Great vibe.

2021-05-01,5,Group trip,Absolutely wonderful air bnb! Each room was decorated and detailed so wonderfully and it was such a perfect space for our group. We loved sitting on the porch at night and early morning to enjoy the views and weather. The beds were so comfy and all of us were trying to figure out the brand of the sheets! They were SO soft! The whole house was spotless clean and came with awesome features. The theater room in the basement and photo booth upstairs were such cute touches.

2021-04-01,5,Group trip,We loved this home!! It is HUGE! Each bedroom has its own bathroom and the common areas are perfect for a family gathering. Perfect location where you can walk to restaurants and shops on Oak St.
2021-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The lodge exceeded our expectations and surpassed the listing photos. Each space is thoughtfully designed and well supplied. There was more than enough room and options for entertainment/activities.

Each room provides its own unique experience that is both fun and restful. The common areas have a great balance of space for groups, as well as, nooks for reading or relaxing alone. If you're considering a retreat, family get together, or looking for a single room. I highly recommend using Lodge 902. You won't regret it!"
2021-02-01,5,Group trip,"A really fun spot that is so nicely curated. We loved our stay at Lodge 902. We were lucky enough to rent the whole space for our group. It was such a great weekend. A great location - just a short 7 minute walk to downtown Hood River and close to many other restaurants, stores, and tasting rooms."
2021-02-01,5,Group trip,Wonderful place to stay. Close to everything and room for multiple families or friend groups. The private parking lot was an amazing perk as well.

We walked downtown everyday for coffee, takeout, shopping, etc. The lodge was very homey and fully stocked for all of our needs. In every nook and cranny you could find something new and exciting to see or play with(games galore)! We also loved the way the lodge is set up with everyone having their own bedroom and bathroom! The TV room in the basement was great for the kids while the adults chatted around the fire upstairs! We would highly recommend Lodge 902 to any of our friends or family! We absolutely LOVED IT!"
2020-12-01,5,Group trip,Would Stay Again! Terrific Spot for a Small Business Team Bonding. Each room has it's own bathroom. Terrific spot for a Family Reunion. This place has Character! Fun!

The space has had a bit of remodel and added amenities since the last time I stayed and it's even better! They added a movie room downstairs, 2 full apartments and a fun lounge and entertainment space. We rented the entire 3 floors to ourself and we really couldn't have asked for more in a space and location. There are special touches in every room, shopping/dining and entertainment are right outside the door within blocks, and ample parking for guests in the included lot. I highly recommend Lodge 902! I wish there was a space like this in every city."
2020-11-01,5,Group trip,"Great big house, fun games. It was also close to beach. Loved many spots where we were able to sit ik big group. Would love to visit again."

2020-10-01,5,Group trip,"One of the most unique lodges I have ever stayed at - the most fun and classy decorations and small touches.

2020-09-01,5,Group trip,Its our third time using Lodge 902 and we'll definitely be back. I would highly recommend to anyone wanting a restful stay or to explore the Hood River area.
2020-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Amazing house downtown Hood River. We were there for Labor Day weekend with friends and we really enjoyed our stay.

2020-02-01,5,Group trip,Lodge 902 is one of the best Airbnb experiences I have ever had. The house is HUGE and every single inch of it is designed for relaxation and recreation. We had a staff retreat here and the house is set up perfectly for groups (and couples) on all three floors. The jetted tubs were my favorite as well as the flat screens in every room. We had a wonderful dinner at Double Mountain Brewery and came back to the house and played all the games that are stocked in the living room. Everyone commented how nice the space was and I definitely would love to come back and stay at Lodge 902 anytime!

Our group settled in and immediately got down to having fun. The various hang out spaces were clean, artfully decorated and comfy.
Kitchen was fairly well stocked, and had plenty of room. All the guest quarters were equally excellent.
A few questions came up, and the hosts responded quickly.
All in all, we found the space fantastic, and are looking forward to coming back!"

2019-12-01,5,Group trip,"My colleagues and I stayed here for a company retreat (for the second time), and it really is a perfect setup. Since it's operated as a B&B, each person gets the privacy of a locked room and ensuite bath - plus lots of common space including a well equipped kitchen. Highly recommend for a small company event."

Plenty of space and privacy for individuals but great gathering places for groups. Fun and lively decor, and in great condition. We used a recommend chef for a team cooking competition - the chef and the space were perfect. Thank you! The team has already voted and we will be back!"

Everything we were looking for. I would highly recommend it."

2019-10-01,5,Group trip,"We rented the whole place for the weekend for our October wedding. Just a small intimate ceremony with a few friends, nothing crazy. We were able to stop by in May to meet up with Ellen for a quick tour so we could get an idea of the layout beforehand (so kind of her)! Lodge 902 ended up being perfect on so many levels! The decor is amazing - thoughtful, quirky touches everywhere! Every room has a bathroom and shower. Lots of space throughout the house for everyone to relax and hang out. An awesome collection of board games - even a giant playable scrabble board on the wall downstairs. We fixed a meal for everyone on Saturday night and the large kitchen had everything we needed, including 2 ovens and plenty of place settings for all 14 of us. Sunday morning we had Sonja fix breakfast for us (not typically included when renting the whole place, but so glad we decided to add this on!). Delicious and so easy for us! For Sunday night, we reviewed the catering list that Ellen had provided and decided to have Boda's Kitchen cater dinner. They dropped it off in chafers and we were all set- again, so easy!! Overall our stay was fantastic and all of our friends kept commenting on what a wonderful place we'd found. A few of them are even planning to look into Lodge 902 for upcoming family and work gatherings. If you are looking for a beautiful, quirky place and want super helpful/responsive hosts, look not further! :)"

2019-09-01,5,Group trip,"We absolutely loved this space! There were 12 adults and we each had our own space and bathroom. We loved hanging out on the deck and that we could walk downtown. Everything you could need is provided: two coffee makers, blender and tons of board games. The record player was epic! Most importantly, there are tons of wine glasses! The bedding was very comfortable and the pillows are clearly great quality. We loved the eclectic decor. We will be back. We could not have found a better spot for our group. Thanks for the perfect lodge!"

2019-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Excellent place for family reunion. With 8 bedrooms / 8.5 baths, there was plenty of space for everyone, but also plenty of space to come together. Very nice location close to town (walked down to get ice cream every night!) with beautiful views of the river. Fully stocked kitchen. Fun funky decor. A couple blocks from a cool kids playground too. Loads of board games, and the old video console was a huge hit with the kids. Couldn’t have asked for a better vacation."
2019-07-01,5,Group trip,As noted in previous reviews the Lodge is 100% the place to be! We took over the whole house and my entire family ranted and raved about it non-stop. Lodge 902 is full of carefully curated design details for your fun and comfort. We absolutely loved our time at the Lodge and highly recommend for your next trip to Hood River!!

2019-06-01,5,Group trip,Lodge 902 was great! The house is massive with some many cool areas and little design touches. And you can't beat the location just a few blocks from downtown Hood River.

2019-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Perfect place to rent out and celebrate a milestone birthday! Tons of space, fully stocked kitchen, beautiful spot, easy to walk to downtown HR!

2019-05-01,5,Group trip,💯👍
2019-05-01,5,Group trip,"I booked Lodge 902 on behalf of The Nature Conservancy so we could bring staff and community partners together for a meeting. We rented the 6 main bedrooms for our community partners and the basement apartments for our staff. The guest rooms are beautiful and made our partners/guests feel special. The basement apartments were great too. It was nice to have a space with it's own bathroom and kitchenette for our own coffee and shower in the morning before joining the group upstairs. We hosted our meetings in the living room and easily had 15 people watching a PowerPoint presentation at any one time. The hosts were great - actually VERY accommodating to our group and the check-in and check-out process was seamless. Now, we are trying to think of reasons to have another meeting in Hood River, so we can return to Lodge 902. Highly Recommend!!"

2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Brooke's space is close to everything but far enough away that you feel the peaceful quiet away from town. Everything is spotless, convenient and comfortable. She's a delightful host with great recommendations."
2024-04-01,4,Stayed one night,"Cool place. Unique spot - clean and nicely decorated. They have done a great job with the space they have. The steep stairs and the stair to the entryway might make it difficult for older people or if you have small children. Also, if you are tall, the ceilings are low so you'd have to watch yourself in a couple areas mostly around the bed. Small TV is fairly far away from areas to watch."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,A really great place with very thoughtful amenities. I would absolutely stay with Brooke again!
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The apartment was perfect for my stay in Hood River. The space was very inviting and very close to town. The apartment had everything I needed for the stay.

Would definitely return when we are in the area."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,We loved staying here. Great place with plenty of room and everything we needed. Just a few mins from loads of restaurants. We’d definitely stay here again when we’re in town.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,We needed a place to get ready for a wedding along the Gorge and spend one night and this place was perfect. Brooke was so gracious to allow us to check in early and have a steamer ready so we can steam our suits for the wedding.

2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,We had a wonderful stay at Brooke's in Hood River. Brooke was very responsive and her place was clean and ready for us upon arrival. Took her recommendation and went into Bingen for the spa which was lovely. Would stay here again. Thanks!

Pine Street Bakery is also very close and highly recommended for great coffee and pastries.
Would definitely stay again!"

Close to an amazing local bakery in town and several cute breweries. Highly recommend!
2023-01-01,4,Stayed a few nights,The place was spotless. The cooktop advertised wasn't there. The linens were great. Appreciated having teabags available. The couch wasn't very comfortable to sit on. It was in a convenient location. If the couch and bed very a little more comfortable I would have given it 5 stars.

Brooke gave some great suggestions for food in town and everything we ate was delicious. I highly suggest Double Mountain Brewery for some great beer and the pizzas are amazing!
Definitely recommend staying here. We will hopefully be back real soon."

Thanks for an amazing stay!"
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great place. On a main street, but very well insulated and off the road behind the house. Very clean and quite quiet, (other than the occasional sound of a barking dog.) Their kitchen knives are really sharp and the bath towels and other supplies were quality. The way the wall is by the bed it’s easy to hit your head. So, we just pulled the bed out a bit and slept with our heads where the feet normally would be. That worked well. Hosts were around during our stay, and replied quickly to all requests, but respected our desire not to interact much."
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Fabulous place. Has everything all set up nicely in a quiet neighborhood close to town.

2019-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My partner and I stayed at Brooke's place for two night while in Hood River. the Loft style apartment is very charming, clean and cute. It's a 5 min drive from down town. check in & parking was a breeze. The apartment had a lots of personal touches. Our only issue was that we couldn't get the Apple TV to work (I think the model is very old, and needs to be replaced). Aside from that, we loved everything about this apartment!"
2019-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"This place has great style and is huge! Beautiful windows and great natural light. Plus its very quiet and removed from the noise of downtown Hood River. I love Brooke's design tastes, the place has a California Rock N' Roll chic vibe. Would definitely stay again!"
2019-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is a very nice place. Very clean, modern, well equipped. It is everything it appears to be in the pics and description. Great location just outside of downtown. Nice and private too. Brook was a great host. I had a great stay and it is my number one choice when I return to Hood River."

2019-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Brooke’s place is so nice and close to everything!! We loved it!!
Will definitely be coming back to it!!"
2019-01-01,5,Stayed one night,We really enjoyed our short visit skiing and sledding at the mountain and getting rest in between. The cute place had everything we needed. It was very clean and I loved the thoughtful extras. The kitchenette served our needs for breakfast and the coffee/tea was really good.

2024-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,great place experience hood river. very clean
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My husband and I loved staying at cabin #4. We came to spend a weekend away from the city, relax, bike and hike. We loved the ease of the cabin, close to hiking and biking, great outdoor seating areas and walking distance to food and coffee.
We even got a plus when we got to see the northern lights in the night sky.
The place was super clean and beautiful.
We are not light sensitive but I guess this could be an issue for someone as the cabins let in amazing light but will start to be bright with the rising sun which we found to be lovely"
2024-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"I booked a last minute getaway on a rainy spring weekend. The cabin is new, warm and cozy with a nice view of the Gorge. It is a short drive to Rowena Crest—wildflowers and hikes! We didn’t get to try out the fire pit, but we enjoyed the complementary beer, wine and coffee. The bed was very comfortable. There was everything we needed to cook dinner and breakfast, except cooking oil, but the market is very close by so we were able to pick up last minute supplies. We will absolutely be back."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"Perfect stay, responsive hosts, SUPER clean. Loved it : )"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,Was a nice cozy cabin and a great stay

2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great!
2023-12-01,5,Stayed one night,Brian’s doing it right as a host! The cabin is well thought out and very comfortable.

You will be very happy that you booked with Brian!
2023-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"We loved staying in this cozy cabin, it was very clean and felt like the perfect place for a birthday weekend getaway! The host even left us complementary local beverages which was such a thoughtful and generous gesture. We’d definitely stay here again!"

2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"A simply wonderful, peaceful place to stay. Really we just enjoyed the gorgeous huge window that faced the river. We sat out on the deck with coffee and it was such a relaxing time. Went to MoCo for a great pizza dinner and the coffee shop for a morning bagel. So nice to be able to walk to both places. Took a long hike up the Columbia Gorge Highway Trail and took in the spectacular views. Brian was super accommodating to us and we really appreciated the late check out and enjoyed the beverages too. Thank you so much for creating this good getaway spot! We will definitely come back!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The cabin was a great place for our three day weekend. The cabin is gorgeous, and it's located right next to the Columbia Gorge Historic highway. It's a great place to stay when biking through the gorge. The bed was super comfortable!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We stayed late September 2023 and this cabin was a great spot to relax. It was clean and simple, although everything was luxurious, and felt spacious for a studio. Great views of the river from inside and on the balcony. We used the fire pit as well while the Wagon Social Club right below the cabin was playing live music. Groovy vibes. It was easy to get to Hood River (less than 10 minutes to downtown or waterfront). We also drove about 15 minutes east to do the Rowena Plateau Trail about an hour after sunrise which was stunning with the clouds and sun rising over the river. Would imagine it's great at sunset too and other times of the year when the wildflowers are in bloom. Lots left to explore in the area and we'll definitely be back to this cabin for another trip."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Brian’s place was nothing but amazing! My husband and I spent our anniversary here in Mosier/Mt. Hood area and we couldn’t have picked a more perfect place to stay than here! It was super clean, comfortable, beautiful views, and had a coffee shop right behind! Parking is easy too! This place was close to all the sights we saw. Right when we arrived too there was complimentary local wine and beers! We even ran into Brian and he was super friendly and gave us amazing recommendations around the area! We plan to come stay here again except with some friends and family! Definitely book your stay here!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Brian was an excellent host. The space was very peaceful with wonderful views. Outstanding experience, definitely recommend."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,Exceeded expectations. Beautiful place. Bed was amazing. Really well cared for. Brian was responsive and helpful. Complete thumbs up and we’ll be back.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We had a great time! A very cozy cabin for a peaceful weekend.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"We really enjoyed our overnight stay here. The cabin is conveniently located, only about 6 miles from Hood river. The cabin is really nice, better than the photos, very comfortable. Randonee coffee shop has excellent coffee right below the cabins. We had a great stay."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This place is so beautiful! Amazing design. Cleanest AirbNb ever.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Brian was very friendly, available and responsive, actively working on his properties. This isn't passive income for him. He actively works to provide an A+ experience. The cabin was in perfect condition in all respects and exactly as advertised. We loved the location, which was easily accessible, with coffee, food, grocery, etc. nearby, yet still off the beaten path. Plenty of outdoor adventures, Hood River, wineries within close driving distance."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My husband and I really loved our stay at the cabin. It was absolutely beautiful and clean and so peaceful and relaxing. We enjoyed the coffee shop right next door and sitting on the back deck. We contemplated staying right in Hood River because that’s where we spent most of our time, but after staying here we would do it all over again as it was only a 5 minute drive to downtown Hood River. It was so private and relaxing in the sweet little town of Mosier. So
Worth it! Would definitely stay there again. We enjoyed it so much that we were sad to leave."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"One of cutest places we've ever stayed in. Brian is a great host. He provided complimentary local beer, wine and coffee! 100% would stay here again."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Amazing little cabin and a fantastic location. Perfect for a getaway. Our host Brian was super friendly and communication was excellent. We felt right at home and there was even beers and a bottle of wine waiting for us. Our only regret is not trying the coffee shop down the way but we will definitely be back.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What can I say about Brian and Summer’s place. This is our second time here and definitely will not be our last. Just a perfect place to get away, enjoy both activities nearby but also just quiet down time. We will keep coming back."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,My husband and I really enjoyed our quick getaway to the Randonnee cabins. The cabin itself was very modern and clean. The view was amazing! Brian was very helpful with directions and made the whole process super easy. We will definitely be back!
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This was the best Air Bnb! From the time we arrived we felt at home as soon as we walked in the door. We have already told family and friends about this location and how great of a host Brian was. We would love to come back again and stay here.
2023-07-01,4,Stayed one night,"Beautifully decorated. Clean and comfortable furniture. Brian communicated well and even had a bottle of wine and some beer waiting for us. And the coffee shop down the path is excellent.
The one thing to be aware of is the noise. It may have been a one-off, but the location was a stone’s throw from the main road, which made for a loud Monday morning (5:30am) with large trucks driving through. Maybe some additional weatherproofing on the sliding back doors could minimize the noise. Again it may have been our misfortune."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"Brian was very accommodating, his instructions were perfectly constructed and the place was incredible.
Brian went above and beyond when we realized we made a mistake in booking only one night and jumped in quickly to help coordinating extending my stay.
5 stars doesn't due Brian justice!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great stay. Perfect location, beautiful views, and everything you need for a weekend getaway. Look forward to staying here again!"

2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Brian’s home was so clean and cozy. These modern cabins were a perfect spot for my husband and I after our wedding. We loved this cabin!
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"brian's modern Cabin was amazing love this day, wish I could've stayed longer"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Brian's house was beautiful. We liked the new- freshness of the house. The architecture and finishes were well thought out too. Brian also left us some gifts of local products - beer and coffee - just what we needed:) The train tracks are just down the hill toward the river and we heard them in the night. The Randonnee Cafe is short walk away to a morning breakfast and coffee. We enjoyed the quiet of the location with the city of Hood River a short drive away. Thanks Brian
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"Gorgeous, comfortable and well designed space. Loved staying here to celebrate our anniversary!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place was awesome!! The cabin was incredible, it had everything we needed, the view was awesome, and Brian made us feel right at home.

2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Beautiful space, so peaceful. Very nicely built, perfect weekend getaway spot. Host was friendly and wonderful !"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"We wanted to find the perfect place to stop on our way back from a road trip to celebrate our anniversary. So happy we stumbled on this amazing spot. Not only was it the perfect location for all the adventures and wine tasting we enjoyed in the gorge but we lucked out and got to enjoy Mosier Fest right next door. After walking around and shopping with the vendors we enjoyed food, drinks and live music with the local communities. When we were ready to head back we were close enough to continue enjoying the live music from our porch while watching the sunset. All around a fantastic experience and look forward to staying here again! PS the bed was super comfortable and the kitchen had everything we needed to heat up leftover and cook what grocers we still had!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We arrived by bike to Camp Randonee via the Historic Columbia River Highway State Trail. Brian’s AirBnB is in a perfect location for access from either the trail or I 84.
The Airbnb is gorgeous - new, modern, well designed and appointed. The landscaping is also impeccable with all native plants.
The space was so relaxing and comfortable that we took the day off from cycling and lounged around! A bonus for us was the extra large gear shed that fit our tandem and camping equipment.
The Airbnb overlooks a very sweet area with a coffee shop that has outdoor seating and two darling food carts. We really enjoyed listening to music and people watching on Saturday evening from the outdoor deck. Brian left local refreshments for us that we really enjoyed.
If you want to cool down, there is a local swimming hole less than a mile away. There are also wineries, hiking trails, etc nearby.
You will not be disappointed with this Airbnb, as it is five stars, and worth every penny!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The only thing missing: Full length mirror. Great, quiet spot. Perfect."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Architecturally stunning home. Beautiful inside and out. We had views of the river and mountains through the huge front windows or from the deck. Also our own fire pit set in a lovely garden. Very clean and very comfortable. Brian left us local beer, wine and coffee! We so appreciated this. Towels, extra blankets and pillows, a very comfortable bed, everything you would need has been thoughtfully provided.
The location is great, easy to get to trails or Hood River. Wonderful coffee shop next door and a great restaurant around the corner.
Brian was easy to communicate with. We will definitely be back!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had such a wonderful few days, everything seemed brand new, worked great. Very comfortable and perfectly located close to hood river but more quiet. Loved the fire pit. We didn’t stay long enough to use the kitchen but we did make coffee and couldn’t have loved all the little touches more. Everything was perfect! We would definitely stay again."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,Thanks again!
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,My wife's new favorite Airbnb!

2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful place to stay for couples or friends that love adventure & the outdoors. Perfect location w/ so much to do in the surrounding areas. Brian & Summer did an amazing job w/ these cabins. They are quality built & furnished, and the landscaping is amazing. We enjoyed the trail along the river from Rock Creek park, watching sunset from Rowena Plateau w/ the wildflowers & mountain biking 3 different trail systems all within 30min drive!"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Such a cute spot. Easy check in, spotless home. We loved having the coffee spot to walk to and our very own parking spot. We will definitely be back."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,If I was able to give this place 6 out of 5 stars we would. This place was perfect for our family of three. We have a 2 year old and trips can be difficult when we stay in places with lots of knick nacks. This place was perfect! We were actually able to relax due to the minimalism and nothing for our toddler to get into trouble with. We will definitely be staying again :)
2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"Such an awesome place to stay. The modern cabin was super cool and nice inside, and being connected to Randonée coffee made it even better!
They made the first night of our honeymoon special with complementary drinks! Stoked on Randonée!"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We enjoyed our stay in this attractive, well designed well appointed cabin. You could see that careful attention to detail had been given to make the room clean and comfortable. Brian was a great host and communication was easy and clear."

2023-03-01,5,Stayed one night,Brian’s lovely little Scandinavian style studio was spotlessly clean. Each detail carefully curated. The heated tile of the bathroom floor was a luxurious touch. Comfortable bed. Clean high end appliances. A perfect little jewel for two.
2023-03-01,5,Stayed one night,Very beautiful modern and new build. My wife’s favorite part was the heated bathroom floors 👍
2023-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Took my son for a short ski trip to Mt Hood and we were so happy with this place. Both the architecture and the interior of the unit is beautiful, exactly as shown in the listing. Brian is a helpful and responsive host who answered all the questions I had before and after check-in. Would definitely want to come back again!"
2023-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We absolutely loved staying in this cabin and cannot wait to visit again. The place was very cool and felt super modern and comfortable. I loved the bed and the chairs. The large windows were gorgeous, and I loved being able to pull down the shades for some privacy. The heated floors in the bathroom were really nice. The kitchen had everything we needed. The place was well stocked with extra TP, towels, and coffee, which you don't always see! We walked all over town and enjoyed the nearby plateau hike. The locals were very friendly, and Hood River was a quick and easy trip. Brian, the host, was super friendly and very responsive. We felt well cared for. I highly recommend this stay!"
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Brian was SUPER helpful with our stay! The check-in was really simple with the lockbox. The ""linked"" coffee shop on the same grounds was really good. Had a great staff, and excellent oat milk lattes and we ran into Brain there. He instructed the next time we stay if we let him know ahead of time, he can have e-bikes or paddleboards waiting in the gear shed.
We plan on returning in the warmer months to do kite surfing, biking and/or paddleboarding!"
2023-02-01,5,Stayed one night,Very comfortable and private. Felt safe and was quiet. 👍🙏😃

2023-01-01,5,Stayed one night,We had a great relaxing time staying in our cabin for a night after a long day of hiking. We had everything we needed and felt completely relaxed and at home in the modern space. We will likely come back for another stay! I would highly recommend Brian's place to anyone looking for a modern retreat.
2023-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"The place was great. We got in a little late so we didnt get to enjoy it as much as we'd have liked to, but still a great stay. Good price for the room bad price for fees. Not the owners fault."

2022-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"The Randonee cabins are beautiful. It’s a
Really beautiful piece of property. The art, the furniture, the fixtures to the heated bathroom floor was all amazing. We found our selves looking out the floor to ceiling windows admiring the beautiful cabin and the landscaping. Brian is a 10 and it’s obvious he has put a lot of time and care into the cabins."
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We enjoyed our stay at Brian’s cabin..

Close to downtown Hood River, a ton of beautiful local trails, and a taco truck across the street that is excellent. Would definitely stay again!"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This was my second stay in the Camp Randonnee cabins and I continue to love it here. The cabins are wonderful - well appointed and so comfortable - and the views are gorgeous. Mosier is a fun little town with easy access to hikes all around. Brian is a wonderful and responsive host. I highly recommend!
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Quiet place, clean, great location and excellent host!"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The Cabin was super cute, clean and a great spot for a couple's getaway! We appreciated the touches of local beverages and local art!

2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Quick drive from hood river and easy to get to. Very very clean! Bedding and mattress were comfortable and we slept well. Some traffic noise but we travel with a sound machine so it wasn’t a big deal, and the nice location makes this even more worth it. Nearby coffee shop is wonderful and has friendly staff. Taco truck right across the street was very good. Host is wonderful - friendly and responsive. We loved this place and we would gladly stay here again! 10/10!"
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Fantastic.
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The cutest modern cabin that had all we needed! The space felt bigger than it was with all the amazing natural light. It had all the comforts, plus quick access to all things Gorge."
2022-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"Wonderful, bright private cabins but with a community feel. Take them up on their recommendation to check out Mosier Company for food, drinks, music and meeting the locals."
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This cabin is beautiful, clean and so cozy! We thoroughly enjoyed our stay!"
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We had an amazing time at Brian’s Camp Randonnee! Everything about the cabin was exactly as pictured (maybe even better!) and Brian was an excellent host. Would highly recommend booking!
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,What a find... we walked in to find a complimentary 6 pack of beer and a nice bottle of wine waiting for us. The place was spotless and a perfect quiet location for us to retreat after a long drive. The kitchen was stocked with coffee from the coffee shop just below the cabin. We opted to get our coffee made for us and had breakfast at the coffee shop each morning before golfing in Hood River at Eagle Crest. We want to add a shoutout to our Brian as I missed the message regarding the map misdirection and the door code being provided. He was super responsive and got back to us within minutes of us sending a message for more info.
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We came down for a quick weekend getaway and Brian’s place was exactly what we needed. It was so clean, modern, and comfy. Lots of nice little touches like local coffee and beer. We got to meet the owners and they were very nice. Will def be coming back!"
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Nestled in the tiny town of Mosier just a few miles outside of Hood River, this modern cabin has beautiful architecture and interior finishes (though dare I say seem slightly out of place for the surrounding area, but alas super clean and comfy). Great for a short few day stay for 2 people as the cabin is a studio layout. Longer term stays you may desire a full size fridge, a washer and dryer and a microwave (though the ninja countertop oven is great and possibly does all you need). That said, everything was perfect for our 3 night stay. Cute coffee shop is steps away, along with a Mexican food truck and the MoCo restaurant that were both good. Cabin is quiet with the occasional train that passes through. The backyard deck and fire pits are cozy. Just a quick drive to get to Hood River to enjoy the river front and breweries, shops and restaurants and close to hiking trails and water activities. Perfect for the outdoor enthusiast (and the shed is perfect for storing your gear). Booking was super easy and the hosts are friendly and highly communicative (even met in person when there). Highly recommend staying here, would definitely stay again!"
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My husband and I took our first trip away without our kiddos and stayed at one of Brian's cabins. We were excited from the photos online, but upon arrival, we were in agreement that the photos didn't really do it justice. The cabin is simple but done well. Very cool aesthetic and fantastic location! Having the coffee shop just beyond the fire pit was amazing. We even met Brian by chance one morning grabbing coffee and got to introduce ourselves - super rad dude. He was responsive to our text messages about some questions we had, he recommended a restaurant to us to celebrate our anniversary (which we also took him up on and was fantastic!) Really great experience. We will definitely be returning again! Thanks so much for having us, Brian!"
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very comfortable and pleasurable stay in these cabins. I love the whole design from interior to exterior to the excellent coffee shop in the front. Highly recommend to anyone looking for a getaway.
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Awesome basecamp for exploring Columbia River gorge. Would love to stay here again
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We loved our stay at Camp Randonee and we will be back! Everything about this place was wonderful and well thought out. We loved the location just beyond Hood River and access to outdoor activities. Brian was very helpful, easy to work with, and a great host."
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Really appreciate how incredibly comfortable the bed was, and well laid out the entire place was, and such an inspiring design. The Ninja oven also made cooking anything seemless - and the kitchen contained everything we could ask for. Normally when we are in Hood River we eat out every night, this time we ate in every evening to enjoy the beautiful space and patio area even more. Couldn’t believe how quiet the air conditioning unit was - We appreciated having the cabin cool upon our arrival amidst a heat wave. Thank you! Complimentary beers and wine was a nice touch too - We love Pfiem!!"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We loved our stay at Brian and Summer’s place! Cabin was super cute and charming, extremely clean, and had everything we needed for a comfortable stay. Great bay windows with a river view, cute coffee shop for morning coffee and a great little taco truck across the way for lunch. Great communication from check in to check out and everything in between. Will definitely stay here again!"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We loved our stay at this great cabin! Very comfortable with a unique setting in such a sweet little town.
Brian was great to communicate with and quick to respond. Nice to actually run into him and chat for a few minutes.
We will definitely be back again!"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Amazing amazing place and Brian is an awesome host.
Don’t miss the mosier plateau trail that’s walking distance from the cabin, and the rock creek beach just down the street.
Super comfy bed and gear garage was super handy."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Such a great experience! 5 mins from Hood River, literally steps to good coffee, tacos and beer and bike and hiking trails in town. The utility closets made storing our bikes super easy. The listing itself was immaculate and modern and cozy. Perfect place to come home too after a day of adventuring in the Gorge"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed one night,Beautiful modern cabins in the heart of Mosier. Perfect base camp for whatever Gorge adventure you have planned.
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had an excellent stay, awesome location, clean place and so much to do around Mosier and Hood River. Also really good coffee and breakfast right next door."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Fabulous place and location. We loved Mosier and Camp Randonnée was really something special.

Everything/ Every detail was thoughtful and beautiful!
Perfect😎"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed one night,Great space in a quiet location.
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The cabin was really pleasant. Full of light and open like a little modern loft. It's the perfect location for so many things - recreating or otherwise. We were there for a wedding that was at a farm in the hills above Hood River. Loved the local coffee, Randonee, and restaurant, Mosier Company. There was a live band when we were there and the food was very good. Of most note - we slept like babies. Finally, someone who understands the importance of a good mattress! Thanks Brian!!!"
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Cabin 4 is where i stayed - highly recommend it! The only negatives are the bed is more firm than i expected (not an issue, just surprising) and the motion sensitive light on the taco truck will go off in the wind, but the bed is tucked away and the blinds are solid so it's not an issue at all unless you're a night owl 🦉 The shower is awesome, the inline water heating is awesome, the space is gorgeous, and the proximity to cool stuff is great. Make sure to get a breakfast sandwich and a latte at the cafe, everything there is super good!"
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Brian’s place was super clean, brand new and along with the great design he equipped it with really great soaps, drinks etc… 10/10, would definitely recommend!"
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great location in Mosier. Definitely check out the Mosier Plateau Trail. So close you can walk to it.
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Amazing place to stay. Easy access to great coffee and food. Clean and very comfortable. We had 2 great days of biking.
2022-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"We had such a lovely stay at the cabin - it was the perfect getaway. We loved the area - such a great, modern cabin in the center of Mosier with accessible hiking trails and bike riding which we took advantage of ! The welcome package was such a sweet touch. The communication was A+ !
We will be back ! Thank you Brian !"
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place very clean and cute and cozy
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We had a wonderful stay in Hood river at Karey's Airbnb! The apartment had everything that we could possibly need during our visit. The location was magical and the bed was amazingly comfortable!!
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,It was a great stay at a beautiful location. The property and house are well-designed and extremely comfortable. Bob and Karey are great hosts and good people. We would highly recommend it.
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Perfect gateway location for all things the area has to offer. Karey is very friendly and went out of her way to make sure we had a wonderful stay.
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What an amazing location and view! The river is right outside is beautiful and accentuates this homey space perfectly. Listening to the river was so peaceful and the view from the porch is idyllic. The perfect spot for coffee in the morning and a glass of wine at night. The bed was comfortable and the kitchen is great for making easy meals at home. I also loved the roomy shower and cute bathroom sink feature. All in all this is a comfortable place to stay and the price can’t be beat for how lovely the surroundings are. I would recommend this Airbnb to anyone looking for some rest and quiet time, but it’s also in great spot to explore the Columbia River Gorge if you want to go out."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We enjoyed sharing kareys home on the river. We kept the windows open at night to hear the water and it was perfect!! Not too far from town, and your own nature reprieve to explore the gorge"
2024-04-01,3,Stayed a few nights,"Very peaceful back porch over looking the river. The bed was comfy. As mentioned, its right of a busy highway, I didn't notice the noise much but its not a walk-able location whatsoever if that matters to you. The apartment is attached to the main house, so the back deck is shared with the owners. You could hear them in their house in the evenings, they weren't loud, but its definitely not a private apartment if thats what you're looking for."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Everything about our stay was wonderful! The location was easy to get to, the back porch was super relaxing next to the river, the bed was comfortable and we had a nice chat with our host."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was a gorgeous location with the river right out the back door. Excellent back porch with rocking chairs for hours of quiet reading and contemplating. There are tons of song birds and squirrels. The Oregon grape is flowering and it was a gorgeous pop of color in the early spring landscape. The bed was comfortable with soft sheets and cozy quilts—good sleep with the sound of the river. Great shower and fluffy towels. The hosts were respectful of my privacy and super responsive. There is some noise from the busy bridge nearby, but inside the room it was barely noticeable and the sound of the river drowns out a lot of it."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We had stayed here before several years ago and so it was a natural choice because of location. It is tranquil and beautiful. It is very close to Hood River and the sound of the river instills a sense of peace.
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place a few miles outside of Hood River. We loved the porch overlooking the river. The bed was extra comfortable. Overall a great stay.
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The room and the area were beautiful
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We really enjoyed their place! The location was perfect and peaceful right by the river. It was very cozy. The shower in the place was beyond amazing A++++ My daughter and mom absolutely loved their stay. It's attached to the house as the listing says, but more than enough privacy, if anything they didn't get enough privacy from us haha, my daughter is a social butterfly and would walk over to them to chat and garden. They are very friendly hosts! I definitely recommend staying here. The listing says some highway noise, but from inside you won't here anything. I'm a super light sleeper and it never woke me up. You will more likely hear the soothing sound of the river. The location is perfect, just a 10 min drive to the main part of town and 30-45 min drive to the slopes depending on what part of Mt hood you're going to. Many hiking trails and waterfalls near by to see. Oh and they have mexican train dominoes!!
There is a good chance we will return in the future!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Cute little place! Great view of the river and the county store across the way was fun. Allowed us easy access to Mt. Hood skiing with a 40 minute drive. Comfortable and well decorated.
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Sit in a wooden rocking chair on the back porch facing Hood River while enjoyingy your drink and good conversation. Enjoy viewing the colorful birds and the soothing sounds of rushing water. This place is not only very clean but also very nice for relaxing and escaping into nature while having all the amenities of a comfortable home. It's a great value too. We've stayed there several times and plan to return again.
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,It was very good space. The river noise was restful.
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This is a sweet gem and the treats at the shop across the driveway are a perfect compliment. Close to the restaurants and other activities in town. Great view of the Hood River and beautiful oaks growing along the river. We hope to return soon!
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Wonder place with fantastic view of Hood River. Exceptional host.
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great location! Lots of space and a beautiful view of the river. Plenty of amenities for any of our needs. Thanks, Karey!"

2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My hubby and I came to town for some skiing at Timberline and couldn’t be happier to have found this charming and cozy spot for the weekend. It was very warm and peaceful, perfect after a day on the mountain.
Thank you again, Karey!
Looking forward to booking again in the future."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a great stay,. Loved the property, amenities, and under floor heating."
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was the perfect place to stay for a quiet weekend outside Hood River as a base camp for snowshoeing trips on Mt Hood. Clean, great location across from the Apple Market, and Karey was very responsive and kind. Highly recommend!"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Fantastic view of the Hood River, a Winter wonderland at this time of year. Warm, clean, cozy private place. Kitchen fully stocked. Perfect for up to 3 people. Have booked before and will do again. Exceptional hosts."
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We loved our stay with Karey and Bob. They were so sweet and helpful. We stayed here to be closer to the Hood River Hospital during a winter storm because I was 38 weeks pregnant. They made us feel right at home and offered their help several times. The place is even cuter in person. You can’t better hosts then these two in Hood River!
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Loved the beauty of the place. Very Rustic and charming
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful place, stars looked amazing at night! Very peaceful and relaxing!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was our second stay at Karey's and it was wonderful each time. Very quiet and private. Cozy and comfortable. Great bed and terrific shower. This is a perfect place for a personal retreat. There is much to do and see in Hood River and area. Or you can just hunker down in this restful, beautifully designed studio. We highly recommend it!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Stay here on your next trip to Hood River!! The property is gorgeous and not too far from the amenities in Hood River. The endless amounts of outdoor recreation nearby made us wish that we booked more nights at Karey's place. Additionally, the place was spacious and super clean. Highly recommend!!"
2023-10-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"This was a nice place that met my needs for a short stay in the area. I met Bob at check-in and he was welcoming and helpful with local recommendations.
The kitchen had all the things I needed to make meals.
One negative was that some of the surfaces were not clean. Dusty table tops in the living area, and lots of crumbs under the toaster on the kitchen counter.
Overall, I liked my stay at this cozy spot."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I loved my stay at Karey’s place! It was so cute and comfortable. The surroundings were so beautiful, quiet, and peaceful. There is the cutest little country store right next to them that had delicious ice cream and goodies. Only a 15 minute drive to the city center with lots of window shops, restaurants, winery tasting rooms, and breweries. And 10-15 minutes in other directions away from the city center we’re beautiful winery estates. I didn’t mind the driving either when it’s all beautiful to look at. And Karey was very kind and made the stay there very easy and comfortable. I would definitely stay there again 😊"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a wonderful and relaxing stay at Karey’s. It was a bit too cold to enjoy coffee on the porch in October, but the set up was comfortable and cozy. We were close to town, but still near nature with the sound of the river just outside the back door. Would definitely stay again on a future getaway."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Perfect spot to come back to after a long day of apple picking! The porch was so relaxing and the view was amazing!!

2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We enjoyed our time very much. The apartment is very clean and comfortable. The porch on the back is very peaceful. We enjoyed the Fruitloop trail and observing people at the Columbia river. We have never been to the area and found it to be a great find.

2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Very welcoming and peaceful stay, thank you!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Karey and Bob were fabulous host. The bed was comfortable it had everything we needed and a cute little market on the corner which sells the best dill mustard!

2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,Wow what an awesome place to stay! We only wish we had booked it for longer. Such a great place - cozy & peaceful. Cute little country gift store right across the lane. Close to Mt. Hood and hood River. The porch was wonderful to sip coffee and take in the sights & sounds of the river. Karey and her husband were so nice. Would love to come back again one day! I forgot a battery charger and Karey notified me within 5-10 minutes of our departure offering to ship it to my home. But we had not traveled far so we turned around to retrieve it. I was so grateful that she notified us so quickly. Highly recommend if traveling to this area.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Stellar location and hosts!

The bed was super comfortable, and we slept great. The location was an easy drive into downtown Hood River for dinner. We’d stay again!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is the perfect place to stay in the Hood River area. It's a great location, close to town but very private in a lovely, wooded setting on the river. The apartment is comfortable and nicely set up. Karen and Bob are great hosts."

2023-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,"What a beautiful stay in Hood River! Only 10-15 minutes from downtown and the drive is beautiful through many vineyards and orchards! Karey was a generous host, even purchasing a Pack n Play for our baby to sleep in!! We would return in a heartbeat. Thank you, Karey!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This creatively designed apartment is spacious and very well set up. It was a joy to look at some of the hand made furniture that adorned the apartment and the deck. Having access to a laundry room was a nice bonus. I would have been very comfortable in the cabin apartment if I had stayed longer than my short time in Hood River.
I could easily prepare meals in the kitchenette and then enjoy them while watching the lovely Hood River that flows in front of the cabin. When I left one of the windows open, I could hear the sound of the river throughout the cabin.
In April, orchards in full bloom and trails along the Columbia with lots of wildflowers are just a short drive away from the cabin.
Karey was super welcoming and had wonderful communication with me. Both Karey and Bob shared lots of ideas for getting out in the area during my stay.
This is a place that I would be glad to return to in the future."

If the weather permits, sit outside with your glass of wine and enjoy the peacefulness of your natural surroundings. The kitchen accommodates simple food preparation, the table seats dining for two, the bath towels are plush and the bed is so very comfortable. Don’t hesitate to choose this lovely Northwest cabin.
Thank you Bob and Karey for graciously hosting us every time we visit Hood River."

2023-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,Thanks for having us!
2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"Karey was a great host! She was friendly and very welcoming. She made a point to greet us and told us several times to let her know if we need anything. House was spotless and bed was comfy! Unfortunately our schedule allowed us only one night there, otherwise we would have loved to stay for multiple nights. Will plan to stay here again in the future!"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Karey’s place is gorgeous, quiet and spacious, It sits above the Hood River which you can rest in the hammock and watch and listen to along with the birds, heaven. The kitchen wa super well appointed. I love the drive from her place into town and or up the mountain through miles of orchards. This was a dream stay."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"The price was great great for a what you got. Lots of room, clean, very nice. It only has a kitchenette, but it is a much better than a comparable priced hotel room, or even a more expensive room for that matter. It’s setting is very pretty and relaxed. Great place to go enjoy the local area and what it had to offer."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,Lovely little apartment right on the River that was quiet and restful. Hosts were great and even went above and beyond to return an item we left during our stay. Would definitely recommend and would stay here again.
2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"The cabin was perfect, and both Bob and Karey are awesome. Highly recommend."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"We were delighted with the charm and location of the cabin. It overlooked the beautiful Hood River!

2023-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This is a beautiful and peaceful location that exceeded our expectations. My daughter especially enjoyed relaxing in the hammock overlooking the creek. It is also a straight shot into town for restaurants/shopping, although the kitchen made it easy for us to make our own meals using the convection oven, and electric griddle. The bed was super comfortable and I melted right into it after a day on the slopes! I look forward to visiting again when it summer!"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Bob and Karey were lovely hosts and the space couldn’t have been more ideal. With a spacious design, comfortable bed/pillows, and the Hood River rushing by outside, your worries will drift away in the PNW breeze."

2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Karey was a very accommodating host, would absolutely recommend staying with her!"
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The view and the water were the highlights. The view was right on the edge of the Hood River...included was a view of a nice arch bridge. We enjoyed sitting on the porch in the very unique rocking chairs just looking at the view and visiting. The water for drinking, showering, cooking, was spring water and was some of the best we have had in our travels. The place was nice with hardwood floors, that incredible view, a comfortable bed, and nicely done bathroom and a fairly well stocked kitchen. It wasn't that far from a busy highway but the river drowned out the sounds of the vehicles. Karey was very responsive to any needs we had. What worked best was simply knocking on her door which was just at the other end of the porch or on the other side of the shared laundry room. Messaging through the Airbnb app was effective too. This place was about 10 min from groceries in Hood River to the north and not that far from a nice view of the Mountain and some nice hiking trails to the south."
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great couples spot for ""home-base"" with so much close by to explore and venture around. Tons of great brochures and local information for recommendations right on the counter as you enter in. Love the structure and design of the space with beautiful scenery surrounding the property."
2023-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"We really enjoyed our stay here. They are both great hosts, and the apartment is lovely. It’s within 5 1/2 miles from downtown Hood River with an easy drive."
2023-02-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Good place to stay for a short visit to lovely Hood River Valley. Convenient access to Mt Hood and Hood River. Cool setting right above the river. Quiet and comfortable.
2023-01-01,5,Stayed one night,Just what we were hoping for.
2023-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"Comfortable. Peaceful. Plenty of space. Sound of river at night was nice. Karey was very clear with instructions and timely communications. As a musician, I appreciated the cigar box and lunch box guitars and some of the musical themed pics. jv"
2023-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"This was a comfortable, clean and well equipped place in a great location."
2023-01-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Very nice out of the way spot on Hood River, private, warm, cosy and had all the basics. It ended up being on the cold side of things, so we didn't get to enjoy the gorgeous deck. Everything was great, in retrospect, wish we had gotten a place a bit closer in just because food was hard to find at the late time we checked in, no fault of the host though!!"
2023-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,This is a lovely safe place to stay!
2023-01-01,5,Stayed one night,Wish I could stay on a vacation vs a work trip!
2023-01-01,5,Stayed one night,Very relaxing place! Really loved the sound of the river right out the back door.
2023-01-01,5,Stayed one night,Karey’s place was perfect for our one night stay in Hood River. Very clean and well-equipped space. The bathroom had plenty of nice towels and quality shampoo/condition/etc. The bed and futon were comfortable as well. Best place I found for the price!
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Awesome place!!! Super comfortable for 2 people, Karey made it feel like home. Maybe the only thing (which is a super big nitpick) is the saucepan was a little small to cook for 2 people, but other than that extremely minute detail everything was perfect. Highly recommend!!!!"
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We loved the place 🤗 it felt a small home away from home! We even want to model the shower like theirs! Amazing stay! And the river view is peaceful
2022-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Karey’s place was spacious, clean, and cozy. It was easily accessible. Karey’s instructions were perfect. The kitchenette area had everything I needed to prepare a few small meals - microwave, toaster, toaster oven, hot plate, and utensils. The rush of the river just below the back yard was especially enjoyable, peaceful, and relaxing. Karey and her husband were super friendly and even helped me find lodging for an additional night (their place was booked). I hope to stay at Karey’s again and highly recommend it for your stay in Hood River."
2022-12-01,5,Stayed one night,Awesome spot super nice place lots of space and had everything we needed
2022-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,Good host. Good place
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Theses folks are simply AWESOME. They even ordered a snow storm for our anniversary stay (They denied having anything to woth the snow storm, but they are Super Hosts, cabable of most anything). The river setting is simply magnificent."
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Karey was the greatest host and greeted us shortly after our arrival. She and her husband were very accomidating and gracious and the cabin felt very cozy, warm, and peaceful. A must stay in my opinion."
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My wife and I had a wonderful weekend in Hood River largely thanks to Karey’s lovely place. Easy to find, check in and out were a breeze, and it had all the amenities we could need. Highly recommend staying here for a relaxing time in beautiful Hood River."
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This is a wonderful Airbnb. Extremely comfortable. The setting is beautiful above the Hood River. Very quiet and private. And readers will love the lighting for hunkering down with a good book. This is important! Very comfortable bed and linens. We hope to stay there again!
2022-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"We really enjoyed Karey's place, and hope to stay here again! It feels like a family cabin you'd return to year after year. Wonderful hot shower, cozy home that holds in the warmth even when it's very cold outside, bright stars, and sounds of rushing water from the river just behind the cabin. We'd love to see it in the summer time, and get to enjoy the deck and hammock. It's a little ways from the main part of the town of Hood River, but we didn't mind that--it's very peaceful. We stayed here after a week on the road, and it was so nice to be able to do a load of laundry."
2022-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"Thank you for the stay , it’s was wonderful , clean and easy to locate ."
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Comfortable, clean and peaceful with a beautiful river view. Nice TV and well stocked kitchen and bathroom. Comfortable bed. We really enjoyed our stay and hope to stay there again. Awesome hosts, great communication! Much appreciated."
2022-11-01,5,Stayed one night,Karey was very flexible with us when we had an unforseen issue that prevented us from being able to make our reservation. Much appreciated!
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place is lovely, quiet and secluded. A perfect jump off to go hiking or drive to shop and enjoy. Very thankful we stayed here fall is beautiful."
2022-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"I had a great stay at Karey's place. It was too chilly to be out on the porch while I was there, but I can see it being an amazing place to hang out!"
2022-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"This place was just what we were looking for: close to Hood River, cute and comfortable, and an easy check-in process. Thanks Karey!"
2022-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Worked great for a one night trip. Beautiful location and not too far from town and other attractions. Definitely make a stop a WAAAM just around the corner, it was a great way to spend a rainy afternoon."
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was a great location along the river. Very neat, clean and comfortable. Loved the back porch and view. We had everything we needed. Would definitely stay again!"

2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Our stay at this beautiful apartment was out of this world! The setting was idyllic, the amenities were perfect and our hosts were so very lovely! We wished we would have booked an entire week!
Our hosts were so available, and offered to provide us with anything we might need.
The rocking chairs on the deck, that overlooked the River, were so comfortable and inviting. We would wholeheartedly recommend this property. Plus, the bed was divine!!!"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Very clean, comfortable and spacious. Quiet and safe. Private entrance.
Had some coffee, cream & sugar available, so if you needed it, you wouldn’t have to run out and get some right away. The shower was very nice.
Only downside was if you wanted to use the hot plate, it took a long time to heat up.
Definitely worth a return trip! Fabulous!"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed one night,My husband and I loved this little Airbnb! They were great at communicating and very kind. Would definitely recommend this place!
2022-10-01,5,Stayed one night,Lovely location. Very clean!
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Karey and Bob’s place is stunning. The hammock is the best place to start and finish your day. Bring your coffee—they’ve got a coffee maker there! No better place to sit and enjoy your morning coffee than on the shared patio. Bed is very comfortable and the towels are super soft!
2022-10-01,5,Stayed one night,Great place to stay for Columbia River Gorge and the fruit loop and wineries. Comfortable and a nice back porch with the sound of the river. The Apple store close by has great baked goods:)
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful place, just as listed and as others have described. I really appreciate the owners' disclosure about traffic noise. It abated to a trickle after ""rush"" hours and was hardly audible when inside the apartment. Fantastic setting and gracious hosts."
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The studio apartment was very roomy, homey, but tastefully furnished, and sparkling clean. We only wished we had a whole week there to really enjoy the location and amenities. The best surprise was the deck overlooking the Hood River. There is nothing between you and the river but the wooded river bank! Plus rockers and a hammock to use.
Karey is a wonderful host, providing privacy but generously sharing her home. Check-in and communication was easy and trusting. I highly recommend a stay with her."
2022-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"What a cozy, charming and comfortable stay ! Karey was very communicative. We absolutely enjoyed the backyard that faced the river. Clean property and comfortable bed ! We highly recommend this property for your stay."
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"If you want a laid-back atmosphere, this is the place. We felt so relaxed and absolutely loved sitting on the deck, drinking coffee, and listening to Hood River pass by. It is stocked with everything you need and is a comfortable, spacious area. We would definitely stay here again."
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We loved our stay at Kerri‘s apartment. The unit is beautiful and very well appointed. The kitchen had everything we needed and the open floor plan felt spacious and airy. Our favorite part, of course, was the back porch that overlooks the lovely Hood River. We spent a good portion of our time in the rockers and the hammock listening to the soothing sounds of the river. The unit was also perfectly located For our trips into town and for exploring the plethora of wineries, cideries and fruit stands in the area. We highly recommend this rental to anyone who wants to visit this lovely part of Oregon and we look forward to a return visit next time we are in the area."
2022-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"Airbnb was as pictured. Plenty of space and nicely stocked kitchen. Really enjoyed the deck and sitting overlooking the river. There is some traffic noise while on the deck but very quiet inside. Karey kept us informed and responded quickly. This apartment is attached to their home but your privacy is respected. We didn’t even see them once, which was too bad because I’m sure they are lovely people. We would stay here again."
2022-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"Wonderful spot, very clean, comfortable bed, relaxing environment, enjoyed the porch overlooking the river. Would stay again!"
2022-09-01,4,Stayed one night,Very spacious and good value just a bit too dark outside when arriving to check in.
2022-09-01,5,Stayed one night,What an adorable place! We loved it! And definitely eat at their son's BBQ restaurant in nearby Parkdale.
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"LOCATION: Perfect for exploring Columbia River Gorge and Mount Hood. Easy to find and close to Hood River amenities.
APARTMENT: Very clean and comfortable. Décor is ‘rustic’, but finished to a very high standard. Kitchen is very well equipped. There is no cooker, but the microwave/hotplate/mini oven are more than sufficient. Lovely outside area, overlooking the river. Very comfortable bed for a great night’s sleep. Photos do not do the apartment justice.
SERVICE: The pre-arrival communications were very clear and helpful. It was easy to get into the apartment. We met Karey’s partner and we had a pleasant quick chat. We knew they were around if needed, but they didn’t bother us. You can tell Karey has really thought about her guest’s needs when setting up the apartment. Lots of information on local attractions.
WOULD I STAY AGAIN? For sure!"
2022-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"Absolutely loved the place! Great view of the river and the bridge right from the back door or the awesome hammock and rocking chairs on the porch. Sadly only stayed one night and were very busy with a wedding, but we already have talked about coming back another time to enjoy spending more time there! The bed was extremely comfy, and that mountain spring water was delicious!"
2022-09-01,5,Stayed one night,Karey’s place was perfect! We booked it for a one night stay for a friend’s wedding near by and it was even better than the pictures show. Very clean and spacious and right on the river so you can hear it with the windows open. Communication with Karey was also very easy and accurate. Bed was very comfortable and space was very quiet. My only con was that we woke up to the smell of bacon but yet didn’t have any ourselves! Would recommend if you love sitting outside in the morning in peace while you sip coffee.
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"A perfect place to stay when visiting Hood River! It was clean, quiet, and close enough to town. Our favorite part of the trip was being able to sit on the porch and drink a cup of coffee while listening to the river. Not knowing the area, we loved having a basket of brochures on the counter for local activities and a suggestion list of places to eat!"
2022-09-01,5,Stayed one night,clean and cozy room. friendly and helpful host. we enjoyed our stay
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Perfect location between downtown and many of the local orchards and wineries. Karey's place is spacious and charming.

2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Wonderful people on a beautiful property. The hosts were responsive and more than accommodating. We got to chat with the hosts a few times and they are certainly inspiring and humble people.

2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful spot by the river, the back porch was the place to be, swaying on the hammock reading a book."
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Karey’s place was perfect! My husband and I were in town for a wedding and her place was the perfect location. We enjoyed having our morning coffee on the porch overlooking the hood river. We even took the trail down to the river and jumped in to cool off. Karey and her husband Bob were so welcoming and wonderful to communicate with! It was a beautiful getaway and we would definitely recommend to others!
2022-08-01,5,Stayed one night,Definitely would stay here again. A real cool spot. Wish we had stayed longer!
2022-08-01,5,Stayed one night,Super cute studio style apartment. kept very clean and amazing backyard views of the river . Would def stay again .
2022-08-01,4,Stayed one night,this was a comfortable stay in a nice location.

2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"10/10, will book again.

2022-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great cabin away from town, which led to us thinking of eating and visiting Parkdale…which we LOVED! Away from the crowds, beautiful drive with views of Mount Hood. The cabin had everything we needed and Bob and Karey are very nice and helpful. We will stay again!"

2022-07-01,5,Stayed one night,Karey’s place was perfect for our quick stay in Hood River. I don’t think the photos do this home justice. The views from the porch are beautiful and the sounds of the river are relaxing. Very clean and bigger than I expected.
2022-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"Beautiful spacious private area in cabin with porch overlooking the river. Loved relaxing in the rocking chairs and hammock in the evening/morning. Nicely equipped kitchen (but didn’t use during our 1 night stay). No A/C but with open windows and fan, it felt cool enough and we slept well. I am a light sleeper and was worried about outside noise/light with windows open but it was very dark and quiet outside. Able to do a small load of laundry which was nice after a few days on the road. Wish we had been able to stay longer. Would definitely stay again if in the area."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Nice, spacious, one room efficiency, attached to the main house. Private entrance on the Hood River.
Just about 5 miles from main Hood River, easy access to town, the Fruit Loop, and great ice cream at the Apple Valley Store.
There is no A/C which is not a problem unless it gets over 95 and 105! Which it did."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We had an amazing stay! The apartment is very spacious and comfortable with a beautiful view on the back deck. Location is great with quick and easy access to town and hiking trails. Karey was kind and gave us some wonderful recommendations for things to do in the area. We wouldn’t hesitate to visit again.

Highly recommend staying with Karey on your travels to Hood River."

2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,If you are looking to stay around Mt Hood then you need to stay here! The place is clean and very large. Sitting in the rocking chairs overlooking the river was a great way to start and end the days. Close to everything in the area. Has everything you could need for your stay. Shower was great with lots of hot water and the bed was super comfy. Loved it and would want to go back!
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Karey's place is in a great location. it was the perfect place to stay while we were in Hood River for a wedding.
2022-07-01,5,Stayed one night,Great view. Had a wonderful stay.
2022-06-01,5,Stayed over a week,"Our second, and longer, stay at Karey’s roomy, comfortable, and we’ll-equipped studio was even better than our first. Our young grandkids are close by, and after a sometimes all-day visit with them or a long walk/hike while exploring the local terrain it was the perfect place for a refreshing respite - and right on the river, just as advertised. Hope to return again and again."
2022-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great location, communication, and value!"
2022-06-01,5,Stayed one night,Enjoyed my stay! The house backs up to Hood River and has a great view from the back deck! Definitely recommend.
2022-06-01,5,Stayed one night,Karey’s place is gorgeous! It is the perfect apartment space to use with anything you need and lots of charming touches. The back porch view is phenomenal as it overlooks the river and has a hammock and chairs to enjoy the space. Really lovely stay!

2022-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Reviews are totally accurate, this is a lovely place to stay. If you're a light sleeper bring a sleep-mask and earplugs. Otherwise there's nothing not to love."
2022-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"The airbnb was beautiful, clean, welcoming and as described. Karey was very responsive to my questions (e.g. I am allergic to feathers: are there alternatives to the down comforter - not an issue, not used in the summer) and understanding when our plans changed from two nights to one. My only complaint is that we didn't have enough time there to enjoy it as fully as we might have: I would have preferred changing from one night to two but our other plans didn't allow for that. The hammock, especially, with the sound of the Hood River rushing by, was a perfect spot for a few moments meditation and relaxation. I really, really hope to be back."
2022-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Beautiful, clean, Airbnb space."
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Karry’s place was wonderful for our stay. It was very quiet and comfortable. It had everything we needed, and it was close to a lot of bars and restaurants in hood river. I would highly recommend staying here. We would love to come again."
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Lovely place right on a roaring river not too far from the scenic Columbia River Gorge. Wish the weather had been a tad warmer so we could really enjoy the outdoor hammock.

2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,absolutely wonderful space. one of the best places sit and have cock while you're listening to the river.
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great location. The owners are very accommodating. There is a wonderful view of the river from the back deck.
2022-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"I had a wonderful stay at Karey's home in Hood River. It was incredibly beautiful, right by the river, and very lovely inside with plenty of space. The hosts were very responsive and friendly as well.
WiFi worked great; I was able to connect and do work without issue!
Strongly recommend this spot to anyone who has the chance to visit Hood River!"

2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What a Magical, peaceful place. The view of Mt Hood is even better than the photos on the web site. The place is cozy and comfortable (and very clean). Patricia was a very gracious host."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This property is in a beautiful location. We enjoyed our morning coffee on the private patio with a view of Mt Hood as the sun was rising. Also, all the birds! We enjoyed watching all of the hummingbirds dive in and around. Lots to do in the area. We took advantage of several hikes and a wine tasting at nearby Hawkins winery. Also had several nice meals out including pizza night at the White Salmon Bakery. All in all a great three night getaway and we hope to return soon."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Amazing place with an amazing view! Hosts were great. Hopefully we make it back to stay again.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This is a really special place. The photos really don’t do it justice. One of my favorite Airbnbs. Hope to be back!
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Absolutely incredible location. The views are stunning - even better than the pictures! Patricia's guest home was well-equipped, clean, and comfortable. The space was just the right size for a relaxing getaway for two. The location is fairly private. The bed was very comfortable - we slept like babies. The shower has good water pressure. Patricia was an excellent host - very friendly, proactive, and responsive. We can't wait to come back!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Unfortunately, wildfires blocked the views of the gorge for our first couple of days staying here. But, that may have made that view even more special once clearing! The hummingbirds (and other birds) are bonus. Patricia’s place is very clean and tidy. As described/shown, the kitchen is small and limited, but we felt the sacrifice was worth it for those views. Highly recommend for 2 people!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed about a week,"What an incredible location. We've stayed in many airbnbs in the Columbia Gorge, and this is our new favorite!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Lovely, private studio with awesome views. Better than the pictures."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We had a wonderful time at this amazing spot. Highly recommend!
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We enjoyed one night out of our planned 3 nights at Patricia's place. Unfortunately our trip was cut short due to a major wildfire in the area and we were asked to evacuate. However Patricia was extremely kind and refunded back the entire stay. The AirBnb that Patricia built is truly a labor of love with great views, cute garden spaces and access to a lot of beautiful nature. I wish Patricia and family all the best and hope they are able to recover from the devastating impact of the fire. Thank you for letting us share your beautiful home with us."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Amazing view!
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Cant say enough about this place. Most beautiful view I’ve ever seen, affordable, just a few minutes away from amazing hikes, restaurants, breweries, etc. The host is incredibly accommodating and made our experience great. The place had every amenity you could think of. If I’m in the area again I will certainly be looking to stay here."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Patricia’s place is stunning! The most gorgeous view of any Airbnb I have stayed in. Beautiful outdoor space for breakfast and dinners. We really enjoyed watching the sunsets. Highly recommend!!
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,AMAZING views right from the patio and from the main windows! You’re surrounded. Lovely landscaping and tons of wildlife to keep you entertained like chipmunks and birds. The inside is very clean and has all you need. The one issue is that the internet isn’t the greatest. You may have to hotspot the to your phone if you’re trying to stream something from a laptop for example. Either way this is a very peaceful place to stay.
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Patricia was great and the location has amazing views. The pictures don’t come close to how amazing it is. Spent most of the trip just hanging out on the back porch. I will definitely come back and stay again.
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Wonderful stay! Kind but unobtrusive hosts.
Nature nature nature! Saw wild turkeys, birds of prey, birds and hummers at their feeders and butterflies.
It just doesn’t get better than gazing at Mt Hood throughout the day!
The unit is clean well stocked and bed is comfortable with nice linens
Highly recommend and I will definitely return!"
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What a spectacular retreat!! The views are phenomenal, and our hosts thought of everything to make the guest house a perfect home away from home. I can’t say enough about what a memorable stay we had!"
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a wonderful stay at Patricia's guest house!! The views are unbelievable and the unit was very comfortable and well appointed. It is only a short drive to the town of Hood River, where we spent a lot of our time. Be sure to check out the great pamphlets and books on the area that she has in the unit!"
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This Airbnb is the most relaxing retreat. I cannot imagine a better view anywhere in the world. Patricia and her husband are very kind. I cannot recommend this place high enough.
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I truly cannot say enough great things about this AirBnB and Patricia. This AirBnB is conveniently located about an hour from Portland, right across the river from Hood River, OR and minutes away from White Salmon, WA (great pizza spot and baking company!) and some great little wineries. Easy to get to with detailed check-in instructions and tons of information provided about the area. Patricia was extremely communicative, and we even got to meet her for a few minutes and she was lovely. The view is absolutely amazing! You will definitely want to spend some time on the patio having breakfast or dinner. Would definitely recommend this property to anyone, and we hope to make it back sometime!"
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Absolutely amazing stay. The best Airbnb I’ve ever been to. Nice private entry to a well equipped newer build guest house. Amazing view! Close enough to town for easy access to dinner and activities.
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is was a top top stay for me at any Airbnb anywhere! Was nicely built, very clean, cozily furnished, and a perfect base for Hood River exploration, especially to then come home in the evening and watch the sun set over an epic view with a glass of wine in hand. The premise, the views, and owner (I spoke with Patricia) are all just lovely."
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The view is fabulous, the birds entertaining, spotless place, everything you need. Great hosts...highly recommend!"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful stay!! Could not say enough about the property and host, had an amazing time"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Absolutely loved this place. So charming and with the most magical view over the gorge. Would recommend and will definitely come back.
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What a magical place! Patti and Mike are gracious hosts who have thought of everything in this spacious, immaculate, and well-appointed studio. They even arranged for a ""super moon"" to appear on the night of our arrival (lol). Seriously, the accommodations, the gardens, and the views of the Columbia Gorge and Mt. Hood are stunning. We brought astronomy binoculars and spent every evening on the terrace gazing at the stars. The bird action is also remarkable, from the smallest hummingbirds to raptors close enough to hear their wings flap overhead. You'll also want to bring some prepared meals with you, because the best restaurant in the world can't compete with the views. (We read ahead of time that there wasn't a stovetop, but there's a microwave, fridge, and everything else you might possibly need so it's easy enough to plan ahead.) We will absolutely be back."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had an amazing stay at Patricia's cottage. It was the perfect setting for a complete reset from work and life in the city — unplugged, read, wrote, drew.
The views are breathtaking: waking up to Mount Hood, ejoying bruch on the patio overlooking the Columbia, playing cards at the dining table as birds party at the feeders, and stopping mid-conversation as a bald eagle floats by.
Patti is a wonderful host — welcoming and helpful. The cottage is lovely...
Great touches include a sound machine, comfortable bed, two separate luggage racks and hanging spaces in the foyer area, and a well-curated selection of books and magazines.
We look forward to another visit."
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Found this gem as I was working a couple days on the road. Pictures don’t do the view justice… it’s like a freaking painting in two directions. Patricia was very communicative and directions were easy to follow. Everything was as good as advertised. Verizon cell service worked fine, as did wi-fi. It’s essentially a studio so any more than a couple and a small child might be tough.
Property and experience overall was a delight. Hope to make it back someday when I’m not on the clock and can enjoy the town or the outdoors."
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Easy check-in, comfortable house, and most of all incredible location and views! Highly recommended!"
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Patricia’s home is beautiful and we greatly enjoyed our time there. The space is perfect and so many great touches. The garden space and view are absolutely spectacular. We are already looking forward to our next stay.
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Patricia's guest house is one of the most amazing airbnbs I've ever been to. The view is magical, absolutely stunning. cannot be beat. Patricia and her husband were very welcoming and helpful during my stay"
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place is amazing!! It has everything you need for a comfortable stay and the hosts were very helpful & communicative. The hosts live on site but your area feels very private & they are respectful of your space. And of course, the views are absolutely mind blowing! Can’t beat waking up to a view of Mt Hood :)"
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful garden, stunning view and very comfortable, stylish accommodations. The private patio overlooking the Gorge was a highlight. We’ll be sure to book again when back in the area."
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place has got to be in the top 10 best views in the entire world! Absolutely phenomenal! Patti and Mike were incredible hosts, everything was perfect! I’ve been raving about it to everyone I know! Will be returning next year for sure!"
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Such a spectacular location and a perfect Airbnb for two people (or two people plus a kid). Patricia is a wonderful host and this guesthouse has everything you need plus breathtaking views. We just wish the weather cleared enough for us to fully see Mt Hood over the four days we were there! The view would’ve been amazing.
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What a find! We could not get enough of the beautiful view! The guest house was super clean, it felt brand new! We will definitely be back!"
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Wow, the view will knock your socks off! This was one of the best stays I’ve ever had on Airbnb. The listing is very accurate but still doesn’t describe just how nice the view of Mt Hood and the Gorge are from the windows and patio. We also enjoyed watching all the birds come visit their beautiful garden and bird feeders. It’s super close to hikes and to White Salmon/Hood River. I read ahead of time that there’s only a microwave so we planned our meals to keep that in mind but otherwise, it’s fully equipped with everything you need including the world’s fluffiest towels. I highly recommend visiting and I can’t wait to come back."
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Amazing view! Lovely studio and beautiful garden. Wake up to Mt. Hood!
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This guest house is perfect for two to enjoy amazing views (best I have seen at any AirBNB). It is very cozy and has easy access to all of the Mt Hood, and Mt Adams hiking trails and activities. I would stay again in a heartbeat!"
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The best Airbnb ever!! The view is amazing and our hosts were friendly and helpful. The home itself is beautiful inside too with lots of extra touches to make for a fantastic vacation. Definitely recommend a stop here if you want to relax and enjoy the view
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This is a beautiful place to stay for some rest and relaxation. We can’t wait to go back!
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Thoughtfully designed and well-appointed guest house with absolutely stunning views of the Columbia Gorge. Perfect basecamp for hiking, biking and all other outdoor activities in the area. My wife and I had dinner reservations for our anniversary, but instead got the meal to go and took it back to the guest house patio to enjoy the view."
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This is such a gem of the Columbia River Gorge. The view can’t be beat and the house is very clean and quaint. The beautifully manicured garden attracts lots of pretty birds and elevates the already stunning view. We highly recommend this Airbnb!!
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Absolutely wonderful guesthouse with an unbelievable view of the Columbia River and Mt. Hood. We sat on the porch for hours taking in the view. The guesthouse was clean, inviting, and has everything you need. The location is perfect for exploring Hood River, Mt. Hood, Mt. Adams, and the surrounding area. Will definitely book again!"
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This was the most amazing place to stay. The views are breathtaking and the gardens are a delightful bonus. Patricia and Mike were kind hosts who made us feel welcomed and appreciated as guests. We highly recommend staying here for an unforgettable Gorge experience. This place exceeded our expectations and left us excited to visit again.
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Renting this space was one of the best decisions of our trip to the Gorge! If we didn't have a goal to hike everyday, we would have been just as happy to stay at the Guest House to read books, watch the birds outside and look at the view. It is peaceful, clean, and is stocked with every needful thing most people would need. I've rented airbnb's around the world and this has been my favorite rental. Highest marks!"
2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great location!! Amazing views. Wonderful hosts!! This place reminded us of our honeymoon spot in the Isle of Skye, Scotland !"
2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Come for the views, stay for the bird watching! This is truly a gem of the Gorge."
2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Thank You Patty and Mike,
We had a fabulous time at your guest house. The view was magnificent! It was like waking up with the Gods. It was just what we needed to rejuvenate and revive our spirits. Beautiful weather, Mount Hood at the edge of our bed and happy birds frolicking everywhere…A slice of Heaven.
“Rest”assured we will be back…
Terry and LuAnn"
2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Overall, we had a great experience here! Patti and Mike were very friendly hosts. The guesthouse looks brand new and is very well stocked and organized. The view from the guesthouse is incredible, and not just because of the amazing view of the gorge and Mt. Hood - they also have a beautiful garden you can enjoy from inside or on the patio. There's not much immediately nearby aside from a few wineries, but White Salmon and Hood River are only about a 10 minute drive away, and it makes for a great home base for exploring the gorge."
2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Upon arrival we we’re welcomed by Patti, she and her husband were very nice and accommodating. The directions given to their place were clear and precise, their guest house was very clean, tidy and cozy, the views from the guest house were stunning where in you can see Mt. Hood on a clear sunny day. Patti would check up on us now and again which was really very thoughtful of her. I would definitely highly recommend this place."
2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Very clean, cozy, and an absolutely spectacular view. Close to everything the Gorge has to offer. Patricia was very helpful and responsive communicating through both the app/email. I would definitely come back and stay again!!! Highly recommend staying with Patricia."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very good place with all the amenities
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We had a great stay here! It accommodated our needs with our two little cavapoos that we needed. We were able to check in earlier than expected which we didn’t do since we had already made plans until the designated check in. We did learn the grass wasn’t able to be attended to so it was slightly overgrown and my littlest guy ended up with tumbleweed like sticks in his hair since he likes to sit a lot. The yard is not fenced in which is stated, but would have been even more ideal for our pups but we managed fine.
Mentioned they could not find garage opener but had already stated street parking if I recall. The garage seemed quite small anyway and if you parked in front of garage it blocks sidewalk.
Street parking wasn’t the best but not the worst, we parked directly across in a parking lot (which noticed others park overnight) so we could keep eye on our vehicle which worked out fine for what it was. Walking distance to Mesquitery. Would def stay again!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This house is older and in a busy neighborhood but it’s also clean, cute and comfortable. We were in town for a family party at The Ruins which is a five minute drive away. We especially liked walking over to the Indian Creek trail with our dogs-there’s an easy access point about a block away. Host was very responsive."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Cool little house, very well situated!"
2024-05-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Great place and easy to find! Alisha was a great host!
2024-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"It was already our second stay at Alisha's house. Wonderful place, spotless clean, has everything needed for living. Wonderful, helpful and very friendly host. Definitely will come back again when visiting this area again."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Interior house was cute and location was great. Walkable distance to a few restaurants. Host was responsive to an item we left behind. Thank you!
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Thank you, Alisha, for such a good place to stay. The house is really good, cozy and comfortable. Has everything needed for living, with good design. It can be clearly seen that the host cares a lot about the guests and their comfort. Very clean and tidy. We even decided to book 2 more days for our next trip."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Wonderful choice. Small home, very well utilized space. Had everything we needed. Just as described. Two very friendly coffee shops less than a block away. Comfy beds with high quality linens. We really, really enjoyed it and would love to go back"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Very cute house. Easy walk to downtown. Lots of cute shops and places to eat in immediate area. Beds were comfortable, house was clean. Great bakery, tap house, and plant shop right up the road."
2024-03-01,4,Stayed with a pet,"We enjoyed our stay. People who stay here should understand that ""Hood River Heights"" is a noisy mixed commercial + residential area at the top of the hill on the way out of town and along the main drag to Mt. Hood area etc. During previous stays, we stayed closer in to town, and this particular house is right on a busy intersection and looks quite run down on the outside (garbage chucked into the unkempt lawn) and does not have any fence or privacy.
The inside, though, is very thoughtfully set up with comfortable beds, flat screen tv, nice cozy bedding, etc. We did find the kitchen to have basics but missing some essential items like a ladle for soup for people who actually cook here. There are some nice things to walk to, like the popular Pine Street Cafe, and a fancy dog store. Walking, otherwise, was a challenge with no sidewalks through the residential neighborhood.
Investing in the exterior or fence would help families and people with dogs feel more comfortable relaxing here."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Clean, comfortable, and convenient! Would also recommend guests visit The Mesquitery for delicious meal--"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We had a very nice time in this home. Parking was easy on the street. My sister was wishing she had brought her sewing machine to shorten the curtains and shower curtain but still is a very nice place. We would choose it again if we have the opportunity!
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,We both really enjoyed our stay here and would definitely book again in the future. Very clean with amenities listed. Area is walkable with short drive to waterfront.
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great place, super clean, super cute & comfortable. Everything was easy. Would definitely book again. Thanks so much!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great central location and very comfortable place with great communication.
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Alisha’s place was wonderful! Made for a very comfortable stay and a great starting point for exploring the Columbia River Gorge and Mt Hood

2024-02-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Lovely space within a few steps of a great bakery, market, coffee and other food. Easy walk to downtown Hood River. Highly recommended."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We had a great stay at Alisha’s. Walking distance from several restaurants and shops. We walked to the Pine St. Bakery each morning for breakfast. We had great nights of sleep with the black out curtains and the really comfortable beds and bedding. While we didn’t cook at all during our stay, it looked like the kitchen was well appointed with everything you’d need. Our dog and kiddo enjoyed the yard, and we of course picked up our poop! The heating sources in the house worked great. And check in and out was really easy and convenient with the key pad. We’d definitely stay again."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Great location and spotless rental - perfect for a quick Mt. Hood or Hood River getaway for family of 4
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"A really quaint cottage - compact, well-decorated, comfortable and clean! A convenient location to some restaurants and our favorite Hood River bakery (Pine Street), but it is on a main road and next to some less smart buildings. It wasn't too noisy though, and felt safe enough. Overall a very nice stay."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Lovely spot for a quick trip from PDX.
2024-01-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Perfect place for a weekend getaway. Close to walking trails for the dogs. Really good bakery/coffee a couple blocks away. Easy commute to downtown. Would stay here again.
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Cute, clean and cozy."
2024-01-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This is a nice little house and my wife and I would stay there again. Good amenities, including dog-friendly and two bathrooms. We try to visit Hood River frequently from our home on the Olympic Peninsula in WA. We are familiar with the Heights neighborhood and knew what the surroundings would be like going in."
2024-01-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We had a great time staying at Alisha’s place. The home is in a cute neighborhood close to restaurants, bars, and coffee shops, all walking distance. The home was very cute and clean, we would definitely love to stay there again on our it next trip to
Hood River!"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"My husband, dogs and I loved this home. It was very homey and was a perfect vibe for our quick vacation we wanted. We will definitely be staying again the next time we visit hood river."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Great location right in the Heights of Hood River. Walkable and near some of our favorite spots for food, coffee and beer. Quiet yet right in a great location."

2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Place was very clean. Super close to a couple cute cafe’s and bakeries! Definitely would stay again!
2023-12-01,5,Stayed about a week,"we loved our stay! the bed was extremely comfortable and we loved all the little amenities including the fully stocked kitchen, extra large shampoo and body wash, and the little gas fireplace. the house is walking distance to some nice places including an amazing bakery and a steak restaurant.
we would highly recommend this place to anyone looking for a cute and cozy place to stay in hood river :)"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Alisha’s BnB was the perfect place for a long weekend away from home for 2 adults, 1 teen, 1 senior dog and 2 4-month old puppies. The BnB had all the comforts and amenities we needed to relax and enjoy Thanksgiving. It is located near coffee shops, a great pet store, a bakery and a few restaurants (though we preferred to drive to town and The Hook area for some grub). It is walking distance from an easy hiking trail that is dog friendly so we were able to enjoy the autumn sunshine and crisp cold outdoor temps too! Alisha is super responsive, friendly and flexible. We would def come back and re-book her BnB again."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Served our needs well! 5 min drive to the downtown area. The place was very clean and had lots of room. Alisha was very responsive too!
2023-10-01,2,Stayed with a pet,"The location was great for walking to businesses, and the inside of the house was cute(I love older houses). I was nervous when I saw the yard. Unfortunately the house had not been cleaned well or much at all. The kitchen had someone else’s food left on the dish rack, fridge shelves, and sponge. The couch had noodles on it, and quite a bit of I’m not sure what between the cushions. The headboard had food on it when I went to bed. And the pillows had big wine stains under the cases. Under the bed had a square where it hadn’t been cleaned and was quite thick. I had a hard time relaxing in the house and felt lucky I was away for work most of the day. Alisha was very apologetic and easy to communicate with about the issues."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with a pet,would stay there again
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with a pet,We really enjoyed our stay at Alisha's home. We slept great! Great kitchen for cooking. Little communication was necessary and check in was easy with a code door lock. Location was convenient and close to stores.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Enjoyed our stay at Alisha's place! Clean, comfortable, and has a sweet backyard for the pup. Street parking is easy, and the house is just a few minutes away from downtown. Alisha is a great communicator and always quick to respond. Would recommend!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This house was beautifully decorated, clean, well located. There were lots of restaurants walking distance and just a short drive to downtown. We felt so at home staying here and would love to stay again!"
2023-10-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Cute house inside. All new! Close to one good dinner place/bar and one delicious bakery. It is 1.5 miles to walk to downtown. There are no Hubers or Lyfts in HR. Don’t drink and drive! The yard is not pretty. It needs some love. It was too spendy in my opinion.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Alisha was an awesome host! She was very easy to communicate with, left fantastic inetructions, and made the overall experience extremely easy!
The house is lovely, very quiet and with enough room for 4 people comfortably. The house is in a great location, walking distance to several restaurants and a short drive to downtown hood river.
Overall, a great place to spend a weekend and a fantastic host to help!"

2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Lovely home, comfortable beds, great AC during a very hot stay and a good home for our 2 children. We are familiar with the Hood River area and knew we would be staying in a pretty busy area, our only complaint would be lots of traffic (could not be heard from inside, only when outside) and not a great outdoor space, but that was fairly easy to work around. Alisha was very responsive through the trip."

2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This ranks among the best places we've stayed. Great location and amazing surroundings. The accommodations are perfect for a couple's weekend getaway, or even a longer stay. We were talking about what we would improve, and there really isn't anything we'd change. When you go, I hope the weather cooperates so you can sit on the swing out on the deck. I don't remember if the listing mentions this, but you do have to climb a flight of outside stairs to get to the door. We had no trouble with this, but something to be aware of if you have mobility issues."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Lovely place with beautiful deck. Outside of town on a quiet street.
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Wonderful studio! The big deck and open yard made it feel like you were on your own private farm.

2024-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"My dogs and I really enjoyed our stay, and the fenced yard was a wonderful surprise along with the local wildlife. Close to hiking areas and town. Would highly recommend."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"My husband, 2 month old, dog, and I stayed at Laurie’s place for 2 nights. It was the perfect size for our little family and a great location for the activities we had planned while there. The property was beautiful and great for our dog to run around in the mornings / evenings. Laurie was very responsive and kind (even offered a pack -n- play for our baby). We would definitely stay here again!!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"my wife, dog, and I really enjoyed our stay. Laurie's place is quiet and a wonderful place to stay. we've already shared with friends how much we enjoyed staying there."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Laurie’s home and yard are beautiful, large, green and located in a wonderful area of small farms , homes on acreage and orchards. The apartment we stayed in is in the back and up some stairs, which allowed for a lot of privacy when we wanted it. Laurie was very friendly and available and also gave us some good recommendations for hikes in the amazing Columbia River Gorge area. We would stay there again in the future if we go to the Hood River area again."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This is a great place to stay in Hood River. The place is clean, cozy, and has been thoughtfully stocked and decorated. We even found snacks waiting for us. The deck is surrounded by beautiful trees and a peaceful atmosphere. Laurie is very kind and helpful, but she’s also respectful of her guests’ privacy. We will definitely be back!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Laurie's place was so inviting, well appointed. In a serene location yet close to town and not far from some great hikes and waterfalls. This was the cleanest place I have ever stayed and the others were clean. Soft sheets and blankets. comfortable bed and a nice couch to relax on after a long day. This is a great place to stay and if we are in the area again we will stay at Laurie's."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,We had a great time staying a few nights there with our dogs. They had a blast. Great people and great place! We will be back!
2024-01-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This was the perfect home base to explore the Hood River area! Not far from town, close to the gorge attractions and it was so homey inside. The space was so clean and better than it looked in the pics and I didn’t realize the fenced area is their entire property! Probably more than an acre for my dog to explore, she loved her time here. She is an apartment dog so didn’t get that kind of independence at home. Only complaint is the bed frame is verrrrry squeaky and did wake me up a couple times during my stay. Highly recommend this place!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Laurie was an exceptional host, always available if we had questions. The quiet and serene studio located up a flight of outdoor stairs had gorgeous views of the farm and surrounding pines. The studio was impeccably decorated with inspiring paintings of Mount Hood and Mount Adams. The layout of the studio was exactly what we wanted: a pleasant and roomy living/sitting area with a large screen, a full kitchen with dishes amply supplied, a lovely table for dining, a sense of privacy for sleeping located right around the corner, with beautiful linens and comfy blankets, and the bed was THE MOST COMFORTABLE BED I have ever slept in. We got the best rest, peace, and restoration ever! We are walkers and thoroughly enjoyed the walk into town with Mount Adam on the left and Mount Hood on the right. Nothing could have been better than the hospitality we received! We definitely hope to stay here again on our next trip to visit the grandchildren. Thanks so much, Laurie, for all!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Cozy studio in a country setting yet, close enough to hiking and town with a myriad of activities. Laurie was very friendly and a wonderful host. The studio was warm and lovely. Would definitely stay again. My dog and I lived meeting her “grandog”."

Laurie was a great host, always very responsive."

We had everything we needed and the room was nice and secluded with a private entrance that was easy to figure out. We appreciated the communication and help prior to our arrival and during our stay. Would definitely visit again!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Thank you Laurie for being such a great host. We really appreciated your friendliness and helpfulness, yet giving us lots of opportunity to come and go and be on our own.

The space is convenient, there is a small fridge, microwave and enough in the kitchen to heat up food for yourself. There is a hot plate in the cupboard but we did not need to use it. Nice shower, comfortable bed and a couch that is suitable to sleep on. And Netflix! If I had brought my dog there would be plenty of room out in the gated yard for them to walk around etc. but there is wildlife, so they need some monitoring. It is ez entrance with keypad and space for parking."
2022-09-01,5,Stayed one night,Great place to stay.
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"In the past I have chosen a downtown location thinking that might be more convenient. Now I know that
staying only a few minutes out of town on a farm is the way to go. The setting here is spectacular and very quiet. What a pleasant experience to end the day out on a private deck while sitting on a swing looking at a beautiful grove of very tall pines."

2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Laurie and Roger were very friendly and welcoming during our stay. Before arriving they gave us a heads up that they were in the middle of construction on the front of their place. This did not disrupt our stay in any way. All the amenities were provided and the location was perfect. It was wonderful to bring our dog along and for a large property to walk around on.
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Fantastic stay. The room had everything that we needed to be comfortable and the location was convenient for Hood River and local activities like apple picking. The back yard was wonderful for walking and seeing the chicken coop. We would definitely stay again!
2021-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Laurie’s was the perfect place for my family of 4 to stop and rest after we flew into Portland for a family road trip into California. It’s clean, comfortable, and relaxing. It has all the essentials that you need and is close to town so you can pick up dinner, etc. My 10 year old love playing in her backyard, looking at the chickens and picking raspberries!"

If we ever come back to Hood River area, we will absolutely stay here again!"
2021-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great place to stay! Laurie provided great instructions and the place was exactly as described.

2021-07-01,5,Stayed over a week,"Perfect launch site for your Gorge life. You’re minutes from the Heights, downtown, & 2 min. from Post Canyon staging area. The Sunset Farm Studio is spacious, has ample parking & has all the amenities you need. The bathroom is private & separated from the living space by a small hallway. The unit is well equipped with dishes, toaster, microwave, Mr. Coffee maker, electric tea kettle & hot plate. The unit is well accommodating for 3 people & the blow up air mattress is quality. The large yard & dog loving hosts are perfect for your pooch (no chasing the chickens). We enjoyed having dinner on the porch while the sun went down behind the large pines & swaying on the swing while star gazing at night. Thank you to the hosts & the studio for giving us the best summer vacation."
2021-06-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"A very nice value in a reasonable, private, location. Very peaceful setting. The deck is wonderful. We had great sight seeing nearby of the Columbia River Valley and Hood River area. Within one day we hiked to 11 waterfalls, and certainly could have done more! The area is both beautiful and historic, and we’ll worth the trip. Thanks, Laurie, for sharing your special part of the world!"
2021-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"What a great place soooooooo close to Post Canyon. We had an excellent time. This couple really knows how to make you feel at home and their cozy loft reflects it. The owners are amazing and friendly, they were there when we arrive to say hello and get us settled. What a pleasure sitting out on the deck in the evening overlooking their amazing place. They even gave us a shuttle to the top Post Canyon the day we arrived (Thank you Terry!). We will be back again because it is great place for my wife to relax with a good book while I rip it up at Post Canyon. No need to drive to Post, just a short pavement ride to the loft."

There is an easy outdoor stairway (handrails, yes!) to access first the deck with a swing and then the cozy, well-equipped studio: clean, comfy and attractive. Laurie’s space even thoughtfully supplied two spaces to leave a suitcase open, an amenity that we always appreciate! When you’re in Hood River, be sure to stay there."

2021-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had an absolutely amazing stay here! Laurie and her husband were so welcoming to us and our two doggos and the studio and back yard were great. This studio definitely made our stay in Hood River even better, and the area around the AirBnb was fun to explore on our runs. They had great recommendations for trails to try and different hikes in the area. 10/10 recommend!"
2021-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Laurie’s place is very relaxing. At night you can hear frogs and during the day there are chickens running around in the big backyard. It is close to farmland and vineyards. If you have a dog you do have to keep it on a leash while in the backyard so it doesn’t chase the chickens!
Also close to a beautiful winery that was 4 miles away."
2021-04-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Lovely place to stay just outside the beautiful town of Hood River. This is actually right next to an organic farm about 5-10 min drive outside of town; the drives into town are beautiful and not stressful at all ; so don’t let that be a barrier. It is so quiet and peaceful and the host was a lovely person . It is a quiet space and we were there in cool early spring and found the space warm and cozy. Minimal kitchen supplies so if you were planning on cooking meals not enough space or supplies are available; but there is enough that you can avoid eating all your meals out ; which is also very nice .
2021-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"If you are looking for the perfect nest for your stay in Hood River, look no further. Laurie and her beautiful Airbnb was everything I needed to get away from the city for my 9 year anniversary! The peaceful, quiet country setting was lovely and it was a very short drive into the town itself. I instantly felt so comfortable and relaxed when we arrived there. Everything is so clean and organized with high quality blankets and towels; it was truly luxurious! The bench swing out front is the perfect touch to enjoy the forested back yard and deer met us in the morning before we left. Highly recommend Laurie's place. 💎"

2021-02-01,5,Stayed over a week,"My boyfriend and I stayed at Laurie's airbnb for about 10 days and enjoyed every minute! The bed is comfortable, the space is very comfortable for 2 people, the kitchenette is just enough. We so enjoyed our stay in Hood River, with the quick 8 minute drive into town, and the peaceful setting of this airbnb.
We had zero issues during our stay, and Laurie and her husband were perfectly accommodating! Easy parking, close to the mountains and gorge for skiing/hiking. Lots of great restaurants in town. The place was very very clean, which made us comfortable through our travels.
We will definitely be back!
For anyone traveling while working, the wifi was more than enough for me to do my fully online job, but if your job requires cell phone service Verizon wasn't super strong, but strong enough with wifi support!"

2020-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We enjoyed our peaceful stay at the quiet studio tucked away on Laurie’s property. It was clean, cozy, and offered all the amenities promised, and more. We brought our two little Shiba Inus with us, and there was a dog bed, a bag of duck/pumpkin treats, and a water dish for them. The place was cozy and comfortable, and very quiet being outside the town center and near popular mountain biking trails. Laurie was immediately responsive for our questions via text. It snowed the morning we were checking out and Laurie was there to shovel and salt the stair and deck, at an appropriate time, not too early. We will be coming back and highly recommend staying at the studio, and greeting her free range chickens too. :-)"
