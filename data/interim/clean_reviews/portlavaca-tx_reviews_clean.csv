Great location, and is very spacious, loved the backyard for my small doggies. Even loved the cute touches of the bathroom bottles holding the shampoo, conditioner, and body wash. The host was very communicative and the listing was accurate. I also appreciated the keyless entry as opposed to other places I have stayed at that have lock boxes that are a pain to open. Overall 5 out of 5 stars."

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,üëç
2023-06-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Overall, place was nice and well kept, but a little small for the expectation. A little on the expensive side when factoring in the cleaning fee. Really you're paying for the waterfront access and privacy, which is worth it to go fishing right off your back porch."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Michelle's place was wonderful! There were only 2 of us so the place was more than enough. Her instructions were so detailed and she described everything that we could have thought of! The dock and view was beautiful. maybe 2 minutes away are beaches capabale of being swam in. Fishing options GALORE! Drive about 30 minutes towards Port O Connor and there are more beaches a little more sandy than shell and jetties to fish on. great area to get away in Nature or play with the kiddos. We were there mostly for fishing and I would recommend their place and give it a 10/10 for proximity to fishing and their private dock on their property. A/C worked great, place was clean when we arrived, stocked with condiments, all appliances you need. Thanks for letting us enjoy your place!"

2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I thoroughly enjoyed my stay at this little gem of a place. It was quite, peaceful and a great place to unwind for a few days. It would be a great place for a couple looking for seclusion and privacy or a small family. The place is clean and charming with nice touches such as extra toothbrushes, razors and deodorant. I will definitely return here."
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,My son and I really enjoyed our stay. Everything was just as described. The views and access to the private pier were highlights of the trip.

2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We stayed her to look for waterfront property for ourselves and what Michelle has is truly heaven on earth and a one of kind place in the region.

2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Exceeded our expectations. Peaceful and quiet location. Fully functional kitchen. Lots of comfortable places to sit and relax - both inside and outside. Long pier with sheltered area for fishing includes a water hose and lighting. We did a lot of fishing and really enjoyed it! Using dead shrimp for bait we caught a lot of sea cats; However, we also caught white fish, speckled trout, etc. My personal favorite was the HUGE, line yanking, black drum (my first). Also recommend checking out the Calhoun County Museum in Port Lavaca - this beach location has a lot of history and the docent made it really interesting."

2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We loved staying at this private beach in near Port Lavaca. It was clean, comfortable, amenities were well thought out. The sunrises and sunsets were spectacular. The host provided great area dining recommendations and things to do in the area. The lighted palapa on the beach was great in this hot Texas weather. We will come back to this place and highly recommend for a long weekend getaway."

Even the shampoo, conditioner and body wash was so good! The mattress was very comfortable and we had the best naps and sleep! Walk out and enjoy a beach, straw hut cabana with chairs, fire pit, and private lighted pier! We fished one day off the pier and caught many whitings, a few hard heads AND TWO huge black drums right out the back! Talk about fun! The Indianola Marina is about a mile away with food and live music! Michelle & Clint are great hosts! This place checked all of our boxes and we would love to come back one day soon!"

2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Accommodations are even better than expected with easy access to all desired areas. Soo clean & well outfitted with everything needed. Covered parking right next to door. Gorgeous views‚Ä¶ much prized private dock/pier/beach a real plus as public facilities can get crowded.

2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is a super cute and comfortable stay on the bay! My husband and I had a great time fishing, kayaking and learning about the history of the area. The marina has a good breakfast taco and the local people have such amazing stories! My suggestion is to bring food to cook because once you are there, you will be hesitant to make the twenty minute drive to the closest store, but it is worth it!"

The full size fridge and stove were really nice to have. The decor and furniture was really high quality and adorable. The mattress was really comfy. And that VIEW!

Go make your own memories at this fantastic rental!!"

2020-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"What an amazing, secluded apartment! The space was sparkling clean with everything we needed and Michelle was a very friendly, responsive host. Such a perfect location for those looking for a private getaway. Unless you venture to one of the nearby local stores, you may not even see another single person. We adored the private beach & pier! Our group isn‚Äôt much for fishing but I‚Äôm sure the pier would have been perfect for that. Instead, we chose to jump off the pier into the water & float in the warm, gentle waves during the day. Don‚Äôt fear the shells in the sand at the shallows of the water, go out a few more feet & the ground becomes very soft & accommodating for swimming. We would love to come to this property for another girl‚Äôs trip in the future."
2020-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My husband and I stayed at Michelle's apartment for his birthday and Father's Day. I chose this place because with everything going on, I was looking for cleanliness. However, I was also looking for peace, quiet, tranquility, and the opportunity to fish and crab. Michelle's place was all of this and more. The place is SO cute and extremely clean. I was very impressed. Although we didn't get to speak with Michelle directly, there were a couple times we had a question and her husband was more than happy to answer them for us. We felt so comfortable in this apartment. The whole process from the initial reservation through check-out was so easy and pleasant. The only thing we hated was that we had to leave a day early, as my husband got called in to work for a mandatory meeting. We would love to return in the future and would definitely recommend this rental. Oh, and we caught several fish (most too small to keep, but a few cats that were keepers), a couple sharks, and about a dozen crab. Thank you Michelle for allowing us to spend time at your beautiful apartment. It was a wonderful experience."
2020-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My sis and I had the best time in this tiny lil home. We ate lunch meat and chips, even tho it has a completely well stocked kitchen. We spent most of our time on the private fishing pier! Murphy bed was comfortable, and the couch made a great second bed. Great host, easy check in. Overall a great place!"

2020-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Michelle‚Äôs place was perfect! It is clean and cozy, the bed is soft, and this little front window offers a great view of the bay. We brought food and cooked our own meals, and I‚Äôve honestly never seen a cleaner refrigerator in an Airbnb! I‚Äôm kind of OCD about a clean place to store food, and it was spotless.
The location is excellent. We did well fishing over the weekend, but when we weren‚Äôt fishing it was nice to sit on the little downstairs patio or on the pier and just relax. We brought our kayaks and enjoyed boating around the little lake across the street via a public access spot nearby. I highly recommend this place!"
2020-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was such a cute and relaxing spot! The decor and set up in the little apartment was so stylish and unique, it definitely felt like home. The location itself was OUTSTANDING! Waking up and seeing the ocean view right in the backyard was breathtaking and our personal favorite was access to the private pier where we did tons of fishing! I would recommend this airbnb to anyone and have already referred a friend as well. We will definitely be back to stay and have found our favorite vacation spot. Michelle was so pleasant and made sure we had every thing we needed and checked to see if we were doing ok. Love love loved this place!"

2019-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The ‚Äúapartment‚Äù was surprisingly better than I expected. Everything as advertised or better. Perfect for our 4 night stay, but I think we could enjoy it for a much longer period. Beautiful clean bay beach, fun local store/restaurant/saloon, great restaurants at the Indianola Marina and Port O‚ÄôConnor, as well as in Port Lavaca. And my local granddaughter and I caught many varieties of fish one afternoon. We loved it and it‚Äôs certainly on our list to try to stay here when we return to visit family."
2019-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great place on the water. It is very clean, comfortable and cozy with plenty of room for two. The sunsets are beautiful and the evening were very enjoyable for a September evening. We had a pleasant surprise of a dolphin swimming right up to and under the pier while we were fishing. A real gem of a place and we will be going back."
2019-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This is all what you‚Äôll read from other reviewers. It is a ‚Äúdiamond in the rough‚Äù. My husband and I had a well rested and fun couple of days. The fishing off the pier was fun. We really enjoyed our visit. Michelle goes out of her way to make sure there aren‚Äôt any surprises when you arrive and during your stay.

2019-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Truly a treasure.
2019-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Private, quiet, lots of wildlife, close proximity to anything you may need, and all cooking utensils and toiletries provided."
2019-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This beautiful private suite under a beach house with private beach and pier is amazing. When it‚Äôs just you on the property it‚Äôs serene and amazing! When the family is home, you share the beach and pier with only the host couple and their two kids. Their kids were super cool, fun, and helpful! I love that you can see the water and pier from you window! The bed is super comfortable -and it was so nice having a full kitchen with an oven!!!! I will definitely be back!!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Prime location if you're looking for a convenient spot while in Port Lavaca. It is in a working class neighborhood, but it is so convenient to multiple beaches and the little touches they have added to the house made our stay awesome!"

2024-04-01,3.0,Stayed with a pet,"If you're coming in town for the beach, expect a quiet duplex about 20 minutes from the beach. The place is clean and has all the basic amenities. Expect the only bathroom to be in the master bedroom and curtains for privacy entering the second bedroom.
We had difficulties getting into the place and the host was not responsive. Fortunately the neighbor came and saved the day with a spare key.
The location is great to plan for Buckee's or HEB if needing to stop for anything. Great local taqueria nearby."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great spot for us to stay before our fishing trip! Thank you so much!
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Perfect little house for our family of four. We had an issue but Summer was quick to respond and fix. House is exactly how it is described and pictured. One bedroom is private but be mindful of the fact everyone will have to go through it to get to the bathroom-it was a nonissue for us; but may be an issue if booking for a work trip with coworkers. Other bedroom has two beds and privacy is obtained by closing thick fabric curtains. They worked well when closed to block out living room/kitchen noise and light. Kitchen is well stocked. Will stay again in the future if needed.
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,This is the second time we‚Äôve stayed here! It once again met all our needs. Host is very responsive.

2023-03-01,5.0,Group trip,"We loved our short quick vacation in Port Lavaca. It was perfect for the three generation Spring Break get together.
So beautiful!!!
The fishing and the pool table were the highlights, while time at Magnolia Beach was a close second.
It was cold and windy the second day we were there. But no worries... pool, cards, and kite flying were perfect activities.
Angie had everything there we needed. Laundry detergent, spices and condiments, and plenty of games. We even needed a quick use of the first aid kit. She has it all.
Thank you for a great time!"
2023-02-01,4.0,Group trip,Great place. The A/C unit went out the first day but Angie was quick to get it taken care of.
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,This was just a wonderful home for our trip. The host has thought of everything and the home came ready for us to enjoy the space and the area. I loved the dock out into the bay and both of the boys on the trip spent hours reeling in Small redfish and puppy drum when they weren't playing pool. Would certainly stay here again if we come back to the area.
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Absolutely love this place was sad to go! Love the finishing touches, the open air pool table room, fire pit and the fishing is spectacular (this coming from a family of Texas coastal fishermen and fisherwomen! Angie is fantastic."

2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Angie's home had everything we needed and then some. The private pier provided some much needed quiet time.

Would love to visit Angie's Lavaca Bay place again."
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Angie is a host on top of everything! The house has everything you could need and more. The location of the house is amazing, and the view is even better. Probably the best AirBnB we have ever stayed at. I highly recommend, and we will definitely be back!"

2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Wow! well worth the trip. Excellent place if you want to unplug. I forgot about work and didn't touch a laptop all week! Fishing was so good, we had to buy bait every day (at Indianola bait shop). The pool table really put this one over the top! Nicest home on airbnb for this kind of vacation. Caught at least 10 Bonnet head sharks on squid and one with shrimp. We had better luck with frozen shrimp than live. The crab traps were a handy extra. Best extras were: tons of kitchen towels, condiments and utensils, coffee station, lighting was great, charcoal for the grill, lighted dock was a HUGE plus. Bed was super comfortable. Modern, clean and fresh. Our hostess offered up everything in the home, which is a refreshing bonus. Appropriate for all ages."

2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The house is exactly as pictured and described. Angie is a great hostess and is extremely responsive. The house is the best equipped house I've ever stayed in. The dock, screened in patio and outside patio were great areas for us to hang out and BBQ. The dock was great to sit on to enjoy the great view or fish. We had a boat that we launched at the nearby ramp or in Port O'Connor. We would definitely stay there again."
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was such a wonderful vacation rental! The location is absolutely perfect! The private fishing dock let us fish anytime - with breaks, snacks and bathroom right there! Decor was so tastefully beach-y plus clean and comfortable- the only time we left was to buy more bait! Everything we needed to fix a fish feast off our catches! It‚Äôs so quiet and private - we couldn‚Äôt have asked for anything more!"
2022-03-01,5.0,Group trip,"This is a beautiful home! LOVED the decor. Very well equipped. Plenty of bedding for 8 people. We were a party of 6 . Everything was clean and smelled great. The pictures don't do justice to how close to the water and pier you are. We enjoyed fishing on the private lit pier and the convenience of cleaning fish right there. We enjoyed sitting around the fire pit, barbeque-ing and playing pool. 15-20 minutes to Port Lavaca where there is a Walmart. 10 minutes to Indianola where we enjoyed that fishing pier too and live music and food. Overall a very splendid stay. If you have the chance to stay here, you won't regret it. Angie was very responsive and communicated very well. Definitely a GEM and will be back!"
2022-02-01,5.0,Group trip,"This waterfront home is perfect for a large group. We have stayed in many places on the gulf coast area and this one topped them all. You will not be disappointed!

The pier is set up great for fishing and crabbing, day and night. Close enough to Port Lavaca for groceries, supplies and restaurants: 15 minutes. Our family was always entertained with the games, pool table, ping pong, fishing, crabbing and when it rained we had the large TV to eat popcorn and watch a movie. The master bedroom has a great view with a very comfortable bed. This room can be darkened or left open with outside light. The house guests have a pay it forward way about them with the goodies left in the pantry and refrigerator. Hope to come back soon."
2021-10-01,5.0,Group trip,Absolutely gorgeous home and you can't beat the location on the water with it's own private pier. Perfect place to rest and relax.

2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We loved our stay at Angie's Airbnb! I've never stayed at a place that provided so much for you & the kitchen was so well equipped. So many things provided to use both inside & outside! Lawn chairs too! The fishing pier & fishing lights were amazing and added to our stay. Great for kids, because you didn't have to be an experienced fisherman to catch fish. Sooooo much fun! Loved the house, setup, porch and our bed was super comfortable! I can't say enough about what a great house it was."

Located right on the water between Alamo and Magnolia Beaches , this spacious but cozy house is loaded with amenities, including free Netflix and Amazon Prime. It is extremely clean and has everything in the home needed for a relaxing stay. The views from the windows are stunning and the private dock is a great place to fish or just watch the birds and marine life. The privacy and peaceful quiet are what I valued most. At night, the fire pit near the house was another bonus. 
Our hostess Angie was extremely helpful and even rescheduled our visit a week after the unusual freeze in Texas. We really appreciated that."
2021-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We really appreciated having a literal ""port in the storm"" during the epic winter weather that hit Texas! We had traveled from the DFW area to celebrate our anniversary & while it was cold, we never lost power & we were cozy with a view of the gulf. We got out everyday to explore the area based on our hostess great tips. BTW communication with our hostess, whether it was by telephone or text was immediate & accurate. Everything we could need to live 5 days in this house was there & it was so organized. I've attached a picture of the view out to the pier. PS - the white stuff on the ground is snow, not sand üòä"

2020-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"The house is at a very nice location. Water is not deep, about 4 feet or so, perfect for kayaking. There are fish at night, too, with the dock light turned on. This was our best beach house experience so far."

The owner even let us check out a little later from what originally was supposed to be so Thank you very much for that! üôèüèº We wanted to stay more days but unfortunately we have to wake up to reality.

Even though we didn't get to the area until after check-in, I appreciated that Bernadette offered up the option to come earlier since she didn't have a guest staying the night before. We also had friends whose RV A/C broke and needed a place to stay for one night, and Bernadette graciously allowed the extra guests. Will definitely stay again if I'm in the area!"

2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great little beach house in Magnolia Beach area of Port Lavaca, Texas. Very cute and comfortable house that is well decorated and well stocked with everything you need for a long weekend or week-long stay. Comfortable and cozy living room with a sleeper sofa, chair, and recliner. The kitchen is fully furnished with large dining table, microwave, stove, toaster, and coffee maker.
The bedroom is large with a big king bed and two bunks beds. Two TVs with Dish and other cable services. The homeowner is very responsive and helpful. Nice neighborhood and places to explore the beach. Big backyard that is unfenced if you bring your pets. The front porch is very cute and a cozy place to have a glass of wine or a martini or to read a good book.
The house is located about 5 ‚Äì 7 miles from the main town of Port Lavaca but is walking distance to the beach, fishing and all the fun you want in a beach house. One thing to note is to be sure to bring food, snacks, and drinks for the first day since there are no big grocery stores or places to eat except a small convenience store with a few essentials.
We really enjoyed our stay and the ""girls"" loved the beach."

The little house was very comfy and had everything we needed in the house. We were very, very pleased with the house and will Definitely rent again if we go back. Thank you Bernadette for the house."
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We arrived late and a mess, having just learned that our dog has cancer. So it was a bittersweet vacation. We left the tackle at home and let our dog dictate the days, mostly spent beach-combing, chasing driftwood sticks in the surf and catching blue crabs (she‚Äôs a great crabber)! We were especially happy to spend these special days in Bernadette‚Äôs very comfy and thoughtful house. The home was lovingly restored and decorated and was clean, cool and conveniently a few blocks walk to Magnolia Beach. The fact that their home was dog-friendly was an absolute must, and as usual we packed extra dog towels and her food dishes and made good use of the hose at the back of the house to keep the salt and sand on the outside. We hope to return on a happier occasion so we can do some fishing and enjoy more of the wildlife! We saw Ouster Catchers and Sand Pipers on the beach and even an alligator on the road in. And after some spotty showers, the night air was filled with Gulf Toads singing and the sky was filled with so many stars. This really is a special part of Texas!"

2020-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,A very homey place to spend a weekend. We spent most of our time fishing and there is plenty of that nearby. The home had plenty of hot water to wash off after being outside all day. The space felt like it was actually someone home and not a place someone bought to flip and use as an Airbnb. Would definitely stay here again.
2020-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,A wonderful place to relax and enjoy a peaceful neighborhood that is very close to the beach!! Very comfortable!

2020-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"What a sweet little cottage. All the touches of home. Missing nothing.
A great value, quiet neighborhood, and everything was tidy.
Bring bug spray because the skeeters in the whole area are savage."
2020-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Easy to find and quick trip to the beach. Cute cottage, great time w/family."
2020-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is the perfect spot to get away from it all! The nautical decor is darling and really set the tone for our beach weekend. A short two block walk to the beach and the inlet of the bay, we made the walk multiple times per day just to take in the scenery or walk our dogs. The neighborhood is darling and everyone waves as they drive past. We used the house as a place to relax and go on little adventures to Pt Lavaca, Indianola, Port OConnor and Seadrift.
The kitchen was perfect to cook - if you wanted - or heat up leftovers like we did. The bed and the couch and chairs were super comfy and we laughed more than once that we had driven five hours to lay on someone else's couch, but that is what good weekend get aways are for.
There was plenty of hot water for long showers and plenty of towels for bathing. We did not use the beach for swimming so I cant say if there were beach towels, but we always bring our own.
There is a little market in the neighborhood, otherwise Pt Lavaca has everything you might forget to bring. And we didn‚Äôt try it, but renting kayaks or paddleboards would be perfect as you can put in just a few blocks from the house.
Definitely pack bug spray, because this is Texas!
Absolutely great getaway spot. We have already recommended to friends."

2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We needed a place at the last minute due to some work on our house. We were able to book this same day, and it a great place to relax. The house is so adorable with wonderful little touches throughout. We had a great stay."

Ocean Drive is where the ‚Äúaction is.‚Äù Bernadette answered my various questions leading up to check-in. The kitchen has everything you‚Äôd need, the house smelled super and the beds were very comfortable! Having coffee on the porch is a fabulous way to begin the morning. Neighbors are quiet or not around. Super friendly neighborhood with the interactions we did have, and some even brought us margaritas on the beach! Pro tip: bring your own beach towel and bottled water."

2019-08-01,5.0,Group trip,We enjoyed our stay very much. The cottage is adorable and was very clean.
2019-08-01,5.0,Group trip,This is a super cute and stylish beach house that made for a great weekend with my friends!
2019-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Beautiful and perfect for a family with small children
2019-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This is a wonderful beach cottage 4 blocks from Magnolia Beach. Bernadette had great and timely communication which makes everything so easy. The cottage itself was super clean and the beach d√©cor was especially thoughtful. You can tell it's been recently renovated and for sure the cutest cottage on the block! The king size bed was very nice given it's a 1 bedroom and our 3 year old loved the bunk beds. Overall I would recommend this cottage and really was a great value even during peak summer season.
Tips: Research Magnolia Beach. This beach is ideal for fishing on the piers, sitting with your chairs and enjoying the view. It's free and you can easily drive your car right up close to the water. However it does have a large amount of shells. So water shoes are recommended so you don't cut your feet. Not ideal for smaller children who are looking to play in the sand and build sand castles. Rockport or Port Aransas which is about 50 minutes away is much better for that.
Local Area - this is a small community with limited restaurants. So the kitchen is stocked with cooking utensils and a grill. So better to stop by HEB on the way in and stop up for your stay.
Don't forget all your own beach equipment and beach towels.
AirBNB details for this cottage: Everything lists correctly - just pointing out no washer or dryer. So be prepared to bring towels and beach wear home wet/air dried. 2 A/C window units that to work very well for living room and bathroom. Kitchen and bathroom run a few degrees warmer.
One small revision - AirBNB shows check in time is Noon. It is 3:00pm. We did request an early check in and Bernadette was able to accommodate a 1:00pm check in. Again, she is great at communication via the website message center."

Thank you !
2018-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"The Palms at Magnolia Beach is a cute, cozy, and recently upgraded beach house in a convenient location to the beach.

We stayed for two nights as a family of five and fit comfortably. Wi-Fi was great and the TVs were nice. House is very clean too. We would definitely stay here again."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This home was wonderful! Sitting on the bay in the most laid back town . I took my entire family there and everyone enjoyed it so much.
We were just down the way from a perfect little pocket beach with picnic tables and covers. The other direction from the house was the marina where my husband could launch his boat. And across the street the fishing pier was there for us to enjoy. We sat on the huge front porch and watched the sun rise over the bay. As night fell we sat on that same porch and visited as a a nice breeze kept us cool. The house was beautifully decorated. Comfy beds , clean bathrooms and large bedrooms was a delight. The kitchen was stocked with everything you needed to prepare a meal. There was even an extra fridge in the laundry room for keeping our drinks in! Our sweet host met us there when we arrived and was only a text away when we had questions. Absolutely everything was perfect with this place. Comfy house. Quiet town. Beautiful views. Oh my goodness it was great!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Group trip,"I had a wonderful stay on Lisa‚Äôs property! Lisa herself was very communicative and sweet! My friends and I came together to celebrate my birthday for the weekend and could not have had a better time! The space is beautiful, very clean and organized. There‚Äôs labels on the cabinet so you know where everything is. We spent most of our time on the porch because of how beautiful the view was! Would definitely stay here again :)"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This was the perfect place for our big family‚Äôs annual Mothers Day Weekend getaway. It was peaceful, beautiful, and Indianola has the best classic laid back easy vibe you love to find in a little hidden gem of a small coastal town. Also, rent the golf cart‚Ä¶ it was the perfect addition! We rode around all weekend, even down to the marina for some pretty great hamburgers!
The beds were very comfortable, the house is spacious (pics don‚Äôt do it justice at all), the 2 bedrooms downstairs were great for separating toddlers who need to nap from noisy teenagers and the new couch was amazing! The set up downstairs is perfect for extended families and we loved the swing. The backup generator was a fab touch when there was an outage in the area and we were the only ones with power for miles.
There were extras that provided a great touch. From Shampoo & conditioner to condiments and lots of towels. If you‚Äôre looking for a laid back getaway to relax and be lazy for all ages‚Ä¶ this is THE place!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Group trip,Beautiful home!! Well decorated and had anything we could want.
2024-03-01,5.0,Group trip,Lisa was so nice and responsive. She even did a little decor moment for our bachelorette party since we told her why we were coming. Thank you Lisa for your hospitality!

2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Our group‚Äôs stay at Lisa‚Äôs place was so special! We all remarked how fresh and clean the house smelled. The bedrooms are large, with a huge common kitchen/living area and the ocean right across the street. Since it‚Äôs August, we enjoyed leisurely morning coffees on the cool and shady West-facing back porch and the spectacular Moonrise out front at the end of the day. The outdoor shower was a bonus feature we all took advantage of at least once‚Äîdon‚Äôt miss it! Lisa was there to greet us and share tips for the beaches and restaurants nearby. She was always available to answer any questions we had.We are a group of college friends who made more wonderful memories together in this beautiful place. Thank you, Lisa, for being such a great host. We hope to get back soon!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Really enjoyed our stay. Lisa was great and answered all our questions. Loved the area. Went swimming at a small pocket beach down the road. Great place to go fishing - the pier was a short distance from the house. Downstairs there was a dartboard and a cute swing. The only drawback was the upstairs and downstairs are not connected. Which is not stated in the description of the house. So when we arrived the two other rooms with the daybed/futon and full size beds were downstairs and my daughters (24 & 27) did not want to sleep down there because there were no locks on the metal sliding doors that you entered into the downstairs or the bedrooms which made them uncomfortable. Also they wanted to be with us - upstairs. So we made it work. But overall the house was wonderful and the area was nice!
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We would absolutely come back to this place, worth the price of admission!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"The house was breathtaking! It was perfect for my family and in-laws. Fishing pier within walking distance. Lisa was very informative on things to do and where. We loved our stay, very relaxing and made new memories with my kids.

2023-06-01,5.0,Group trip,"Great place to relax! Husband extremely familiar with the area so fishing was fantastic.

Will definitely come back!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Pura Vida was AMAZING! My family enjoyed the beautiful home and unobstructed views of the water, sunrises and sunsets, birds and dolphins.
The home was beautifully decorated, and just FANCY! I read a review that mentioned a smoke smell and there was absolutely none‚Äîthe home was immaculately kept. I also appreciated the availability of plenty of paper goods and trash bags, and a well stocked laundry room. The kitchen was very spacious and well stocked.
We enjoyed the swings, the fire pit, and the short walk across the street to the water to hunt crabs, and Lisa told us of a fun swimming spot for the kids just a short way down the road. The outdoor shower was a plus!! Also, the ample parking under cover was super nice.
Lisa was super responsive and an incredibly helpful host. We will definitely be back! Our new favorite place!"

We had so much enjoying all the local activities. We will definitely be coming back!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Our stay at the Air Bnb was great! It was fresh and clean with a stunning ocean view. Beautiful sunrises were on the front porch with sunsets on the back porch.

2023-05-01,3.0,Stayed with a pet,"Not worth the price. The house is nice, but someone has smoked cigarettes heavily in there so you constantly smell like cigarettes."
2023-05-01,5.0,Group trip,"Spent the weekend with a group of amazing friends. The house was clean, comfortable, and easy to access. The views from the front deck are breathtaking. Lisa was super responsive and helpful before and during our visit. The perfect place to disconnect and enjoy some quiet time. Port Lavaca is close enough to get any supplies to that you might need during your stay."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"The beach house was the perfect place to gather and celebrate the Lord's blessing of family and fellowship. Beautiful home, lovely views, and the children caught fish off nearby pier!"

2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Wonderful place where you would wake up to ocean view sunrises and the breeze of the ocean literally right in front of your face. It was very peaceful and relaxing. The whole group when they saw the house was just overwhelmingly happy, and the inside of the house was exactly like the picture on the Airbnb site. Everyone was just HAPPY!!!!! We enjoyed working with Lisa and she was extremely helpful and hands-on, showing us everything and meeting us at the place when we drove up. You just can't describe the place with words. It is like taking a picture, but the actual view is so much more and breathtakingly beautiful. I will definitely share this place with friends and highly recommend it."
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Lisa‚Äôs home was beautiful! Perfect for our group and our doggies. So much space! So many cool amenities. Directly across a non-busy street to the beach. Front and back porch to watch sunset and sunrise. Will definitely be back. So so amazing! Has everything you need. Make sure you get everything you need before settling in the beautiful home. Closest store is about 15 minutes away. Perfect paradise for relaxing.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The house was beautifully decorated and clean. We loved the location because it was close to marina and restaurant. The layout was perfect because each bedroom was private. We had a great weekend thanks to your cute home.

The kitchen was very handy and stocked with plenty of kitchen-ware making cooking much easier than expected!

The host stayed in contact with us sending great suggestions for things to do and places to go! We will definitely stay at her property again!
2023-07-01,5.0,Group trip,"First off, Terra is a fantastic and very responsive host! This home had everything we needed for a family holiday getaway. While we spent most of our time outdoors under the covered patio & pergola, we enjoyed the interior spaces as well. All areas are beautifully decorated and were very comfortable for all 6 of us‚Ä¶plenty of places to sit, eat, relax, and sleep. We loved using the kayaks to fish in the marsh areas behind the house, and we caught a few keepers & several little fish as we paddled toward Powderhorn Lake. We had a wonderful time making fun memories here and we will definitely return!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"What an awesome place. Terra‚Äôs cottage in Indianola was perfect for our two family vacation. The views are stunning, the home is clean, comfy and well furnished. We took the kayaks around the marsh and saw lots of fish; my husband and I went on a date to the marina within walking distance and had a great meal and inexpensive drinks! We walked around the neighborhood to read the Texas history plaques and learned about the town. Before our stay, Terra had lots of useful information to share, and during our stay, she was responsive to the questions we had. Thank you for sharing your wonderful spot!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Terra‚Äôs place was an awesome. We had a great time. Home was just as described if not better. Can‚Äôt wait to book and come back. If you‚Äôre looking for a place in Indianola this is the place to stay. She‚Äôs helpful and kind. Can‚Äôt wait to go back soon!

Very quiet place to get away and enjoy family time. Basically a block to the Marina where you can launch your boat, dock your boat overnight, they also have a great live bait shop, restaurant and bar and grill. The beach is right down road. Highly recommend this home and area!"
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place was absolutely perfect for my family and I on our spring break vacation! Terra was probably one of the best hosts I have ever had at an Airbnb.

It was our second time and plan to make it out annual vacation spot!! Thank was sharing your home with us!!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Group trip,"Home was better than pictured. Very Spacious and clean. Great Floorplan. Loved the extra long pier and private bach. The kiddos spent hours searching for shells and sea glass. Bait shop is only a short walk away. Walmart is around 20 minutes. It is a very peaceful area. Zero boat traffic. Fishing was not good for us, but still really enjoyed being out there."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We had so much fun here. We loved the private little beach and we caught some great fish on the pier. The house was also very comfortable and the bottom porch was great to just hang out.

2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We enjoyed our stay. We were looking for a place that our cousins from Pennsylvania could enjoy some fishing and see the Texas side of the Gulf. We also had our parents with us. The ‚ÄúSalty Ranch‚Äù was a perfect location. We went to several places in the mornings and fished in the evening. The last night we were there my husband caught a 34‚Äù black drum and I caught a 37‚Äù black drum. Too large to keep but amazing experience. We also caught sting ray, bonnet head shark, croaker, hard heads, and catfish. The place was comfortable for all our needs. I love the water barista and coffee bar. The panini maker was fantastic!!! Alex was a great host and when we needed anything she answered immediately. We spent a lot of time downstairs resting on the lawn. I don‚Äôt think we ever turned on the TV. What a great week. The marina down the street was very nice too. Thank you so much."

The house was stocked with everything we needed, and more. From utensils, toiletries, cookware, cups, and dishes down to board games and crab traps! The coffee bar was awesome and greatly appreciated. We were blown away when we walked through the door at how nice and welcoming this house is. We will definitely recommend and returning! The area underneath the back deck is shaded most of the day and maintains a nice breeze. The lighted pier is were we spent alot of time and offered great fishing!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Group trip,"The Salty Ranch was the perfect place for our short family vacation. If you are looking for somewhere to relax and fish off a private pier, this is your place! The Indianola Marina is just a short trip down the road if you get hungry (they have a grill) or need more bait. The house is also close enough to Port Lavaca and Port O‚ÄôConner to go grab groceries or dinner. We had a great time!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Group trip,This is one of the best places we stay and will continue to go back every year !!!
2023-07-01,5.0,Group trip,"If Alex isn‚Äôt the best host in North America, she is definitely in the top 2. She is very responsive, extremely easy to work with, and treats guest like friends. Her place is perfectly located if you enjoy getting away from crowds, scenic sun sets, and catching plenty of fish. The house has everything that you need to cook meals and stay extremely comfortable for many days. We never left her place for 6 days, until we were finally forced to re-enter the real world. Alex and her house provide the perfect opportunity to disconnect for a week and get in touch with how life should be lived as often as possible. Outstanding place, we will be going back."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Exceeded all of our expectations. Words can‚Äôt express how great this place is. You just have to experience it yourself. We all had so much fun that we forgot to take pictures.
2023-06-01,5.0,Group trip,"We had a great stay at the Salty Ranch. Fished, crabbed and relaxed. Great place if you love to fish!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Group trip,"Man if you like fishing and maybe have kids and don‚Äôt want to be surrounded by a bunch of people. This is your place to go. Bait shop super close with good bait. Great pier with a nice green light. For the fishermen there are plenty of little bait fish you can catch yourself to sustain. We bought bait the first day and didn‚Äôt have to again after. We were easily catching blacktips, gaft, trout and some big bull reds. The house was very nice and the bunk beds are a very surprising size and very comfy. If you are looking a fun nice not crowded vacation this is it."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Alex was very responsive and the house was very nice and clean. The location was a great and within walking distance to Indianola fishing marina.
I recommend the place to anyone wanting a nice, quiet place to stay and plenty of space."
2023-05-01,5.0,Group trip,"The location is so peaceful and beautiful. Views of water from every window! The fishing dock is fantastic to fish whenever you desire and can be seen from inside the house so you feel like you are always together. The beach was wonderful for our little one too. The home is well appointed and it was spacious with a good layout for 6 adults and a toddler. The town itself was friendly and the marina being so close for supplies was helpful. Fun family run restaurant too.
Overall, a wonderful place to share great memories! The host Alex is terrific on all levels. We highly recommend!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Group trip,"My family enjoyed our stay here at the salty ranch. It was very quiet and neighbors were nice. The home was well equipped. Alex was very responsive to any questions I had. We spent most of our time fishing out on the pier and caught several alligator gars and many gaftop . Not what we expected to catch, but it was still fun and exciting despite all the rain that Texas has been having the past few days.. Make sure to pack your mosquito spray cause they can get very vicious under the house. I will recommend this place if you love fishing or getting away in general."

We enjoyed having the cove/beach area right there to swim in & pier to fish on.
Alex is a great host.
Very relaxing place."
2022-08-01,5.0,Group trip,"Great place to stay, very quiet and relaxing. The house comes with everything you‚Äôll need. Don‚Äôt forget your mosquito repellent.
HEB is 25 minutes away, so stock up before your stay; spend more time fishing and less driving. The fishing marina has good eats if you don‚Äôt want to drive to Port Lavaca.
The fishing pier is in really good condition. We caught a couple hundred fish from it, with a few keepers; lots of fun. We also caught a few blue crabs with the already included crab traps. Alex and Cody (and their family) provided very helpful tips. Don‚Äôt be afraid to ask.
Don‚Äôt leave anything outside that can be eaten overnight, the trash pandas (raccoons) will find it.

2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We loved staying at the Salty Ranch. It was a perfect location and had everything we needed. From the pier we saw a pod of dolphins go by a couple times. My grandson was thrilled with all the hermit crabs he found in the evenings on the private beach. The house was beautiful and we loved hanging out on the downstairs patio. Alex was great at getting back to me right away with any questions I had prior to our trip. I highly recommend the Salty Ranch and will stay here again when we go back to visit my daughter.

2021-08-01,5.0,Group trip,"Alex is a tremendous host. She is very thoughtful, a great planner, knowledgeable about her area and an extremely nice person. We felt like we were renting from a friend or neighbor even though we never met. The house was extremely well stocked and came with at least a starter package of every item we needed. Our group experienced some of the best fishing of our lives including an 80 pound gar, a 60 pound black drum and over 200 combined speckled trout and sand trout. The pier is well built and even comes with a private landing for trophy fish. Crab traps, a long handled dip net and even a check-it stick were provided. Our 5 day trip could not have been anymore enjoyable and if you are looking for outstanding private fishing this is the perfect place. Thanks for everything Alex. We look forward to booking again soon."
2021-07-01,5.0,Group trip,This was a great experience. Peaceful area. We caught 50 crabs that were keepers over the 5 inch keeper requirement. We even caught a stone crab to keep one claw. The beach part was great for swimming and going out in our kayaks. Neighbors were nice guys. Night fishing was awesome. Trout hitting the lines all night long. The layout of the house was well thought. Plenty of places to sit and chat inside and outside. Beds were even comfortable. Only add on I would recommend is a big fan under the porch area.
2021-07-01,5.0,Group trip,"Alex is a great host! Very responsive and helpful. We said we like to fish and Alex gave us a few tips, as well as offering us crab traps, which were very successful! 10/10 would stay at salty ranch again!

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This home is beautifully decorated and very well-kept. The property and the views from the back patio are incredible. The biggest problem with visiting the Texas coast is the mosquito population, but the spacious screened patios took care of that. My wife and I stayed comfortably with our infant child and two other friends, and we each loved every bit of it."

2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We spent a wonderful month here. It was clean, cozy, just right for the two of us and occasional visits from our daughter, too. We were surprised at how far it was from the town of Port Lavaca ‚Äîbut that turned out to be great. It was easy enough to get there for whatever we needed, but then back at the house could enjoy the laid back beach-y vibe of the Magnolia Beach and Indianola areas, and the even quieter setting of the house itself which is tucked back and a bit away from the beach activity. The screened porches were wonderful; we especially loved the back view over the marshes with a variety of birds to watch. We fished from the public pier, and could do our 3-4 mile daily walks right from the house or nearby (Zimmerman Rd which runs through the Texas Ornithological ‚ÄúMagic Ridge‚Äù sanctuary). Paul was extremely responsive to any questions or concerns and clearly cared about our experience in their home. We‚Äôll be back!"
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Our one-month stay was perfect. We valued the peace and quiet of the surrounding area and the amazing sunrises and sunsets visible .

Paul went above and beyond to ensure our stay was enjoyable."
2023-12-01,5.0,Group trip,"This home was a great size and set up for our family of 5. Great views out the front and back of the house. A lot of amenities available. We were there the last week of December, it was an extremely quiet and peaceful area during this time."

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"The house was very nice, clean, and had everything we needed. Comfortable beds, good house layout. The screened in porches were a lifesaver since the mosquitoes are so bad in the area. We spent a lot of time sitting on the porches. The dogs enjoyed being outside and watching the birds. The views are great both front and back. There are beaches within walking distance both directions."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Paul's Place at Port Lavaca was something Very Special! From the Location, to the Coziness and Comfort, to the Cleanliness, to the Extra Touches of the Interior Decoration and Amenities in the Kitchen, to the Outside Elevator to get our luggage upstairs, to the Covered Parking, and the Fishing Dock.....
Everything was just so Special and helped to make this the perfect vacation! Honestly, we could find No Negatives with our Stay! We will be back next year....that is a Promise!
Thank you Paul for Everything!

The house was beautiful, the beds were comfy and the loft was easily accessible! The kitchen was beautiful and functional!
One of my favorite things from this trip was sitting on the deck with coffee or a glass of wine gazing at the water! The beach views and the sunrise/sunset from this house are absolutely stunning and so peaceful! The downstairs area is great for relaxing and there is plenty of room for activities! The table is huge, which was great for playing games on! We also took advantage of the bikes and kayaks that are for guest to use, they are in great condition! We definitely recommend this house for any beach getaway! We can‚Äôt wait to come back to the Tral Tertle"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I wish I could give more than 5 stars! Our family had an AMAZING time at the Teal Tertle. The waterfront views were stunning! We sat on the front porch with coffee and watched the sunrise, and we made use of the house kayaks, pulling back in just as the sun was setting.
Every day contained a mid-afternoon bike ride along the water. We drove down to the marina on our first night. The food was great, and the fishing from the pier with the locals was so much fun!
The house was beautiful, clean, and we enjoyed the open kitchen and living room at meal times. The beds are comfy, and there‚Äôs a perfect loft nook for the kids.
Preston was a wonderful host, very responsive. We were greeted at check in by Lisa who was so kind, and she had so many helpful suggestions!
It‚Äôs been so long since we‚Äôve experienced the slow pace of ‚Äúcoast life‚Äù, and the Teal Tertle was exactly what we needed! Our family will definitely be making this an annual trip."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This home was wonderful! Sitting on the bay in the most laid back town . I took my entire family there and everyone enjoyed it so much.
We were just down the way from a perfect little pocket beach with picnic tables and covers. The other direction from the house was the marina where my husband could launch his boat. And across the street the fishing pier was there for us to enjoy. We sat on the huge front porch and watched the sun rise over the bay. As night fell we sat on that same porch and visited as a a nice breeze kept us cool. The house was beautifully decorated. Comfy beds , clean bathrooms and large bedrooms was a delight. The kitchen was stocked with everything you needed to prepare a meal. There was even an extra fridge in the laundry room for keeping our drinks in! Our sweet host met us there when we arrived and was only a text away when we had questions. Absolutely everything was perfect with this place. Comfy house. Quiet town. Beautiful views. Oh my goodness it was great!"

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Hosts were very responsive and available if you need anything. The location was perfect. I was looking for a place for my sons to fish and this worked out perfectly. Private dock and they caught several different kinds of fish. The house was just the right size for the three of us. Looking forward to finding a time to go back.
2024-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Very peaceful area. Nice cozy house, very clean, host was very friendly and responsive to any questions.

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We stayed there Monday through Thursday for a few days off to unwind from the daily work grind. We got precisely what we were looking for. The Casita was exactly as described, very clean with easy access and spectacular views. Rosangely and her husband communicated well and went above and beyond to be hospitable. Fishing off the dock was easy, fun, and we ate some of our catch. Other than a nice convenience store around the corner, supplies are about 25 minutes away at Walmart Supercenter in Port Lavaca. We would recommend this place for anyone wanting a quite escape to the coast. Thanks again for a great time."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"I will give the place 10 out of 5 stars ,everything was awesome the hosts were very nice it just felt like family.. even my son jr is asking when are we going back to see titi Rosie and Tio Ramon to go fishing,overall great stay and looking forward to come back again

2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We really enjoyed our stay! The host was very friendly and accommodating. I was very thankful for the private fishing pier. I fished for over 10 hours while my wife was bundled up in a sleeping bag ü§™. Hooked a couple of bull reds just feet from the Airbnb!
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The property was exceptionally well-maintained and provided all the necessary amenities for our stay. Additionally, it‚Äôs ideal for accommodating larger groups as you have the option to rent the unit next door. The duplex boasts a generous outdoor area, and the convenience of a fishing pier just across the street is truly a fabulous bonus. Wendy & Jack"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"If I could give 10 ‚≠êÔ∏ès I absolutely would! The pictures don‚Äôt do this rental justice.

2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Our stay at Casita B was perfect for my husband and me. We were able to check in early which was a bonus for us.
Rosangely recommended a restaurant for lunch on the way to Magnolia Beach. It was great!
In the mornings and evenings, we were able to sit on the porch and take in the view of the bay and the ships passing by. My husband was able to wet a hook which he loves to do on their private pier for their rentals.
We ventured out to nearby towns to sightsee. We especially loved the pizza at the Indianola Fishing Marina.
Overall, our trip was very relaxing."

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Ty very much
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Had a great long 4th of July weekend here. This location really allowed us to enjoy fishing and also had an amazing view at the start of our day. We were able to view a lot of the fireworks from the pier every night and were able to enjoy the tranquil environment. We do hope to come back and maybe book one of their other homes. Perfect spot for three guests and never felt like it was too small. Thank you for a pleasant stay!
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This was my third stay at the Casita/with Roseangely, who is a great host. My grandson and I drive down from Austin for a lovely quiet beach visit, and Roseangely is a fantastic host. We walk up and down the beach at Magnolia Beach as well as visit King Fisher beach nearby. Magnolia Beach has a great sunrise, wonderful shell collecting, fossilized corral, and lots of hermit crabs to observe. King Fisher beach, nearby, has a nice shallow sandy beach. Relax, enjoy nature, take a nice swim at both places, and do some great birdwatching. We don‚Äôt fish, but lots of visitors fish right off the beach."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We love this place. It was clean and we had a great stay.
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Rosangely,

2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"I went to the casita for a relaxing Spring Break. Although the weather was windy and I could not make the most of the proximity to fishing on a private pier, I was able to workout and relax in a place that felt like home away from home. I felt unbothered which was my goal."
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"One word to describe how I was treated, family. Very quiet and cozy!"
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Rosangely's Casita is the place to stay in Port Lavaca! The view is incredible and it's steps away from their private pier and a short walk to access the water. The place was clean and well appointed. It was the perfect place for my husband and I to spend our 35th anniversary! Rosangely is very sweet and thoughtful and made our stay memorable.
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The Casita was simply perfect! It is decorated adorably and very clean. Rosangely was an excellent host. She answered any questions we had promptly.

It was sublime, I‚Äôd definitely stay here again."
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The stay was amazing! The location was just as great. Having a public pier so close by made it super convenient to enjoy our time fishing. The house was clean and perfect for our needs. Despite being a duplex, it's still very private, we never heard the family staying in the other unit. The hostesses were also amazing with communication and their recommendations were great!"

2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Our stay was great. The communication with the host was easy and the place just as described, including a 20 minute drive to Port Lavaca to get groceries. Come prepared to really enjoy your getaway."
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We checked in late because of a last minute decision to stay in the area. The host had turned on the air conditioning for us so it was nice and cool when we arrived. We wished we would have had time to stay a few more nights in this cozy place that is only steps from the beach. The large windows were great in the morning and the view is incredible. Oh and the front deck was great. We plan on trying to stay there again the next time we are in the area.
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The stay at Casita B host by Rosangley was extraordinary. The place was kept clean, cool and well lit. It was easily accessible even though it was late in the night. The host has been very responsive to all inquiries and questions. I had an opportunity to meet her the following morning. She was made sure our stay was comfortable. The unit was very clean, well stocked and appointed. From the living area and kitchen and the patio the view of the bay is soothing. You get to see the sun rise over the serene gulf waters.
Highly recommend to stay here next time you plan a getaway."
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Absolutely loved this place!
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"What an amazing experience! The owners lived right next door and were very welcoming!

2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Rosangely and Ramon were very good hosts. Everything was perfect. The beach house was cute, and very clean.

2022-07-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Rosangely was a great host! Amazing hospitality. She went out of her way for me and I really appreciated it. Thank you so much!
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place is awesome! My boyfriend and I went. We‚Äôve actually stayed here before with my dad. But in the other side of the condo. Which is a little bigger. Great little spot right across from the water. Very quiet and perfect to spend with a significant other, a friend, or even by yourself. Very quaint and cozy space. Just enough room for a small getaway. And if you feel like venturing out, away from the beach-you can go into town and try out some of their restaurants. We didn‚Äôt get to, cause we went out after most were closed. But we did find a cool little bowling/pool hall/arcade game place called Beau‚Äôs Bowling. I suggest checking it out. But thank you again to the hosts for this much needed vacation!"
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Excellent view with price. Very relaxing! Would definitely go again.
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We loved this little condo right on the bay. The location is perfect if your looking for a less populated-quiet- and relaxed setting. Great views right in front of the water. You can‚Äôt actually go in the water in front of the condo there‚Äôs rocks and there but a little further down there‚Äôs a beach just a short walk or you can drive right up which is what we chose to do. The closest Walmart is a 22 min drive. The condo really does have everything. The hosts thought of all the essentials- there‚Äôs even q tips in the bathroom! The space was nice and clean. VERY cold ACs. We didn‚Äôt have any issues with cooling down in June. The 1 TV is in the bedroom so no TV for the main living area/kitchen so my husband was bummed cause we made him sleep out there. Oh well! We had such a great little vacation here. So relaxing to sit downstairs and let the toddler run in the shade of the house. They have lots of bikes you can use too. Highly recommend
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We miss this place already!!! The hosts Rosangely & Ramon didn't miss a beat, and they did not disappoint! Everything we needed was provided, the accommodations were 5-Star worthy, and my husband & I got the vacation we dreamed of for our anniversary. We'd absolutely recommend this location to anyone interested. Truly a hidden gem, worth every penny & even the locals made us feel like one of their own. So sad that we had to return to reality so soon!!"
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We enjoyed how quiet this rental was. Everything was clean and the hosts are incredibly friendly.
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The casita was a just what my husband and I needed, a peaceful get away. This spot is perfect for couples who just want to unwind and relax.

2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The hosts sincere communication and recommendations made all the difference for our stay. Even though this is a big fishing Haven, still very quaint to walk up and down the beach and see dolphins this morning."
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Sent two of my employees down to the area for work and they stayed at the Waterfront Casita. They said it was the perfect location. Everything was clean and it was the perfect setup for what they needed. Will definitely stay here again!
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This place was a perfect little getaway for me and my husband for our anniversary. From the time that I made the reservation communication was just so helpful and very informative from the beginning to the end. There are lots of little places to visit and the beach it‚Äôs just right outside the door it‚Äôs such a pretty view of the stars at night and the sunrise in the morning was amazing. We visited a few of the places that were recommended by the host and they were all nice experiences. The bed is super comfortable our host to even left us a nice little card wishing us a happy anniversary I thought that was a very nice touch and I would highly recommend this place to anyone looking to get away for a weekend beach retreat.
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I have stayed at the casita twice and it is one of my very favorite places. It is so peaceful, has a wonderful view and has everything you need to enjoy some time away. Come check it out - you won‚Äôt regret it!"
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Anyone wanting to have a peaceful stay on the Texas coast should definitely check out Rosangely‚Äôs little houses out. They are a perfect size for a couple or a couple with two kids. I know my friend, 2 1/2 yr old daughter enjoyed staying and Rosangely was ever so attentive. She always made sure we had everything, that we were comfortable, and if we ever needed anything just to let her know."
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"A clean, cozy, modern-styled place to relax. A peaceful place to watch the sun rise over the bay, and set over the marsh while listening to the waves crash on the rocks."

2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Booked this spot for my parents, and all I can say is how much I appreciate the hospitality the host had. They made my parents feel so welcomed that It‚Äôs rare when they vocalize their experience from a vacation. The smile and joy upon coming home was enough for me to know that they very much enjoyed their stay. Check in was easy, super clean, and if you had any questions at all, it would be answered right away."
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I spent a wonderful few days alone for a well needed mental health retreat, and what a great place to do so. I enjoyed my first evening with a walk along the beach, before the cold weather arrived. The host is amazing. She and her husband aim to ensure guests are comfortable. Since it was low season, I was able to tour all their units and the decorating, along with some handmade furniture items are incredible. I look forward to returning with family in the future to stay in their larger unit."
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay if you're wanting to stay in the area. Very fast responses from Rosangely if any issues arise. Zero issues.

Really a special place to stay. Rosangely goes above and beyond as a host -- she made sure to check in and ask if I needed anything, and was always available (but not intrusive) to answer questions and offer tips and local info. When I needed to print some documents for my flight, she was more than happy to let me use her printer. A top-notch Airbnb experience."

Walk to the public pier for fishing, crabbing bridge just down the road, lots of history there‚Ä¶many historical markers easily accessible.

The beach is a haven for natural interests - we saw hermit crabs, crabs, pelicans, purple matins, herons, and jumping fish. On our last day, our host directed us to a spot 30 min away where we could be sure to see Dolphins, and we did. This is a rocky/shell ish beach but there is a section which is quite conducive to swimming. The sun rises directly out your window. Very enjoyable stay. Will return."

2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Thanks for being so thoughtful. The place was perfect and very cozy. We really enjoyed our stay there at La Casitas. We hope to see you again another time on another occasion. Take care! We will definitely recommend your place to others.
2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Super nice people answers all your questions nice low key get away
2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Rosangely was an awesome host! We had a fantastic time and will def book again!
2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Amazing place and amazing hosts. Will be back to their amazing properties!
2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Casitas is an amazing place with many fabulous amenities. You wake up and drink coffee to a view of the bay. Beach is walking distance and so is the fishing pier. We have stayed at Casitas multiple times and we decided it's our bit of paradise away from home! Casitas hosts are the best, very friendly, attentive to your needs for a pleasant stay!"
2020-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We really enjoyed our stay. The place is small but really cute and perfect for 2 people. Loved the decor. The bed is really comfortable. As others have said, the town is about a 15 min drive away so keep that in mind and get your groceries or whatever you need on the way in. There isn‚Äôt a ton around but the small beach is down the road. It‚Äôs a nice place to relax and recharge."
2020-07-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Very small but very cute and spotlessly clean little place. The owners and manager were very friendly and accommodating. The location is near the pier and beach. Only down side is all the rvs around it.
2020-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The place was great! Very clean and comfortable. We had a great time and would recommend to friends and family.
2020-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Definitely a great stay. Highly recommended!
2020-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Great place.
2020-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is the perfect place to reset and re-energize, and you won‚Äôt find a better host than Rosangely. Highly recommend it!"
2020-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"A great stay! I was celebrating a 5 year anniversary weekend and we both wanted to spend time away from the city (Houston) This did not disappoint. The hospitality we were greeted with was exceptional. Hostess came out to personally greet us with a warm welcome as soon as we got there and ensured us to not hesitate to ask for anything. I do recommend bringing sandals to the beach itself, a lot of small rocks and seashells that can make a walk unbearable. The Airbnb itself is perfectly suited for two people. Clean and welcoming with plenty of amenities such as dishes, cups, utensils, stove etc. This was a perfect stay. My only issue was that We did not get to stay longer! Will most definitely be back and recommend it to anyone needing a break or relaxing getaway."
2020-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Great Location, a short 3 minute walk to the pier. 10 minutes to a nice bridge for crabbing. The sun rises directly on front porch. My wife loved the view. They had water hose down stair carport to wash off sand from kids stuff. Owners were super helpful and kind . We brought our daughter for her 8th birthday and they gave us a Unicorn cake which she loved. She adores unicorns! We will be back no doubt! I would suggest this to anyone looking for a nice quiet getaway."
2020-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very quiet location looking out over the bay great amenities very clean updated
2020-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Rosangely's place was perfect for a quiet getaway. She was fantastic with communication and sent lots of info about the place and area. Check-in to the Casita was easy and the place looked exactly like the pictures. We spent a lot of time on the balcony watching the water. The Casita is within walking distance of Magnolia Beach but we drove since you can drive your car onto the beach. Nice little beach to get away from the crowds at the more touristy ones. The Casita is in a pretty remote area so would recommend bringing food for meals but there are some good eateries in the area if you're ok with a little drive. All in all it was a great stay and would definitely recommend!
2020-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is a perfect place for 2. Very comfortable stay. All you need is your own food, clothes, and beach towels. Everything else is provided. The communication was perfect and we knew Misty was right there if we needed anything. Highly recommended!"
2020-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Loved the view
2020-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Had an amazing time! The house was great, warm and welcoming with amazing views. We will be back!"

2020-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Nice place for relaxation
2020-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Nice and small place!
2020-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Despite some reservations about making a trip while the country was gripped with fear of the coronavirus, I decided not to cancel. It was a brief stay, but we enjoyed it nevertheless.
The house faces the bay, and there are 2 giant picture windows, one facing the bay side to watch the sun rise, and an occasional ship floating by, and the other facing west to watch the sun set. The kitchen is nicely set up and we used it quite a bit. This area and its vicinity is steeped in history, and it was interesting to go through the information, even though we did not get to visit them. We left feeling we should definitely come back, and maybe in a bigger group."
2020-03-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"Absolutely amazing location, details, hospitality!! You won‚Äôt find a better SUPER host any where else period. The views itself should a rating. Rosangely‚Äôs and her husband treat you like family."
2020-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Casita B has a beautiful water Bayview from living room window and from the front deck. Condo is very Modern,Comfortable and very clean. Amenities included tasty Columbian coffee with different flavored creamers of your choice. Accomodation was a great Queen bed with clean linens and there is a sofa sleeper also. Our 2 nights were fabulous and plan on staying again soon! Hosts are friendly and very accommodating to answer any questions you might have. I recommend Casitas A & B @Magnolia Beach.üíú"
2019-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Rosangely‚Äôs Casita B is just perfect. Super clean, nice layout with bedroom separate from the sitting area and kitchen, nice views of the water, very comfortable bed!!!, and all the essentials in kitchen and bathroom. The shower is amazing!
I was also able to see the Casita A, which is a 2 bedroom unit, and it is also very well appointed. No doubt I will be staying at one of these locations each time I return to the area to visit my daughter and her family.
Rosangely provides all the info you need for an enjoyable stay, and is a prompt responder.
Safe travels ALL!"
2019-12-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Rosangely‚Äôs place was just as advertised. It is a great place for a couple with several days to stay, or even just overnight. Exactly as advertised, super clean, and Rosangely and her housekeeper will great to work with.
There were weather issues that occurred, beyond anyone‚Äôs control, that caused our stay to be shortened, but there is no doubt we will definitely attempt to stay there when we return to see family ever chance we get....hopeful for 3/4/5 times a year."

2019-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Rosangely‚Äôs place is amazing! The kitchen is fully equipped with everything you need! The beds are very comfortable and everything was very clean! Very relaxing! We will definitely stay there again!
2019-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This is a hidden gem! The casita is very comfortable and had everything we needed! Depending on what you choose to do you can relax and walk the clean beach or you can take a short drive and visit a winery or craft brewery. Regardless of what your preference is you will have a very nice stay here. Our hosts were top notch! Totally recommend this cute casita!!!
2024-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,THIS WAS A PERFECT WEEKEND GETAWAY - COREY WAS AN AMAZING HOST - WILL BE GOING BACK FOR SURE
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Such a cute little cabin right next to the beach! This place was exactly what I was looking for during my stay and I was able to bring my dog along with me! The place looks just like the photos, perfect little spot for a cozy weekend. I really enjoyed my time here!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Group trip,"Home was a great place to stay. If you love fishing, the pier was perfect. There were stingrays, gars and cats biting! lots of blue crabs. This was a fun place."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Went to escape the city life. The view from the porch was beautiful and at night, the lights gave it that extra special touch. I don't fish but sitting on the pier was extremely relaxing and what I needed to get away. Lucas was also extremely polite and accommodating as I changed my plans a couple times. would stay here again"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,It was a great stay
2024-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Great place to take the family for a peaceful getaway. The pictures don‚Äôt do it justice, but they give you an idea of how beautiful this place is.
The pier was exceptional, definitely appreciate how well it is kept. üôèüèº
Lucas was a great host, clear communication left me with few questions.
Definitely coming back. This spot won my heart."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"It was very quiet and peaceful, which is exactly what we were looking for. The house seems to be newly renovated and they did a great job. We felt right at home. I loved that we had full access to store our fishing gear in the garage. We enjoyed our time at the Olivia Bay House."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"as usual, some fish got away, broke a fishing pole , lost some tackle... all while having a great weekend with the family, can't wait to do it again... thanks for all see yall next time.."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"I cannot believe how peaceful this place was! The night sky alone was amazing. The fishing was phenomenal. We had the best luck on Muller- which can be bought at the bait shop in town-Big Bear. All around it was amazing, the Marigolds were on bloom, so you had the touch of wolf flowers in the yard. It was just amazing. You‚Äôre about 20 minutes from town. In town you will find just about everything. Restaurants, Walmart, bait shops. Port Lavaca has a cute small beach area. Perfect for the kids.
We walked the pier, and were completely shocked to see the ‚ÄúPink Floyd‚Äù figurative flamingo flying. The wild life is amazing at the BnB and on the pier.
Night fishing was our best luck. As soon as we would cast, we would get a bite. I will say, when the bay is copper, fishing wasn‚Äôt the best, but we utilized activities in town. The back porch had the most amazing sunsets, with rocking chairs and great breeze."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The location was just what we needed to get away and have an amazing day fishing. The house was clean and welcoming. The shower was probably thr best part of the house. The private pier was the main attraction and it was awesome getting to be on the water at night and see the stars.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Awesome place! Great fishing off dock. Beautiful area. If you‚Äôre there for the fishing, definitely recommend!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Thank for having us. We truly enjoyed our stay. It was the getaway we needed. Peaceful, serene and right on the water."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Absolutely beautiful place we will certainly be back
2024-03-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,"Found hairs in the bed. The bed did not have a top sheet. Only three washcloths for a four day stay. No dishcloths for the kitchen. Dirty bathroom floor, including a battery in the corner."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We took our family out for spring break. This home was absolutely the best choice ! So quiet and relaxing the view was beautiful we fished the whole weekend on the pier.
I definitely recommend! We will be planning a stay again soon!!"

2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great value, secluded and the fishing was on point."
2024-01-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Lucas, the host, was easy to deal with and very responsive. The place could use some coat hooks, more cooking vessels (tea pot, broiler pan) and front door (main access) needs to be re-hung."
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Very nice & updated. Pier for fishing was really nice! We think maybe it was too cold as we didn‚Äôt catch anything. But we utilized the grill & did some cooking! The lights outside were really nice. The nearest gas station was a little over 10 minutes away, no food or stores close by if you forget anything. The front door was hard to close but that should be fixed this week so shouldn‚Äôt be a future issue. Overall we enjoyed our stay."
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place for peace and quiet!
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Peaceful and quiet!

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,For a fishing family this place is a gem! The place was super cute. If you have little ones that are adventurous then the fishing pier might be a close supervision job as there are no railings at the end and on one side. It was so quiet and peaceful. We saw dolphins several times. This is a fabulous place for a family to spend the weekend.
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Great stay, in the first few days there was a issues adjusting the thermostat due to it being a new one and it wanting to keep raising the temps. After getting that resolved it was much better. Great place on the water if you looking for a getaway we stayed 9 days."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great place to stay if you like peace and quiet and your own private pier to fish off of.
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Great little hidden gem! Grandkids enjoyed the pier, backyard and treesüòä Just as described and Lucas was very easily contacted for communication."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Loved our stay here! Lucas was super accommodating and helpful. The pier was so nice and clean and we loved the fishing. It was also amazing watching the storms and having breakfast out on the back porch. No issues with bugs at all which was refreshing. It was very quiet and secluded which we loved. We brought our fur baby and she felt right at home, she actually hid when it was time to go because she didn‚Äôt want to leave either! Definitely 10/10 and we would love to come back again."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Peaceful and Relaxing. Lucus is respectfull and attentive.
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Best decision ever made choosing home off the beaten path so peaceful the guys loved the private pier especially at night with the lights. Adorable home with a kitchen full of essentials which made us feel right at home. Definitely will be back ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è

2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had an amazingly relaxing few days!
Lucas‚Äô description was perfect. Very private and loved that we were able to have Sadie Mae (our doggy daughter) with us!
We loved drinking our coffee in the morning while watching the birds fly and fish jump in the water.
Our evening sunsets with a glass of wine were wonderful!
We brought bug spray and Citronella candles (at Lucas‚Äô suggestion) However, we never used them or saw a mosquito! Yippee!
I brought my fishing gear and I saw lots of fish jumping; however, we were enjoying the place so much I never even unpacked it. I will definitely be back to fish from the beautifully lit dock.
Lucas was available and answered any questions immediately. We had one tiny hiccup and he had the problem solved quickly and efficiently!
Thank you so much for sharing your home with us! We will definitely be back!"

2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I stayed at this place 6 nights in order to participate in local beach clean ups, and do some kayaking on my own. The location was great for this. The facility is well equipped, clean and quiet. Everything worked. There is a responsive young man working for Michael who lives nearby who was absolutely great for providing help and information. I was out doing things all day, everyday, but the facility was always good to come back to and relax, eat, shower and sleep. I would stay here again."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great spot for the value
2023-09-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,Quaint little spot clean and functional. The water pressure in the kitchen was extremely low so difficult to clean up. The a/c worked fabulously. But definitely don‚Äôt go outside with dowsing yourself in bug spray. The second anyone went outside we were cover in mosquitoes ü¶ü. It didn‚Äôt seem to matter the time of day we would all get bit. A decent spot though.
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Micheal was very good and giving us instructions. Everything was clean , Aircondition worked beautiful.
There was so much to do around like great fishing. Great restaurants felt comfortable and safe.
Thank you, Micheal for having such a great set up in your vacay home! Looking forward to staying again."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Comfortable, close to places of interest. Host responds immediately and offers great information of the surrounding area. Found a place to always go to when wanting to enjoy the beach! Thank you! :)"
2023-07-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"the place was very clean and accommodating for my family. however, it was too close to other trailers, so close I could hear them walking and thought it was in my air bnb. the photo of the loft with the chairs left the impression that is off your patio, and it is not. the air bnb is a good couple blocks from the water . other than that, the host was very friendly and responded so quickly. welocked our key inside one night, and at 1030 p.m., he had someone there within 30 min to let us in."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Really great spot
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Nice quiet location. Not too far from beaches and restaurants.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Nice location to stay! Area was fun and beautiful, lots of great eating spots around too!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"was a very quiet and reserved home, I was there for work and enjoyed it and especially the quiet nights not having to deal with hotel guests. I felt like I was living there in the home for years."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Felt at home! Will be returning soon.
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great place! Booked last minute because our previous host had to cancel. Totally surpassed our expectations. Had everything we needed for our stay.

2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This place was great! So clean, well stocked & it‚Äôs like they thought of it all! We loved the little extra touches too, like the muffins waiting on the stove for us and the little bottles of wine! Definitely will look to stay again."
2023-03-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Place was perfect for what we needed. Quick drive to magnolia beach.
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We enjoyed our stay the area very much. The house was very clean and comfortable. The beds, sofa, and easy chair all offer good support making them comfortable to sleep and set in. We found every thing needed to cook but would probably bring a few specialty items if staying for an extended time. The area is quiet and not crowded which was one of the plusses for us. We loved the access to the bay and fishing and were often the only ones in the area fishing. It was exactly what we were looking for after spending 2 months in Port Aransas which is becoming more busy and crowded every year. The flip side of that is that you will not find restaurants or night life right out your door if that is what you are looking for. Again the area and facilities were perfect for us and Michael was a very accommodating host. We highly recommend this property if you are looking for a saltwater haven off of the beaten path. Thank you Michael, we enjoyed our stay and would consider booking again."
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Super clean and well equipped spot to stay if you‚Äôre looking to explore the coast.

2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We enjoyed our stay. The view from the balcony was very nice. The neighborhood was working-class but very nice and quiet. We felt safe and comfortable. Michael and Twila met us at check in and provided tips on restaurants and fishing spots. They also left us homemade muffins and some wine.

2022-12-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"The stay was overall great. Really peaceful, but the only complaint I would say is that the light on the porch is really dim. I‚Äôd just add something a little brighter for nighttime grilling."

2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"Amazing stay beautiful Little home and everything was clean, owner also replies very quick to questions etc."
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Very hospitable, close proximity to beaches, nice clean house and host was easy to contact, even made us muffins and had adult beverages ready upon our arrival. My only issue was we chose the location because of the observation deck, which was very misleading, its not on the property of the house, you either have to walk through a pit of mud and through two other properties to get to the observation deck, or you can drive there which is what he recommended. We felt very mislead with the observation deck which was the reason we chose to go there, but everything else was nice"

2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"This is a wonderful property. All of the amenities listed plus some where made available to us. Michael was a gracious host and was very open to communication with us. He checked in via text on the second day, just to make sure we were good and didn't have any concerns. I read a previous review where someone called the neighborhood sketchy, but I want to say that was not my experience. All of the people I interacted with were very nice and welcoming. Overall we had a great time and enjoyed our home-away-from-home."

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We loved staying at Bernadette's home. We had so much fun fishing at Magnolia Beach. It's so peaceful and we felt right at home. The Airbnb was clean, so pretty and cozy. Rockport TX beach was 40m drive which made our stay even more enjoyable. The owner even let us check out a little later from what originally was supposed to be so Thank you very much for that! üôèüèº We wanted to stay more days but unfortunately we have to wake up to reality. Ugh, that is going right back to work!! We are definitely booking here real soon before summer ends!!!! 10 out of 5 stars : )"
,,,"Didn‚Äôt meet expectations, host was willing to refund the remainder of my stay"
,,,"We told her the floors were dirty and that I had found roaches,she could send someone to clean floors,she said she had orkin service for over a month and that it takes time to get rid of them. Why would she rent the property if it takes over a month to get rid of them? I dint want to bring them back home with me I was very disappointed. she offered to come spray chemicals to kill roaches but I had all my kids I was not going to risk their health.
The listing said it had a dryer/washer,
The only dryer/washer we could see were connected to the main house. They were full of clothes on top as well as the floor around them. There was a pot on top on dryer and look very unsanitary. The main house was very unkept, a set of couches right in front of the house and a dirty looking pool on the other side of the house. Definitely won‚Äôt be staying here again."
,,,Was not ready until 8 o‚Äôclock five hours after we arrived
,,,"this is not the first time i have used Airbnb and have always been very satisfied with my stays.. but i was highly disappointed with the response from the owner.
First, the place IS adorable and in a nice quiet area.
We had issues from the start, which do happen, but blame was put on us and refused to give any refund. from the moment we got in, there were issues with wifi and the tv... we were told to reset the system, per maintenance, and it didnt work.. which in the end, the owner tried to blame us. maintenance tried to fix the tv issue with the dish technician (as we left to have dinner) and when we returned maintenance was still there and stated he had ""reset something"" and ""hopefully it works"". . where it didnt... and again, owner tried to blame us. Dish was going to come out the next day (Saturday) but had no time frame and wanted us to wait around for them.. we were on our VACATION.. but that was also put on us that we wouldnt allow anyone in the house.. which is NOT the case. We didnt know if we were going to be there or not, as there was no time set and we were on vacation. we shouldnt be asked to wait around when we are paying for services. the last day the toilet stopped working.. maintenance sent someone (a buddy of his) with a plunger.. and we decided to do it ourselves since it was a ""used"" toilet.. and it still didnt work.. so the last 24 hours we had to use the restroom on the beach."
