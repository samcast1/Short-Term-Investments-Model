2024-06-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Overall a nice clean place. Will consider staying there again.
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We stayed in town for our friend’s wedding, this spot was PERFECT for us to get ready and rest after the festivities. Make sure to take a look at the stars!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Booked here last minute and Kellie was informative about everything. Thank you Kellie for the great stay!
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We met Kellie and her husband right away because we accidentally turned into the wrong driveway. They were extremely friendly. We found the rental to be even better than expected. Very clean and smelled so nice. Kellie had thought of everything. It is located outside of town which made it so quiet. She and her husband told us that the cicadas had arrived. We actually enjoyed listening to them. But the rental is so tight that we never heard them inside. The bed was soooooo comfortable. We made the decision to always stay there if it’s available when we visit Paragould. We stayed three nights.
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Great stay, very clean, and very comfy, if I’m ever working up here again I will be staying again!"

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We couldn’t say enough good things to explain this little gem! It was a great place all around for privacy and relaxation . Very clean and modern which we like!
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"It was a bit confusing pulling in, since our GPS told us to pull into the main house entrance and the guest house’s entrance was VERY steep. But it was a cute little house, very clean, and was in a great location. We were out of town, but not too far out that it was an inconvenience to get around. We did see 2 deer when we were there, so that was awesome!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Perfect little getaway! Very friendly. Beautiful place. Super quick responses to my questions. 10/10 would stay again!
2024-04-01,4.0,Stayed one night,Loved the place. A few bugs but not many. Probably there due to previous visitors. Nice shower and restroom. Liked the comforting blankets. I would recommend staying away from Ikura Japanese restaurant though unless you like sushi with bones in it. Responsive host. Google maps stops at her driveway though and not the Air BnB driveway so it was a little confusing and so is the key pad. Overall enjoyed the house and world recommend.

This place would be what we are exactly looking to buy when we come down. Much Appreciated"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Gorgeous place, quiet and clean!"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This was my friend and I's first experience with getting an AirBnB. We had a good time at Kellie's. It was cozy and had everything we needed. There was a Kum & Go near us so we had a place to grab some snacks for the trip. Also, Kellie was very responsive which was great! If we go back to Paragould, I'd def. just stay at Kellie's :) def. recommend :)"

2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We travel every year to the area to duck hunt once a year. Kellies home made the trip better than ever before. It was very clean and well maintained. It was very spacious even for a one bedroom. It had a bonus room that we were able to utilize by using a blow up mattress. Kellie’s home will definitely be apart of our duck hunt every year from here on out.
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Don’t let the plain exterior fool you! You’ll step inside to find a spacious, comfortable, well-appointed retreat. The country setting was lovely and very private! This of the place to stay if you are visiting the Paragould area. We will be back."

I will definitely stay here again."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The perfect location for us to see our daughter in Paragould with a new grandbaby, as well as our son and his family in Jonesboro (Brookland)! Our visit could not have been more perfect! It quite possibly could be our new place to stay while visiting our kids!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very nice place
2023-10-01,4.0,Stayed one night,Cute and clean place to stay! The only downside was the bed- sinks down in the middle and very uncomfortable.

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Kellie allowed me to book her place for my technologically impaired parents. Lol. They usually stay at hotels and always complain about the noise. They loved it at Kellies place. They said it was the best place they had ever stayed. Quiet comfortable and private. I would have to say they will never stay in a hotel again. Thank you, Kellie, for a great place to stay."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I was impressed with the cleanliness and we loved the dog that came out to say hi! Definitely a huge plus. We only stayed one night, but there were dishes and utensils that would accommodate a longer stay. I would recommend it!!"

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This was our second visit to Kellie's place. We were so happy it was available again this time. We don't know how to use the streaming TV (old people who have cable) so I sent Kellie a message & she came right over. She couldn'tget it to work either so she flagged her husband down as he was mowing the yard. He was just finishing so came right over & got it working. He made sure we knew how to turn it on and get the stations we wanted. They are a very sweet couple. We will be back!
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Nice place to stop while traveling.

2023-02-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Kellies place is a great, clean, stay out in the countryside. You have everything you need at her place- beautiful kitchen and living space. If you don't like dogs- I would be hesitant to book because she has several that roam the property- we are dog people and did not mind. If you need a quick place to stay- this is perfect but we wish there was a little more privacy overall on the property."
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Kellie's place was quiet and quaint. We so enjoyed the location and being out of the way of the city. It's a lovely property and a clean and comfortable home. Would highly recommend and stay again!
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This was a return visit for me. The location is close enough that you don't have a long travel time to get necessities, but far enough out that you have a PEACEFUL stay. Kellie's place provides a wonderful view and you feel right at home."
2023-01-01,2.0,Stayed one night,The place itself was clean and neat. The driveway was very under described super steep. We love dogs but when we pulled up dog was running in front of car while we parked and barking. It then continued to bark all night long and kept us up. Don’t recommend if you need to sleep.

2022-10-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Overall happy with our stay!
My only real problem is that the driveway is a bigger deal than the listing makes it sound like. Small vehicles would have trouble. I was in a Yukon XL. A VERY large SUV, and the length meant that I scraped when pulling out unless I cut the tires very sharply.
Nice place and convenient! Taxi’s run in this area with enough heads up."

The details put into everything were also appreciated, such as extension cords, Tupperware, and a portable fan. Super clean as well. We were in town for a family event and needed help with some tools for the decorations, and without hesitation we got the help we needed. Awesome communication! One of the best airbnb stay I’ve ever had. Next time we will definitely be staying here if it’s available. 10/10!"

I cooked all my meals in the full kitchen. All pots, pans, plates, cups and utensils provided, just bring your own food and oil for cooking. Walmart and Aldi nearby if you forget anything. Visited Crowley Ridge State Park (only 15 minutes away) and ambled down a couple short hiking trails. The hosts are very friendly, respond promptly, and give you your privacy while making it clear that they’re happy to help if you need anything. I would be happy to stay here again!"

2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Wife and I enjoyed our stay very much. Cleanliness is King and Kellie’s place is neat and clean. We also appreciated the quietness and privacy; yet convenient to both Paragould and Crowley’s Ridge State park where we enjoyed our family reunion. Kellie’s place was perfect for us and we recommend it.
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We stayed at Kellie's place on our way home from our vacation. We were tired, and this home was a perfect place for us to recharge and get a good night's rest. It is private, quiet, bright, and beautifully decorated. Kellie was welcoming with great communication. I can recommend the Bar-BQ Barn nearby for a meal. We picked up carry-out from there and it was really good. This is a wonderful place to stay!"

2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Kellie’s place was a great stop on our road trip back home from New Orleans to St.Louis. She had great communication and I liked how the property was set back off of the main road for more privacy in an unfamiliar place! Very spacious and homey! Would 10/10 recommend!
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great place. Well worth the price. Kitchen seemed very well stocked with all essentials. Overall it was exactly what I was looking for in a place to spend the night to break up a long drive.
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Kellie’s guest house is lovely. It has been very tastefully decorated and the furniture is very comfortable. Everything looks newly renovated and smells wonderful.
The only problem this light sleeper encountered was dogs barking in the night. My husband didn’t hear anything, so that may just be me. I feel very comfortable recommending this to Airbnb frequenters."
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was my second stay with Kellie, and it was just as amazing as my first stay! Will probably continue to put this Airbnb as long as it is available when I am in town."
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"First ABnB experience and it was great. Super quiet, out of town. Stayed during a storm one night and it was wonderful. Country smell + the frog noises was my favorite. I live in a big city now so this was definitely a treat. Never saw the host / family besides the dogs during our stay even though the houses are near each other. Nice little private place if you’re looking for a quiet country get away. TV had a Roku with lots of streaming services too so that was a plus."
2022-02-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Nice place. Communication was good. I would rent again.
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Very clean, cute AirBnB!"

2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This was a great place to stay. Everything was clean and the house smelled of my favorite Tyler candle. She provided everything you could possibly need in the kitchen and bath. The bed was very comfortable with the option of feather and plush pillows. The TV had Netflix and Hulu which was great! The property was quiet and not hard to get to at all.
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,I loved the stay here! Cozy and close to town but secluded enough that you get to see how pretty Paragould actually is!
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Kellie gave me a wonderful first experience with Airbnb! She was very communicative about check in, but we didn’t have to see her after arrival if we didn’t want to, which was great. The guesthouse was clean and lovely, as was the property, which made us feel right at home. There is anything you could need to cook if you so wished, and the bed and shower were super nice! I would definitely recommend staying here!!"
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The location was perfect for our needs. The house is well-kept, supplies were on hand, and we felt at home for our stay with everything we could need. We will definitely book this place for each future trip to the area! Highly recommend!"

2021-12-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"This guest house was made for people traveling with pets! It was so incredibly well decorated and a dogs paradise. However if arriving after dark I would check in with the hosts to make sure they are able to guide you as you get close to arriving, as there is no address listed on the driveway for the guest house! Thank you so much for hosting Kellie."
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Cozy and quiet! Located close enough to Jonesboro, yet, far enough away to not have to hear it! Didn't see the owner once! Which is a great thing, IMHO! Never had a reason to contact them, which is the ideal. Great stay, great place, great privacy! The trifecta!"
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,If I could give more stars I definitely would if you have a place to duck hunt near this area this the spot to stay absolutely felt just like home and the most cleanest Airbnb I have ever been to we will definitely be back this is a perfect date night spot for just a quick night away!!!!! I HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!!!!!!!
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Kellie has an amzingly cozy, clean, and beautifully designed guesthouse with plenty of emenities for a couple on a romantic getaway or if you want to just get away from the hotels and city for the night. It's all gorgeously updated and she even has spices for cooking and coffee for the mornings. Thank you Kellie for the warm welcome and all of your help!"

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,We enjoyed the Bnb very much and the hosts were very understanding and friendly at all times. I think anyone looking for a peaceful place with an older original interior kept to give you that home feel would enjoy!

2023-08-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"Judy’s place definitely felt homey, my only complaint overall was that the floors may need a good mopping. I had my 1.5 year old and the tops of her feet/knees were black from crawling. But it was gorgeous, perfect spot for where we were and definitely reasonably priced for a whole home."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,were going back

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Stop looking!!!! This is the place you want to be if visiting Jonesboro! Jennifer’s place is immaculate! Nicely decorated, spacious, private, awesome scenery, great pond & only a 10-15 minute drive to stores/shopping. The beds were super comfortable & the view amazing. Every amenity you could ever need. Well equipped kitchen, which was important because I had to cook brunch food items for 65 people (for my daughter’s Baby Shower in town). The highlight is, of course, the LONG HORNS!! My husband kept saying, “This isn’t a trip, this is an experience.” My adult children were just as fascinated with the Long Horns as much as my 3 granddaughter, LOL. Hands down 10/10. You will not go wrong or be disappointed in choosing Jennifer’s place to stay! She & her family are super nice & Dixie will make you feel right at home!! I would definitely stay here again & again!"
2024-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Loved this beautiful home on the farm. It was so peaceful to sit on the front porch overlooking the lake and watching the cattle walk by. Very comfortable beds and the entire house is relaxing and very clean. Kitchen is the most fully stocked kitchen we have ever had at any of our previous Airbnbs. Our family loved our stay. Thank you!
2024-05-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"We had a great stay at this Airbnb! Overall, we liked it and would stay here again. It was easy to find, easy to check in, and it was a comfortable and enjoyable space for our family. We chose this one specifically because of the cows right on the property. They weren’t around as much as we had hoped, but in the evening both nights of our stay they did come and graze very close to the house. Our kids loved that and kept asking about the cows even after we left!
It’s very peaceful and a beautiful view of the countryside.
We appreciated the host who was quick to respond and give clear instructions. We would totally stay here again!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Great stay! Would definitely stay again!
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,I loved my stay at Jennifer's Airbnb. It was just a beautiful experience watching the cows in the morning while sitting on the porch. Thank you for your hospitality and that unforgettable scenery ❤️
2024-04-01,5.0,Group trip,"The Longhorn View is an extremely homey, comfortable place to stay. I was there with four friends to see the total solar eclipse, and it was just the perfect setting. We loved the open floorplan inside and the open sky outside. Longhorn cattle walking by was a bonus and, of course, Dixie the blue heeler. Total sweetie. I would definitely recommend Jennifer's place."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Everything about our stay was beautiful! The kids loved seeing all of the animals and the lake. The home was immaculate. We enjoyed our stay!
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"What a wonderful place to stay!!! My family felt right at home, the scenery was so peaceful and our host Jennifer was so friendly and accommodating. I recommend a stay 💯 and will definitely be booking again on our next visit to NEA!!! Thank you Jennifer for being such a wonderful host!!!"
2024-03-01,5.0,Group trip,We had such a wonderful stay at the longhorn. Such a beautiful property and relaxing home. We will absolutely stay here again.

2024-01-01,5.0,Group trip,Awesome place and scenery! Very well kept and maintained!
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,My family stayed here for lodging for a duck hunting trip close by. The location was convenient and perfect for them. It was secluded so we felt very comfortable leaving the boat there while going to town. There was a circle driveway so it was very helpful with the truck and boat trailer. It was more beautiful than the pictures show and we will definately be back every year. The friendly dogs and view of the cattle and horses were definatley a plus! My son left his toiletry bag and she even Fedexed it to us the same day as checkout. Definatley recommend this place!!
2024-01-01,5.0,Group trip,"I had booked this place with a few other friends for a duck hunt the first week of January. The Airbnb was beautiful inside and out. Jonesboro was only within a 20-minute drive. One of my favorite parts of this Airbnb was the ""no shoes inside the house"" request. A few others and I are Asian so that was normal for us. The carpet inside was extremely clean and it was something we appreciated. The beds were very comfy and clean. My favorite part was probably the living room. It had enough room for 4 or more guys to hang out and talk. The property is on top of a hill so with the blinds open you overlook the pond and terrain which looked amazing at sunset. After the early mornings and long days, it was a nice spot to settle down and make memories with the guys. I'll definitely be looking for this Airbnb first if we're ever headed back up to NE Arkansas."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Such a beautiful place to stay! My family truly loved their time and we hope to stay here again next year!

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"It was so peaceful and beautiful. I love looking out the window and seeing the horses and longhorn cattle just walking by my granddaughters. Enjoy going down to the pond and looking at it. We are booked on a weekend where there was a fall festival so there was tons to do with that. Overall, it was just a really wonderful place with lots of room for family to gather. Would highly recommend."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We absolutely loved our stay. The property is absolutely beautiful. Jennifer is the nicest host I have ever encountered. We hope we can stay again.. we made great memories. Thank you so much for opening your home.

2023-08-01,5.0,Group trip,Love love love this place!!! My family and I can’t wait to be back already!
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,I absolutely loved this Airbnb. We go to Jonesboro once a year to visit our close friends and this stay was by far my favorite. Jennifer communicated so well & was an excellent host for us. She made our stay easy and very enjoyable! The animals were lovely & the scenery was so beautiful. Will stay again!

Feels like home when working out of town."

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This was a great place to stay in NEA! If you have kids, this is a must! It had a wonderful lake with dock to fish in and horses/cows came right up to the back porch, my kids sat at the window to keep watch! It was in a great location, less than 20 minutes to both Paragould and Jonesboro! We will definitely stay again for another weekend adventure!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Pictures don’t do it justice. Jennifer was easy to communicate with and was very accommodating and proactive. I’ve already told people about it and have recommended staying there.
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,This place was ideal for a weekend getaway. The views were stellar and peaceful. I enjoyed the friendly dog and lake access. I will definitely stay here again.
2023-06-01,4.0,Group trip,"We loved the place. Very nice and peaceful. BEAUTIFUL land and enjoyed watching the horses and longhorn cattle. There were even fireflies in the evening near the trees. Flys we’re kind of annoying but I suppose this time of year (mid-June) they’re bad everywhere. We have the annoyance in New Mexico (where we are from). Traveling back to NM they were bad at every stop. The only reason it wasn’t a total 5 star ⭐️ review is because we wanted a place for family to come a go. We had 6 people staying but we’re only allowed 3 cars parking and with many people visiting because we had our matriarch (soon to be 89 yrs old) for families to visit with her. So I had to shuttle people back and forth from different parking lots in Jonesboro and Brookland. Jennifer (our host) said it was because they had so much rain. All things considered, we had a great time with family and would recommend Jennifer’s property."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,What a great house. Loved seeing the cows and horses she had. Great location for what we needed. I will be back

My 3 friends traveling with me was very impressed as well"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Beautiful views and it has that private feeling, but host is also nearby if any troubles arise and you need help! There is a glass chess board, what more can I say?"
2024-06-01,5.0,Group trip,The house was fine. My husband and I used the bedroom on the main level. My daughter and her family used the basement. It worked great.
2024-05-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Bryan is a great host and his place was perfect for our needs. We’d definitely stay there again!

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We had a wonderful family vacation. My sister and I had her children with us. The home was baby/child safe for the most part. As with any environment, you still have to watch children around stairs and electrical outlets, but there weren't many breakables within toddler reach and things like that. Home was clean, comfortable, and cozy. Quiet and peaceful environment. We didn't utilize the hot tub or lake nearby due to weather, but those are nice amenities for peaceful and fun vacation. Bryan was extremely personable and responsive for any and all questions. I will absolutely book this place and work with him again!"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We really enjoyed our mini vacay at Bryan's place!

2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very quiet peaceful location. Plenty of room inside and out. Very dated and cluttered decor. Not close to restaurants or shopping.
2023-12-01,5.0,Group trip,Bryan was very nice and accepting. We enjoyed the stay very much and it was cozy like home! Definitely recommended for others!
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Private & homey feeling!! My family of 7 enjoyed the home & grounds! We can be a large group in one home but this house was perfect! Kids had their own space. Only thing I would change is more TVs but that wouldn’t make me rate it anything less than 5 stars
2023-12-01,5.0,Group trip,Wonderful place to stay for a work retreat/Christmas party. There was even a Christmas tree set up. Bryan was wonderful to work with ❤️
2023-12-01,4.0,Group trip,"We were thankful for our short stay in Bryan's home. The surroundings are beautiful. The hot tub was extraordinarily clean. And Bryan was a friendly, responsive host. Some things that future guests might appreciate knowing: Although the home sleeps six, the dining table only seats four. This rental is one where the owner is truly renting out their own home, and much of their belongings are still in it (ie. gun safe and hat collection in master bedroom, empty liquor bottle collection in the dining area, among other things.) Personally, we'd prefer less personal belongings in a rental, but that may just be a style preference. Once again, we were grateful for Bryan's friendliness, and the surroundings are beautiful."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"The home was welcoming and our host, Bryan, was indeed a Super Host. Our family had a great time together and everyone kept saying how much they liked it there. If you get a chance to stay here…DO! You’ll love it!"

2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Bryan's place is great! This was the second time my family stayed at Bryan's place because we truly enjoyed it the first time as well. Bryan is proactive with communication and his place is very home-like, including the decor. It is a roomy house out in a private quiet area with peaceful quiet woods behind the house. Highly recommended!"
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,very nice very clean house perfect for what I needed thank you very much

2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Bryan's place is a great get away from city life! It's close enough the city (Jonesboro and Paragould) if you need, but far enough away to be away from it all, which is why we chose this place. I brought the entire family down (including the dog) while I had a week long class at Arkansas State University. My wife works from home and needs quality internet (the internet service was great and is exactly as described). The front yard is well kept and big enough to play anything you can imagine, and the backyard has plenty of woods to explore. Hot tub and firepit were great. Plenty of wood laying around to burn. Beds are comfortable, house is roomy, clean and well decorated. Plenty of stuff to cook with if that's your thing. Great place to stay if you are traveling for work, or just want to get away for a while. We would definitely stay here again."

The house was about an hour and 26 minutes away from the Zoo. The house itself was amazing, it had everything we needed and more. Very clean inside and out. The hot tub was perfect. I will saw it is a bummer that the only tv we could watch anything on (without hooking something up) was the one in the living room, but thats not that big a deal honestly. The owner was always very nice, accomidating and very quick to respond. If we ever are back in the area we will be checking this place for availabilitys first. :)"
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We had a wonderful weekend in this beautiful home. Open and spacious. Comfortable beds and bedding. Clean.

Very peaceful & quiet. The hot tub was a welcome surprise. I booked our trip on short notice & without reading a single review as we had an urgent family matter. Bryan’s home made us feel like we hit the blind Airbnb jackpot. We had everything we needed and if we didn’t, Bryan provided it promptly. The yard is beautiful and perfect for kids to run and play. The front porch swing made the perfect spot to sit and watch the kids, read a book or just enjoy the serenity of the outdoors. We have stayed in many Airbnb’s in the Jonesboro/Paragould area. Bryan’s place quickly filled the #1 position on our list. It will be our “go to” for any future visits."

2020-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Atmosphere / Location – What an excellent location and atmosphere. Why stay in the city when you can get away? Very quaint home just outside of Jonesboro. My wife and son only stayed the night and wish that we could have stayed longer. Very pleasant home perfect for a getaway or just passing through.
Rooms - The home was very clean and well kept. Beds were very comfortable. We had everything we needed for our stay.
Bath room - The bath room was also very clean. Again, everything that we needed was provided in ample supply for our stay.
Host / Amenities / Service – Your host has done a fantastic job enabling all of the services you might need. We had a fabulous time and highly recommend staying at Quiet country home close to Jonesboro and Paragould."

2020-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Bryan is great!! We weren’t able to stay at the Airbnb because we were traveling with too larger of trucks and trailers (we were moving and passing through Arkansas). Bryan offered to come help us be able to get our vehicles onto the property but we had already driven to a hotel because we were exhausted and wanting to get to rest ASAP. We had to cancel last minute and Bryan was incredibly responsive and kind. He also reimbursed the cost of our stay. Though we weren’t able to stay on the property from what we did see it was BEAUTIFUL!! Bryan is a great host!!

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We only stayed for one night but can only recommend booking with Mayra. The check-in was super easy and the host provided us with all the information we needed. She replied almost instantly and was very friendly. The tiny house was exactly as shown on the pictures and includes everything you might need. As for the location: there's not really anything around, but you can reach Jonesboro in about 15 mins by car where you will find restaurants etc.
All in all very happy with our stay & would definitely come back!"

2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,No complaints! Host was very responsive and kind!
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,The kids loved the loft!
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We were in town for a Softball Tournament and some other parents complained about the hotel they stayed at. They are not used to city life and had to listen to sirens all night. This place is about 10 minutes from town and was so quiet and peaceful. The only sounds we heard were the sound of car doors shutting from a couple other people arriving.
Also, I must give mention to how clean it was! Actually, it was IMMACULATE!! I was very impressed with how clean everything was.
The only downside is that the shower was tiny. I’m not a big person, but I found it difficult to move around to wash up.
It would’ve been helpful to have a full size mirror on the outside wall of the bathroom to allow extra room to get ready, since the bathroom is so small and doesn’t allow for two people at a time. But, over all I was extremely happy and would visit again!"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Exactly as pictured and described. Loved the easy check in and check out.

2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Mayra’s place was just what I expected from the description and pictures. It was a quick in and out for my friend and I but everything was great.

2023-07-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,"Leaves a bit to be desired in the functionality department. Looks just like the pictures but once you’re there, you realize it’s hard to find a place for your stuff. I’ve messaged host privately about the functionality, as I have stayed in several A frames that have got it going on!!
If you like strong coffee or well creamed, I do advise you to bring your own coffee and creamer.
She’s a good host who responds promptly and does want you to enjoy your stay! I can fully see the concept will be a great one, just needs a little more."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,nice place

2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,I stay here multiple times a month and always enjoy the quietness and also close to town but not in maquito-ville.
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This was such a fun stay! Beautiful surroundings and had Netflix on the tv! It was such a cute A Frame!
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This place ended up being a great stay! As long as you follow your GPS, it'll lead you right there. The cabins were nestled next to each other but I did not hear anybody else the entire evening. Everything was very spotless and clean and very much as the description said! It was really a cute place too. There was all sorts of good touches. I would say it was so clean, that I felt like I was the first person staying there. If I had to pick one negative thing, it gets a little bright in the morning as there is no curtain on the upper window of the A-frame. Other than that, I would definitely stay here again!"
2023-06-01,3.0,Stayed one night,Nice cabin. Not 2 bedrooms though. No privacy between beds.
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Very nice place to rest on our travels.

2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Will most definitely stay again nice little vibe !
2023-04-01,3.0,Stayed with kids,"Convenient, to get to, not very close to anything in town, no kitchen, and felt like it should have been better disclosed. Not the most comfortable place. Sheets were excessively fragrant, gave us all a headache. Loft needs some sort of railing. Not safe for a child."
2023-04-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"Very clean and comfortable! We loved the set up of everything and where it was located. The only thing that might bother some people is the shower size and there is barely any sink counter space. Everything else was perfect! The bedding smelled so clean, it cooled nicely and it was so peaceful."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Absolutely lovely place! I definitely will be visiting again in the near future!
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,cute little a frame cabin. really unique and we had the whole area seemingly to ourselves. Would definitely stay again!
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Based on our April 2023 stay, I think the place is new my map app didn’t recognize it and kept rerouting me. It took me a couple of times to figure this out. Just make sure you check your app! As time goes on, I’m sure that will be updated."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"The place was very welcoming and clean. Quiet area, would definitely book again :)))"

2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,had a great time great place very quiet
2023-03-01,4.0,Stayed one night,Very very nice!
2023-03-01,4.0,Stayed one night,Wasn't initially able to access our cabin with the code. Owner quickly arrived and let us in. Keypad wasn't working so they cleaned out a different cabin and set us up very quickly. We love the simplicity of the cabin. It was perfect for what we needed. Will recommend to others and will revisit if in the area.
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Nice unique place to stay!!!
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Great stay!!!
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Just as described and easy check in!! Great place to stay, highly recommend!"
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Enjoyed the stay! We were looking for a one night stay, but didn’t want to book a hotel room. Mayra’s place was a similar price to a nicer hotel in town. Don’t regret it."
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"My boys and I really enjoyed spending the weekend here. It was very clean, well furnished and the beds were very comfortable. I would stay here again. A+"
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,cute and cozy little place!
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Was easy to find and a tranquil area. I loved the split level with the loft design. It was a bit cold the night I stayed, so sleeping in the loft bed was great because all the heat went to the top of the A-frame, and it was a very cozy and warm bed."
2023-01-01,2.0,Stayed one night,"Upon arriving at about 6pm the room had a strong odor that smelled like someone with an upset stomach had just used the bathroom not long before we came in.
The place was cold when we walked in but the heater was already on 76 so we left it alone. Upon returning somewhere around 11pm, it was still ice cold. In fact, the room never warmed up even though the heater did run the entire time. We froze all night.
Lastly, the middle of the window in the door is fogged but the four sides are clear and you can see inside from the outside. We had to put a towel in the door and shut it so it would cover the window just to be comfortable changing. We took pictures of all of that if needed. It was just unsettling to know someone could see inside.
It was clean and as advertised but not worth the price to us due to the smell, the cold, and the lack of privacy due to the visibility someone could have by simply standing in front of the door."
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We enjoyed our stay. Our cabin was cute and very clean. The bed was comfortable. Before we arrived we had a message that there had been frozen pipes and we were asked about changing cabins. The weather had been extreme so we understood and appreciated the host being proactive. We also had a 50 foot trailer we were pulling and they were able to accommodate that, which was wonderful! They were also quick to respond to any questions. We would gladly stay here again.
I do want to point out, that the shower is extremely tight. I am 5'9"" and a big girl. I fit, barely, and it wasn't an issue for me. I'm cool with making do. I do think it would have been an issue for my 6'7"" brother. Just wanted to give any above average sized folks a heads up!
Definitely a great deal for the price."
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Wonderful stay in a beautiful place. Will be returning!

2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Cozy and wonderful little A frame outside Jonesboro was just what we needed on a road trip stop. The kids got a kick out of the loft and discovering a sweet horse neighbor. We’d love to return!
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Perfect place to pull off the road on our multi day trip.
It was a cold ride on the motorcycle and we were so glad to find blankets and a hot shower (which was harder to find than you think!)
We had a wonderful stay and would return!"

2022-10-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Very clean, great amenities. Small yet cozy. A little ways farther from town than expected but nice and quiet. Only issue we had was the toilet was loose on the floor but the host responded quickly when we let her know."
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Had a quick trip with my daughter for fall break. The location was great! AFrame house was so cute, had everything we needed. The towels, etc were great quality! The drive to and from Jonesboro was short but absolutely beautiful! Feels like the country, but close and convenient. Had a great time!"
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,A great little space to stay! Clean and fun for the kid. I really appreciated how affordable it was with the total fees. Thanks again.

I needed somewhere that felt like home while our new home was being finished in Arkansas. The cottage in Paragould felt just like that…home. Everything is as pictured, the home is very fairly priced for the accommodations you receive, the home was clean and smelled so good upon entry, our host was gracious enough to ensure a list of places to go and food to try were left for us, and the neighborhood is peaceful. We had a blast with the board games. I hadn’t seen or played “Oregon Trail” is decades! Our host held an open line of communication the entire stay and was able to accommodate us for reservations changes when we had to extend our stay. Karen and the cottage in Paragould were both my first introduction to Airbnb and Paragould, AR. She has made a lasting impression and I would recommend anyone to book your next stay at ANY of her properties!"

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,One of the best AirBnB experiences we've had. The house was very clean and cozy and walkable to downtown. The kids loved the arcade in their room- tons of fun.

She had great recommendations for places to eat. We felt very welcome and appreciated the hospitality!

2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"If you are looking for a charming house that makes you feel at home, then this is the one. It was perfect in every way. It was comfortable, clean, had everything we needed, a fenced in yard for our fur baby (which he loved by the way), and a patio to enjoy in the evening. It literally had all the comforts of home. Inside had a rustic, yet modern feel that we fell in love with when we walked in the door. Ashley and Stephen are amazing hosts as well. They were responsive and accommodating. I highly recommend this home. If I come back down to Paragould, this will definitely be my 1st choice!"
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Ashley was fantastic. I’ve done Airbnb’s before and she was the best I’ve had. Very fast responses. She went above and beyond to make us feel welcome. Her attention to detail was through the roof. Next duck season we will stay with her every time!
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"As my first stay in an Air BnB, and co grounds keeper of a traditional BnB, I was beyond please with my visit. even checking during my stay if anything needed attention. if you have the chance, this is an absolute blessing of a stay. Don't hesitate."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Loved this place! Would definitely use again!! Host was easy to get a hold of and quick to respond.
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Sarah's sunroom was so cute, cozy, and spotless. We booked this room when we were in the middle of an 18 hour road trip and plans for a hotel fell through. She was so kind about allowing us to book later in the evening/sam day and provided very specific directions for how to find the house. We did not have any trouble getting here whatsoever. Sara has lots of candy, snacks, and drinks provided in the cabin that make it feel cozy and welcoming. I truly have nothing to complain about with this cabin. If we are ever in this area again, we will be sure to book this sunroom. A million times better, safer, and cleaner than a hotel room."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"The sunroom was absolutely wonderful to stay in! The area it's located in is very serene and peaceful. The room itself was very cute and clean. I had to leave my fur babies at home for this trip so it was very comforting to have such friendly dogs to greet us. The best thing about our experience was Sarah. She was very descriptive and informative, she kept in touch, and was so friendly! We definitely will be looking to come back in the future."
2024-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Very comfortable and hubby really enjoyed the complimentary snacks! Thank you!
2024-05-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"beautiful place, friendly dogs, wonderful host 🙆💯"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,The Sunporch is the best! This is such a peaceful and relaxing place. Sarah is one of the best host I have ever had. I am going back there for a weekend by myself and I am gonna sit in the swing overlooking the pond and simply relax. Great experience.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,What a lovely place to stay! The sunroom is perfect -- so well thought out and planned. Everything you needed and so many thoughtful touches. Sarah was terrific at answering questions and communication -- all of the instructions were so clear and easy to understand. And we loved the pups! We were welcomed by two of the sweetest dogs in the world; they were also fantastic hosts! We only wish we could have stayed longer so that we could have explored the beautiful surroundings. We felt so at home.
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Sarah has always been a great host. Our contractor wants to stay at her place every time she is in Paragould. Sarah has always been very flexible and reasonable when we've had a last minute change. Will continue to book her place as long as its available.
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Wonderful stay, Sarah is an amazing host. All pups were super sweet and very playful with my pup."
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Sarah was a great host and communicated throughout the process of staying on the property. The only thing I didn't care for was a lot of traffic coming in and out of the main house on the property, but we did have a great time fishing in the pond, and we can't wait to be able to stay again with Sarah."
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,The stay was amazing. Our dog played well with the farm dogs. It’s very peaceful.. Couldn’t have had a better host!
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Sarah was such a lovely host! She was extremely responsive and even put up their precious pups to allow my girls some time to themselves.
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Great stay!
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Pros: the check in is convenient, the dogs are cute, the outdoor area is nice, it’s clean, and it has all the essentials (plus some treats which is nice). Cons: It was freezing when I came in, to the point I sat in my car for 30 minutes to wait for it to warm up. (The heater does work fine once it’s been turned on for awhile, I ended up cozy). I’m not certain if the value is there considering hotels in the area go for the same price or cheaper. (I don’t intend to be harsh on the hosts, I’m still giving 5 stars. this is just my honest review for fellow travelers)"
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,We loved our stay here - would definitely stay again. Everything was AWESOME. Willie was our favorite - the sweetest boy! Thank you for sharing your place with us.
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"If there was a rank above Superhost, this family would have it. They checked on us several times in our stay and even bought our supper one night. They went out of their way to make us feel at home and we did! We will definitely find a reason to come to the Sun Room again!"
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Very cute and clean place. The dogs were sweet and adorable. I saw 2 shooting stars sitting by the pond at night, so I loved that."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Wonderful place! Very clean and private. The bed was extremely comfortable. Very well put together and thought out. Will definitely stay again! Thank you!
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We loved The Sunroom ! The bed linens were so comfortable and cozy that it was hard to get out of bed this morning! The snacks and beverages are a nice touch. Sarah was very responsive, and we greatly appreciate the pet friendly accommodations. The yard was immaculate, and her pack absolutely adorable! Willie made sure we were welcomed and kept near me when I was walking my dogs late last night. We will definitely book again when in the area!"
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Second time staying there loved it
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,the sunroom exceeded my expectations. Super clean. super friendly hosts and super friendly dogs to play with my husky. I would definitely stay here again.
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We had another place booked and upon arrival it was infested with wasps. We had to quickly find another place to stay and this was it. They were fantastic being available on such short notice and super responsive and helpful. The dogs on the property are super friendly and really make you feel at home!
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We needed a place for us and our spoiled pup and this was a great place. The Sun Room was everything we needed. We arrived after ark and Sarah made sure all the lights were on outside so we could find our way.
Everything we needed was inside, including snacks for us and our pup.
If anyone needs a great place to stay in Paragould or in the Jonesboro area, this is the place."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Awesome place
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This was the best place on our trip from Orlando, Alanta and here. Beautiful and relaxing room!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Sarah’s place was just as pictured. It was a perfect private guest suite with all the things you would expect. It was immaculately clean and the bed was super comfy. We would definitely stay here again as a stopover on our return to Texas.
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We stayed at the ,""Sunroom"" 2 nights with my special needs daughter. We were all very comfy. My daughter loved petting the super friendly dogs, Sarah even had some treats to give them and my daughter loved it. We fed the fish at her peaceful pond. Bed super comfy and super clean.
Thanks Sarah,
Jean M."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Sarah offered a great Airbnb! We were not disturbed once, and it was like out own tiny home. Overall, the Airbnb was very cute and comfortable. The dogs were the sweetest and so lovable. This was an amazing stay, and Paragould is great for a nice weekend get-away.
Ps. The local Checkers has the best milkshakes and fries for a midnight snack!"
2023-09-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,"The host was very responsive, considering we made a last-minute reservation due to issues with another Airbnb host. The room was very clean and stocked with lots of candy and soda and water. The home is a little out-of-the-way, so it wasn’t super convenient to get to, but we found it just fine. The host has two very friendly dogs that stay outside and during the night they woke us up a few times barking which meant we didn’t get as much sleep as we were hoping for. Also, there are two large windows in the room that don’t have any shades, which meant we couldn’t sleep in because it got so bright in the room. Other than that, everything was fine. The host was very friendly and responsive. I think it would be great for someone who isn’t a light sleeper like myself."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Very good place and hosts
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Sarah’s place was easy to get into, I didn’t have any issues finding the house. Inside was clean and had everything I needed for my 1 night stay. I appreciate that her place is pet friendly. Her dogs were adorable and came over to say hi, just beware of this if your pet doesn’t like to be approached by other animals."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"this place was exactly how described. nice and clean lots of privacy, very roomy while feeling cozy. the great Pyrenees dog is so nice and beautiful."
2023-09-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"The directions were unclear for me. I know you can’t pick your neighbors, but the road in had lots of rough looking, junky homes. It was hard to believe such a lovely little place like Sarah’s was close to these homes. Her place was immaculate; so clean and smelled lovely.
The pond and patio were fun to spend time on. We saw rabbits, frogs, the catfish feeding routine and enjoyed petting their great perinese dogs.
When Sarah learned that we had some special needs for the visit, she was instant in beginning preparations to accommodate us."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Our stay at The Sunroom was great! It was very clean and was exactly as described. The snacks, drinks, and coffee provided were very appreciated. They even went above and beyond to accommodate our late check out time. Will definitely stay again if we’re in the area!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Sarah was very friendly and quick to respond. The morning we left for our trip she made sure to send driving directions, helpful tips, how to flawlessly use the keypad to help ourselves into the sunroom, and what to expect when arriving. The place is nicely decorated, and cute. She made sure everything we may need was stocked and in good taste. Beautiful country scenery. The fur babies were an added addition, however, very very well mannered! There were treats left so that if we wanted to make friends with the pups, we could. Again, they were very mannered. Check out was super easy, just a quick message to let her know we’ve gone. We hope to revisit this place and enjoy the amities we weren’t able to during our stay due to the weather."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Cute and comfortable home! They thought of everything!
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great cozy place !
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The Sunroom is great; exactly what I was looking for. It's somewhat secluded and very peaceful. It's exactly as described and very clean. I especially enjoyed the deep soaker tub (something hotels rarely have) for easing aching muscles. The patio is really nice, and if you want a small fire just walk across the road and use the fire pit/ring next to the pond. I didn't think about it at the time, but I suppose you could build a small fire and roast a few hotdogs and/or marshmallows. The pond is full of catfish and you can feed them or try to catch some from the dock with the included fishing gear (I preferred to just feed them). The Sunroom is just a few minutes from visiting friends/family, shopping, dining, entertainment and Reynold's Park (I think that's still the name) which can be accessed by at least two directions (I used both). Overall, a very pleasant experience and one I recommend."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I loved the sheets! I came after dark, so was a little tricky for me to find, because my eyes don’t do great in the dark. Thank goodness for her directions in addition to the GPS. Her directions were spot on! The place was roomy, clean, and the dogs friendly and made me feel safe coming in at dark."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This is one of my favorite places i've ever stayed! the host is such a wonderful person to communicate with, very fast responses, very sweet. We booked this place super last minute due to storms and she was so understanding! The house is so comfortable and clean. The property is beautiful, The dogs were adorable and so sweet, and i really am looking forward to the day i can come back here!!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Sarah went above and beyond for my parents during their anniversary stay. She made them feel welcome and part of the family. She helped them find all the things to do in town. My parents couldn't say enough about how amazing she is!
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This is an off the beaten path (literally, as there is a gravel and dirt road you take to get there) place. It is very cozy and clean. As noted, there are unleashed dogs around, so be sure that works for you and your pets."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Loved staying here! It was so nice and peaceful. Derrick even brought us over a fishing rod so we could fish at their stocked pond. Great hosts and cute dogs.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Cute studio about 4 miles from downtown. The place was clean and the dogs were sweet. It's on a gravel road that is nice for a morning stroll (take dog treats for the friends you'll meet on the way).
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"It was a beautiful place, comfy bed. The only disadvantage was that the Wi-Fi didn’t work and I had no service at all, but that wasn’t a big deal to me at all. It was such a nice and quiet little area.We loved getting to pet the fur babies and my nephew loved the pond and getting to catch toads."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We had a great time here, would recommend!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Sarah’s place was perfect for our needs while visiting family in the area. The bed was comfortable, always important!! Loved the snacks she left for us (we ate ALL the kisses 😬), and she and her husband, Derrick, were so friendly and quick to respond to anything we needed. Loved the intro photos of the dogs..:when we finally met them, we felt like we were meeting celebrities! Although big, they were very friendly to both the humans and the canine in our party. The setting out in the country was very peaceful. Hopefully we’ll be able to visit again!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The host is friendly, and there are a lot of snacks."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We had a quick overnight stay at The Sunroom on our way to Texas. It was just right for our needs and was in a lovely, peaceful location. Sarah was a most helpful and attentive host. Highly recommend!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"A true example of excellent hospitality. The room is beautiful, very clean, quiet, spacious, nicely designed, bed and pillows are comfortable. Really great place to stay. Serene and peaceful surroundings. Bathroom is very good, super clean, equipments work great & there are all necessary toiletries of perfect quality. Snacks, sodas chocolates, water were also provided. Wifi is also available. Sarah is a good host, professional and very helpful. I love the dogs, they are very friendly and welcoming. Pure good souls that love people. I highly recommend Sarah's place if you are in the area. Will definitely come back again. Home away from home. ❤"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Thank you Sarah for the amazing stay at “The Sunroom”. The place was SUPER clean, smelled amazing and very peaceful! Sarah was very responsive, helpful and friendly! The dogs on the property were very sweet and the amenities were great too! My son loved the provided snacks! I would definitely recommend staying here and we would definitely come back!!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"I loved this place! Very thoughtfully designed and finished. Everything is provided, including snacks. Super clean. There were fireflies everywhere at night and nocturnal birds singing. Its a short drive off the freeway but so worth it."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The Sunroom is a gem in Paragould located on the route we travel from Kentucky to Texas. It is maybe two miles from the main drag and easy to find. Just my wife and myself were in our party. The Sunroom is not huge but plenty of space for two people that like each other or a couple with one or two children. Spotless, squeaky clean with all amenities and plenty of extras (Keurig coffee maker, soft drinks in the fridge, breakfast food, and a truck full of sweets). Extremely well constructed with a well thought out floor plan, efficient use of space, and a very interesting and tasteful decor. PEACEFUL AND QUIET which is what we were looking for after a long drive from Houston. Clear, timely and friendly communication from Sarah. Everything top notch. Would stay again in a heartbeat if available on our next trip.
Thanks for a great stay. We truly appreciate the effort.
Jim and Betsy"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The dogs were wonderful!! We had a great time fishing in the pond!
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The stay was perfect, for our weekend get-away. The space was very peaceful and very clean. Enough linen for all 3 of us. The dogs were just as peaceful as the description said they were. Always a nice presence in such a relaxing serene area. Thru messaging, Sarah was a very present hostess, most mannerly and welcoming. My husband also loved the fishing pond. He caught (and released) fish and he loved that they gave him some fight. Definitely recommend staying here. My husband is already wanting to go back! Stay, Sarah does leave the light on for you!!!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The Sunroom was excellent! It was very peaceful, very remote, and very relaxing! Sarah was an excellent host! She was very helpful with any questions I had, and had a super quick response time! I can not express enough how welcoming Sarah was! We walked around the pond, sipped on the DELICIOUS complimentary coffee and watched the fish. We sat on the swing and enjoyed the beautiful, peaceful atmosphere.
I can not wait to tell my friends and family about this beautiful location!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The place is a beautiful, quiet little getaway out in the country. It is dog friendly and the hosts' dogs are super friendly and love to approach pets. The hosts are friendly and easy to get in touch with if I had any questions. The place was easy to find. Everything in town is nearby and easy to find and I would definitely come back and stay here again."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,The place was beautiful and secluded. Sweet dog’s beautiful stay. Didn’t realize it was a duplex But didn’t feel disturbed by anyone there reminds me of a tiny home! Loved it it was so cute and the interior design as cute. Wouldn’t recommend bringing frozen food it’s got a compartment abt big enough for an ice tray but not for frozen food. Host were very friendly and helpful. My large dog love all the land and my small one loved to bask in the sun 10/10 would recommend for couples who appreciate peace and quiet and nature. Only abt 10 mins from a gas station and Walmart along with some other restaurants.lovely place !

It was a great little find and the owners were very friendly and helpful. It is close to town if you desire.

Would definitely choose this place again if ever in the area."

2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,This was our second time staying at this Airbnb and was again a great experience.

2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"My wife and I can truly say we haven’t had a bad experience with any of our bookings in the past, but Sarah’s little place was over the top. Everything from the place looking like you could eat off the floor down to even the smallest little details like drinks candies you name it. That wasn’t all tho it was really like wow someone these days even makes sure the candy is exactly where it needs to be. I would go back any-day and most certainly would recommend her place for a stay or 5. Thank you Sarah hope to see you guys again soon.

2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"If you are looking for a quiet place away from the hustle and bustle of life, you could not ask for a better place, and yet close enough to town that you can easily access anything you want within 10 minutes!"

We only wish we could have stayed longer."

2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Looking for a quiet country getaway but full of amenities than this is the place. The studio sunroom is beautifully decorated, very clean, and modern with country appeal.
Beautiful porch to enjoythe pond, dogs, birds, and nature. It was a relaxing place to stay while I was away from home for work and was MUCH better than any hotel. The dogs were so sweet and well mannered. I would recommend this quaint getaway for anyone looking to be out of town but just close enough."

2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,A place that will make you feel right at home. A beautiful property. My dogs loved it !
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Very nice Airbnb with everything you’ll need in a nice countryside area. Though it is an one bedroom suite it’s attached to their house, yard is still shared as well as, privacy."
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Great place to stay and wake up to morning sunshine. was also great getting greeted by some nice dogs and having treats provide to give to them.
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Sarah's home was better than we could have imagined. The space was very clean and more than enough room for a couple with 2 dogs. The bathroom and kitchen were stocked with items that we found to be a nice touch to the place. Even the doggos had a treat! The yard was more than large enough for our pups to run around in and they even played with Sarah's dogs (who were extremely friendly to both dogs and humans). Overall, we loved our stay and would recommend Sarah's to anyone!"
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This kind of place is the reason I like to stay at airbnbs and not cookie cutter hotels. This is a private unit attached to Sarah and Derrick's home. They were very helpful and kind (even when I accidentally parked on their lawn!) The unit was very clean, stocked with snacks and spacious. But the best part of this stay is the sweet, friendly dogs hanging out on the property. The dogs were eager for pets and head scratches but also veryyy chill with me and my dog. I'd definitely stay here again as a pit stop on my road trip home."
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,It’s a beautiful room with beautiful scenery outside.
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Such a cute space! The dogs were so friendly and cute. The place was very clean and the snacks/water bottles to have when we got in late from driving were so nice! We stayed one night to break up our long drive and it was a great spot!
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Comfortable bed, nice coffee for keurig , and very clean."
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,What a great space. Peaceful and quiet. Great bed. Great snacks. Friendly hosts!
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Expect to see a cozy spot in a somewhat rural area. The family-oriented location is surrounded by woods with a small lake. Large doggies reside here but get along with another well mannered pup. The room is clean and accommodating; perfect for a quick stay.
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is a really cute and unique little place. Sarah is a great host. The other family members we met were very friendly and welcoming. The dogs added a great touch and helped me feel right at home. The area from the driveway to the door of the room is very user friendly, all concrete, flat and no steps."
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Sarah’s place was perfect! I have been to a lot of airbnbs, but Sarah has been the most hospitable host I’ve had! Her and her husband really made sure we had what we needed and enjoyed our stay. We definitely overpacked because their airbnb had pretty much all we needed! They even had dog treats and offered to get us things for the holiday. (: It was the cozy, secluded, and relaxing getaway we were looking for to spend the holiday. The cutest little airbnb ever! Loved every minute of it!"
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"The sunroom is a beautiful space, lots of windows and lots of sunlight to enjoy while relaxing in the spacious room. This is a repeat spot for Airbnb-ers."
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The Sunroom is really comfortable room in a quiet setting. Sarah and Derrick were both really great and super responsive to emails and questions.
The shower was hot with good water pressure, the wifi was fast and reliable. The furnishings were comfortable.
The snacks were a nice treat and the Kuerig was great with lots of coffee options.
There is not a way to cook so plan accordingly. There is a microwave and mini fridge which worked well for our needs."
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"THIS PLACE WAS AMAZING!
Sara went way up and beyond her ""call of duty"" as a host! The ""Sunshine"" room was beautiful. Such a peaceful place!
Loved having Willie (their oldest dog) greet us when we first arrived. 🤗 I will
DEFINITELY stay here again!"
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great place to stay and very welcoming.
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Was greeted by big Willie at the drive way and was the start of a great stay. Was a perfect spot to stop on our long road trip with our dog.
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Very clean place very nice. There was a pond across the way that you can sit at there was very beautiful. The house are very accommodating and they help give me kits to do around town. Will definitely go back.
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Immaculately clean, modern guest unit. This is an efficiency style guest house attached to the hosts' home, in a serene setting with a view of a pond. The owners have 4 friendly dogs. It was hard to find in the dark, but the hosts went out of their way to guide us there. Sarah also put out extra effort to give us recommendations for restaurants in Jonesboro."
2021-09-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,"Several aspects of this rental didn’t meet expectations, and I offer the following comments in a constructive spirit in hopes that conditions improve as a result. I would have expressed them directly to Sarah, but she was out of town. (In fact, I saw no one at all on the premises for the entirety of my stay.) First off, the positives: The remote setting is peaceful and quiet; even the very inquisitive, super affectionate resident dogs were –thankfully– “bark free”. The compact rental unit was tidy (with the exception of the toilet bowl, which was streaked and obviously had not been cleaned, and a bucket littered with cigarette butts between the two patio chairs on the small outdoor seating area next to the front door). The Keurig capsule coffee machine was in fine working order, but most other aspects of the kitchenette were sadly deficient. Here is an inventory: There was no flatware or eating implements save for a small wicker basket with plastic forks and spoons – no knife of any sort. The drawer labeled “Utensils” contained only scissors and one plastic spoon. No bottle opener or corkscrew. No bowls at all, no plates except for small and flimsy paper plates and a few larger plastic ones that warped and cracked when heating up take-out food in the microwave. For drinking, there was a solitary tall water glass (but four coffee mugs). Some of the missing elements were puzzling: Breakfast cereal and milk were provided, but there were no bowls. Is the guest supposed to use a coffee mug and a plastic spoon to eat the cereal? The small kitchen sink did have dish soap, but no sponge or dish towel. In other respects, there were no hooks to hang clothing or wet items (rather awkward given the heavy rains on both days of my stay), although the unit was adorned with several Christian crosses inscribed with Bible verses. The only potential clothes storage options were a heavy metal bar with one hanger perched precariously under the AC unit and directly above the bed; there was a bureau at the foot of the bed, but the top three drawers were stuffed with extra bedding. As to the bed itself, the mattress was adequate, but the all-polyester sheets were uncomfortable, and the bottom sheet was riddled with pilling. Finally, the Wi-Fi signal was weak (the router must have been in the main house next door): It worked, albeit quite slowly, on my iPad, but not at all on my PC laptop. If Sarah opts to resolve these issues, The Sunroom would be a much more satisfying retreat space."
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"These are the types of hosts that think of everything. Space was clean and check-in, etc were super low key. Would stay again if we were in the area!"
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This was out third visit to Sarah’s Sunflower Studio. It was very clean again and everything was in good working order.
How nice when you come in on a hot day to a cool room and a cold drink."

2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,cannot express how great this place is!! cutest little suite with everything you would need and the property is so fun complete with a pond of fish and farm doggos!!

2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We really enjoyed our stay at the Sunroom!! Everything you see in the pictures and write-up are true and even better in person. We will certainly stay there again if we return to Paragould for events we heard about this trip. Sarah was always checking on us by messaging to see if we needed anything. Such a peaceful setting that I think we need to return with no events to attend so we can just enjoy the peace & quiet & the birds & wildlife.
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"What a clean and comfortable space. We were greeted by sweet furry pals and had a great rest before our drive. Sarah was thoughtful, had many details in mind and available when ever we needed something. Would love to visit again:)"

2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful place. Cozy and sweet. The people were kind in the moments we talked to them, but for the most part they gave us our space. We caught some awesome fish in their stocked pond. Their dogs were sweet and didn’t bother us at all."
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Super cute little place, just out of the way enough to be quiet and close enough to be convinient. (And there is cereal!) Take some time to feed the fish!"

2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Wonderful stay in a beautiful area of the country. Sarah and her family are very warm and welcoming and made us feel like family. My wife, 10 year old son, and I had a great time and we all caught a lot of fish in the fantastic pond. The place is private, comfortable, and extremely clean. Great front patio as well. Will definitely stay here again and recommend enthusiastically."
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,What a lovely place this is! This studio was just what I needed after a long day of driving. It is super clean and the AC works very well. There is a place to park right next to the door and the dogs are very friendly (Hi Willie!). And it is very quiet and serene. I wish I had been able to stay longer. I look forward to coming back.
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We love coming to stay at Sarah's Place! This is our third trip. The accommodations are quiet and comfortable, and we sleep SO well in the absolute peace. Our old dog (16.5 y/o) loves to roam around the yard and play with Willie, the canine Airbnb host. Our gracious (human) hosts also gave us apples to feed the horses and there is food to feed the fish in the pond. Paragould is a neat town with lots to offer and we are so glad we found this location. Whether you are traveling with dogs, or looking for some peace, quiet, and calm, you will feel right at home here."
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We had a pleasant stay at the sunroom. Our booking was very last minute but the hosts were very accommodating and provided a truly pet friendly experience. We were greeted by Willie, the family’s Great Pyrenees who was gentle and calm the entire time. The pond is lovely and we enjoyed feeding the horses. The space was very clean and comfortable."
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Sarah is an excellent host! She is communicative, thoughtful, adaptive, and offers everything a person could need. She was particularly helpful on our last trip as I broke 3 bones in my foot the day before we were due to arrive. She helped me navigate through a cancellation and rebooking excellently. And I'm also happy to say her location is very handicap accessible! Paragould is a delightful town with lots of food options. Our dogs felt welcome and pampered and we were even given apples to feed the horses on-site. If you are in the area, you couldn't do better than with Sarah."
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This place is a slice of heaven for sure! So easy to find, and near everything you need. It is tucked away enough to be removed and peaceful, but near attractions and stores. If you like animals, nature, and clean modern styling, this is the place for you. Sarah was around with a warm smile for anything we needed, but provided us plenty of privacy and space. They even gave us apples to feed the horses; it really made the trip for me. My son caught a catfish from the pond on his first cast with the extra bait they provided. I am sure we will all have fond memories for all our lifetimes. Thank you so much!"
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This is a great place to stay only minutes outside of town. I was exhausted at the end of a long day working and was completely able to relax while sitting on the front patio, looking out over the pond and listening to whippoorwills. The tranquility and quietness was a welcomed relief from a hectic day."
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great pet-friendly place to stay!
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I highly recommend this location! It was completely quiet and had everything we needed traveling with two dogs. The surrounding area was beautiful and peaceful. Plenty of space for our dogs to roam/be walked safely. An outside sitting area, fridge, microwave and kitchen amenities. A quick 12 minute drive to town. I couldn't ask for anything more and plan to stay again as we return home from our journey. The host(s) was quick to respond to all my inquiries and was a pleasure to meet. Whether you are traveling with dogs, or just want a quiet get-away, this is your place."
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"What a beautiful gem! I was looking for a quiet and dog friendly place to rest during my travels and this place exceeded my expectations. The studio apartment is on the side of the house and private. It looks modern, cozy and new. Amazing views. Outstanding hospitality as there is even sodas and snacks! Best part that my dog was able to be off leash and played all day with their puppies!! He had the best time ever. Lovely spot highly recommended to be away and enjoy nature and peace."

2021-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We booked this unit while passing through Arkansas. The unit was sparkling clean and the communication made things simple. It is off the beaten path, very quiet, and pet friendly. Snacks and drinks were supplied which was a nice touch and prevented me from unloading the cooler. The owners were very personable and made us feel at home."
2021-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We really enjoyed our stay the hospitality we received was amazing very sweet people there little place was perfect for our visit would definitely look into again if we are in that area again.

2021-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Sarah has everything described to a t. You will not be disappointed to stay here. Everything was just as described. Hope to visit again soon.
2021-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Sarah was on it with communication! We came in at 1am after driving all evening with our 4 yr old and 14 week old pup, Thor(soon to be service pup!) to a WELL lit up outside and the lights on inside! It smelled nice, it’s newly renovated, clean, simple but all the necessities! Bed was comfy and it was quiet.
After a walk around the pond we met some of the family pups and they were all well behaved, friendly and wanted belly rubs! Thor got to make some friends before we got back on the road!
Finding these little gems have made our road trips even better!
*Next time we know to bring our poles for the stocked pond!"

2021-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,The Sunroom is a very cute little guest house right by a pond. My husband and I enjoyed getting to feed the fish in the pond before having dinner. Bonus points for us was that papa johns delivers to the guest house. After driving all day it was nice to not have to do anything extra for food. The guest house itself was very cozy and the windows provide lots of natural light (my favorite). The kitchenette was stocked with snacks and lots of drinks and coffee options. The bathroom was also stocked with essentials and the water was nice and hot! The hosts were so nice and love dogs! They were very kind to my poodle. They are also very responsive to messages! Wish I could have stayed longer.

2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Ann was very helpful in answering questions and communicating with us before, during and after our stay. Staying at Ann's ABNB was far better than a noisy and expensive hotel. Having three bedrooms and a washer/dryer made our stay much better. The kitchen was well stocked with everything needed to cook a meal. When searching for clean, safe and affordable lodging while in Paragould, look no further than here. Appreciated the ""Welcome Snacks"" as well."

Ann and her house easily earned an A+."
2021-09-01,5.0,Group trip,"My top hope is a clean and safe place for our traveling musician family (5 adults) to spend the night as we criss-cross the country for performances. Ann's sweet home more than filled the bill - with bonuses. Yay! Everything was perfect for our needs. We arrived after dark and were thrilled to find a super clean, tasteful, and cozy place to spend the night. After unloading our bags we were able to make a quick and easy trip (less than 5 minutes each direction) to pick up groceries to cook in the cozy kitchen for our late-supper. The shower had good water pressure and the bathroom was clean with plenty of towels. The mattresses were amazing - super comfortable - and we all slept soundly. We would not hesitate to stay here again when traveling through the area! Thank you Ann for quick and easy communication and for a well-thought-out home-away-from-home!"

2020-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The host was very responsive for us, and was able to answer questions almost immediately. The one issue we did notice, was the cable was basic as can be and there was nothing to supplement this with such as Netflix or anything. This wasn't a big deal for us as we were not staying that long, and we had a laptop with us that we streamed to the TV anyway.
The internet was very generous, and worked phenomenally for our needs.
The place was very clean, the only slight issue we had (which honestly, you should be doing anyway) is there was some debris in the pans when we used them - however, I would not knock the listing for this.
Overall, our stay was great - the amenities were enough for us (however if you plan on staying at the residence for extended periods bring your own firestick or something for additional entertainment)."
