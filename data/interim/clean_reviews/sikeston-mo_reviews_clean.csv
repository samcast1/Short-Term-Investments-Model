The house is beautiful decorated, kitchen fully stocked with everything you‚Äôd need and the most comfortable bed. The patio is private and perfect for relaxing in the hot tub while watching the sun set. We had a mild December evening so we were able to get a fire going and enjoy the quiet night by the pond. We went into Cape Girardeau for brunch at Mary Jane Bourbon and Smokehouse, which was only 15 minutes way, and soso good. I cannot say enough good things. We had a lovely, relaxing weekend."

They put lanterns in their pond, lights that led toward the shore, and when my girlfriend said yes put fireworks on display. We will be forever greatful and will definitely be coming back. Craig & Martina are excellent host and their booking is worth every penny."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Twisted Sassafras is THE place to stay for a little R&R! First, the treehouse is BEAUTIFUL!! It was decorated so nicely and the place was pristine! Everything tied together so beautifully to create a warm, welcoming space to rest and relax. The bedding was soft and the towels were luxurious! The fireplace and brick accent wall were so inviting! The hot tub was perfect! Every single detail was considered when this place was built! The kitchen was very well-appointed with everything you could need! The bathroom had a very nice shower and the heater made the bathroom even nicer! The owners were very thoughtful in their choices, and you can tell that they have tried to think of everything a person could need while there. The location was excellent, as you were just minutes from some wonderful restaurants (The Southerners and My Daddy‚Äôs Cheesecake) and lots of stores! We had such a lovely time and can‚Äôt wait to go back! Thank you, Craig and Martina for sharing your beautiful treehouse!"

2023-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"Private little house in the treetops. The place was absolutely gorgeous and super clean.

Hands down the best place we‚Äôve ever stayed!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this beautiful tree house! This was the perfect getaway! Only minutes from town, but it feels like you are out in the country. Our favorite part of our stay was the amazing sunset view from the hot tub!!
Craig and Martina are wonderful hosts who were very helpful and kind. They went above and beyond to make sure our stay was wonderful! The cold drinks in the fridge waiting for us at checkin was such a nice surprise!!
Loved this place so much!! Thank you for sharing your beautiful treehouse! WE WILL BE BACK!! ‚ù§Ô∏è
Scott & Jodi"
2023-11-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"What a wonderful treehouse! It was so cozy and perfect size! Love the privacy! The handcrafted bed was gorgeous and very comfortable! The shower was a dream! Love the area to relax while enjoying the fire pit.
The hot tub looked awesome- unfortunately it was broken during my stay- but the owners where so nice and let me know almost a week beforehand. I only had this weekend to come so I didn‚Äôt change my reservation. I plan on returning so I can enjoy the full experience. Amazing place to have a quiet, relaxing getaway!"

2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"First of all, this place was absolutely gorgeous! I knew as soon as I arrived at the location that it was the right choice to make. The fall scenery & warm colors of the leaves made it the perfect getaway for the night. Martina & Craig were great hosts; the place was immaculately clean upon arrival & they even brought alcoholic beverages for me! There was a binder of rules on top of the fridge along with a guest book to sign. I had booked twisted sassafras for my 24th birthday celebration; this was my first Airbnb I've booked, & my expectations were exceeded. The hot tub was my friend's and I's favorite part; it was less than 30 degrees outside but the hot tub kept us warm for hours! Thank you for giving me this opportunity; my friend who visited would now like to book the place sometime soon as well so I'm sure I'll be back! If you are thinking about booking here do it, you won't be disappointed!!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"Highly recommend! The treehouse was as beautiful as the pictures show. While not far from town, we felt like we were in the middle of nowhere. Our only regret was we were there for only one night. We would have loved to spend time by the fire pit and relaxing on the outdoor bed/lounge."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,We truly enjoyed our stay at the treehouse! It was everything posted and more. A true romantic getaway. Craig and Martina were very responsive and easy to communicate with. They gave recommendations when asked about local restaurants. They left us a hand written note with chocolates and cold drinks upon arrival. It was the perfect reconnect and break from reality. Thanks again!
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We booked the location for our daughter and our new son-in-law for a little honeymoon. It was perfect! He loves to fish, she loves to sit on the deck and drink coffee and they enjoyed the hot tub. Thank you for making it so special for them - a lasting memory!!"

2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,The cutest getaway! Will definitely be coming back!
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"Craig and Martina went above and beyond to make sure our stay was perfect. Starting with the small amount of wine and beer in the fridge to enjoy after a long drive and the frozen mugs waiting in the freezer, we had everything we needed to have a wonderful time. The property is gorgeous and the layout of the house is so well thought out. We really loved the comfy bed and mood setting electric fireplace. We will definitely find a weekend to come back! Thank you both for wonderful stay!"

2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had an amazing time at Craig & Martina‚Äôs treehouse! It was easy to find, felt very private and peaceful, and was spotless! Perfect Airbnb for a little getaway and R&R. Communication was excellent, instructions were super easy to follow, not a ton to do at checkout, and sweet little extras sprinkled throughout that made it feel extra special and welcoming. We can‚Äôt wait to visit again and have recommended to many friends and family! Cape G was fun to explore with tons of restaurants, breweries, thrift/ antique/ boutique shops and more! All around great experience!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,We stayed here for our anniversary and it was so adorable! It was comfortable & homey. The location was easy to get to but peaceful & private. We really enjoyed our stay and will definitely stay there again in the future. ‚ò∫Ô∏è
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Needed a weekend away after a busy season in life‚Ä¶the treehouse fit the bill and more! Beautifully decorated, the most comfortable bed and pillows (in fact, we ordered the pillows for our own home while lying in bed!) and a peaceful surrounding set the scene for a relaxing weekend. The owners were incredibly thoughtful in each of their design choices and we were comfortable from minute one. Can‚Äôt wait to return again!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,My husband and I recently celebrated our 18 year wedding anniversary and wanted some time away. This cabin provided exactly what we needed! We checked in on Friday afternoon and stayed through Monday. Check-in was extremely easy. The cabin was beautiful! The mattress was SO comfortable. We spent time in the hot tub and relaxed. It was wonderful!
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"It was everything we were looking for in a one-night escape. It was on a rural route, so quiet, but just a few minutes drive from town. It was tasteful, yet simple in its decoration. The hosts were generous and thoughtful, providing a couple cold beers and everything we needed to roast s'mores over a fire. But there was something more. The elevation of this tree-house puts you right at the base of the tree canopy. A young oak grows through the deck, there for you to lean on, perhaps sway in the breeze with, as you sip your morning coffee. The birds are plentiful and do not shy away from the porch rail. It was as if we were no longer strangers, being on their level as we were. We left feeling refreshed and rejuvenated, even after only a single nights stay. It would be a mistake to pass an opportunity to stay here."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We had a very enjoyable stay! The cabin is very cute and definitely will be thinking about staying here again in the future!
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"We love staying at the cabin!! If you want a great place to stay but close to lots of things to do, check it out!"

2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,My boyfriend and I had so much fun on our couples getaway! Highly recommend this place for a cabin feel away from home. They even left us a treat and brought a brownie pan so I could bake for my boyfriends birthday! Super appreciated!

2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful cabin. Pulling up its tucked back off the road, wife loved the flowers outside. Inside it just feels cozy.

2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,I visited back home and chose to stay here rather than a hotel. I was not disappointed. I had my two young ones with me and they enjoyed it so much. It‚Äôs a great place for family or even a nice little get away for a couple. And when I had a problem with the light they acted promptly and fixed it. I will be back!

2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"As always, this house was amazing. Not only are you in a private area, but you also have a lot of things to do in Cape. Andrew quickly responds to your messages and works with you if you need more time to check in or out, for example.
The only downside I have (which isn't even Andrew's fault) is that the fireplace had to be welded shut. We're already ready to come back, and we just left."
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great area, not even a 10 minute drive to the downtown area! Pool table was great and the hot tub was awesome as well! The bed was comfy and we loved the dartboard as well!

2023-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great communication!
True log cabin feel"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Place was just as advertised. It is located in a residential area, even though it is an actual log cabin. It is a large one room cabin with bedroom and bathroom walled off. Everything worked fine. We used the hot tub. Quiet neighbor hood. Casino right down the road. I would rent again. Owner was in communication and available if we needed anything."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great getaway place. The neighbors are closer than I expected but it still was a private space and quiet. It was clean and well stocked. The owners were extremely attentive. We had no issues but they checked on us multiple times thru text. They listed multiple recommendations for food and drinks. We would definitely stay again!
2023-11-01,5,Stayed one night,Peaceful and beautiful place. Me and my boyfriend are already planning to stay again soon. Hot tub was wonderful
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Perfect place to spend our weekend. Hot tub and pool table were great activities!
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,Great place!
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"Andrew's place was a nice quiet getaway. It has been the best place we've stayed out of our visits, nothing wrong with the others. The location was close to other houses but felt like we were away from everything. Andrew has plenty to do in the house it was hard to leave to get out & enjoy the town. We made great use of the pool table dart board & hot tub, as well as enjoyed the back deck & front porch. We are hoping to stay there again soon. Also, special memories were made here during our visit. Thanks again Andrew for providing a great log cabin for people to stay in while visiting Cape Girardeau, MO."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,Cozy and perfect location in town. Loved it!
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"the Cabin far exceeded our expectations! communication was very easy, as well as the check in process! The inside was delightfully more spacious then how it appeared on the photos. we were definitely pleasantly surprised!
we have a lot of favorites, but our highlight was definitely the hot tub, while the pool table was an added bonus of our night!
the deck was absolutely the perfect backdrop for our morning cup of coffee.
the only regret is that we did not stay longer! 10 out of 10!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Almost everything about this place is fantastic. They were very communicative and made sure everything was okay throughout our stay. The area around the house was pretty nice. The backyard is generally pretty private, and was super cute. The hot tub is an awesome bonus, plus a firepit, grill and pool table! The Cape Girardeau area is definitely a place for people who love the outdoors. They do have pamphlets for you to look through and find things to do tho. I only have 3 complaints, the main one being the lack of storage. I stayed there for a week, so I brought a lot, but if you're going for a weekend or something like that, the storage would be fine! My 2nd complaint is mostly a me thing because I'm a bit of a germophobe, but there are a couple of areas where it seemed time for a super deep cleaning, so that worried me a little bit. Also the bed was alright, the pillows were very uncomfortable. But overall, it's a very cute and fun place, and I absolutely would stay here again!"

2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Had a Christmas get away with friends abd everyone tgought it was an amazing place
2022-12-01,3,Stayed with kids,"The pictures are a little deceiving. I was expecting a cabin with more privacy and more seclusion. The cabin is more of a studio with a separated part for the bedroom. The back door only has one lock and no dead bolt. The street leading up isn‚Äôt well lit. The house was hard to find and the street is narrow. We did arrive at night time, so of course that made it harder. There is no privacy fence, so the hot tub just sits in the back yard just off the deck. Honestly, I didn‚Äôt feel very safe. I wish there were more locks on the doors and an actual privacy fence that went all the way around the back yard instead of just the sides. The side was pretty cool. The pool table and dart board were fun, and the bed was clean and comfortable. The bathtub was a little dirty along with the floors. Overall, the experience was just ok. I guess just based on the photos I had higher expectations."
2022-12-01,4,Stayed one night,if you're looking for a relaxing evening or weekend where there's enough to do where you stay that you don't even care if you go out or not this is the place in Cape
2022-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"This place is fun waiting to happen. I felt like I was back at camp, except a lot cleaner with more to do teehee. We appreciated the open floor concept with ample space to move around. We used the Roku tv to look up a workout video and then played pool and darts while we did our laundry. The bed was sooo comfy! (It felt similar to our own, which is firm with a pillow top.) Andrew was extremely accommodating and so sincere and responsive. We would def stay again. Recommend!"
2022-12-01,5,Stayed one night,I really enjoyed myself! I can not wait to book again in the future.

Very private with rolling hills and views of the river. The host was extremely responsive and provided so many amenities such as a coffee bar, firewood for the outdoor fire pit, plenty of linens and household supplies. Our group was very impressed with the cleanliness and attention to detail. The host even left a personalized welcome note and suggestions of things to do the area. We would definitely stay here again!"
2023-05-01,5,Group trip,"Laura was a wonderful host. She responded to any question or concern quickly. So many nice hospitality touches throughout the house to mention. We stayed 3 nights for our daughter's graduation at SEMO. We had our two other kids, my parents and my mother in law staying there as well. It was so nice to for us all to stay under one roof than in 3 different hotel rooms. We grocery shopped and made all our meals - so much better than trying to beat the graduation visitors at cape in the restaurants. The home was clean, spacious and decorated downright darling. The kitchen had every gadget or appliance we needed...the beds were comfortable and the bedding/linens/towels were great quality. I hope she is hosting in 2 years when my daughter graduates from Grad school at SEMO - because we will definately want to stay there again! We made wonderful family memories there during our stay! I highly recommend staying here...you will not regret it."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,We‚Äôre a men‚Äôs golf team traveling to the area for our tournament. There was lots of extra space for everyone to gather inside and out. There were lots of extra touches not normally found in Airbnb‚Äôs such as a continental breakfast bar and coffee bar. The team really enjoyed that. There were also sticks to make s‚Äômores on the fire pit. The setting was absolutely perfect for our needs. We would definitely stay here again should we be in the area. Very friendly and responsive host.
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,This is literally the BEST AirBnb we have ever rented! It was so relaxing and private. There was more then enough room for our family to sit down and enjoy a meal and a glass of wine (and a puzzle at the big table. Lol) Laura was an amazing host and went above and beyond to make sure we had everything we could possibly need or want. She even had a bottle of wine waiting for us and a personal note. Ten out ten! I would recommend this to anyone staying in the Cape area who has a larger party.
2023-03-01,5,Group trip,"Laura was a great host and communicator. Fellow coaches and I were in town for a volleyball tournament and had the best time here. Cozy, inviting and a convenient location for us. We were able to relax and recharge here. Check in/out was easy. We will definitely be back in the future."
2023-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,River Run was the first air BNB we have booked and everything was great. Our families were in town for a volleyball tournament so we weren't at the house a lot other than to get ready and sleep (and a little time to hang out and relax with our friends that we stayed with). Everything was super clean upon arrival. The beds and pillows were so comfortable. Plenty of extras of everything if needed. I actually forgot to pack my toothpaste and toothbrush and she had all that stuff under the sink in case it was needed. The bath towels were so soft. The kitchen was nicely stocked with extra pantry items for our use. The kids absolutely loved the breakfast buffet that she left for us! and the stocked coffee bar was just what was needed for us adults! The location and scenery was amazing. it was super windy the days we were there so we weren't able to use the fire pit which we had looked forward to but you can't control nature. If we are ever back in Cape Girardeau we will def stay here again!
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We can‚Äôt thank Laura enough for allowing our family to experience Christmas Eve at River Run! It was a night full of new memories and reminiscing‚Ä¶Absolutely Perfect. Accommodations were perfect for our family. Thank you so much Laura for every detail!

The host, Laura, will make you feel welcome and is very responsive while you are there. Did I mention how clean and comfortable the home is? And peaceful.

2022-06-01,5,Stayed over a week,Laura was an absolute awesome host and the place was AMAZING!!

Communication with Laura was seamless and she had so thoughtfully added touches throughout the home to make our stay more comfortable.
We were visiting for SEMO‚Äôs graduation and enjoyed the calm comfortable space in the midst of a busy stay. Our favorite moment was sitting outside in the morning watching barges move down the Mississippi. We will definitely return for another stay!"

2022-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This is a gem of a place, and you‚Äôll love it! It‚Äôs comfortable, well stocked, quiet and was large enough for our family of 7. The house was charming and had amazing beds and sofas, so cozy. There were plenty of blankets and throws, since it was chilly on our weekend. The bed trays with water, chocolates and towels were a nice touch, robes and slippers, bottles of lotion, shampoo, etc...all made us feel like we were in a 5 star hotel! But the really great touch was the breakfast bar, with pastries, fruit, cereal and such! The coffee bar seemed great too, but we aren‚Äôt coffee drinkers. Plenty of dishes, flatware, utensils, etc were on hand. The artwork and decor was top notch and the creaky wood floors so authentic, they brought back childhood memories. Thank you Laura for a comfortable, easy set up, check in and place. SUPER job. The best Airbnb we‚Äôve ever been in!"
2022-03-01,5,Stayed one night,Perfection! You will not be disappointed. No detail was overlooked. I will be back to share this GEM with more family and friends soon!
2022-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This home was by far the best airbnb we have stayed at. So many thoughtful, personal touches that made our stay more than comfortable. From the bed trays with water, extra towels, and chocolates to the extra deep bath tub, to the muffins and breakfast bar, and the beautiful scenic view of the river and countryside. Super close to town but feels like you are staying at grandma‚Äôs farmhouse. Super spacious home with plenty of areas to unwind. Highly recommend staying here if you are in the area. My son forgot his beloved lovey elephant and Laura shipped it to me immediately, forever thankful."
2022-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Best AirBNB property our family has ever stayed at! The living room is spacious and the overstuffed large furniture was wonderful! The dining room provided a coffee bar and breakfast bar along with a beautiful 8 person dining room table. The kitchen had everything we needed to make meals along with a spacious fridge. All of the bedrooms had plenty of extra linens, blankets, pillows and had comfortable beds. The porch and roof top deck was adorable and the fire pit looked very inviting! We didn't get a chance to use these 3 areas but will come back another time so we can. This house was clean, cozy and very relaxing. It was exactly what our family needed to unplug and enjoy. You will not regret staying here!!
Cape Girardeau was fun to explore - and do yourself a favor, take the 30 minute drive to Lamberts Cafe in Sikeston. It is WORTH the drive."

2021-08-01,5,Group trip,You cannot go wrong staying here. This home is absolutely adorable and sits on a beautiful property. Laura's attention to detail is beyond and you will not be missing anything during your stay here. Would definitely come back to stay here if I am in the area!
2021-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Beautiful property close to town but far enough away to enjoy the peacefulness of the area. Beautiful home, can't wait to make it back one day! Thanks Laura"
2021-08-01,5,Group trip,She went above and beyond. Great place to stay!
2021-08-01,4,Stayed with kids,Laura‚Äôs home was wonderful and very welcoming. It was just as described and our family loved our stay! We had plenty of room to spread out (all 8 of us!). The beds were extremely comfortable and the home was stocked with everything you could need and more!
2021-08-01,5,Group trip,"You will not be disappointed with Laura's property or the amenities! Close to the downtown area, it provides easy access to all of the downtown attractions, while still being secluded and serene. Her home was absolutely beautiful, had everything we could have possibly needed and more! Laura was also very responsive during our stay and promptly answered all of our questions. I highly recommend this property to anyone who's looking for a quiet getaway in the Cape Girardeau area."
2021-07-01,5,Group trip,"This is a wonderful house and Laura is a great hostess. There were so many little things she did (left goodies for the morning after our arrival, or upon our arrival, had items stocked on the bathrooms in case we forgot something, directed us to restaurants and things to do in the area) to make us feel so welcomed. Plus the kitchen was well stocked with cooking utensils, etc. for meal prep on premises. We commented it was one of the most welcoming houses we have ever been to (snd we‚Äôve been to quite a few)."
2021-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Best Airbnb we‚Äôve stayed at, and wish they were all like this. The home is exactly as described with a ton of extras that had my youngest exclaiming it was the best house EVER!! The location is very private, but a short 10 minute drive into town.
For a large family, this was perfect‚Ä¶snacks, toys, extra TV space, well equipped kitchen (a lot of rentals sleep 8+, but only have dishes for 5 or 6). We unexpectedly stayed at this home after our previous rental in a ‚Äútrendy‚Äù area had bars on all the windows. After an uncomfortable night in 2 hotel rooms with 6 people, and a frantic search, we found this gem. My only complaint is we only got to stay one night!!!"
2021-07-01,5,Group trip,Everything is perfect. We stayed 2 nights and enjoyed staying very much.
2021-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,Laura's place is as advertised. It has all you will need and probably more. It is so quiet and peaceful there and the facility is wonderful. The porch was a favorite for our family as we had nice breezes the whole week we were there. Everything was extra clean and there is plenty of room. You will not be disappointed as the description and pictures give you an adequate idea of what it is like. Many thanks to Laura.
2021-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,A great place to stay.
2021-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,Laura goes above and beyond to ensure no amenity and comfort is left off the list. Such a cute place with so much beauty to offer!
2021-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We stayed here, three families with a total of 13 kids between us. We felt right at home, had plenty of room, and enjoyed the many extra perks that Laura has added to the home. We loved having the sweeping views of the Mississippi River, and the fire pit was perfect! Thank you for having us! A beautiful place to unwind and spend quality time."
2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great place to stay, extra little touches in each room, Laura goes above and beyond for sure, highly recommend!!"

She went out of her way to provide everything you would ever need on a weekend away including a portable speaker and toys/activities for kids. The location is beautiful, right on the Mississippi River. We enjoyed the firepit and playing in the huge yard."
2020-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"If you're looking for a place to stay with a slightly larger family .... this place is it. Amazing house, completely quiet location, and from the minute you walk in the host has taken care of anything you think you might need. 5 stars are not enough."
2020-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"If you are looking for a quiet, beautiful place to get away to, this is it. The house is in the country but very easy to get to. Close enough to town for sight seeing and shopping. The house itself is gorgeous, very roomy, beautifully decorated, and comfy! Laura has provided so many nice touches to make your stay comfortable. We enjoyed the nice fire pit outside each night. Loved having coffee each morning out on the patio with a view of the river and fields. The host communicated quickly ( we even booked very last minute). Will definitely stay here again. Also, SO clean!!"
2020-08-01,5,Group trip,Incredible location!

2020-07-01,5,Group trip,We needed a last minute booking for our girls weekend and thankfully Laura had a last minute cancellation so the property was available. It was way more than I could have hoped for. We had a fabulous time and downtown Cape Girardo has so many great shops and restaurants. We definitely plan on adding this place to our list for future visits!!
2020-07-01,5,Group trip,Great stay!
2020-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is a fantastic place to stay. Very clean, tons of room, comfy beds, everything you need in the kitchen, lots of outdoor space, very nice patio for outdoor meals, fire pit, and a beautiful view. The hosts were incredibly hospitable and made sure we had everything we needed during our stay. I would highly recommend staying here. We also explored the nearby state park, which has a lot of hiking trails and a lake to swim in. Great way to spend one day while you're here."
2020-07-01,5,Group trip,"Everything was exactly as advertised, Laura has a great space and is an amazing host! I would definitely recommend this place to anyone looking for a comfortable, stylish stay."
2020-07-01,5,Group trip,"I have no complaints about this home. You can tell a lot of time and effort went into making our stay exceptionally comfortable. The house itself was well equipped with anything you would need as well as included things that are sometimes forgotten when traveling like toothbrushes and shampoo. The property itself is fantastic with great views of the Mississippi River from the balcony and fire pit, plenty of parking and secluded enough to feel as if you have your own space but still very accessible and convenient. Laura was very friendly and responsive. I would highly recommend this home to anyone considering visiting the area."
2020-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Quaint older home that has been remodeled with excellent taste and style. Plenty of room, property is secluded and up on a hill with a cool (far away) view of the river and bridge.
We enjoyed our stay!"
2020-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"A warm, cozy, lovely home!
We came down for a softball tourney, and this home turned a long weekend into a special mini-vacation.
Laura has put so much heart into the details. Everyone noticed and appreciated all of the small things that make River Run so special.
Any future stays in Cape will result in heartbreak if we can‚Äôt stay at River Run. Such a great place!"

2019-12-01,5,Group trip,"You can expect to be quite confused! You will think that you are staying at The Ritz! The house is comfortable and every little detail has been thought out. I have stayed in just a few Air BnB's and many hotels, by far this experience has been the best! Don't think twice about renting this house. It was absolutely perfect!!"
2019-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Wow, what an amazing place to stay over our Thanksgiving vacation. This home far exceeded my expectations. The house was super clean and well maintained. The kitchen had everything we needed to prepare our Thanksgiving feast. Laura was very responsive even during our stay when I needed a little help. She had so many extra touches that were a surprising treat. We will hopefully book with her anytime we travel to the area."
2019-11-01,5,Group trip,"We are so grateful we chose River Run. We were in Cape for a family wedding. The reception was held at the Country Club and was only a few minute drive from the home. The home is in a lovely country setting overlooking the Mississippi River. It is a secluded resort on the edge of town, yet a very short drive for groceries and activities. Once inside, we were welcomed with area guide books and a FAQ binder for the home. Quaint framed signs are about the home with directions for everything from light switches to where to find things. We were treated to a continental breakfast, beverages in the refrigerator, a basket of single serve snacks, and pantry stocked with the basics. More importantly, we all had a restful night sleep in comfortable beds and luxury bedding. We highly recommend booking your stay at River Run."
2019-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The place was outstanding, clean and very accommodating! Laura was quick with responding with any questions we had as well! Cant wait to stay again when we re visit!"

2019-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"River Run is in a beautiful, private location but is only 8 minutes to downtown Cape. The owners have created a beautiful, comfortable oasis and have added many personal, thoughtful touches. It is very clean, check in is simple and the owners are responsive. Highly recommend."
2019-09-01,5,Group trip,"This place is everything a home away from home, great quality, home decoration and very very clean, she left no room for error."
2019-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This place will not disappoint! My family and I wanted a weekend getaway that we all could hang out in one place instead of a hotel. This house was beyond anything that we could have imagined. Laura has created a home away from home for my family. She went above and beyond on everything in the house. From pasteries, thoughtful notes, beds, robes, you name it she has thought of it. We ended up hanging out at the house most of our trip because we felt so at home. We will be returning!"
2019-07-01,5,Group trip,Laura was an amazing host! The home was beautiful and all of our expectations were met. Everything we needed was supplied. I recommend her as a host and this home if you‚Äôre looking to stay in the area.
2019-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,Loved our stay. Laura went above and beyond making our stay extra special. The check-in process was smooth. This is definitely a perfect spot for families away from the hustle and bustle but close enough to the city.
2019-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,This was a perfect and beautiful setting. Laura was an great host she went above and beyond our expectation. Our family enjoyed it all it felt like we was at home
2019-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Wonderful place to stay in the area with lots of privacy. It is very clean and lots of thoughtful touches including snacks and breakfast foods. Home is decorated beautifully with very comfortable beds. Would return if in the area in the future. Laura is a great hostess who provided directions and every amenity needed for a home away from home.
2019-05-01,5,Group trip,"River Run is a beautifully-outfitted home - charming yet spacious enough for our family. The views of the Mississippi River from the deck or screened-in porch (the cross breeze keeps you cool!) are not to be missed.
The host has gone out of her way to make the home welcoming and the amenities are what you would find at a nice resort: welcome trays on each bed, robes, flowers, snacks, wireless speakers and extra toiletries should you need them, just to name a few. The rooms are spacious (bigger than they appear from photos!), and the beds are comfortable with plenty of pillow options. The kitchen is fully outfitted and there are both indoor and outdoor dining options. The bathrooms are large, and the showers are top notch.
Laura, the host, is responsive and accommodating; her pride in the property is evident."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed over a week,Absolutely loved my stay here. Would stay again if I was in the area. Kristin is an amazing host. Very kind. Super responsive. The area is quiet and calm. The house is clean and comfortable

2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This is a gem of a property and a surprise find in Bloomfield. Everything is very nice. The house much more spacious than expected. Excellent condition.
2024-04-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"The property was as pictured and as described - very pretty, with calming colors and nice decor. Kristin is super responsive.
Bloomfield is a nice little town, and host provided recommendations for dining and other activities. While options in Bloomfield are limited, nearby Dexter has more options. Sikeston is within about 1/2 hour. We enjoyed the nearby town square and all the historical markers. Our reason for staying in Bloomfield was to visit the Stars & Stripes Museum, and for that, this was a perfect location.
Our only issues keeping me from giving it 5 stars are that the housekeeping person didn‚Äôt re-stock some items needed (we expected to have toilet paper and coffee for 2 people for 2 nights) and we had to work around a leaking bathroom sink - Kristin offered to call a plumber right away but didn‚Äôt want to inconvenience us by making us wait around when we had plans for the day. A stop on both ends of the barn door rail to keep it from sliding off would be helpful."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed over a week,"Great place. Clean. Well decorate. Comfortable. Kristin is a great host! Responsive, helpful and kind."
2024-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,Very nice place would definitely stay again if back in the area.

2023-05-01,3,Stayed a few nights,"We liked the home but during our stay we encountered different bugs, so if pest control was kept up we would most definitely stay again. Other than that it was a nice tiny home."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"This Airbnb is CUTE! We loved it. Visiting family in Bloomfield is so much easier now that we don‚Äôt have to find a mediocre hotel 30-45 mins away.

I work remotely and this was the perfect place to work during the week: quiet,swanky, fast & reliable internet, plenty of air conditioning, plenty of workspace, and a large fridge. I got a lot done in our 4-5 days staying there - even my laundry! Kristin was wonderful! She was quick to respond to all of our questions - even BEFORE we made a reservation (and a reservation on short notice at that).
This is a gem and it will certainly be our ‚Äúgo-to‚Äù from now on when we visit family in Bloomfield. We highly recommend the stay, it‚Äôs worth every penny. Bravo!!

Close enough to campus for graduation events, restaurants, etc, but also far enough away that we were able to enjoy quiet and peaceful evenings around the campfire.

I cannot describe how perfect this home was for my family's trip. Based on the description of the property and location, I knew it was going to be great, but after arriving I was immensely satisfied.
After 3 days of a canoe camping trip on the Mississippi, this home was a beacon of modern salvation! Only 5 minutes from the Trail of Tears State Park where we ended our trip, which was such a relief. No need to worry about a long drive to a hotel loaded down with boats and gear. There was plenty of room to unpack and clean our gear and reassemble everything for a secure trip back to VA and the hot tub was welcoming to our sore stiff bodies.
Gorgeous decor, unique and simple and felt homey and inviting. There were plenty of kitchen supplies and everything was easily accessible. We felt right at home! Also, something most people likely wouldn't notice, we all greatly appreciated the larger toilets! üòÖEspecially my older father and very tall/big brother. ü§åü§å"
2024-04-01,5,Group trip,"We had a great time during our stay here, under the stars! We even got to see a few extra minutes of stars during the Total Eclipse! We'll treasure these memories for many moons, than you for letting us stay!"

2024-02-01,5,Group trip,It is a beautiful place nice and quiet it
2024-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,Perfect spot for our little family while visiting town.
2024-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"This was our first time renting an AirBnB and we picked the best place for our first experience! We stayed as a spur of the moment getaway for my husband and I‚Äôs birthdays this month. We enjoyed being close enough to Cape Girardeau to do the shopping and dinning, but far enough out to get that peaceful atmosphere we were looking for. This place looks exactly as advertised, extremely clean/well kept, and so many little extras that I noticed other renters don‚Äôt offer. Must stay here!"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed one night,Great place! Will definitely be back.

2023-11-01,5,Stayed one night,We really enjoyed our stay at Kevin‚Äôs. It was clean and spacious. You can tell they put a lot of effort into making sure their guests have everything they need.
2023-10-01,4,Group trip,Stayed at the farmhouse for a girls trip for the weekend. Overall it‚Äôs a great place! I was under the impression we were somewhat closer to more wineries but that‚Äôs on me. Otherwise it was a great place to stay and hangout out with the fire pit and the hot tub. Only issues we had was the front door lock just took some getting used to and the wifi was not great. Had spotty service. Beyond that we all had a great time. Los boys hideaway is literally down the road from the house and had great food. State park and one winery is within 7 minutes of the house.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Modern Magnolia style farmhouse on a beautiful grassy knoll.
The dogs had a much needed run chasing squirrels around the property after hours in the car.
We were able to relax with our much needed margaritas in front of directv (yes!) after tasty tacos at Fuel in Jackson.
The photos don‚Äôt lie - the place was impressive."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We celebrated our wedding weekend at the ‚ÄúFarmhouse under the stars‚Äù. The place was so cozy and had so much to offer.

2023-10-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Thanks
2023-10-01,5,Group trip,Family loved the house and the place around it. In the description it said it was a few minutes from cape girardeau when in reality it was a 20 minute drive to heart of the city. The side streets we had to travel were horrible‚Äîno reflection on hosts but the city of cape needs to do some serious maintenance
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We had such an incredible stay at Kevin‚Äôs place! It was so beautiful and cozy for our group. We especially enjoyed the outdoor space, including the grill and hot tub!"

2023-09-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We loved our weekend getaway at Kevin‚Äôs cute country-style barn house! It was so relaxing to soak in the hot tub, enjoy the beautiful country side, and toast s‚Äômores (a gift from the host!) by the bonfire at night. Would 100% recommend! The house is so clean, well decorated, and there‚Äôs even a little loft game room that was a pleasant surprise. If you‚Äôre in the city and looking for a quick, peaceful getaway, this is the place! We felt relaxed and refreshed after a weekend spent here."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with a pet,We enjoyed our stay very much. The location out in the country was great. The house was clean and comfortable.
2023-09-01,5,Group trip,"This was our choice for a siblings weekend. There were 3 couples and this house was the perfect fit. We spent time sitting inside, on the porch and around the firepit."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Enjoyed our stay‚Äî relaxing, comfortable, private & clean. Highly recommend. Verizon cell service spotty, but that‚Äôs a small sacrifice for the setting."
2023-08-01,5,Group trip,"This house was truly under the stars.
The house looks just like the pictures.
The house was very clean !!! The beds were very comfortable & we slept very well.
We relaxed by the fire pit & enjoyed gazing @ the stars while in the hot tub. The big lawn allowed for recreational use . I would recommend this house üè° to anyone.
Regards,
Lynne from CT."

2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay!
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is our second stay here and definitely will not be our last. This is a beautiful gem of a house. Wonderful hosts in a very great spot. We love this house. The hot tub is great, its a stone‚Äôs throw to Trail Of Tears, the house is very private and wonderful for dog owners. My dog loves to run in the field.
As a cook, the kitchen is great! Its a wonderful place. You couldn‚Äôt pick better!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,Our son described the scenery as ‚Äúa Bob Ross painting‚Äù. It is a beautiful and relaxing hideaway. Host went above and beyond to ensure we were satisfied with our stay. Thankful for such a wonderful place that accommodates pets.

2023-05-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Kevin's place was amazing! We used the fire pit, hot tub, made all our meals at home, and it was perfect for us! Kevin even let us check in early, which was MUCH appreciated! We brought our electric fence for our dogs and they loved having so much land to run around! We would love to stay at Kevin's place again!"
2023-05-01,5,Group trip,Wonderful stay for our daughters graduation. We had a small gathering with family after commencement and we had plenty of room. Close enough to town but remote and quiet enough to feel like you are out in the country!!!
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Kevin's place was beautiful. it was very clean and quiet. relaxing stay, I would definitely stay again"

2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,Great place for a special occasion
2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,Awesome place!
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This is such a cool house! It‚Äôs far from everything, peaceful, the perfect getaway from city life. We cooked several of our meals in the kitchen which is roomy and well equipped. We were grateful for the solid Wi-Fi signal, we were able to check email and get that out of the way. The back yard was wonderful- hot tub, fire pit, acres of green as far as the eye can see.
Highly recommend this very nice, clean, cozy house."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Couldn't be happier with our stay! Great girls weekend getaway location. The house was spotless and every amenity was considered. We were in love with the decor! The hot tub was fantastic, love the outdoor spaces. We would love to come back!"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We loved our stay. The place is amazing, comfortable and has everything you need.
- Location / area is quiet. But that‚Äôs exactly what we wanted.
- Super close to state park for trails & fishing.
- Town is small but still some great food options.
- The hot tub & fire pit where the perfect end to the day.
- Beds were super comfortable."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This place is adorable. Tastefully decorated and very cozy. We expected a little more privacy, although we were not at all disturbed (except a neighbor's barking dog). It was especially peaceful at night. The hot tub & fire pit were fantastic - plenty of wood and roasting sticks. The creek is a dividing line between some other homes that were much closer than I'd hoped. I imagined it to be a private creek, but that was my own interpretation. Trail of Tears (which is lovely) is a literal 4 minute drive. Beyond that, everything to do is 20 plus minutes. But that did not hinder our enjoyment. The kitchen had all the basics (except a whisk). However, our family of 6 coooks big meals & with 2 skillets and 2 pots (one small & large of each) we had to get creative. Could've used 1 more large skillet. Upstairs worked nicely as a 3rd bedroom for us. we brought air mattresses, and there were plenty of extra blankets & pillows. Overall, the place well-maintained and we had a very nice stay."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This place was perfect! Beautifully decorated, cozy, and clean. perfect location to explore the Trail of Tears State Park or spend time to unwind.

2023-03-01,5,Group trip,"Kevin we appreciate your accommodations
Very cozy place to get away"
2023-02-01,4,Stayed a few nights,This house was pretty amazing. The space was the perfect size. The kitchen and butcher block island are perfect for dinner with the family and I loved the open concept. Kevin and hosts were incredibly nice and helpful. If you are in the area I highly recommend this adorable house.
2023-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,We very much enjoyed our stay. The farmhouse was well furnished and got frequent use out of the hot tub. Was a perfect place for a bit of a get away and relax for a long weekend.

2023-02-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Home away from home!!! A comfortable and special place to stay with our pup while on the road. Peaceful and restful. The house has everything possible that you need and was spotless. We will be back if traveling through this area again. Don‚Äôt miss the bar & grill across the street - super friendly and kind people.
2023-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"My two friends and I wanted a peaceful night away and just relax. Kevin‚Äôs place was SOO cute! A lot bigger than I expected. We enjoyed our time by the fire and the complimentary s‚Äômores kit that he left, yummm! We also enjoyed the hot tub late at night, the hot tub was very easy to figure out and he also leaves a QR code to help you understand how to work it. Lots of blankets to snuggle up in and all the beds where comfortable. Would definitely stay again. Thank you!!!"

We had access to everything we would need and it made for a perfect weekend! I will recommend this beautiful place to ALL my family and friends and 10/10 would DEFINITELY stay here again!! If you get the chance to stay‚Ä¶do it! You will not regret it. I have stayed at many Airbnb‚Äôs and this one tops my list."
2023-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,Everything about our stay was perfect! We instantly fell in love the minute we walked in the door! Kevin and Jill were amazing hosts and went above and beyond to make our stay just perfect!! I would highly suggest staying at Under The Stars anyday!!!
2022-12-01,4,Stayed with a pet,"The house was nice in a calm, quiet area. it is a fairly good distance from town, so be prepared with everything you need prior to arriving."
2022-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Cute farmhouse with a fire pit and hot tub! I‚Äôd stay there again.
2022-12-01,5,Stayed one night,Super cute place. would recommend to anybody!
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The Farmhouse was a great retreat! We were very impressed with cleanliness and little extras‚Ä¶mini shampoos, waters, coffee, s‚Äômores! Decorated so cute for Christmas! The space is perfect for 4-6 people. Super comfy and had everything you need for a weekend away. It‚Äôs rural and quiet, but close to town should you need anything! Should we visit the area again we would 100% return!"
2022-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,The house and outside amenities were fantastic!
2022-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We picked this place as our halfway point on our road trip from Texas to Illinois and we couldn‚Äôt have picked a better place. We felt right at home, and our doggos loved all of the space the had to run around outside. The host are very welcoming and left a s‚Äômores package as a gift which was just what we needed on a cold night. The surrounding area was so peaceful and relaxing that we didn‚Äôt want to leave and wished we would have started our trip sooner to stay a few more nights. 10/10 we recommend."
2022-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Everything we hoped it would be and more. Tucked comfortably away but minutes from college town amenities! Do NOT hesitate! Jill was positively THE ABSOLUTE BEST HOST EVER!
2022-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,We absolutely enjoined the house. Very cute and clean. We liked the location being far outside of town and being able to get food a minute from the house at the bar. The hot tub was a plus
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We enjoyed our stay. Everything was clean and very welcoming.
2022-11-01,5,Stayed one night,Absolutely perfect! Such a beautiful property. Beds are comfortable. The host definitely went the extra mile.
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place and perfect hosts!!
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,If I could describe in one word about this place it would be amazing! The house was beautiful. It was decorated very nice and very clean. The host was very nice. The hot tub was amazing. I will be booking again with them. My only regret is that we couldn‚Äôt stay longer.
2022-10-01,5,Group trip,"The house is amazing! I wish we could have stayed longer. This place was very nicely decorated, stocked with everything we needed. It was so peaceful. The game room upstairs is so cool. I will be booking again for sure."
2022-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This property is as advertised and is a great place to retreat to. We had young and older kids stay during our family vacation. It was truly a home away from home. Everyone had a great time. The upstairs loft was good for a quiet work space and playing games while little one and adults napped downstairs. We loved using the fire pit many nights and the smores package was a nice touch. Having a nice yard for our granddaugther to run around in and a creek to explore was great for her. She even made a ""fairy house"" with a fire pit in the back yard with items she found near the creek. The layout of the house was great for our group and everyone had their own space. It was close to some really great parks like Trail of Tears State Park and overlook and Riverfront Bridge Park being our favorites. We enjoyed My Daddy's Cheesecake Bakery and Cafe for my birthday breakfast and the Spanish Treat Farmacy for another breakfast. Their unique latte choices were delicious. The hosts were great, quick to respond and helped with some specific requests for local food, entertainment and park suggestions. Jill was so sweet to remove the fragrance wall plug ins and candles before we arrived and aired out the house since I have major sensitvities to fragrances. She also left me a big soup pot from her house when I asked if there was one on property so I could make homemade soups and chili. She even offered to leave chilli powder for me. Her and Kevin were wonderful through out our stay. We thorougly enjoyed our time as a family here. We would definitely come back if staying in the area again."
2022-10-01,4,Stayed with a pet,All the comforts of home with considerate and communicative hosts
2022-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Such a peaceful and well thought out farmhouse. We had a fire every night, enjoyed the hot tub, and caught up on some much needed sleep with naps on the comfy couch. House and kitchen seemed to have everything we needed.
We had our kids in tow and they spent hours outside exploring down the by creek, playing cards and board games in the loft area, and watching a movies at night. We even walked across the street to the local bar/restaurant and kids played pool, threw darts, and enjoyed some burgers. Locals were nice and friendly.
My husband had a few work calls and the internet was solid for multiple zoom calls. He set up his workspace in the loft area in the morning. Keurig coffee was nicely provided as well wood and a perfect welcome package of s‚Äômore fixings.
Jill was very helpful as a host and gave us great meal options in downtown Cape. Cape was about a 10-12 min drive away. Just far enough away that we felt away from it all. We went to the Saturday farmers market and a college football game!
We are already checking our calendars to come back and next time probably venture out to the Trail of Tears park. All in all it was just what we needed"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"Our stay at Under the Stars was absolutely perfect, completely peaceful, and gave us the opportunity to enjoy our family around the fire, take walks on country roads, cook together, and rest. The beds are as comfortable as a five star resort but in a beautiful farmhouse. We can‚Äôt wait to get back."
2022-10-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Thoroughly enjoyed our stay here. Cute, well appointed design. Everything was clean and had everything we needed. Loved the little design touches and the fragrance. All 3 of the rooms were cute. The two bathrooms were nice and the kitchen and living area was great. Would have been so nice to have spent time on the patio, kicking back by the fire and making use of the S‚Äômores fixings our hosts generously provided. It was a bit late by the time we arrived. Hopefully we will do so on the return trip on our way back through the area! Would highly recommend this quiet and relaxing space!"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"We‚Äôve stayed at over 8 Airbnb‚Äôs since we‚Äôve been in Missouri and this by far was our favorite!!! The host jill was so sweet and took so much pride in all she did for us and future guests. The beds are so comfortable and the bedding is so soft!! There are 2 many things to list so I‚Äôm going to try to serve this adorable farm home the compliments it deserves!! Love that the center of home is main living and kitchen area. The custom island is great for feeding a big family!! It‚Äôs so cozy feels like your at home!! The bbq is new the fire pit is new and she had cozy blankets for warmth for outside and jill left a s‚Äômore set up for us!! Also they left menu for a mom and pop bar/rest. Right across the field!! Had a great bison burger there and a few drinks!! Owners are great!! More now on the backyard üá∫üá∏ambience is breathtaking!! Sit and enjoy the sunset and all the splendor that surrounds this beautiful farm house! If you want and are expecting a fabulous place to stay, don‚Äôt pass this place up!! We‚Äôll be back Jill!
Thank you
Grace & peace

2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great spot within reach (for us) to junction of two interstates, as well as a major highway.
Clean, well-thought out design. Shannon responded quickly when we needed to extend our stay. Mattress is a bit more firm than we prefer, but didn't cause issues. Kitchenette is handy for a quick meal. Plenty of pristinley white towels & wash cloths.
The stairs leading to the apartment were fine for us as a ""mature"" couple to navigate with luggage. Packing more bags, with less weight, in anticipation of the climb was the way to avoid any mishaps while ascending & descending.
We will definitely book here again. Recommend!"

2023-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"Shannon‚Äôs place is truly one of hospitality. She has thought of little details: coffee, tea, hot chocolate, creamer. There are plenty of towels and the place is very clean. As a guest, you can tell she got into the Air BnB business because she enjoys hosting, not just to do the bare minimum and make a profit.

2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Lovely house in a quiet neighborhood. Lots of birds ( robins, bluebirds, cardinals, etc. ) in the yards and trees, as well as beautiful historic homes in the area, make walks interesting.
There's not a single inspirational word in a frame in this house. If you plan to live life like it's wine o'clock somewhere, maybe set an alarm. I appreciate the thought that went into the decor.
Comfortable beds, the couch is great. The hosts were on their game. No complaints, would absolutely stay here again."

2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Mikes place was a cozy place to come home to after long days of work! I appreciated having access to a kitchen, and he had it stocked with some nice basics (I did have to buy ground coffee but there was a local coffee shop very nearby that grinds their own beans!)
The front door has this weird (but understandable) feature where it automatically locks every few hours- it kind of sounds like someone is trying to open the door, but Mike explained it‚Äôs just locking itself again! Overall, very good and comfortable place and Mike was super responsive and helpful."

2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I really enjoyed my stay at Ashley‚Äôs place! There are so many fun, unique aspects to this accommodation; the large inside hot tub, the fun PacMan arcade games (very retro!), the gas fireplace, the comfortable bed & the outdoor seating area in the back yard that has mosquito netting. I spent a large majority of my stay right there in the unit, reading, watching Netflix movies, playing PacMan, hot-tubbing or sitting outside. Unfortunately, the only full day I was there was a Sunday, when the local town attractions weren‚Äôt open. But, this accommodation will keep you happy in & of itself!"

2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We have stayed at Ashley‚Äôs three times now. We love it. The hot tub alone makes the cost of the room unbelievably low compared to any other room offering the same amenities. The room is very pretty / romantic, private. I have yet to meet Ashley but I know she is there if I need her and she is always quick to respond to any questions. I highly recommend staying at Ashley‚Äôs if you are in the area, it‚Äôs perfect."

2023-12-01,3,Stayed one night,"The host was great, it was a clean and nice room and setup! I only struggled with a couple of things- the bed was large but very uncomfortable and squeaky. I am a light sleeper so it was difficult to sleep in and we woke up sore. Another difficulty was the heat, the room is only heated with a fireplace with a simple on and off, there‚Äôs no adjusting the temperature. So, several times throughout the night we had to get up to turn it off and on since we couldn‚Äôt get the room to be at a consistent temp. We went in the winter, so this may not be a struggle in the summertime. Sleeping was just difficult."

The room temperature was easily controllable. We are light sleepers so the train did wake us quite a bit, BUT our host's description pepared for that and there was a noise machine clock provided to help with that as well very proactive with that aspect of the home. Other than the train, it was quiet and peaceful in the neighborhood. We would definitely recommend this space and stay agan for a simple not so far away get away."

2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Had a great time at Ashley‚Äôs place. It was perfect for our little stay in Dexter.
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great value for the space. Host is very responsive. Check-in process was very easy, detailed and accurate. We hit a small snag when we got there and she promptly responded to my text and made the issue right. It is wonderful to know if you have any issues the host is easy to reach and is quick to resolve them because that is not always the case. Certainly will check out this place again if I need a quick get away."
2022-11-01,5,Stayed one night,This place was SO beautiful and very relaxing! Great honeymoon place! :)
2022-11-01,5,Stayed over a week,Very cozy and a great stay for the price
2022-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"Beautiful place for a night get away, loved the hot tub in room. Kids and I had a blast. Definitely coming back for a mommy get awayü•∞"
2022-09-01,5,Stayed one night,We had an amazing stay! Ashley went above and beyond for us! The communication we had was amazing!! Wonderful extras that are included!! We can‚Äôt wait to come back!!
2022-09-01,5,Stayed one night,A wonderful PEACEFUL little oasis for ANYONE needing a place to stay in Dexter! We wish we had been doing more than just passing through‚Ä¶it was such a pleasurable stay!

2022-08-01,5,Stayed one night,Ashley's home was lovely. She was very helpful with all of our questions and provided everything we needed for the stay. Can definitely recommend.
2022-08-01,4,Stayed a few nights,This is such a nice place you do get to hear the train whistle but we liked it. Easy to get to things too.
2022-08-01,5,Stayed one night,Great eye for detail. Cute place and great location.
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great place,great time...thank you"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Was a nice stay and would definitely recommend. over the top from the sitting area out back the hot tub and full amenities. thanks Ashley again.
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place was so cute. Check in was simple, the town was really beautiful. They had everything we needed and more. Definitely worth staying."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed one night,There is nothing like organizing your things then slipping into a hot tub with a glass of wine. Day is done. Read until sleep overtakes you. Nice.
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"we really enjoyed our refuge. the house is very quiet, and so is the street in the neighborhood. it's close to grocery store and walmart, lots of places to eat out, but really a nice place if you just want to hibernate."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,It was great
2022-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"Ashley‚Äôs place was amazing! Spacious, clean, nice shower, good amount of kitchen supplies, and of course the hot tub was amazing to have right in the room. A lot of other reviewers have mentioned train noise but honestly we both slept like a rock. So unless you‚Äôre a very light sleeper, this place is absolutely perfect! Cant recommend enough and we‚Äôll definitely try to stay here again if we‚Äôre ever back in the area"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed one night,The AirBnB was exactly as advertised and did not disappoint. I haven‚Äôt seen another place that has a hot tub in the room itself and it was very fun to use. Ashley was fast with her responses and a great host.
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,No issues. Room was ready on time. Communication was good.
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Ashley's listing is AMAZING. It's very spacious and the hot tub was incredible after a long day at work. Everything was just as listed. It was great having my own entrance so I didn't disturb no one else by my coming and going. I highly recommend her.
2022-06-01,5,Stayed one night,The place was even better than the pictures. The hot tub was great!
2022-06-01,4,Stayed one night,Great value - thanks
2022-06-01,4,Stayed one night,Very nice room and clean .
2022-05-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"I enjoyed my stay. Other than the train noise, the space was quiet and comfortable."
2022-05-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Ashley keeps everything very nice and clean! Everything we needed for our weekend getaway was right there. The jacuzzi was our favorite part. So unique!
2022-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"super cool huge room! it has a mini pack man arcade machine on the wall it's so cool, hot tub is huge and very nice. the ace was clean and smelt great, at a very fair price. no complaints here!"
2022-05-01,2,Stayed one night,"Train is too much, I feel the ad does not describe the intensity or frequency of the train horns."
2022-05-01,4,Stayed one night,It's a nice spot for a cheap passing through stay. We did use the jacuzzi but didn't stay in it for as long as I had pictured. I'd probably pick a different spot but for $100 I have no complaints. Dexter Queen was great for ice-cream (shockingly probably the best I've ever had) and the local Mexican spot was what you'd expect.
2022-05-01,4,Stayed a few nights,I would stay there again
2022-04-01,4,Stayed one night,We had a nice stay.
2022-04-01,5,Stayed one night,Only really rented for the hot tub of course but it was a great place to stay
2022-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"this place has it all, bed is comfortable hot tub is amazing, great hosts"
2022-03-01,5,Stayed one night,great place
2022-03-01,5,Stayed one night,My stay was AMAZING! We only had one little issue but they communicated instantly and took care of it! This location was everything it said it would be and more! I can not wait for my next stay here! If i could give more than 5 stars i would in a heartbeat!
2022-02-01,5,Stayed one night,This was our second time visiting Ashley‚Äôs space and we loved it! We will definitely be back again!!
2022-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,A unique room offered by lovely hosts who are as available as you need them to be.
2022-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"The place was clean and well kept. The hot tub was a welcome relief after a day's driving. Ashley was attentive to all the charming little details in the room, and we felt safe and private - comfy and cozy there. Parking was secure and overall, the place had a home feel to it. Would stay again if we are in the area."
2022-02-01,5,Stayed one night,Great hosts. Very private. Hot tub was great. Definitely recommend staying!
2022-02-01,4,Stayed one night,This place is awesome! The hot tub is a very nice touch. Either for a romantic getaway or just a night out this is the one!
2022-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place was a really nice stay. My boyfriend and I stayed for my birthday weekend. The hot tube was excellent and the arcade machine was a really nice touch. Even though everything was covered in ice since the weather had to suck, the backyard was still very nice and private. We definitely plan to come back sometime in the future! Thanks for the vacation!! ‚ò∫Ô∏è"
2022-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"100% perfection! Everything about this space is perfect. The room is so cozy, the electric fireplace is beautiful, the jacuzzi was an amazing way to end our day! 10/10 would stay here again. The hosts were also super easy to work with and very accommodating!"
2022-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Cozy, relaxing quiet and clean!! I have loved my stays here. Definitely will stay again if I‚Äôm in Dexter."
2022-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was a great stay. My check in was early at 7am. They had the door unlocked, fire place was on so the room was toasty and the hot tub was hot and ready. I‚Äôm a travel nurse so that was amazing after a long night!! Comfy bed! In a nice quiet location great for sleeping. Definitely staying again and again!"
2022-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"This is a must-book stay! Between the indoor hot tub, fireplace, swivel mounted tv, arcade machine, king size bed, covered outdoor spaces, and well-stocked breakfast bar area, we were entertained and comfortable every minute (: The hosts have also clearly put a lot of attention into the details, from the creative decor and furniture to helpful amenities like snacks, quality shower supplies, plenty of extra dishes and linens, board games, books, work spaces, grill supplies, little lending library, etc. The yard space is awesome too!"
2021-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"Really fun and unique place! My husband and I stayed here on Xmas Eve while traveling thru the area. We loved watching Xmas movies while lounging in the hot tub! I would recommend this place! Some items I liked: easy checkin/out using a lockbox located on the backyard fence, full-sized fridge, countertop appliances available, plenty of parking, quiet location (I noticed a train or two, but it did not disturb me and had others not mentioned it I would probably not have even paid any attention). The unit is located in an older home so it has wear and shows its age in some areas, but overall we were happy with it! We recommend Pixleys Pub for their homemade chips and fried fish. We didn't try any other restaurant because everywhere else was closed for Xmas."
2021-12-01,4,Stayed one night,Worth your time and money! I highly recommend!
2021-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Unique stay! Very clean, relaxing with indoor hot tub that was easy to operate. Very communicative host"
2021-12-01,5,Stayed one night,Clean and quiet- had a good stay! The PAC-MAN machine is a good addition!
2021-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great stay. Recommend
2021-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We felt safe and comfortable during our stay. Loved relaxing in the jacuzzi on cold night. Surprised to see a mini arcade in the room. Enjoyed a few rounds of retro gaming! Walk to old town shops in Dexter, so cute. Easy, quick access to highway. We were dreading the local hotels and decided to try airbnb to be close to family for holidays. Thank you Ashely and Travis for offering your enormous, clean, smoke-free, comfortable room (with its own entry!) to travelers."
2021-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"Well thought out space‚Ä¶and a lot of it. Hard to beat the value when you have a recessed hot tub, electric fireplace, separate shower, king bed and even a wall classic video game + a fridge, microwave, coffeemaker++. Was an unexpectedly cool and unique, 1-night pit stop on our road trip. Book it!"
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Everything was great, we were 6 minutes from where we needed to be. The hot tub was definitely what appealed to us, and location."
2021-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"Very beautiful room, clean and organized. Hosts were quiet and very accommodating! We used this room as our wedding night room and the hot tub was so wonderful after a weekend of running around! I would definitely recommend them for others looking for a place to stay in Dexter!!"
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place! The hot tub was wonderful!
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This room is an absolute gem! Private, quiet, and who could go wrong with a hot tub! I will 110% book again!"
2021-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"Good location near the highway, easy to find. Everything we needed was there."
2021-08-01,5,Stayed one night,Perfect. Thank you.
2021-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"A great room for a quite evening. The hot tub is a great extra, and the netted back yard tent allowed for a quiet ""bug-free"" evening. An all-around nice experience."
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Ashley was quick to respond .The place was totally private and i know we werent the quietest because our adult kids came to our room to party. Very nice stay will stay again when i come back the area again.
2021-07-01,4,Stayed one night,This was my second visit very relaxing in town but its like your away from everything i loved it‚ùó‚ùó
2021-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"This place is very nice. The yard is large & fenced in. There is a screened table & chairs if bugs are active. The hot tub is huge! The only noticeable noise is a train that runs regularly about a block away. It did not disturb me, but it may disturb others."
2021-07-01,5,Stayed one night,i will definitely be back this place was very clean and peaceful
2021-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great experience! Exactly as listed, and awesome add-ons with a toaster oven, hot tub, and full size fridge! We only stayed for a night, but definitely wouldn‚Äôt have minded being here longer. Highly recommend!"
2021-06-01,5,Stayed one night,The room was beautiful and easy to find. Nice amenities and the hot tub was such a wonderful perk.
2021-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"We had a nice, relaxing stay! We loved having the hot tub to relax in, and the private back yard to enjoy as well! Very clean, and all was represented accurately. üòä"
2021-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"Very clean, cute and quite."
2021-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great place, and fun with the hot tub!"
2021-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"Perfect space, exactly as described. Better than any other area rental and cheaper than the hotels 30 minutes away that have a hot tub. Highly recommended stay. We will be staying here every time we come back to Dexter."
2021-05-01,5,Stayed one night,Best place I went to being the first time on airbnb. Will definitely book again here. üíõ
2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Nice relaxing atmosphere great amenities and nice alternative to area motels. Much better much cleaner and affordable.
2021-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"This is a great stop if you want to experience Dexter, MO. The amenities are some of the best we‚Äôve experienced, and the host and hostess took very good care of us!"
2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Celebrating our anniversary my wife and I enjoyed being able to rotate between the hot tub, the shady backyard, and the king size bed. Everything was super clean, Guest Netflix was a nice touch, board games and BBQ grill added to the fun and we would recommend to anyone passing through or just needing a day away for relaxation."
2021-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"Thanks for the relaxing, unique stay! It was just as described and exactly what I was looking for.....small town vibes and comfortable accommodations. I am sure that I will visit again!"
2021-04-01,4,Stayed one night,Loved the hot tub
2021-04-01,4,Stayed a few nights,üòÅ
2021-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Loved it here! If you don‚Äôt care for trains, you might have a problem. But I‚Äôm used to trains so didn‚Äôt bother me at all. There is a little sound crossover but not a big deal. The hot tub was amazing. Also the bed is kind of loud but also not a big deal"
2021-03-01,5,Stayed one night,A great place. Awesome hot tub!
2021-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"This place was exactly as displayed and described. The built in hot tub was pretty awesome. However, if you have a high sensitivity to Chlorine, you may reconsider. You do need to understand that there is a hot tub inside the room (no separation whatsoever) so it's difficult to reduce that ""aroma"". It only takes a few minutes to become accustom to it. The gas fire place is very welcome on the cooler nights, but it does a very good job of heating the area; must to my surprise that we had to turn it off in the middle of the night. Also, if you are not comfortable backing up in tight spaces, you may consider parking on the street and walking to the rear of the house rather than just driving to the garage."
2021-03-01,4,Stayed one night,It was very relaxing and the hot tob was amazing! Wish it would have been a more private experience we heard people and a cat on the other side of the door overall though would recomend to stay!
2021-03-01,5,Stayed one night,great little quiet spot for relaxing. close to anything you might need.
2021-02-01,5,Stayed one night,This space was amazing! I would highly recommend it!
2021-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Love getting away for a couple days and relaxing in the hot tub. Great big bed. swivel mounted tv so you can watch from the hot tub or bed. It was peaceful . Smelled good too. Everything you need all in one space. Ashley was very responsive with all my messages and the place was great!!! We will be back soon!
2021-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Very clean place, really enjoyed the hot tub. Great stay for a girls weekend."
2021-01-01,5,Stayed one night,Great stay!
2021-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place! Would definitely recommend!!
2020-12-01,5,Stayed one night,Nice
2020-12-01,5,Stayed one night,The space was great! Just what we needed for a one night getaway. The hot tub was so relaxing and the fireplace added just the right touch. Would definitely stay here again!
2020-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very clean and private place to get away and relax in a hot tub.
2020-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Cozy, convenient, and thoughtfully executed. A wonderful experience!"
2020-11-01,5,Stayed one night,Very clean and spacious. All the appliances needed with coffee provided. Quiet with off-street parking. Very nice.
2020-11-01,5,Stayed one night,I can't remember the last time I sleep so well on vacation. Nothing is more relaxing than taking a hot tub right before bed.
2020-10-01,4,Stayed one night,"Hot tub is nice. If you are looking for a private space, this might not be for you. Two inch gap under door that directly leads into host house.
Cat pulled in our bags when we were leaving.
Stylish space. Hot tub was comfortable.
Sitting space is in the hot tub or on the bed. Easy to find. Train nose is not a big deal at all."
2020-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I've been here many times and it's always better than could have imagined.
2020-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Just stayed here for the second time with my girlfriend, and it was just as great as the first time!"
2020-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay. Everything about the place was exactly as described.
2020-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is the second time I've stayed with Ashley as before it was absolutely amazing! I had a special request and she was able to accommodate me. The place was very clean, the hot tub was relaxing, smart tv for those lazy ""i don't want to move"" moments. Fullsize fridge and amenities to cook small meals/ snacks so I didn't have to eat out every night.
I would and have stayed more than once with Ashley, and as long as she'll have me. I will continue to choose her place when I visit.
Thank You for such a pleasant and quiet holiday.
I shall probably see you next year üòâ"
2020-09-01,5,Stayed one night,Very comfortable and convenient stay!
2020-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We loved our stay at Ashley‚Äôs place. The room is amazing, and you can watch tv from the hot tub! Wow!"
2020-08-01,5,Stayed one night,Our short stay from 8pm to 8am was not enough to enjoy the hallmark of the accommodation- a private jacuzzi in the middle of the room. A well appointed room with a spacious backyard. We enjoyed our short sweet stay.
2020-08-01,5,Stayed one night,Ashley's place is cozy and the hot tub within the room was amazing. Extra towels and a file out were in the closet for use. The water pressure is very excellent and we had no issues whatsoever during our stay. Would highly recommend!
2020-08-01,5,Stayed one night,Very lovely space! This was on second visit here. Definitely perfect for a weekend getaway!
2020-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Talk about Netflix, hot tub & chill, this is definitely a great spot for that! Very cool and comfortable and much cleaner than any hotel room!"
2020-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"This listing was very nice. Spacious room, clean, great amenities like tv and fridge, a bar to eat at, comfy king bed, and the hot tub was NICE!! Ashley was a great host and was quick to respond, and helped us find a great diner for breakfast. it was a great getaway for me and my girlfriend. Thanks, Ashley"
2020-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"My husband and I had a lovely night at Ashley‚Äôs place! The set up is perfect for a relaxing evening.
Be warned that if you visit in spring / early summer, your car will be pelted with blackberries and bird poop - so be sure to get a car wash soon after."
2020-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"Was a tad tricky to find, but once we did it was actually super simple if you followed the Hosts instructions! Check out Dhafers Mediterranean a few blocks away you will NOT be disappointed!"
2020-04-01,5,Stayed one night,Ashelys place was perfect for what we needed
2020-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"We stayed here for one night and after a long drive, the hot tub really came in handy!"
2020-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"The outside does not do the inside justice. The room is everything you look for in a hotel room, except it‚Äôs even better. You get a comfortable king size bed where you can position the tv to your liking. You get a large hot tub all to your self, again, where you can position the tv to your liking. There‚Äôs a full size refrigerator so you can store your leftovers from dinner (I recommend the Hickory Log). The glass gas fireplace gives off plenty of heat and makes the hot tub feel very romantic. There are no neighbors (except for Amanda and you cannot hear them). The sound of the train is actually soothing. Some reviews complain about it keeping them up but Amanda has ear plugs in the bathroom and the sound did not wake us up once. We will definitely come back the next time we need to get out of St. Louis for the night."
2020-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Everything was just as we expected. Ashley‚Äôs place was clean and comfortable. The hot tub and fireplace made it very cozy. The private access was excellent and we had complete privacy. We would stay again if we were ever in the area again.
2020-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Booked a three night stay over Valentine‚Äôs weekend with my boyfriend and we already can‚Äôt wait to go back next year. The value is unbeatable for this cozy place, and it exceeded my expectations. The hosts were very helpful and attentive, we enjoyed exploring Dexter! 10/10 would book again."
2020-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"I stopped by while working in the area and it was just as described. Check in was smooth, the room was cozy and clean. There were lots of thoughtful touches and the bed was comfy. I didn't get to try the hot tub because I got there too late and I was too exhausted, but it looked amazing. I would definitely stay here again."
2020-02-01,5,Stayed one night,This is my favorite place to stay at!
2020-01-01,5,Stayed over a week,Ashley's place was very clean and comfortable. Ashley was quick to respond to my inquiries and check in was simple.
2020-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"This Airbnb was totally worth the drive! It was clean, comfortable and the jacuzzi was huge and relaxing. A full fridge was an asset too!"
2020-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Very clean, and very nice for a weekend getaway with your partner."
2020-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"The price point on this room is unmatched, the space is very clean, and what an amazing hot tub! My husband and I stayed one night for an appointment in Sikeston the next day. The stay felt very private and safe. Ashley had the fireplace on when we arrived, so the room was warm and cozy. (The mattress is firm, just in case anyone is wondering.) We had everything we needed. I would definitely stay again!"
2020-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"Interesting little town with some interesting people, we had a good time."
2019-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very accurate description of the room on AirB&B site.
2019-12-01,5,Stayed one night,10/10 would stay here again :D
2019-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"Ashley‚Äôs place is awesome! We were a little unsure what to expect going thru town, but everything was perfect, very stylish. The hot tub is amazing and Ashley was very accommodating."
2019-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,It was a perfect location to get away for a couple days.
2019-11-01,5,Stayed over a week,"Great hosts! Super quick to reply and if they were there when I needed something, they took care of it right away. And if they weren‚Äôt, they still got to it as soon as they got home"
2019-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The perfect place for a weekend getaway. Private yet attentive host, a beautifully decorated space and the hot tub is fantastic!"
2019-10-01,4,Stayed one night,"Everything was described pretty accurately, clean and furnished well. We had fun playing provided games! The bed was comfortable but very squeaky which was annoying but overall, the place fit our needs"
2019-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This place is truly a gem! Such a cute clean set up with great hosts and everything you can possibly think of! Hot tub, fridge, microwave, breakfast corner, board games, private backyard with grill and patio set. The list is endless. Would definitely reccomend if your going to the area!!!"
2019-09-01,3,Stayed about a week,"I liked the accommodations. Hosts are friendly; if there is an issue, be prepared to wait for it to be resolved."
2019-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Ashley and Travis are super friendly and outgoing. They have created a perfect space whether you just need a quick getaway or a comfortable place to relax. Very nice place and great value. We extended our stay here.
2019-09-01,5,Stayed one night,Very large space. Would stay again and recommend.
2019-09-01,5,Stayed one night,Great place to relax and enjoy time alone.
2019-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is an amazing place to stay. You can find places to hike about 30 minutes away, also hydro adventure is a water park about 30 minutes away as well which was a delight. The hot tub in the room is definitely the best, which was why we stayed. I loved it so much, but the ad said it was a house which is actually a room built on the back part of the house. It is definitely not a deal breaker, but it is something to consider. Either way, Ashley was very helpful and the entire experience was more then I expected! Dexter is small, but that doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs boring!"
2019-08-01,4,Stayed one night,If you are like oki g for a place to sleep and be safe this is your spot.
2019-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,you can expect you can expect to find plenty of room and privacy a great entrance with a place to eat right out the back door TV was great with movies the jacuzzi was fabulous I could have stayed in there all day stores are very close Downtown was in walking distance there was coffee to be had a full size refrigerator and freezer books and games to be used and a very comfortable bed. There's a train that comes through and Blows Its whistle but it didn't bother me a bit in fact it reminded me of some old train songs and never woke me up through the night Ashley was very accommodating and helpful I will definitely go back
2019-08-01,5,Stayed one night,Great place to stay! Hot tub was amazing and even had extra amenities that we weren‚Äôt expecting. Would definitely recommend if coming to the area.
2019-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"The place was like the exactly as it was described. It was spacious and clean. The jacuzzi was very easy to use and there were several options for us to adjust. There was a little ‚Äúkitchen‚Äù with all the supplies for cooking, and I thought it was neat and thoughtful. Check-in progress was simple and quick.

2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"The guesthouse was immaculate and beautifully decorated. The bed was the most comfortable I've had in airbnb so far and was a very welcome relief after 9 hours driving. I had a nice soak in the clawfoot tub and slept like a baby. If you have mobility issues, it's important to note that the bathroom sink is installed so close to the toilet that it made using the toilet very difficult. I'm unsure why they went this route rather than a sink on the toilet which would been more ergonomic and user friendly in such a small space. That said, I will absolutely stay again if I'm in the area."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had such a great time at The Guesthouse. It is darling, location is great, and Laurie is an excellent host. Hope to visit again."

Quaint, artsy, a place that I'd love to do for myself at home, just too afraid to make my own. Laurie was so sweet. I didn't need too much, but she was responsive and I just knew that if I needed anything, she'd be available. I'll definitely be back."

2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Booked this as a girls weekend with my mom. So adorable and the perfect size for two! I loved being in a location that made it easy to walk to nearby shops and restaurants. Only trade off is that the busy street made it quite loud at night. Other than that it was a wonderful stay!

Ebb & Flow for live music & a drink too :) Ground About for breakfast! Try the Waffle Flight!!!!! You read that correctly! Then lunch/dinner at Pasta & Sauce as well as Minglewood Brewery for great food & beer....and of course a walk around the town AND the riverfront!

2023-12-01,4,Stayed one night,"Great location in downtown Cape! Very walkable to all the restaurants/bars. It‚Äôs a little loud at night/early morning, as the house is right on a semi-busy corner (nothing a sound machine couldn‚Äôt help!). Also, the coffee machine didn‚Äôt work, but hopefully the owner can look into this soon. It‚Äôs a tight space, so just know that going into it, but worked just fine for the two of us! Nice decor, and very cozy. Very good value!"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed one night,We really enjoyed staying here! It was super cozy and designed with a playful spirit. We walked down to Speck pizza for dinner - only half a block away!
2023-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"We truly enjoyed this place. It's compact as advertised, but had everything we needed, including super-convenient covered parking. The high ceilings make it seem larger than it is, and the art and furnishings add to the fun."

2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"Way to maximize this charming, eclectic, historical building! Vibrant, cozy, air-conditioned, with everything you need just a reach away. Full of color, and all sorts of attractive odds and ends, Laurie designed this to be aesthetically pleasing, useful, and comfortable. The small, tucked-in porch on the outside houses a table and four chairs, plants, chimenea, and views, and is the perfect site for a cool drink or evening meal... breakfast too! I thoroughly enjoyed everything, and slept so well I was amazed! The bed was very comfortable, not too hard, not too soft! You'll get a kick out of the old-fashioned bathtub with shower, using the older-designed coffee cups, and just be taken back to yesteryear on a number of items. I drive a bigger truck with a 6' bed and was able to back up beneath the provided carport parking easily. Laurie sends excellent directions for finding, and parking. I enjoyed this space so much that I didn't even venture into town! ENJOY!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The Guesthouse was a neat little bungalow sitting off the Main Street, but still felt private. I absolutely loved the outside sitting area. You can watch the street, but still feel very private. The inside is an eclectic style that works really well. I loved that there were a few books & to top it off, a good collection of vinyl records, with a record player.
I spent a lot of down time listening & reading.
The covered parking around back was great. The hose available to rinse the vehicle off was a nice surprise. While the place is small, it's very comfortable and in a great location. The event I attended was downtown & I was concerned about the parking situation, but I left my vehicle at the Guesthouse and walked. It's an easy walk to everything downtown and the waterfront. I would come back to this location."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"Amazing! The space is curated incredibly! What a fun experience to stay in a soace, so funky and fun!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,Beautiful little place! I loved how unique it was and the decor was so pretty. The tub and record player were real highlights though. The records they had were great artists and it was a perfect place to relax after a long day of driving. Great stay!

It is one of the few places I‚Äôve stayed in that I went around the entire place, taking pictures and sending to my friends.

Plenty of things in walking distance. Laurie was very thorough in her communication. Check-in was a breeze, I would've stayed longer if time allowed!"
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This space is such a gem like they say! I was comfortable and cozy. It‚Äôs enough for the single traveler wishing to be in a quiet space surrounded by trees and who likes to stroll through the scenic residential neighborhood. The decor is rustic and charming. I love the exposed brick. Since I‚Äôm not a cook, the mini frig and microwave were sufficient. I appreciated the water and snacks! Oh and yes I soaked in that tub- divine! Laurie responded to all messages timely which is awesome and professional. I hope this is available when I return to the area!"
2022-08-01,5,Stayed one night,This was an amazing and historic guesthouse with a lot of personality and everything I needed for my stay.

However my 2nd reservation with Laurie was very very nice and comfortable. I left a review for that stay. I would stay here again! Don't hesitate. Stay here! it's quiet, the bed is comfortable, the kitchen is perfect if you're like me and don't cook! lol there is a microwave and a dorm room size refrigerator."

2022-06-01,4,Stayed one night,"It's indeed very eclectic. The couch is very lovely, the bathtub is amazing, but don't expect too much of a kitchen. Be sure to bring your own food that's already cooked or utensils. It's a decent, minimalist place to stay with a little bit of style."
2022-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"The place was super cute and clean. I loved all the extra little amenities that were there. After a long drive in to town, it was great to come into a homey and inviting place, and sleep in a comfortable bed. The window units made it perfectly cold for sleeping. There were snacks and water, which my college aged daughter loved. And I loved the coffee, creamers, and the basket of toiletries in case I forgot anything. I would definitely stay again."
2022-05-01,5,Stayed one night,This place is adorable! I‚Äôm in love with the style! It was exactly what we were expecting and we would love to come back! We forgot a hair dryer and the owner notified immediately and even offered to ship it. Thanks for a wonderful time!
2022-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"Lovely place. Fantastic location. Makes for a very walkable (and enjoyable) CG experience. Price feels 10-15% high (especially once all the fees get added), but it's still a neat little place. And the host does a great job there."

2022-05-01,5,Stayed one night,wonderful hostess and adorable b&b!

2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The Guesthouse is a quaint little stay in the downtown section of Cape Girardeau. With walking access to many different places, it was a perfect place to stay. We loved our time here and can‚Äôt wait to visit again!"

Location is excellent, walk to all the stuff the old town area has to offer. Great job!"
2022-04-01,5,Stayed one night,This awesome brick home just off Broadway near the riverfront is a unique and fun experience. It was perfect for us!

2022-03-01,5,Stayed one night,This was a very beautiful little house. It was a perfect place to stop for a night on our way back from gulf shores. Real close to a lot of things to do in a beautiful downtown area full of history.
2022-03-01,5,Stayed one night,Such a cozy and unique place. Will definitely go back next time I‚Äôm in the area! Would recommend to anyone visiting Cape Girardeau.
2022-03-01,5,Stayed one night,We were on our way home to Minneapolis after road tripping to New Orleans. This was the perfect spot to pull off the road and get some sleep. The bed was very comfortable. There is a door between the bedroom and kitchen/shower so privacy is not an issue at all. Parking is 10 - 15 feet from the entrance which was so convenient! We would definitely stay here again.
2022-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"A charming, historic getaway as a stopover on our travels. Would definitely book again if passing through the area."
2022-03-01,5,Stayed one night,Nice quaint place to stay. Clean and quiet. You will enjoy.
2022-03-01,4,Stayed a few nights,It‚Äôs a great little place for a solo traveler. The Covid era has changed my priorities for travel but I felt comfortable here (that‚Äôs saying a lot!). Convenient location as a home base for exploring the area. The keyless lock simplifies entering/leaving.
2022-02-01,4,Stayed one night,"Great communication, very clean and cozy, easy check-in and check out, and just a few short blocks to the main downtown strip with lots of restaurant options. Surprised there was a delicious bubble tea spot so close! The internet appears to be coming through a wifi extender and I experienced some drop outs and slow downs so I can't say the internet is the most reliable."
2022-02-01,5,Stayed one night,The location was great and close to a lot of restaurant/bars. The guesthouse was unique and had everything we needed for an overnight stay. It was clean and the bed was very comfortable.
2022-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"Perfect place to stay in Cape Girardeau. Walking distance to everything. A little cold in the winter but they provide plenty of space heaters to make it comfortable. Annie Laurie‚Äôs is right across the street, it‚Äôs very worth a visit. If you have the time, definitely check out River Ridge Winery about 15 minutes down the highway. Best wine we‚Äôve ever tried!"
2022-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We love staying here! It is cozy and perfect for a weekend getaway. And a great location!
2022-01-01,5,Stayed one night,Such a great value! Fantastic location to everything downtown! Quaint and quiet. Will definitely recommend and stay in the future.
2022-01-01,4,Stayed one night,Cozy little spot with lots of shops and restaurants in easy walking distance
2022-01-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"A lovely and cozy 2-room apartment housed in a historic building right in the center of Cape G. It‚Äôs a great location, with a covered off-street parking spot. Laurie and Will were such hospitable hosts and accommodated my last-minute reservation changes when my flight was canceled. As described, note that there isn‚Äôt a ‚Äúkitchen‚Äù per se, but there is a small refrigerator and microwave, and a keurig. You‚Äôre not going to be cooking any meals here but there‚Äôs enough to make a simple breakfast. And the hosts keep it stocked with coffee and good snacks! I stayed here alone which was fine and would stay again."
2022-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"This is a great little place to stay for a couple that wants to be in close proximity to the shops, bars and restaurants. We'd totally do this again if we're in the area."
2022-01-01,5,Stayed one night,Close to the river walk area of downtown Cape Girardeau and the Casino. Absolutely adorable place to stay for the weekend. By the design of the building its definitely from the 1800's French era that is commonly seen along the Mississippi River.
2022-01-01,5,Stayed one night,Absolutely perfect place to stay if in town. Very clean and has everything you'd ever need. We will be back :)
2022-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great stay and great host! Will come back again :)
2021-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Great place to stay! Location was perfect, as food and coffee is super close. Laurie had snacks and drinks in the fridge when we arrived. Check in was super easy :) the bed was comfortable, I suggest bringing your own pillows, as theirs were a little flat. Def would stay here again if we‚Äôre passing through!!!"
2021-12-01,5,Stayed about a week,"I had a wonderful stay! This place is exactly as advertised. If you find yourself with the opportunity to stay here, do it. It is comfortable AND cool. The clawfoot tub in the kitchen area is magical (and no worries, the toilet has its own room). If you love to wonder about the history of places, but still want the comforts of the modern era, this place is for you!"
2021-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"So much historic charm, very comfortable bed, and a tankless water heater for all the baths you could ever want to take in that very clean claw foot tub. You can walk to the river, drinks, dinner, antiques, and more. I love this place! As a former Cape Girardeau resident, I can say with certainty that this is THE place to stay if you want a special experience during your visit."
2021-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Really nice and convenient place! Strongly commended.
2021-12-01,5,Stayed one night,Very comfortable and cute cottage. Close to everything in cape.
2021-12-01,5,Stayed one night,A perfect place for a solo getaway!

2021-11-01,5,Stayed one night,Beautiful little place! We enjoyed our one night stay!
2021-11-01,3,Stayed one night,I do not believe the electrical wiring in this Airbnb is safe
2021-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"We needed to get away and booked The Guest House last minute. What a lovely surprise.
It‚Äôs a small, beautifully older house with similar amenities to a 2-room hotel room; but that‚Äôs where the comparisons end. When you walk in, it‚Äôs immediately evident the place is curated by someone who cares about hospitality and loves Cape Girardeau, which itself was pleasant surprise. It‚Äôs full of thoughtful choices and charm, and the eclectic style makes it feel homey.
The bed is very comfy. That was a big deal for us. (One time we rented a quaint Air B&B cottage in the French countryside by the sea that was all you might imagine-but the bed was uncomfortable, and we had to rearrange our itinerary).
Laurie was responsive and made sure we had everything we needed. The house is located near Cape‚Äôs historic district, which really made us feel like special guests in town. There were some noises and lights at night, but it wasn‚Äôt so distracting that my husband had problems sleeping, and he‚Äôs a country boy who‚Äôs easily annoyed by those things.
We will likely come back sometime for another weekend getaway. Highly recommend!"
2021-11-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Fabulous host. Extremely small but adorable space in a great location.
2021-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,"A gorgeous spot in the heart of the developing downtown. Comfortable, cute and just as described. A lovely stay."

2021-11-01,5,Stayed one night,An amazing stay at a cozy cottage in a fun part of Cape. Our stay was amazingly comfortable and we wouldn't hesitate to book again!
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Our stay at the Treeloft was amazing. The peace and quiet is what we needed. We saw quite a few birds and butterflies. We even saw a deer. We did a lot of cooking on the grill. Love it! The place was exactly what was described and felt like home when we stepped in the door. Our hosts were awesome with their communication and they way the Treeloft was decorated. We highly recommend this wonderful place.
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is the best place I have ever stayed at! It looked exactly like the pictures, it smelled fabulous, everything was in perfect condition and Kaci and Waylon did a fabulous job keeping in touch with us as we had storms in the area. It was the most peaceful and relaxing stay and I couldn‚Äôt be happier with choosing the treehouse at base camp! Definitely recommend for all those that need a break from the everyday hustle!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Staying at the TreeLoft is always such a peaceful and restorative experience! Kaci and Waylon have put so much thought and effort into creating a lovely retreat, and go above and beyond as helpful and responsive hosts. We can't wait to stay again!"

2024-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,There are no words to describe how peaceful and beautiful this Tree House is! My wife and I had an such a relaxing getaway thanks to Kaci & Waylon being such great hosts. 10 out of 10 would absolutely recommend! Can‚Äôt wait to come back again.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The privacy, beauty, solitude, and absolute serenity of Tree Loft create the perfect retreat in which to unplug and get back in touch with nature and one's inner voice. There are ample opportunities to relax and recharge both inside and outside this aesthetically beautiful rental. The decks provide birdwatching, solitude, and hot tub rejuvenation, all within reach of the cedar trees that encircle the cabin. The firepit area, complete with overhead string lights, creates a warm, woodsy setting. Even on a rainy day, sitting quietly amidst the tree tops just outside the huge wall of windows, accompanied by comfy chairs and a warm fireplace, creates a cozy cocoon from reality, and guests are left with an overall feeling of relaxation and calm mindfulness. Our hosts communicated efficiently without being intrusive, provided more than adequate amenities, and the place was spotless and beautiful. We highly recommend this retreat experience as a special gift to oneself."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Our stay at the TreeLoft was such a much needed getaway to disconnect from the real world. The place was just as beautiful as the pictures! You can tell Waylon and Kaci have so much heart and dedication to their rental. I was so in awe with the attention to detail, the cleanliness of the whole place, the prompt communication, and the countless amount of amenities available! You don't ever have to leave! We did end up checking out the two recommended wineries for a day and they were both great! We hope to stay at the TreeLoft again in the near future."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We simply regretted not having more time to spend at such an awesome get-away spot!
Everything was on point, from the commodity, to the location, to the great taste in design, to the attention and care shown by Kaci and Waylon.
Truly was a memorable few days for my wife and I on our honeymoon trip.
Thank you Kaci and Waylon!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was our fifth or sixth time staying at Basecamp--I've lost count! The treehouse is always immaculate, and the surroundings are more than peaceful. If you want a clean, quiet, relaxing weekend away, this is your place. Kaci & Waylon are so thoughtful with their place, and they have done a fantastic job of keeping it as wonderful as it was the day it opened! We will return for as long as Kaci & Waylon welcome us."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Perfection.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Cannot say enough about how amazing our stay was here with Kaci and Waylon! Everything went so seamlessly making for the perfect peaceful get away. They are proactive with communication, quick to respond, and incredible flexible.
Everything at base camp was clearly done with care and intention and we are already looking to book our next stay!"

2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My husband and I booked the Tree Loft for our 16th anniversary getaway. I was immediately drawn to the lofts aesthetic and the thought of a peaceful, secluded atmosphere away from the hustle and bustle of everyday life. The photos are of course amazing but actually arriving and experiencing it first hand was even better than I imagined. Every little detail was so beautiful. The sounds of nature were so peaceful and the view of the stars away from all the city lights were stunning! We also loved the scenery and the close proximity to parks and winery‚Äôs. We had a great experience with communication with our hosts whenever we had a question. I would recommend this stay to any of my family and friends!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We planned this getaway for the 2024 Eclipse. I could t have asked for a better place to beautiful, spotless, comfortable. The absolute perfect place to get away from It all."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I highly recommend the TreeLoft. it‚Äôs so peaceful. The host provides pretty much everything that one will need. The Loft is clean. The grounds are clean and beautiful. The scenery is perfect. There‚Äôs plenty of games and books. I could go on and on, but I‚Äôll sum it up with‚Ä¶..we can‚Äôt wait to return! It‚Äôs the perfect peaceful sabbatical. Mark and Nicole Peterson"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Absolutely amazing. All of the small thoughtful details made this wonderful getaway even better than we could have imagined! They really thought of everything to make us feel at home. Kaci and Waylon sent great instructions and recommendations for places to eat/explore nearby. It was a beautiful location and very clean. Can‚Äôt wait to go back!

2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Impeccable design with lots of small details that made our stay really enjoyable and relaxing. Gorgeous private views, LOTS of birdwatching, just an overall wonderful place for a couples retreat or a solitude retreat. We can't wait to come back."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The best little getaway!! I need in my life on a regular basis to get away from it all and decompress! Beautiful and quiet! Thank you for creating and sharing such a magical space!
2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"This place is exactly like the pictures. The cabin is beautiful, peaceful, and private. You are surrounded by nature and waking up the the view out the windows was wonderful. The space is well thought out and full of tiny comforts. We will definitely look to go back!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This was our second time staying at the TreeLoft and we loved it even more. This is the perfect little getaway to relax and reconnect. We can‚Äôt wait to come back again. Kaci and Waylon are incredible hosts with great communication.

If you‚Äôre looking for a place to get away from the hustle of life, this is it! Loved that there wasn‚Äôt WiFi or cell service, so we could unwind and relax."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The pictures Kaci & Waylon has posted don't do it justice. It is a beautiful loft, the views are stunning and it is a perfect place for couples to enjoy themselves. From Texas to Missouri, this trip was definitely worth it. I, 100% will return and will recommend this Loft as your next destination."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a tree-mendous stay at Kaci and Waylon‚Äôs TreeLoft. What a wonderful place to unwind, relax, and enjoy the surrounding beauty. The place is exactly as described and the amenities were perfect - the fire pit is picturesque for s‚Äômores, the hot tub was a perfect temp, and the bed was super comfy! We had a storm roll through and they proactively texted us to make sure we knew where to find the weather radio and the storm shelter nearby. Their recommendations came in handy for venturing into town for dinner and vineyard/brewery visits. We will definitely be back!!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We enjoyed a relaxing two days at the tree house. All the amenities were even better than described, we will come back to the treehouse in the future!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The Treeloft at Basecamp is truly magical, even if you are traveling solo. I booked three nights there for a writing ""retreat."" I was needing to make progress on a project so I looking for a quiet place to unplug. Kaci and Waylon have created such a wonderful and sacred space, inside and out. My first two days/nights were cold and rainy so the fire place made everything so cozy. On my third day, the skies cleared and that night was perfect to sit in the hot tub. The stars were pure magic. I left refreshed, with a giant portion of my project completed! Getting away from the outside world was just what I needed. And yes, the lack of wifi and cell service helped üôÑ"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place exceeded all my expectations! Kaci & Waylon thought of every detail too, including a s‚Äômores kit! So so cozy and clean! (I use to clean houses, and this place was one of cleanest places I‚Äôve ever stayed.) This was the best birthday present ever to me! And I cannot wait to go back! Don‚Äôt second guess booking this place, you will not regret it."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"My favorite Airbnb I have ever stayed in. The power of disconnecting from technology and reconnecting with your spouse is a must for a healthy marrriage and THIS Airbnb makes that possible.
Love love love this place."

2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This was our second stay and just like the first time our visit was so peaceful and relaxing. We got to explore more this time and walked to the pond that we could see a little bit from the windows and we loved every minute.
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Everything was exactly as advertised. Exactly. I'd imagine the listing has professional photos, but they aren't glamor pics, it looks just like you see here. As chronic over-packers and two who really wanted to ditch the electronics, we packed a lot. Our own games, conversation cards, etc. None of it was needed. They had it all. If you bring clothes and food, you'll be set. I was surprised with a fire pit, that there wasn't a lighter...ended up finding a tub with multiple, also matches and firestarting sticks. Then when cooking I did wish there was a second pair of tongs for raw vs cooked chicken...found a second pair. Everything was on site to have a fantastic time and if you want to venture out there are long trails to hike nearby. Great get away."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Wow!!! What an incredibly beautiful experience in a well thought out & designed home with everything one would need. Such a beautiful place & an unforgettable experience; thank you!
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Our third stay at The Tree Loft. Just as magical as the first two stays! Perfection.
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a great second stay at Kaci & Waylon's Basecamp. The space was just as clean, orderly, and beautiful. This time around, we really appreciated that in Kaci & Waylon's welcome instructions, they mentioned for us to give the babysitters their numbers incase of emergency. This small detail, helped us relax so much more than I can describe. It eased our minds with being out of phone service and way from our babies for the first time. Care and attention to details are apparent in all areas when staying at the Basecamp. Highly recommend!"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Absolutely lovely stay and beautiful space for a weekend away! We enjoyed the peaceful space at night and went on a hike during the afternoon at a spot nearby. Would definitely stay again in the future! Thank you!
2024-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"We had the best time! The TreeLoft exceeded our expectations! Stunning views, cozy interior, and the most peaceful escape! Kaci and Waylon were absolutely wonderful to work with. Highly highly recommend!"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Worth every penny. Gorgeous location and gorgeous place, plus the hosts thought of everything. Crammed a week's worth of relaxation into two nights. If you're looking for luxury digs in a serene setting with absolute privacy, you've found your place."
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place was amazing. Just the getaway we were looking for. The tree loft was beautiful, clean, private, and everything we expected and more. We loved watching the birds, relaxing in the hot tub, and were amazed by the stars at night. Simply stunning."
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My husband and I absolutely loved our stay at the TreeLoft. It was the perfect break from our hectic lives as a family of five. It was an overcast few days with light rain, but it didn‚Äôt dampen our time in the slightest. üòä How could it with the beautiful view of the trees, plenty to do in the loft and such a beautifully decorated and clean space to spend our time. We loved the break from technology and will definitely be back!"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Loved going back to experience the tree loft at a different time of the season. Everything was as we had expected. Quiet and peaceful. Being alone in the woods without distractions was exactly what we were looking forward to. A perfect place to reconnect and remember.
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Love Kaci and Waylon‚Äôs place. This is our second visit and we will continue to go back!
2024-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"We had an amazing getaway at Kaci & Waylon‚Äôs tree loft! Everything was super well kept, clean, and just like the photos! Our time was so relaxing and peaceful. One of our favorite places we‚Äôve ever stayed!"

2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Truly a gorgeous and peaceful getaway for those looking to disconnect. Kaci and Waylon were so lovely and have clearly put so much love and care into the space.
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful setting indoors and out. Very peaceful and worth the disconnect.
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This was our second stay at the gorgeous tree loft and it some how managed to get even better! Heaven on earth without a doubt!
2024-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"This was the most beautiful space we've ever stayed in. So incredibly peaceful and just gorgeous, inside and out. My wife said as we traveled home, ""I want to tell everyone I know about this place, but I also want to keep it all to myself!"" So glad we were able to find a date that was available and visit. Thank you!"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What a great way to celebrate our 15yr anniversary! This space truly allows you to slow down, and reconnect with the one you love. We enjoyed playing games, bird watching, and the hot tub!"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was the perfect place for welcome the new year. We had so much fun around the fire, hanging in the hot tub, playing games & just relaxing together.

2023-12-01,5,Stayed one night,Wow my husband and I booked this for a one night get away. Shortly after arriving we realized we'll need 2 nights next time. This place was a perfect getaway to rejuvenate connect with each other qnd nature. We will be coming back soon for an another peaceful stay.
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,"It was absolutely perfect and felt so cozy! We came from St. Louis, which is just about an hour away, yet it felt like we were so much farther from home because of the difference in scenery. Would come back again in a heart beat!"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place is one in a million! Everything about it is so thoughtfully done and all the personal touches made it feel like home. I was in awe of it from the moment I pulled up. Due to the holiday season, the place was decorated for Christmas which made it feel so warm and magical. It's the perfect little getaway and I cannot wait to come back."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My husband and I booked the TreeHouse for our honeymoon and our only regret is that we didn't stay longer! The space is beautiful and allows for complete relaxation. There are several things to do only a 20-25 minute drive away. However, there are plenty of books, games, records, and a lovely hot tub if you do choose to stay in. Kaci and Waylon were excellent hosts and made the check-in process very simple. We highly recommend this place to anyone, and can't wait to come back again!"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"It was a beautifully relaxing weekend. The Treeloft is well appointed. Local recommendations were spot on, and we had a great time. Loved it!"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"We loved our night stay at the TreeLoft and can‚Äôt wait to come back! The amenities (hot tub, bathroom setup, comfort bed, etc) were top notch and the time away from the rest of the world was peaceful and needed!"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The most peaceful and magical weekend getaway my fianc√© and I could have ever had. We highly recommend this Airbnb to any couple. It‚Äôs a little slice of heaven. Truly a magical retreat. 10 out of 10 recommended!!! We can‚Äôt wait to return in the future.
2023-12-01,5,Stayed one night,The tree loft was an amazing get away for my husband and I to celebrate our anniversary! Kaci was a wonderful host and we would love to visit again in the future. Thank you!
2023-12-01,5,Stayed one night,Nature beauty within the trees. Great escape from the busy city with a little over an hour drive. The Treeloft was immaculate and so well designed. Love everything about this peaceful treat. Looking forward to our return.
2023-12-01,5,Stayed one night,Very peaceful and relaxing
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place is so worth the money! It's stylish, comfortable, and very tranquil. we spent three days chilly with nature, no phone service, internet or TV. We just spent time relaxing, chatting, reading, and reflecting on the year"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful and relaxing! Great place to unwind, unplug, and get away from it all!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The TreeLoft lived up to the hype - such a peaceful, cozy space with top notch amenities. The shower and tub were amazing, and the bed is very comfortable. Perfect place for a private getaway in nature not far from St. Louis. Thanks Kaci & Waylon for being awesome, responsive hosts!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed one night,It is actually even better in person! so well done and tastefully designed. White Glove clean!!
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This has become a tradition for us‚Äîone we didn‚Äôt even know how badly we needed. This is the only place we know to completely unplug and just be, but do it in luxury! Everything about the TreeLoft is pristine and purposeful. They‚Äôve thought well about you before you even arrive! Kaci and Waylon are truly special people who have chosen to share their gift with the world. If you haven‚Äôt been to here before and you get the chance to go, don‚Äôt miss it!!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We loved the place. It was a lovely, quaint, and cozy nature retreat. You can see active wildlife from any vantage point and enjoy nature even from your balcony. They also had about everything you would need in a place covered. The only downsides were very minor. Having no cellular or tech access was nice to disconnect but also a little bit of an annoyance when looking for info on dinner or an activity to do in the area. But it is stated outright. Also, we didn't really like the open shower area in the bathroom. It was kind of cool, but a bit of a novelty, a little chilly, and gets the bathroom area wet. But just personal taste. A few pillow-type options would have been great, too. It was a little pricey for a small weekend escape, but it is a cool and hard-to-book place to stay. We enjoyed our stay, and the hosts were very proactive in communicating and providing information. We would recommend it to others and return for another stay in the future."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place is very special. Having booked this out ten months in advance, this getaway ended up coming up at exactly the right and needed time for us. A disconnect from the outside world to process some current life changes, to forget about everything, to simply be in nature and the peace it provides. Kaci & Waylon truly thought of anything you could possibly want. There‚Äôs almost nothing you really need to bring. My only regret is that we didn‚Äôt get to have more time here. Looking forward to many return visits. Kudos to these two for seeing a vision for what soo many people need and executing it to incredible perfection. Upon leaving this sanctuary, it begs the question- ‚Äúwhy aren‚Äôt we all living like this always‚Äù?"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The treehouse was just as described, everything was perfect. We enjoyed the relaxation and connecting with each other while disconnecting from everything else. Highly recommend!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We loved our stay at the TreeLoft! This is our second stay and we plan to come back again. We have hectic city lives and a toddler and this is our go to parent get away. It is stress free, perfectly contained, and a quick ride from Stl. This year Kaci and Waylon went above and beyond. We have an electric car and I was worried about the charge for the three day trip. They not only allowed us to plug in at the house, they we‚Äôve supplied the cord and had to waiting for us already plugged in. Highly recommend this place and renting from this couple. We‚Äôve never had an issue, and even if we did, I‚Äôm confident they would address it quickly."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,A perfect getaway! Beautiful place inside and out! Loved the little extras that make for a wonderful stay!
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Our stay at the TreeLoft was incredibly relaxing. Getaways like this can reorient you to the power of nature and the pleasure of focused time with your partner. At least that was the case for us!
The amenities are modern, simple, and well-cared for. We loved that the hot tub was ready to slip right into and the stars over the bed provided the perfect night light.
What a blessing to not have cell service or wifi, but to have the chirping of birds and the rustling of chipmunks as the natural soundtrack to hours of rest and relaxing! This location and the thoughtful hospitality was true perfection. We will certainly return!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,Truly perfection. Every detail. Tree loft at BaseCamp is a gem. We‚Äôve already booked a return trip next year.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This was a true retreat. Beautiful Fall weather!!! A beautiful tree house nestled in the woods. Everything was perfect. You could not hope for anything more or different. We are grateful for the opportunity to share a brief moment in time at the Tree House!
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Just go‚Ä¶you won‚Äôt regret it!
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This space was beautiful! Such peaceful surroundings too.. we had a great time and will definitely be staying again!
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"Absolutely breathtaking experience, I will be staying here again. Kaci & Waylon were attentive hosts, providing an unforgettable experience going above and beyond to provide a pristine, comfortable, peaceful retreat that can only be described as heaven on earth. A transformative Airbnb experience few can hold a candle to."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Basecamp is an absolute gem. Everything was perfect. Kaci and Waylon have thought of every detail to make your stay special. Spending a few days here unplugged was a perfect weekend getaway. This is a special place.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The perfect place for a little get away. The TreeLoft is exactly what is advertised. They were very responsive and showed great hospitality our entire stay. Between all of the amenities and layout, would recommend to anyone looking to get away for a few day!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was a getaway gift for my parents. We got a stay for two nights, and they loved it. Would definitely recommend Kaci and Waylon‚Äôs tree house to anyone who wants a peaceful getaway."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,This treehouse cottage was the perfect setting for a night away from our troubles and responsibilities! Excellent way to recharge and we will for sure be coming back!

2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Treeloft is a piece of heaven on earth. From bird watching during the day to watching the stars all evening. The fire pit, the deck with the hot tub and the beautiful bathroom - it couldn't have been better. They have put so much thought into it and provided us with everything we would need. Their directions to their place were spot on and their instructions were perfect, all of our questions were answered. We can't wait to come back. Thank you K&W!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My husband and I recently stayed at the Treeloft at Basecamp, and it was nothing short of amazing. The expert design and flawless finishes created an atmosphere of luxury and comfort that is second to none. We highly recommend this gem for a serene and stylish getaway. Don‚Äôt miss the chance to experience it!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"Beautiful, peaceful and clean! This property exceeded our expectations and will definitely be back. The hotub was amazing and spotless. Loved every bit of our stay!!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The tree loft at base camp was absolutely breathtaking. We had everything we needed but were able to disconnect and spend some time in the peace and quiet. The record player was a lot of fun, as was watching all the different birds! Definitely recommend!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,My husband and I stayed for three nights. Amazing place! Great time unplugging and spending time with each other. Can‚Äôt wait to do it again!
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Absolutely gorgeous!!! Peaceful, serene, amazing! Can‚Äôt say enough about this treehouse. Loved the hot tub, watching the birds, playing music, making a pizza on the traeger and just enjoying the trees and calmness this treehouse offers. There was even a s‚Äômores kit which we of course used. Ate at Mary Jane‚Äôs Burger and Brew and it was great. Hope to return again. Loved it!!!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My husband and I took this trip for my birthday. It was perfect! Best birthday ever. If you want somewhere in the woods and to disconnect from the world, this is the place. We brought food to cook for one whole day, went out to eat one night. There is quite a bit to do in Perryville. But this place is to stay and rest. The hosts nailed every single little thing. We will be back!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Wow!! This place was even better then expected! I surprised my husband for a few nights to get away and little did we know we‚Äôd be staying in the trees. We loved every minute of it and it was just what we needed to relax and unwind. We will definitely be back again! Beautiful inside and out and everything was perfect!
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was our second trip to the TreeLoft. The quiet quality time together we enjoy here provides us with the ‚Äòrest‚Äô we need! The TreeLoft atmosphere is unlike any other and enables us as a couple to create the most wonderful experiences and sweetest memories together that we will never forget. We long to return to the TreeLoft the moment we leave each time as we just crave the quiet, serene, and magical place Kaci and Waylon provide!
Always meticulously clean and matches listing accurately! Wonderful hosts! ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"A great place to get away, relax and be one with nature. Very peaceful and quiet."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"You know it‚Äôs a great Airbnb when you‚Äôre already planning a second visit during the first! Fantastic vibe, even for someone traveling solo like me. Hot tub was spotless which is impressive on it‚Äôs own‚Ä¶ but the best part is the overall energy of the place reminding you of the beauty that is all around and within us."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We enjoyed every moment of our time at the TreeLoft! Thank you Kaci & Waylon for creating such an amazing space to share with others! We couldn‚Äôt have asked for anything more - easily the best AirBNB we‚Äôve had the opportunity to experience. Peaceful surroundings, beautiful decor, and plenty of extras provided! ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è"

2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I absolutely can see why everyone has rated this location 5 ‚≠êÔ∏è‚Äôs. Amazing location, peaceful, impeccably decorated and furnished. Hosts thought of everything you would need for a relaxing, peaceful and unplugged time away."

2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"A perfect retreat, close to St. Louis!
Kaci & Waylon have created a beautiful place to disconnect from the hustle and bustle of your life and reconnect to nature, yourself, or a loved one.
Between a collection of books, games, puzzles, bird watching, records, or walking around the property, there is plenty to keep you busy. Or if you wish, just being.
The kitchen is perfect for creating meals for one or two. They provide everything you could think of!
The cabin is thoughtfully designed and aesthetically decorated to bring a feeling of peace and calm to your stay.
If you happen to forget something, they might have it in the cabin.
If you want, you can park your car and not leave till check out!
Perryville, St. Genevieve, and even Cape Girardeau are a close drive away. Hawn State Park is close, also!
I would say this place meets and exceeds all expectations and five stars is not enough!"

2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was our second trip to Basecamp and we loved it just as much as the first time. Kaci and Waylon are so kind and responsive and they have thought through all the details of their place.
The place is spotless and well designed. The rainfall shower head and incredible soaker bathtub are not to be missed!
Kaci and Waylon provide all the tools you need to relax and enjoy your stay.
The towels, bedding, robes, kitchen tools and kitchen appliances are of excellent quality. Some AirBnB spaces are hit-or-miss with what dishes, pans, spices or coffee that is available but these hosts provide all the essentials to cook during your stay if you wish.
Basecamp has an intentionally small footprint to allow you to escape and focus on yourself and/or each other and yet the space feels so open and never cramped or cluttered."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Even more beautiful in person. Such a peaceful, lovely setting. Every detail to make the stay pleasant was thought of!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We found out what we valued in a get-away space: beautiful/ peaceful surroundings, complete privacy, options for enjoyable time together (great fire pit area, very nice hot tub, inside and outside seating options for reading and enjoying birds and stillness), and the sweetness of hospitable things that the hosts prepared to make us feel at home. Lovely luxury retreat!"

2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The TreeLoft is the PERFECT getaway. We went for our honeymoon and enjoyed the tech-free environment and beautiful Missouri hillsides and forest.
When we wanted to get out for some fun we visited Charleville Winery and Brewery which was recommended by Kaci and Waylon and it did not disappoint! Great food, beautiful views, and an introverts dream tasting set-up.
The TreeLoft was impeccable, as we have high standards of cleanliness. Even the hot tub was spotless and fresh. There are far more amenities than mentioned in the listing. It was stocked with puzzles, books, magazines. We cannot say enough good things about this place and we look forward to recommending it to all our friends who need some couples time!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Magical! Kaci and Waylon have created the perfect escape with attention paid to every single detail. The treehouse loft is perfectly constructed amongst the trees allowing for an idealistic blend of luxury and nature, from the thoughtfully curated amenities to the spotless window overlooking the trees they have thought of everything! After spending 3 hours in the treehouse we decided to book a second stay! 5 stars are not enough! The love and effort put into this oasis seeps from the walls and into your bones. 10 stars might not even be enough!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The time spent at the tree loft was magical. Star gazing from the beautiful skylight , nice fires out by the pit , stargazing from the hot tub . The place is a dream . Bird watching was beautiful and Kaci & Waylon provides extra bird feed . They thought of everything ! Comfortable linens , kitchen was well stocked , nice variety of vinyl records . It was absolutely amazing and i look forward to booking again in the future"

We can‚Äôt wait to come back and stay in the future! 10/10 would recommend to everyone!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This special place will set your soul on fire. The intentional wi-fi/cell-free environment was needed more than realized and really allowed us to turn inward, to each other, and quieted our minds. Everything in the space was a product of great thought and consideration. We were not left needing or wanting for anything. This is more than just a cool place to stay, it is a source of connection and healing for mind, body, and soul! Kaci and Waylon couldn‚Äôt have been friendlier or more accommodating. What a treasure!!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The BaseCamp treehouse was a peaceful getaway! We spent a few days there away from kids and it was very enjoyable. The house was clean and had all of the amenities needed for a short stay! The record player and record collection was awesome and we enjoyed listening to the music!
The hot tub and fire pit were fun to use. The hot tub took some work to adjust the temperature but the hosts were very helpful and responsive in getting this resolved!!!!
Overall awesome stay and totally worth the price!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"10/10
‚òÜ‚òÜ‚òÜ‚òÜ‚òÜ
Would highly recommend the Basecamp Treehouse for anyone looking to get away and reconnect. It's so peaceful and relaxing. Absolutely loved everything about this place. The only bad part was that we eventually had to leave!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"The perfect spot for mom and dad‚Äôs first little getaway without our son. Peaceful, beautiful, intentional, and inviting, this place had it all! Even down to the snacks and books provided in the treehouse, we thoroughly enjoyed the well thought out building of this incredible place. Grateful and blessed for some time to unplug and reset. Many memories made!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was our third stay at the TreeLoft, and it was just as wonderful a retreat as always. It was a much-needed retreat into the trees and nature. Kaci and Waylon are great hosts, and have thought of everything to make the TreeLoft a relaxing and restoring stay. We're already looking forward to next time!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I cannot say enough great things about this place. Kaci and Waylon have created a magical experience at the tree loft. This Airbnb has been on my radar for awhile, but it is usually booked out a year in advance. I was able to snag a last minute cancellation! My husband and I own a restaurant and we needed a few days away from the stress. The tree loft was exactly what we needed. I was worried about being anxious not having cell service or bored without tv and internet. Nope. I hate how we rely on technology so much. Thank you for creating a place that allows you to be closer to nature, enjoy the company of someone you love, and tap into your true self and desires. This will now be an annual trip at the very least. For those of you that haven‚Äôt been..book it whatever date comes available just book it."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I don‚Äôt think we could add anything new to the already wonderful things people have shared about this space. It was beautiful and every detail was thought about. The hosts were extremely organized, kind, proactive, and clear with their communication which is always a welcomed gift. It was so nice to be unplugged somewhere so great! We loved this quiet and peaceful stay and would 100% visit again."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"TreeLoft is one of the few airbnbs we‚Äôve returned to (this was our forth booking)! We love the peaceful location, and the space is perfect for a few days way. You won‚Äôt miss your phone or laptop when you‚Äôre amongst the scenery and sounds out here. Also, the loft itself is always spotless. Thanks for another great stay!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is our 2nd visit and we may have loved it even more this time around, which I didn‚Äôt think was possible! This place is perfect and offers everything you need for a lovely, relaxing weekend. It‚Äôs impeccably clean and adorably decorated. We hiked in Hawn State Park and Pickle Springs (we particularly loved this one) and picked up some delicious fruit at Frank & Bridget‚Äôs Produce in town. We‚Äôre already booked to come back in October and we can‚Äôt wait! This getaway is worth every penny. Thanks, Kaci & Waylon!"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,Highly recommend! It‚Äôs absolutely beautiful!
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Our weekend here was restorative. It's the perfect place to slow down and relax. It's a beautiful and thoughtfully curated space and we took advantage of it all! I can't wait to come back!
2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"Just what I needed! I had been wanting to stay here for so long and am so thankful that I was able to spend a rejuvenating night at the TreeLoft. Those 20 hours (because yes I checked in as soon as I could and stayed until check out) were spent reading on the deck with the sounds of birds and nature around me, cooking in the well-equipped kitchen, eating on the deck while birds frequented the bird feeder, listening to records, enjoying the hot tub, rainfall shower and bath tub, reading by the fire and then sleeping in the comfortable bed.
As a solo female traveler, I felt safe in this space and truly appreciated the disconnect from the outside world for a bit. No WiFi or cell service was great but was also to get service as instructed to let my loved ones know I arrived.
The hosts were extremely helpful and gave great info. Next time I might consider hiking at a nearby park or going out to eat but I really had no reason to leave the loft!"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The most amazing Air BNB experience I‚Äôve had. Great location. Great host. Great communication. Thank you Kaci & Waylon!
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We celebrated our third anniversary here and it was beautiful! It would be a perfect honeymoon location too. It‚Äôs a cozy and luxurious way to get up close with nature. Highly recommend!!

Kaci and Waylon provided flawless instructions and information that made everything a breeze and made us feel right at home during our stay. The TreeLoft itself is absolutely beautiful inside and out with no shortage of amenities or things to do between the fire pit, grill, hot tub, games, and views. We had the most relaxing couple of days and can‚Äôt wait to come back soon!"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,Such a relaxing getaway‚Ä¶highly recommend if you‚Äôre looking to disconnect from the world but reconnect with your loved ones.

We love the design of the tree house and amenities (in particular the hot tub, smoker grill, and fire pit area).

Will definitely be back! Thank you for sharing your piece of paradise."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Our stay at The Tree Loft was absolutely incredible! Very quiet location with beautiful scenery! The loft was meticulously cleaned and prepped for our arrival. The kitchen includes everything you need to prepare meals including a microwave, small oven, and ice maker! We did not utilize the grill but one is provided along with all the required supplies. The hot tub was perfect for the cold March nights we stayed. It too was very clean and inviting. 100% recommend this property. Book this stay! You will NOT be disappointed!"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Our stay was amazing. Not only were the outside surroundings peaceful, but the interior was clean, spa-like, luxurious and calming. The whole experience felt special and welcoming. We spent a lot of time in the hot tub without the jets on, listening to the pure silence next to the pine trees. It was heaven. We will absolutely be booking again!"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What a peaceful retreat! By far our favorite stay. The space is beautiful, clean, modern, and private. We hiked Whispering Pines - great 7 mile adventurous hike.

The hosts were very responsive and went above and beyond to help us find an alternate route when the heavy rains prohibited us from using some of the backroads. The bird feeder was also a highlight. We read books, made simple dinners and listened to lots of music. It was nice to be off grid for a couple of days at such a cool place. Truly a unique and special stay!"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We can't even begin to describe how wonderful our time was at the Tree Loft. This has been one of the most unique experiences that my wife and I have had together.

Believe it or not, Kaci and Waylon somehow under promise and over deliver. The thoughtful personal touches were as amazing as the space itself. There is a reason this property has hundreds of reviews and 5 stars. I can't say enough positive things. We can't wait to return! üíú"

It gives us the chance to tune out the world and tune in to each other. We love the Tree Loft!"

2023-02-01,5,Stayed one night,We had a lovely weekday overnight visit that allowed us to unplug and getaway. The environment was nurturing and rejuvenating even for such a quick visit. Our stay was well worth the drive and expense. Kaci and Waylon were very helpful with informational texts prior to our arrival which made the whole experience so easy and fulfilling. We found being high among the trees inspirational which led to great conversations. Highly recommend a stay even if only for one night! Thank you.

2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Kaci & Waylon provided clear communication to find and access the property prior to arrival. The detailed guide for restaurants and activities in the area was helpful in planning our visit. We were fortunate to wake up to a few inches of snow during our stay. The cabin and property are stunning and far exceed the pictures. We look forward to visiting again in the future.
2023-01-01,5,Stayed one night,We love every minute!! My wife and I will be coming back for another magical weekend!!!
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This place is truly amazing. The most thoughtful air bnb ever ever stayed at. It has everything you could possibly need in the kitchen. The fire place is a awesome touch. The hot tub under the stars was awesome. And the fire pit with all the starter materials and cut wood made it so easy to start a fire to roast the best smores. We love this place and had an amazing weekend!

2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Our stay was just what we needed‚Ä¶time (not too far) away, disconnected, in a beautiful, luxurious treehouse!

Thank you for having us!!"
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,the Treeloft was simply magical. It was the perfect way to celebrate my birthday. It was so incredibly peaceful and rejuvenating to disconnect from the digital world we live in. My husband and I have already decided that we need to visit once a year to escape the constant need for electronics. The pictures don't do this place justice. It was so beautiful and peaceful.
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is a great little getaway to destress and decompress. It's a perfect place for some peace and quiet and to reconnect with yourself and your partner. We absolutely loved it. Also, it may not be a big deal to most, but it was nice having the cleaning fee cover the cleaning and not having a long list of cleaning to complete before leaving."
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is our second stay at Kaci and Waylon‚Äôs Tree Loft. It is impossible to put into words how amazing this place is!

2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Words nor pictures can describe the peaceful and beautiful TreeLoft, every personal detail made us feel right at home. We checked in on Christmas Eve to a basket of goodies including homemade Christmas cookies-yum! There was a beautifully decorated Christmas tree and everything was so cozy. Sitting in front of the beautiful windows looking out over the timber watching the deer and birds was so relaxing. I didn‚Äôt want to leave but we are already planning our return! Thank you for allowing us to reset and enjoy each others company at your beautiful property and being such wonderful hosts!"
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My fianc√©e and I were lucky enough to stay at this peaceful oasis during a winter snowfall. We were blown away that something so relaxing and serene could be this close to Saint Louis.
The inside was literally perfect and had little touches everywhere to show the hosts truly cared. When we arrived there was a Christmas tree lit and ready to greet us. While not necessary, we appreciated that little touch.
My fianc√©e and I truly enjoyed the opportunity to decompress and get away from the hustle and bustle of daily life. It gave us a chance to slow things down and enjoy our time together without the distractions of technology. We most definitely would come back again!"

2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The space is lovely and Kaci and Waylon are the most thoughtful hosts ever. The Treeloft more than lived up to expectations! We will be back.
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"If your dates are available (or you can be flexible), book this place. It is even more beautiful in person than it looks in the pictures! And Kaci and Waylon are very good communicators. I wish for you clear star-filled nights and beautiful light-filled mornings."
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"When I say this place was AMAZING?! Every detail was on point. I mean, even the bed linens were dreamy cozy! Everything you could want or need was right there. The space was elegant, comfortable, enchanting! Kaci and Waylon were the most delightful hosts, and really out did themselves!

2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I have traveled around the world and this is one of the best, if not, the best experience I have ever had an an Airbnb. Everything from the treehouse, the small touches, the cleanliness, and the communication was amazing. Kaci & Waylon do an amazing job and have truly built a little piece of luxury in the middle of Missouri. I would stay here again and I would also recommend this place to anyone. If you find yourself in the middle of Missouri and need a place to stay, I would recommend trying to stay here because it is truly a great and wonderful experience. Thank you again!"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"100 % recommend this romantic getaway. We had a great time and did not want to leave. Renting during the fall was beautiful, so many colors!"

Taking this time to disconnect from the daily grind to reconnect with yourself, your partner and with nature is what we all need more of. This getaway can't happen often enough. Really looking forward to staying here again and excited to stay at their new space once it's available!"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I purchased this stay for my husband last Christmas. I was hoping for cool fall weather and we were so lucky to get a few cool nights to really enjoy the treehouse! It was perfect for a fire in the charming fire pit, relaxing in the lounge like hot tub, and for cool mornings with coffee on the deck! The treehouse has a wonderful little kitchen and outdoor grill, perfect for breakfast and coffee in the mornings and outdoor cooking at night. They have the cabinets well stocked with plenty of cookware, spices, coffee, and even a few other pantry staples! Such a nice touch!! The selection of books, games, and vinyl is wonderful to help you take time away from the digital world we live in a truly relax. I will recommend you take a larger vehicle down to this property as these are typical rock country roads and a lower riding car will likely get beat up. The only downfall for me to not having WiFi is planning on where you're going, if you head out for the day. Their binder they provide has some quick tips on directions from the tree house, but I recommend planning ahead and saving your directions as service is very spotty in the area. Overall it's such a beautiful spot, and anyone lucky to snag a reservation will really find themselves transported to a place of peace and relaxation!"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We are forever grateful for all that Kaci + Waylon have invested into this space to make room for rest and rejuvenation. This is our third stay, and also was our best yet. They have meticulously thought out every detail, so we don‚Äôt have to worry about one thing while unplugged from the ‚Äúreal world‚Äù. It‚Äôs always 5 stars from us! ‚ú®"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Second stay for us and just as great as the first. The most peaceful and serene setting to unplug and reconnect. Will definitely be back again!
