2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What a cute place! It was exactly as described and pictured. Very cozy and welcoming and easy to feel at home. We loved the wooded surroundings, country setting, and the peace and quiet. We were there for a couple nights as part of a longer girls trip (2 of us), and even my friend who is ‚Äúpotty wary‚Äù felt very comfortable with the RV toilet. We had zero issues with that. üòä It‚Äôs worth noting that with the small fridge and no stove, it was totally fine for our short term stay but may be harder longer-term if you prefer to cook and eat in. The host left very clear instructions and is right next door in the event of any issues (we had none but it‚Äôs great to know, just in case). We loved being able to stream Netflix in the evenings or just open the windows and enjoy the sounds of nature."

2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I recently had the pleasure of staying at Ben's cabin in the woods, and it was an absolutely amazing experience. From the moment we arrived, we were struck by the friendliness and hospitality of our host. Ben went out of his way to make us feel welcome and ensure that we had everything we needed for our stay.
One thing that really stood out to us was Ben's responsiveness. Whenever we had a question or concern, he was quick to respond and always made sure that we were taken care of. He also didn't hesitate to check in periodically, making sure we are doing well.
But what really made our stay at Ben's cabin so special was the fact that he allowed us to work on our music in peace. We booked the cabin as kind of a ""creative getaway"" as it can be hard to find a space where we can truly focus and be creative. Ben's cabin provided the perfect environment. The peaceful surroundings, comfortable furnishings, and overall cozy atmosphere made it the ideal place to work on our music."

Our trip was brief but very relaxing and we will definitely be keeping Ben and Denise in mind for future trips to Indiana!
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Travelled alone here as a female and felt completely safe. I loved that you were fully surrounded by nature yet in a 5-10 minute drive you could grab coffee, groceries, or a meal. The hosts home is near, but is blocked by trees. I needed an extra towel and within minutes they were able to bring one. I think it is a huge plus if you need help or anything. They were very responsive and polite with any questions I had through messaging.
The cabin is beautifully decorated. I loved using the Keurig, watching TV, and reading outside on the chairs provided. I enjoyed this airbnb so much I'm planning my next trip back! Highly recommend!"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The cabin is true to the description‚Äîvery tidy, cozy, and close to the owner‚Äôs own home. Which was a saving grace as I locked myself out of the cabin by accident üòÇ

The addition of their favorite local restaurants and the Fort Wayne pass QR code was so handy and very appreciated.

2022-07-01,5,Stayed one night,Great stay!
2022-07-01,2,Stayed one night,This place is not private or in the woods. It‚Äôs apart of their backyard. We can for check in and saw that there was no backyard or fire pit like the pictures say. Then the owner came out of his house and greeted us and said they would be there if we needed anything. I did not feel very safe at this location and we did not even stay.

2021-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great place to for a quick and cozy weekend getaway! The cabin was so cute and very clean and neat. We really enjoyed how close it was to Fort Wayne, the only bummer was that it was close to other houses as opposed to being off in the woods by itself. But overall, a great stay!! üôåüèº"

2021-09-01,5,Stayed one night,Great little cabin for a getaway from the city. small but still roomy and very comfortable
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Awesome cabin! Looks exactly like the pictures! Ben-Denise were very quick to respond when messaging through the app, and the check in guide was very well done. It even included pictures of landmarks once we got close so we would be sure not to get lost. Would definitely recommend this stay for anyone who wants close access to down town, but also wants the cabin/out in the woods experience."
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place! Fantastic hosts! really enjoyed our trip. Planning to stay again!
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Quaint cabin in a beautiful location. Quite a wonderful taste of tiny house living.
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The hosts are excellent. The cabin was just as they described. Everything was clean and orderly. We really enjoyed our stay.
2021-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"Beautiful place! Perfect for one or two people, but I couldn't imagine fitting more people in there than that. There is a Chromecast with the TV, so that made relaxing even easier. The place is like a renovated RV when it comes to the bathroom and water, so the water tasted a little like a garden hose and the shower wasn't an amazing experience, but I was expecting this before I arrived."
2021-09-01,5,Stayed one night,Perfect spot for a quiet night of peace and calm. Beautiful cabin with all the touches of home.
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay. My husband and I stayed for part of our road trip honeymoon and felt very cozy and at home in this cabin.
2021-09-01,5,Stayed one night,Everything was exactly as advertised. Very Cozy.! 10/10 Would recommend. üëç
2021-09-01,5,Stayed one night,Wonderful place. A nice rustic feel to it and great accommodations. Also the hosts were very communicative and helpful. I would highly recommend it.
2021-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"Very nice luxury cabin/camping experience in the woods. Small bathroom, but you are made well aware of this by the owner in their listing AND it is very functional and adds to your cabin experience! We enjoyed our one night stay!"
2021-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"I stayed at the cabin for one night; I work over an hour away and had to help with a late evening event for my job.
It certainly fit my needs for a clean, quiet, comfortable place to stay. I was fortunate to be able to check-in during daylight; after dark may be a small inconvenience due to the fact that the cabin really is in the woods, and the short path to walk up to it is a few steps away from the parking space. A cell phone flashlight provides adequate illumination when dark, though.
For arrival, see photo of signs: it says turn here for cabin, do it. At first it looked like I was turning into their driveway, (which I was), and it's easy to miss the parking space that is to your left for the cabin and the walkway up to it which is a few steps away. If you're not looking right for the cabin it is easy to miss as it's tucked in the trees.
Ben emphasized the small shower and RV toilet to me in communication, so this was not a surprise. The shower does not have traditional adjustment handles for both hot and cold, fyi.
The environment was quiet, a/c worked well and the bed was comfortable. I would certainly say here again!"
2021-09-01,5,Stayed one night,Such an awesome place off the the beaten path. Super clean super cute and super quiet. Ben is outstanding. Highly recommended!
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Clean. Cozy. Quiet. Three words to describe my stay at Ben and Denise's cabin. I was there for a two day personal work retreat - to get away to a quiet place and get some work done - in advance of a business meeting in the area.
The place is exactly as described. You'll feel like your deep in the woods away from civilization, but your just 10 minutes to several restaurants. I even had Door Dash deliver. And, I got in a five mile run on the country roads.
The listing is very accurate. The place is clean. I will be back."
2021-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"This was the cutest little cabin ever , just like in the picture and we actually were sad to be leaving . Hope we can come back !
And if you like to look around the city was very beautiful too we definitely enjoyed our little trip"
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Awesome little place in the woods. Very quiet getaway. Would definitely stay there again on our next visit to Sweetwater.
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"""The Cabin"" was a very nice and quiet little getaway!! I loved the decor, Coca Cola and the log cabin. It was so cozy!! Perfect size for a single occupant or a couple. I highly recommend Ben & Denise as host!!"

2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I really enjoyed my stay at this cozy little cabin. It's convenient that it's not too far from Fort Wayne and yet also situated in a very beautiful spot so I felt like I was getting away. The hosts were also very good at communicating before, during, and after the trip. I highly recommend this place for retreat. :)"

2021-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"Such a quaint little cabin in the woods! Plenty of privacy, very peaceful, but yet close to town. Would definitely recommend this spot!"

We will keep coming back as long as they have us. They‚Äôre wonderful, wonderful people and we‚Äôre so very grateful for their truly wonderful hospitality ‚ù§Ô∏è"
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Michael was an amazing host. He responded quickly to every question I had. The house was spotless, everything was up to date, and the location was peaceful. I would book again with Michael in a heart beat.

Places with good food: Italian grille and Jalape√±os
Groceries stores- Kroger is 3-5 miles away"
2023-01-01,3,Stayed a few nights,"It was ok but not really spotless clean like the other ones I've been staying in. Also the snotty rudeness from Michael over the phone when there was problems with payment not on my end put through Airbnb after already had been there a night I didn't not appreciate one bit. Specially when I was the one that brought it to her attention in first place about payment not being pulled out of my account yet and to have the cops start to call me and question me like I was in the wrong and trying to be there and not pay, and all of this took place Infront of my kid which really upset me. And the dishes had to be rewashed before using them cause they weren't that clean."
2022-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We had a great stay, thank you!"
2022-12-01,5,Stayed over a week,this place was perfect for our extended stay while our son attended auctioneering school. only 5 miles away. Michael was a great host!!! everything was easy...from getting there to check in and out. I would rent from him again without hesitation!!!

2022-01-01,5,Stayed about a week,"This is our second stay at this home and we can‚Äôt say enough good things. We love that they continue to open their home to our family. We are able to stay very near to my grandmother and provide a comfortable environment not only to us but to our girls, which is so very important to us. This wont be our last stay, as long as they‚Äôll have us! They‚Äôre wonderful people and it‚Äôs a wonderful home away from home for us!"

Michael was a very attentive host, and answered any questions I had within minutes.
Highly recommend!"
2021-07-01,3,Stayed with kids,"The checking in process was challenging since host had different code on listing than the message he had sent to me earlier that morning, We traveled all day and I didn‚Äôt think of looking at messages since I thought I had code already. 45 min later and midnight, I was able to hotspot onto my device to see the message he had sent earlier in the AM. Also listing says for 4 guests, that being said I would expect all beds and rooms to be cleaned and with clean sheets on them ready for our arrival. The bunk bed did not have clean sheets, I messaged host and he said that he had the cleaner only prepare the 2 beds and not the bunk bed as it is potential dangerous for kids. And didn‚Äôt think anyone would want to sleep in it. At that point I second guessed if the place had been cleaned properly according to the Airbnb enhanced cleaning process. Because the room had not been cleaned properly. I personally would not stay at this listing again as there are a few other things too."
2021-07-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Michael is a wonderful host. The home was exactly as described. Nice neighborhood, quiet and peaceful. Checking in and out was flawless. I will use this home again on my next trip to Auburn. George"
2021-06-01,5,Stayed about a week,Such a great place to stay. Easy access to Auburn and to Fort Wayne. Very comfortable home and it‚Äôs in a wonderful neighborhood.

2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What a gem! Sunrise Cottage is so incredibly peaceful, welcoming, charming, and thoughtful! my friends and I are busy moms. We wanted to just take a few days to rest and talk. This little slice of country heaven was just the ticket! All three of us left feeling so peaceful and ready to care for our families again. Plus the well-stocked kitchen made it so easy to prepare our own food (we prefer it that way for the most part)! Lydia was incredibly thoughtful leaving us a gift of homemade bread, jam, and applebutter! What a delight! We hope to be able to return the next time we need a little home away from home."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Already shared
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We traveled to Ohio for the Eclipse. Found this rental not far from the center of totality. Soo glad we picked this place. It was absolutely perfect. The cleanliness was top notch. I have my own cleaning business so I‚Äôm always pointing out things. & I didn‚Äôt have to do that during our stay. It was private, and quiet, out in the country. We stayed up looking at the stars. Lydia was a great host!! She left us the best cookies ever. She was quick to respond to any questions we had before we arrived, on our way there, and during our stay. It‚Äôs a close drive to many destinations as well. Highly recommend!!!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This was a great place to stay! If you‚Äôre not familiar with the area, the well water can be smelly so just plan ahead and bring bottled water. The place was great and very clean."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This place was a dream! The location was perfect for us, just minutes from our daughter in town. Lydia's home was cozy and very welcoming. The cookies were a nice touch, and yummy! She was extremely kind and eager to host us in her home! The space was just what we needed. My dad had his own room and my little girl and I shared the other room with the bunk beds. Worked out great that the bottom mattress was a full size as she is only 3, she slept in the bed with me. Overall, we loved our stay at Lydia's and will most definitely be returning when we visit my oldest daughter and new grand baby again :) Thank you for being such a lovely host, Lydia!"

2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Loved our stay! Plenty of room for our family, convenient and peaceful location. Amazing cookies! Everything was perfectly clean and smelled wonderful. We enjoyed cooking here as the kitchen had everything we needed and we were able to enjoy local fresh ground sausage. We also enjoyed watching movies as a family in the living room. Peacefully out in the country with plenty of yard for our little one to run around, with great wifi for working from home. We would definitely stay here again and likely will as we have family nearby. Lydia is very thoughtful in her attention to detail and made this place feel like home. ‚ù§Ô∏è"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This was our second stay at Lydia's place. We love it because it is peaceful and feels just like home. The home made cookies are a nice welcome gift. Lydia is very friendly and responsive. We will be back again.

2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Lydia s place was perfect for a getaway for anyone who wants a peaceful environment that encourages rest and relaxation. From the beginning, we knew we were gonna love staying there. A wonderful kitchen to make meals, a comfortable couch to watch shows together, and a spacious dining room for meals and reading. To top it off, we had fresh cookies made for us on arrival. We can't wait to go back!"

When we arrived after 11pm, the lights were on, and fresh homemade cookies were on the counter waiting for us. The location is easy to get to, private, and quiet.

2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Very organized the place and clean, thank you ."
2023-11-01,4,Group trip,"This historic house has an eclectic layout. We all enjoyed exploring the house, and imagining how previous owners might have utilized the different rooms. The theater room made for a fun viewing of A Christmas Story (An annual tradition in our family).
In all, Evolve (the managing company) was extremely pro-active in communicating ahead of time, and I didn't need to contact them during my stay.
This Airbnb was a great value. Hope to stay there the next time we come to town."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Our four-generation family had a wonderful time at the Indiana Dream Barn. Dustin thought of everything - plenty of towels and blankets, sports equipment in the gym, cornhole boards and bags, and everything we needed for cooking or grilling. The area was private, but it was less than 20 minutes into Fort Wayne where we found restaurants, bowling, mini-golf, and delicious ice cream at Just Cream!
The beds were comfortable, the rooms were huge, the blackout blinds were very effective for sleeping in. The air-conditioned gym made for comfortable Pickleball marathons. The TVs had all sorts of streaming options and the WiFi was powerful enough for all of our devices. The pool water was crystal-clear and he reached out during the week about having it cleaned.
He did warn us about the potholes on the driveway, so be careful driving back if you have a car that sits real low, and if you aren't used to well water the odor might be alarming (don't worry, it's safe). We'd definitely stay again!"
2024-06-01,5,Group trip,"Great place to spend time. Clean, comfortable, and a lot to do with the gym, theatre room, and pool. Highly recommend!"
2024-04-01,5,Group trip,A great host! Answered any and all questions. This is one of the best stays I‚Äôve ever had on Airbnb! Will definitely be staying again.

2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,The Indiana Dream Barn was a blast! We absolutely loved our stay. Everything was just as described. We would definitely book again and recommend this place to others.

This is a place to visit close to Auburn and Fort Wayne while being able to enjoy quite time as a family with many activities right in the house!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay! Peg was super friendly.
2024-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Wonderful hospitality and accommodations, everything we could have possibly needed was already provided and thought of beforehand.

Our host graciously provided delicious home-made treats for us, definitely a wonderful surprise!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,Great
2023-10-01,5,Stayed about a week,"My two sisters and I stayed here and we thought it was a super cute place, perfect size for us and walking distance to all the fun in downtown Auburn. Peg showed up one morning with muffins for us, which I never had someone do this for us at any place we stayed before. She made sure we were comfortable and asked if we needed anything. The only negative I had to say is internet was very low signal, but for us was fine because it was fair week when we stayed and we were out most of the day. We had a great time and we will definitely stayed at this place if we had the chance again. Thank you Jon and Peg for a week full of memories!!"
2023-01-01,5,Stayed over a week,I was extremely happy with our Airbnb. The host was always happy to help with anything we needed. We were very happy with the area and the great recommendations for food Choices in the area. We will definitely recommend and stay again.
2022-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"Charming old home. They had a yummy breakfast available if needed. Bed one was semi firm and pretty comfortable ‚Ä¶ bed two had a bit of a center divet so depends on your preferences. Also if you are light sensitive, perhaps use towels for the windows since there are lots of street lights. It was quiet and cozy. We would certainly stay there again."
2022-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The hospitality was second to none. The place was quaint and cozy. They went above and beyond with extra special things and actions to accommodate my family. I was grateful and appreciative for not just what they did, but for who they are!"

2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Comfortable and enjoyable stay at Dean and Nancy's place! Clean and uncluttered and had everything we needed with many homey touches added in.

2024-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"What a GEM of a place. It met our need perfectly. We came for a wedding my son was Best man (he came from Waukesha, WI) we brought my mom along. We were asked to make bread for the wedding party by the Groom. 3 people were able to be in the kitchen and we had room.
My son stayed upstairs and was perfect for him he really enjoyed it and said with how warm the out side temps got it was really cool up there.
The Creamery is a must across the street. My son plans to stay in the Tiny Shed when visits his friend

2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Dean and Nancy‚Äôs place was a great little house with a nice yard mostly surrounded by fields. It was perfect as a home base while in town visiting family.

2024-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We moved from Savannah to Fort Wayne and Dean and Nancy‚Äôs was the first place we stayed while we searched for a home.
We were welcomed with fresh milk, homemade dog treats and homemade cookies in the shape of Indiana. Throughout our month stay, Dean and Nancy were the most accommodating hosts and we can‚Äôt thank them enough. The house was stocked with everything you could think of, the views were amazing and we felt so safe the entire time. I would highly suggest staying at Dean and Nancy‚Äôs to everyone!"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"100% satisfied. Beautiful space. Beautiful bedrooms. The kitchen was well stocked with nice pans, plates, etc....

Thanks Dean and Nancy for your hospitality! Blessings"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This place is a dream! Everything is quality and very well appointed. You‚Äôre left wanting for nothing. It‚Äôs the little things‚Ä¶ the candles, coffee station, top notch cookware, fluffy blankets, nightlights, greenery‚Ä¶. It couldn‚Äôt have been more inviting. The property is very quiet and refreshing. The decor is cozy and spotless. Dean and Nancy are generous hosts and very responsive. It is wonderfully dog friendly property. This will be a repeat for me!"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This country bungalow was everything and more for my family this weekend. We travel a lot for wrestling and this was my top place to stay. Nothing like sitting in a tournament all day and getting to go home to a beautiful, peaceful, home on a beautiful piece of property. It was so close to town and the arena which made everything easier! I didn‚Äôt want to leave. The simple touches in the home were perfect and Nancy and Dean go above and beyond for their guests. I would come back to Indiana just to stay in this perfect home! My kids loved it! Thank you Nancy & Dean! ‚ò∫Ô∏è"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,This place was clean and stocked full of keurig pods and had a dishwasher which was a perk. They have a second airbnb rental on the property but we never saw anyone as it was vacant during our stay. I only have two beefs with this place. (1) The house had a huge draft coming in from the front door causing the thermostat to run excessively. Cold in living room and Boiling in bedrooms. We jammed a towel in the front door and it helped a bit. (2)The other beef I had is they have Hard Water at the home. The filters on the sink and filters on the water dispenser on the fridge needed changed Desperately. This left large white deposits in our water that you couldnt miss. We had to make a trip out and buy purified water. These two issues need addressed by the hosts immediately. However I still give them 5 stars. Nice home. Nice people. Nice location. Just those 2 small details and it would have been perfect. Even with the two small issues it was just about perfect. Check it out!
2024-01-01,5,Stayed one night,this is my second stay at this ad . My husband got to come with me this time and we both thoroughly enjoyed it. hoped return this time this time next year
2024-01-01,5,Stayed one night,Dean and Nancy‚Äôs place was just what we needed on a short notice. We only stayed one night and this place had everything we needed. Their place was clean and inviting and affordable especially compared to nearby hotels. Loved all the little touches in decor including the scripture messages. The only negative was the weather was super cold and snowy.
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Despite one ""crazy night"" where the power went out, this was an amazing stay. And even with the night the power went out, it just added to our adventure, plus we couldn't have been more grateful for Nancy and Dean keeping good communication and coming out to help us that night.
Nancy and Dean were so helpful and communicative that we had little to no concerns that we would be taken care of. We're so grateful for you coming to our rescue in the late hours of the night.
We truly enjoyed our stay in your beautiful Bungalow. We will definitely be returning to this place and recommending it to friends and family. Thank you!"

Not only will you fall in love with the charm of this house‚Ä¶ the host is a lovely person who added so many wonderful touches to create a very welcoming and comfortable stay for me and my family!
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I've lost count of how many times I've stayed at the Bungalow at this point, but each time feels like coming home. This space is so charming and welcoming, and Dean and Nancy are wonderful hosts. My recent visit was especially charming as they had put up a Christmas tree to give the space a holiday vibe. That added a little something extra special to my visit during this holiday season. Be sure to check out the guest book during your stay. There are so many beautiful stories from past guests who have shared special moments and memories in the home on their travels. It may be a small home, but it clearly holds a big piece of so many hearts‚Äîmine included."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"The country bungalow is absolutely wonderful! A beautiful, peaceful property with amazing hosts! Dean and Nancy were kind enough to let us host Christmas with our Grandkids in their beautiful home! They had it decorated for Christmas, including a beautiful tree! The home is so warm and cozy, I really didn‚Äôt want to leave.
They pay attention to all the little details that show they truly care about their guests! The bedding was fantastic, and provided a much needed nights rest! The kitchen is beautifully updated and well stocked with everything you need!
I cannot say enough good things about this home or the hosts!

Dean and Nancy are such sweet and kind hosts. we will definitely be staying here again :)
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We booked Dean and Nancy's place for a quick girl's trip, and it was perfect! The bungalow was so cute and tidy, and it was the perfect cozy home to relax and unwind in. The kitchen was stocked with everything you'd need to cook a meal, and the bathroom and bedrooms had many small details that were so thoughtful! It is a 15-minute drive into downtown Fort Wayne, so if you want to spend time there it takes some planning. But it's worth it to stay at such a great place!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Dean and Nancy were the perfect hosts and their lovely cottage was simply fantastic! The place is beautifully decorated, spotlessly clean, and extremely cozy. It had everything we needed for a perfect getaway, with thoughtful extras and a helpful welcome binder that included detailed instructions for the cottage and local tourist recommendations. We felt right at home and can‚Äôt wait to return. Highly recommended!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The cottage is perfect for a peaceful getaway. It is super cozy and you feel right at home. I didn‚Äôt want to leave this little peace of heaven .
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We had a girls‚Äô weekend at the Bungalow and had such a relaxing time. The bungalow is just adorable and had everything we needed! What a gem of a getaway in Ft Wayne! Would absolutely stay again!

2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We love this place! This was our second year to visit its the true definition of a home away from home!
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We spent 2 nights at Dean & Nancy‚Äôs and as soon as we arrived, we felt right at home. Everything was so beautiful and clean. The property was large and the landscaping gorgeous. We stayed there as a little getaway before and after we got married at Union 12 right down the road. It was such a relief to come back to the Airbnb and relax after a long day. It gave us so much inspiration for things to do in our own home. I would recommend Dean & Nancy‚Äôs to anyone. Even if you live in the area and just need a little staycation, this is the place to go üòä"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,It doesn‚Äôt get any better than Dean and Nancy‚Äôs beautiful cottage.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,Dean & Nancy are wonderful hosts! I had the pleasure of meeting them in person. Their Bungalow is charming & very dog friendly. I loved the thoughtful touches throughout the property. It felt like a home away from home. I would highly recommend if you are visiting the Ft. Wayne area!
2023-09-01,5,Stayed about a week,"For a country feel close to the city this is the perfect, adorable, and picturesque home. It was clean, tastefully decorated, and the perfect size for what we needed for our week stay. Highly recommended home and superb hosts, a must stay for anyone traveling through or wanting to stay for a bit. We will be back again."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"What a beautiful bungalow! Very clean and the d√©cor was very nice. Felt like being at home. So cozy and comfortable. We enjoyed being out in the country and enjoying the country air, but close enough to get to a grocery store or other stores if needed in minutes. If back in the area, we would love staying here again, 100%."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"It was another peaceful, beautiful visit. Thank you Dean and Nancy for a lovely stay."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This was our second time staying at the bungalow. Love the location. Close to most stores/restaurants but yet set in a beautiful country setting. Comfortable beds and bedding. The reverse osmosis is really nice. Since our last visit they had added an adorable seating area outside along the large black building for the bungalow guests. And, also a picnic style table next to the bungalow. Great place to have coffee or evening cocktails. Everything was clean. Our pup enjoyed the yard as much as we did. Things to note; the owners may stop by sporadically and enter the basement area for their prep/cleaning work for a tiny home they have on the property. So, you will hear them come and go but was no bother to us. Also, check out was 1 hour earlier than most other Airbnbs for some reason. So, make sure you confirm before booking that this is ok for your schedule. We prefer 11 am check out when it‚Äôs a 4 pm check in. We managed and still had a wonderful visit and hope to stay again."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,It was an amazing stay ! Responsive host and they went above and beyond to make our stay as comfortable as possible .
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"It was everything we expected. Perfect location for our trip. Dean & Nancy gave a lot of attention to the details, offering many extras.
We highly recommend this country bungalow!
Greg & Cindy"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We hate to write an awesome review for this bungalow, because we'd like to keep it all for ourselves! We enjoyed a wonderfully peaceful stay in this lovely home. Nicely decorated and truly filled with all the comforts of home. We've stayed at many airbnbs, this one was very generous with amenities and items to enjoy. Super clean too! We highly recommend and we will certainly return when we revisit Indiana.
This bungalow is a MUST STAY!
PS- Two attractions we recommend in the area, the Fort Wayne Zoo and the Sweetwater Performance Pavilion."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"My husband and I booked Dean & Nancys home to celebrate our wedding anniversary. It was such a beautiful location, so peaceful! The home was so clean, bed very comfy! They didn't leave out any details from the yummy treats on the table when we walked in to having ""extra supplies"" if we forgot to bring something. We highly recommend it and would absolutely stay here again if we make it back to Fort Wayne!"

2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,Dean and Nancy‚Äôs bungalow is the perfect place for a getaway. It was beautifully decorated and felt homey and cozy.

2023-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Our hearts needed a getaway and The Country Bungalow hit the spot! We are already talking about coming back in the spring! We loved the birds, sweet cows across the street, and the stillness of the corn around us! Such a quaint and quiet space for our family to disconnect, relax, and refuel before the craziness of fall begins! We absolutely loved that our precious fur baby, Joy, could stay with us!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We had a wonderful stay at the country bungalow! Dean and Nancy‚Äôs home is very sweetly decorated and the area is so peaceful, though not too far from town! They had some great touches for my dog who was traveling with us, and they go above and beyond for their guests! Would gladly book with them again if we are in the area!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed about a week,"What a sweet place! Out in the country it was so peaceful with the sounds of birds every morning. Set amongst big trees with a well kept yard the home was even better than we could have imagined. Walking inside I felt as if I had stepped into a country design magazine. The bungalow was so adorable and had such comfortable furniture and a pillow soft bed! The kitchen was well stocked with all the utensils, dishes and pans needed to cook a meal. The home was clean an immaculately kept. It was one of, if not the best, vacation rental we've ever had. The owners were quick to answer questions and made sure we had everything we could possibly need. We thoroughly enjoyed our time at the Country Bungalow and we recommend it highly."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"What a lovely stay we had at Dean and Nancy's bungalow! The setting is idyllic amid the corn fields and dairy cows, whom we liked to watch through the giant picture window in the living room. The furniture was comfortable, the place was decorated with all kinds of special touches, and the kitchen was wonderful. We even got to watch the town's July 4th fireworks through one of the other living room windows. We had a perfect view! We likewise enjoyed the outdoor spaces. We may return in the fall (and will be eager to visit the cafe opening up across the street at the dairy farm!). üòÄ"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Dean and Nancy‚Äôs place was comfortable (the queen bed was the best airbnb bed I‚Äôve ever slept in, it was so sturdy!) and homey. It was in a quiet location (but very convenient to get to just about anything in the city), and we loved wandering the property and using the outdoor spaces. Nancy always let me know when she and Dean would be on the property for any reason so we weren‚Äôt surprised, and I thought that was really awesome. Would definitely stay again."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"This bungalow is a beautiful home in a peaceful setting. We especially appreciated the comfortable bed in the butterfly room - so many places we stay have rock solid mattresses, but this one was very plush while still supportive. There has clearly been care taken to make this a special place."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed over a week,"Our stay at The Country Bungalow was one of the best Air BNB stays we've had! The country setting was so peaceful, yet close to anything you need. I joked with Nancy that I might not leave!
The house is so cute and very true to the pictures. Dean and Nancy have thought of everything you could possibly need. They were wonderful hosts and very responsive to any questions we had.

2023-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,We throughly enjoyed our stay at this lovely bungalow. We had driven for 10 hours in heat and traffic and were exhausted when we arrived; it was so easy to get into the property due to good instructions. The property was cool: the air conditioning had been turned on as the hosts had anticipated our probable need to cool down after 90+ degree heat. The entire bungalow was immaculate. Everything looked and felt so cozy. The decorating was right out of a magazine. We had a dog and he was able to enjoy the well manicured yard. We all slept well and were refreshed for another days full drive. We definitely would recommend this property. Our only regret is we couldn‚Äôt stay there for more than one night.
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,Dean and Nancy were absolutely wonderful! There place was so cute and put together so well. If you‚Äôre looking for a peaceful and cozy getaway this is the place.
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,Dean and Nancy‚Äôs sweet Bungalow is exactly what me and my husband needed. We wanted to come back to somewhere quiet after being at a concert. Dean and Nancy literally thought of everything that someone might have forgotten. I myself forgot my phone charger! But no worries they had chargers of all kinds there! Our only regret is that we didn‚Äôt get to stay longer. We cannot say enough good things about this Bungalow and Dean and Nancy‚Äôs hospitality.

2023-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"My parents (& 3 doggies) came in from out of state to visit me and my family. Dean & Nancy‚Äôs home was quaint, quiet and the perfect amount of room for them for the long weekend."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Absolutely quaint and beautiful! All the added little touches made us feel special. One night we had a tornado watch and was a little concerned. Dean & Nancy made sure we had access to the basement in the event of a tornado warning.
We loved the wall clock.. it took us back to simpler times growing up. A touch of the past and the luxury of the modern made this place exceed our expectations!
As a matter of fact, we already rebooked!"
2023-04-01,4,Stayed with a pet,Staying at Dean and Nancy's Bungalow was a very nice experience - their home has a lovely kitchen and is decorated in a very attractive manner. I was particularly pleased with how comfortable the bed was as well! The kitchen is very well laid out and the appliances are all new. The living room has a lovely picture window and there were a delightful number of birds to watch at the feeders just outside. We really enjoyed our stay overall and would definitely stay again and/or recommend the bungalow as a great place to stay while visiting the Fort Wayne area.

We had plenty of room for our family of 4 + dog. We would for sure stay here again (and probably will!)."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"The ‚ÄúCountry Bungalow‚Äù was even better than our first visit! Dean and Nancy are perfect hosts, and they are very hands on and prepared the property for our intended use! We were in Fort Wayne visiting our grandson and they left out some cars, Lincoln Logs, puzzles, and books for him to enjoy. We appreciate being allowed to bring our furry friend! Beds and linens are luxurious, and we‚Äôll certainly use the property again on our next visit to Fort Wayne if it is available."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great little old farmhouse. The inside is great. Enjoyed staying here. The cow dairy accross the street is a little smelly but didn't bother me because i was inside the whole time.
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place is one of the best airbnbs we have stayed in. It was so comfortable, homey, and clean. The bed was amazing! I just wanted to stay in bed all day.

2023-02-01,5,Stayed one night,Dean and Nancy had a beautiful bungalow in an amazing location. They were wonderful hosts and go above and beyond for their guests. It was a very peaceful location and we had a very relaxing stay
2023-01-01,5,Stayed with a pet,An absolutely stunning place! You will not be disappointed. Dean and Nancy have made sure every minute detail has been thought about. I think our pup enjoyed the place more than his permanent spot (the best dog bed provided)! Will definitely be back again. Thanks again Dean and Nancy.
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The bungalow was an absolute gem and a wonderful home base for my trip. The home is lovely and situation on a stunning property, not far from amenities but secluded enough you really do feel like you're in a peaceful, rural retreat. Dean and Nancy were not only responsive, but some of the friendliest airbnb hosts I have interacted with on the platform. Can't say enough nice things about this lovely home and hosts‚Äîand very much look forward to a future visit."

It was easy to find and absolutely gorgeous inside. I had my dog with me and greatly appreciated all the small touches for dogs (e.g. food and water bowls, treats, and a bed). If you're in the Ft. Wayne area, I would highly recommend Dean and Nancy's bungalow as a place to stay."

Secondly, the decorating was charming, such detail! Thirdly, the lighting was not that bright overbearing stuff, was luxury and soft for a nice calm visit. All my adult kids felt very comfortable for a visit and loved it! We will definitely be putting this place as our must stay, if available in Fort Wayne. Not to mention the cute tiny home on the other side. Everything is well appointed and has a very cozy welcoming feeling, sleep was great! Very quiet and private as well!"
2022-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"A great place for a quiet, peaceful escape."
2022-12-01,5,Stayed over a week,"Dean & Nancy‚Äôs place is extremely cozy, in fact, it had the most comfortable beds we have slept in. Bedrooms all had very nice bedding and charging cords on bedside tables. The kitchen is packed with all the essentials you could possibly need. The dishes, cutlery, and appliances were all top notch. There were even frosted pint glasses in the freezer. The living room is perfect for reading a book while bird watching through a huge front window. Dean and Nancy thought of every detail, and made our stay a five star experience. Being able to walk the dog through the woods and enjoy a fire pit outside were added treats. We stayed over the Christmas holidays and their property made us feel like we were home away from home. We have stayed at many airbnbs around the world and the Country Cottage ranks as one of our all-time favorites!"
2022-11-01,5,Stayed one night,Beautiful country setting close to shops and restaurants. So much thoughtfulness went into this home as an Airbnb. All the extra touches made us feel right at home. I highly recommend staying here.

2022-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"This house was absolutely perfect for our stay in Fort Wayne. There were four of us going to a wedding at Ceruti's on Innovation Way. The house was just a short distance from the hall, and was perfect for our needs. Dean & Nancy have done a great job making the home comfortable and inviting. The accommodation are superb. The beds were very comfortable. The setting and surroundings were beautiful. A most stay in Fort Wayne.....we loved it."

2022-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"Absolutely love the bungalow! It was a perfect location.

Would definitely recommend and would definitely stay again!!"
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful, quiet, comfortable house surrounded by farms but still just a 10-15 minute drive from downtown. Nancy and Dean are super friendly and helpful and committed to making their guests feel at home. I had a great stay and would gladly return."
2022-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,Dean and Nancy‚Äôs place is the epitome of what Airbnb is. It‚Äôs the warmest and homiest place we‚Äôve ever stayed. It felt like a home away from home for us and the warmest place ever!
2022-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Perfect!
2022-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Oh my- Dean and Nancy are just the most wonderful people. They let you decide how much interaction you want to have with them, but we were more than happy to chat with them every opportunity we could because they are lovely people! The home itself is exactly as it looks in photos and beautiful. They provided everything we needed and more for a month long stay ‚ù§Ô∏è"
2022-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Best place to stay in Fort Wayne!
2022-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Family of three traveling through-it‚Äôs gorgeous and well kept inside, WAY more than enough room. Dean and Nancy have created quite the comfortable and inviting stay we were even a little disappointed it was a single night packing up. Comfortable beds, easy check in, communication, great decor, thoughtful touches we‚Äôve come to expect only outside larger hotels-hospitality to put in a word"
2022-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Wonderful space! Very quiet, and Dean and Nancy go the extra mile to make your experience wonderful."
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My daughter & I were in town to visit with family. We stayed at this cozy bungalow. It was a welcomed , peaceful stay that we needed. We are from Orlando and the hustle and bustle of the big city gets exhausting at times. So, to stay in a peaceful,quiet,country home was just what we needed. The beds were comfy and we loved the updated kitchen. The dining table was perfect for some family card games and lots of laughs. We enjoyed sitting outside under the trees and having coffee in the morning and cocktails in the evening. The location was close to a lot of things yet just out of town enough to enjoy the peace. Dean & Nancy stop in and go through another entrance to basement when they need to get supplies or change out their other rental (tiny shed). They text ahead and let u know. There are clear instructions about which rooms/doors are not to be used by guests. Keypad entry was easy. We didn‚Äôt use the TV much, which is a good thing for me. They had reverse osmosis at kitchen sink. Hall closet had supplies and paper products. Bathroom was stocked. Parking was close to front door with about 2-3 steps on the deck leading into front door. Cute little mud room that I adored welcomes u. There is a dairy farm across the road but we only smelled the ‚Äúdairy-air‚Äù once and it was not too bad. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at the bungalow and hope to return when we come back up for a visit."
2022-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Excellent communication, adorable house, very clean. Little extras were so nice, snacks, soaps, creamer for coffee. Loved the decorations, such a cozy home."
2022-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,Dean and Nancy were amazing! We ran into a few hiccups on our trip in (nothing related to their home or accommodations) and Dean and Nancy were so helpful! They helped us try to find a body shop or mechanic on a Saturday due to us hitting a deer on the way. Overall they are just exceptional people! The house is like you walked into a chip and Joann bungalow. Everything is very simple but also has a sophisticated feel. All of the little detail is there from the snacks left out to the canister in the bathroom with toiletries in case you forgot something! You feel like you are in the middle of the country but you are 7 minutes from Sams and the highway! Definitely a must stay if you are in Fort Wayne!
2022-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Thank you Dean&Nancy for the respite and generous hospitality of your Country Bungalow during a very challenging time for our family! After being hit by a record breaking storm, we were without power during a serious heat wave.
This home was an absolute gift from God. From the moment you enter, you get a sense of calm, peace and retreat. Beautifully designed, spotless, well appointed and elegant. But what sends it over the top are Dean&Nancy!
I now understand what sets apart a super host from the rest. They anticipate your every need before you do. It‚Äôs all there! This home is a luxurious retreat in a beautiful country setting, the beds are very comfortable, the kitchen is well appointed, and the hosts are the best I‚Äôve ever met! I can‚Äôt imagine staying anywhere else in Fort Wayne."
2022-06-01,5,Stayed one night,Great place to stay in Ft Worth! We love this bungalow and the quiet surroundings!
2022-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,We enjoyed the country ambiance with the convenience of the city! The Country Bungalow was comfortable and well suited for our extended family‚Äôs needs. Dean and Nancy were generous hosts and thought of every detail (even providing amazing coffee creamer). We especially enjoyed the movie night in the secret theater room! The night at the firepit should be long remembered for the opportunity to be together around a fire. All and all we were quite content and hope we left your home none the worse for out visit. We would like to visit again if you would have us.
2022-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This was the best Airbnb stay we have ever had. Dean and Nancy have a very nice home that is super clean and comfortable. They thought of everything from the personal note that greeted us upon our arrival to snacks and water bottles on the counter to a container of helpful and typically forgotten items in the bathroom, they covered it all. We really enjoyed our stay in their home and if we return to the area, we will definitely book again. Thank you for letting us borrow your home for a few days, we really enjoyed our stay. Five+ stars!!!"
2021-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"Five stars for everything! So easy to find and check-in, the bed was super comfortable, I had space to lay out clothes and personal belongings.

2020-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"Dean&Nancy did an OUTSTANDING job! I casually brought up that we were staying here for our wedding night and they added extra goodies in our room. Nancy greeted us as we were leaving and congratulated us, and seemed so genuine. Their house was very clean and modern, and we felt very welcome. Overall, our stay was perfect!
Thank you for the amazing night! We would definitely stay again!"
2020-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"Let me just say this felt like I was right at home! They were accommodating right from the start especially with having my boyfriend and I‚Äôs cars there! Super quick booking and relatively cheap especially for our last minute one night booking! They went above and beyond for us! They had towels in the closet, water in the room, the WiFi name and password, shampoo/conditioner as well as body wash, extra items in case you forgot something, snacks in the room for us to snack on and even had a sign in the bedroom welcoming us! Even though we got in late and left before we could get to say hi to the them they showed it through their messages between my boyfriend and I! I would definitely recommend this because it‚Äôs less then a 15 minute drive to the Glenbrook mall and all food locations which was amazing and super convient especially being right off the highway, which made it easy to get too and from their lovely home! I will definitely book again in the future! Amazing people!!"

Jama is a great host and was very responsive and helpful, I would definitely stay at this great place again."
2024-06-01,4,Stayed a few nights,We would stay again! Lovely apartment and location. Matched photos. We are flight attendants and missed some amenities that one would expect from having a kitchen. Simple things we could have used (bowls for morning cereal or aluminum foil for left overs. Those items would expect to see and not have to go buy as it‚Äôs a one time use. There were a couple minor cleaning issues that any hotel would have too (didn‚Äôt find it necessary to bring up to Host). Her instructions were perfect. Felt welcomed with a welcome sign with my name on it. Lovely historical district of Auburn. Would certainly recommend and stay again.

Well stocked kitchen including what you'd need for fixing meals. Great snack options and both tea and coffee selections. This space is above an office space and is architecturally quaint. There was plenty of open space and I didn't feel cramped. My only wish would be for a bigger couch to lounge around on. There was a love seat with a nice ottoman, so that is preference only. I would not recommend this space for children or older people who wouldn't want to navigate the steep stairway. It is a great space for 2 people which is how it is advertised!"

2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,By far one of the best airbnb experience I‚Äôve had. Brian was an amazing host and anyone looking for a place to stay near Auburn should look no further!
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,A cute place with a wonderful outdoor space!!
2024-04-01,5,Stayed about a week,"I stayed her due to my daughter having surgery @ Parkview North,- a 13 minute drive- I literally just slept there and took showers the first 4 days of my stay. Brian and his wife checked in on me to make sure I was doing ok and kept an eye that I had made it back safely at night. I was having a crazy week.
There was a beautiful bouquet of daffodils waiting on the counter and the bed was so comfy and I can't say enough about the place. I would give it 50 stars. If you need a place to crash while family is at Parkview, this is the ticket. Reasonably priced and I wish I had been able to set out on the patio and watch their cows and horses on their farm behind the house. That rooster sure let me know he was there every day lol.
Thanks again! You and Lauren are Rock star hosts."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Brian was such a wonderful host. He was very generous and his home was carefully constructed to meet every guests need!! Loved the location and the atmosphere of his home was so classic and clean. Thank you for the wonderful stay and we will definitely be rebooking!!
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Perfect location near Fort Wayne! Loved watching the horses! Great patio!
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,.
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We arrived to a cute, cozy clean cottage - surrounded by the local horses from the vet clinic! The cottage is cute - and I love the kitchen (which makes it easy to prep for the adventures we had planned). We were there for the Bluegrass Festival (held at the fairgrounds - only a few miles away) - close to shopping, restaurants, and town... but far enough we felt the taste of being in the country! We will certainly be back - thanks Ann!!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Had a lovely little getaway at Ann's. Very cozy. My yappie yorkie fit right in with the neighboring kennel. Don't let the kennel scare you off...there was no barking after bedtime or before 7;30 in the morning. Enjoyed the windmill museum, Bixler Lake Park and Don Chicos...they even let me bring my yorkie into the bar for lunch.
Martha"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"The farm atmosphere was just right for us! Wonderful settings, quite and very accommodating. We sure wanted to stay longer, but next time......."

2024-02-01,4,Stayed with a pet,"This is an overall nice place to stay. A bit outdated but if you are only there for a place to lay your head, this is a good pick. I would warn other guests that there is a dog kennel next door and the dogs bark all throughout the day."

2024-01-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Loved the place. So cute and had everything I needed for my stay. Just be aware of the nearby boarding kennel... dogs bark early. :)
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Super cute, cozy, and pet friendly! Close to town, but far enough out to have peace and quiet. Room to roam with the fur babies! Had a great stay. Had direct contact with host if needed."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Quaint spot for an overnight on our way home for the holidays. It was a little more suburban than expected but did the job. We enjoyed seeing the horses and there was plenty of space to walk the dog we which appreciated.
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Quick stopover on our way home from the holidays, but couldn‚Äôt have asked for a more peaceful & comfortable spot for us and our dogs. Exactly as described. Would definitely stay again when we make the holiday drive."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Great stay overall! Definitely an older house with older furniture, but it did just the trick for what we needed. Decent, cozy stay overall though. The shower was great and the property was beautiful."

2023-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,Loved it!

It was clean and had everything we needed.
The shower was extremely nice !The shower head was amazing!
Ann was very nice and friendly. We accidently left clothes there when we left and Ann was very nice and mailed them to us."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We loved staying at Ann‚Äôs place, it was truly a home away from home. Her place was clean and cosy with everything we needed. The location is amazing, on the grounds of a working horse farm and only about a mile from restaurants, grocery stores and other conveniences while still feeling like you‚Äôre in the middle of nowhere."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,Loved the horses and the house

2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,got a email from owner saying home was ready for stay earlier then expected and was greeted with fresh cut flowers.

2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"It is a beautiful, clean place in the country. It was easy to find and ease of access. Ann responded to any of my texts with quick responses."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Ann‚Äôs place near this horse ranch was magical. You could stay inside the beautiful, well-appointed house or you could hang on the big porch and watch the beautiful landscape. I took a walk all around the area and it was so peaceful. It‚Äôs not too far from normal amenities like grocery stores and places to stock up. The home feels just perfectly far away if you are coming from the city or a bustling area. Also you get to pet horses if you‚Äôre lucky! Highly recommend."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"Absolutely wonderful place to stay on our trip. The place was clean and cozy. It was a delight to wake up and be treated to an awesome view of horses outside your windows. We didn‚Äôt get a chance to take full advantage of all of the amenities as we had a short stay, we were only there for one evening and out by morning, but for an air bnb, this was a top tier place to stay.
I highly recommend this to anyone looking for a stay in the Fort Wayne area."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Peaceful location yet close to town. Loved seeing the horses right off the porch.
Spent a day driving around Amish country which was beautiful. The house was very nice and neat. Large bedroom. Nice front porch. Would stay again."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,Came here with my 10 year old horse-loving granddaughter. She loved talking to and petting the horses and cats in the barns. We rode horses at Pokagon State Park & enjoyed the public beach on Bixler Lake.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We had a great stay at Ann's place in Kendalville. We stayed just one night while driving through the area, and chose the location because we were traveling with our pup. The home is cozy and charming, and the location is beautiful and peaceful. Ann was responsive and helpful. There was lots of area for walking the dog, though no off-leash area. There was a dog boarding center between the home and the road, and we would occasionally hear dogs barking, but it was not disturbing for us or our pup. We would definitely stay again."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Always a good stay. We highly recommend this place!
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The house was very clean and comfortable. It was exactly as pictured. We would definitely gonack if we are up that way again.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Ann was very kind, friendly and easy going about everything. She was very accommodating about my screw up in booking and was easy to work with.

We had a wonderful stay, which was so delightful that I am looking forward to booking another one to two night stay for a long weekend getaway in the future. The surrounding countryside is absolutely beautiful especially if you‚Äôre coming from the city. It‚Äôs tranquil and relaxing outside in the countryside and inside the cottage. This is definitely a place to come to if you want to get away from the hustle and bustle of life."
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Ann is one of the most responsive hosts getting us items we needed & making sure we are set. The place had cute holiday touches which we loved & was very comfortable. Highly recommend this place during your travels.

2022-09-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Farm stay, horses about, cozy farmhouse for a stay. WiFi had a few hiccups but worked most of the time. Easy to explore the area from here. We stayed here while our RV was being worked on nearby. Host very friendly."

2022-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Exactly as described ~ a pretty, one bedroom home on a large acre of farm land. Great getaway for peace and relaxation. Ann has flowers and lavender pushes planted in front which create a soothing aroma. Place was tidy and spacious, had the cutest small table and chairs on front porch to sit and take in the landscape. My fianc√© and I were road-tripping across country so ended up doing a load of laundry there, extremely easy to use and cabinets were filled with detergent & dryer sheets. From the kitchen window you can see horses off to the side. Would highly recommend!"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed one night,This was a very nice place to stay. It's a relaxing environment and comfortable accommodations.
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"It was very peaceful, there is a dog kennel close by but we only heard them a couple times and it didn't bother us as we are animal lovers. Very friendly horses and they were a joy to see. The house was clean and cozy. Ann even put fresh flowers in vases and left us some chocolates. I would recommend."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Clean and as advertised, Thanks Ann!"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Beautiful place in a great location. Ann was perfect with communication and recommendations.

2022-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Wonderful home and great accommodation for horses! We were traveling from the East Coast and needed an overnight layover on our way to Utah. Ann had everything ready for us, including a freshly mowed pasture with shelter for our gelding!
Thank you Ann!"
2022-06-01,5,Stayed one night,So picturesque. So comfy. Loved being around all the horses. Would definitely stay again.
2022-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This was a quaint country home that had all the amenities one could ask for including a washer and dryer and a TV that you could hook up your Netflix with. Beautiful pictures and captivating safari photos hung from the walls. The bedroom was tastefully decorated with an antique desk, quilted bed and beautiful crystal / glass lamps. There is running water, a stove, and a large fridge, not to mention a front porch. Everything was clean. The property was spacious and farther away it was dotted with friendly horses swishing their tails. A really nice place to walk leashed pets too. Ann‚Äôs place is highly recommended for nature lovers or people who are just looking to get away. This place is a great relaxing stress reliever with wonderful scenery!"
2022-05-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Great home! Horses were beautiful to see everyday and Ann is an exceptional host!
2022-05-01,4,Stayed with a pet,Really enjoyed our stay.

2022-05-01,5,Stayed one night,Wonderful place to stay! Everything you need and very comfortable.
2022-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"Ann's place was quiet, bigger than we expected, and very clean. You're just outside of town, a two minute drive away. There was clearly more exploring to be done as far as the property her Airbnb sits on, and the surrounding countryside. We wish we had had more time to check things out, but we only stayed for a night, however it was a very restful night. We would absolutely stay here again in the future."
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I‚Äôd highly recommend this place. It was cute, cozy, and clean. Close to town if you needed anything. Ann was a great host and very easy to communicate with. If we are ever visiting nearby again we will definitely be back here!"
2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The place is a great little getaway close to everything but in a country setting!!

The little touches she offered on our stay their was amazing. I would definitely come again and highly recommend for anyone in the future.
2022-04-01,4,Stayed a few nights,It was a quaint little home. Perfectly sized for two people. The most difficult thing was that it is located right next to a dog boarding and grooming business. The dogs (probably 20) were out barking by 7 AM and were in and out until at least 10 PM. Might not be an issue for most people.
2022-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Very nice place to stay. Close to town but you still felt like you were out in the country. We very much enjoyed our stay.
2022-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Dog kennel up front. Dogs are awake pretty early
2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The accommodations were just right for me and my husband. Enjoyed the sights and the smells! Ann is a very thoughtful host!
2022-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"The Stable View Home was just the peaceful getaway we needed. If you love the outdoors, calm, and beautiful farm sunsets/sunrises, this is the place for you. Ann is a phenomenal host who gave us exactly what we needed: a cozy place to rest and rejuvenate."
2022-02-01,5,Stayed about a week,"We stayed at Ann's property for a week. It was blisteringly cold week but the baseboards kept us warm through the week. The speed of the available Internet is about 15 Mbps downs. It doesn't sound a lot but it was sufficient for my remote work, teleconference, and Zoom calls. With Ann's kitchen amenities, we were able to cook mostly throughout the week. Unfortunately, because of the weather, we didn't enjoy the view of the horses. Due to slow accumulation, Ann also cleaned up off the porch one night. Nice of her to do that."
2022-02-01,5,Stayed over a week,Great stay!! Would recommend.
2021-11-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Host is a great communicator, very accommodating. Check-in and check-out were quick and simple.

2021-11-01,5,Stayed one night,host was quick to respond to my inquiries and even let us check in early! home was vry clean and well kept. would stay here again. thank you
2021-10-01,5,Stayed over a week,Beautiful place love the horses
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The Stable View home was tidy, well stocked, and very welcoming. While the space looks small from the outside, I wish my bedroom at home had this much space and storage options! The kitchen had most basic necessities and we cooked almost every meal there.
The wifi worked great all weekend. And I‚Äôll certainly repeat everyone else and say it‚Äôs nice to see horses directly out the windows and the property is very beautiful.
Having a nice in-unit washer and dryer was such a nice bonus for a vacation rental. The ability to travel home with clean folded clothes is great."
2021-10-01,5,Stayed one night,Very clean and spacious with a comfy bed and nice shower. Everything you would need in the kitchen. The horses are lovely to boot.
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This place is very peaceful! If you are looking for a relaxing getaway this is the perfect option! Very cozy!
2021-09-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Cute and quaint little home where you can gaze at beautiful horses. Ann was a very responsive and helpful host. The only downside is that there is a dog boarding facility close by and the dogs come out barking early in the morning. Other than that, this is a great place to escape to in small town Indiana. Overall, great experience!"
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,beautiful get away. clean and enjoyable.
2021-09-01,5,Stayed one night,Exactly as described. Shower was nice and big and bed was comfortable. Checkin was super easy and communication made renting a breeze
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Ann's place was absolutely charming. we enjoyed seeing the horses while sitting by the fire and spending time in her cozy home. I highly recommend her place if you need to get away to a nice quiet home.

2021-09-01,5,Stayed one night,Would definitely recommend

2021-09-01,5,Stayed one night,Exactly what I was expecting! Cozy and perfect for a little get-away.
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful property and area overall! The bathroom and kitchen have all the basic needs for a weekend or longer stay. Ann was great and had suggestions for food and things to do near the area. Very quiet area, you‚Äôre surrounded by friendly horses. Amazing stargazing at night by the fire pit. Would love to stay here again!"
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Cute place, shower is amazing. Loved seeing the horses."
2021-08-01,4,Stayed one night,"Great spot if travelling with pets, but found the mosquitos unbearable and the dog kennel caddycorner to the property extremely loud and got my dogs all riled up. Also was surprised that the business has people/customers parked and interacting right in front of the Airbnb, which was unnerving. But otherwise, the property itself was well appointed and comfortable, with a comfy bed and nice amenities. Also recommend bringing bottled water- the water has a sulfur smell and no working filtered drinking water on site."
2021-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"Description is accurate. Fun to see the horses. Nice place, we would stay there again."
2021-08-01,5,Stayed one night,We had a wonderful time! The house is nice and very clean. The horses are friendly and they add a nice touch to the peaceful atmosphere.

We loved and definitely recommend it."
2021-08-01,4,Stayed one night,"Pay attention to the property description.
Described very well. Dogs do bark and animals need fed. Very nice place and cool shower."
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Home, Home on the Range!
This house was just perfect for my husband and I and our dog to unwind and get away from the city. The house itself has everything you need to relax, watch Netflix, Prime, etc. (need your own accounts for those), cook your own meals if you wish and relax on the porch. There are several horses on the property including two grey beauties very close to the house. Across the way is a huge field that was alight with fireflies while we were there. The bedroom is huge and the bed was comfy for our needs with nice quality bedsheets too. Bathroom very modern and nice.
The location is only about a 5 minute drive to a major grocery and other basic needs plus a small lake but also a 20-40 minute drive to many fun other small towns to explore. These country roads are picturesque, hilly and peaceful. Ann was a true delight as a host. Highly recommend and we're already planning to come back for longer next time.
PS - Be aware that there is a dog boarding facility nearby and they let the dogs out a few times a day so there is some barking during those times. However, as dog lovers, this was not a problem for us. :)"
2021-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"Ann's, Place is charming. Perfect for me for traveling. It was nice to have a washer and dryer to use.

There were fresh cut flowers throughout the house and everything was tidy.
Anne was very attentive and willing to help. She provided great suggestions for the local hiking spots.
We enjoyed a pleasant weekend getaway!"
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This is a lovely home in a relaxing environment. Loved seeing the horses every time we walked out the front door. The design of the shower is also very cool.
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Lovely cottage with very pretty furnishings and all needed items. Fireflies. I love the porch. and I was so happy to have several options of nearby lakes to paddle my kayak. Bixler lake was just 5 minutes away. A√±n responded quickly to messages.

Overall, we had a fantastic time."
2021-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This Airbnb is a delight inside and out. Aside from the horses, there are hundreds of magical fireflies!"
2021-07-01,5,Stayed one night,Just beautiful! Comfy bed and beautiful bathroom. The lavender was in full bloom which was a treat. We'll be back!
2021-07-01,4,Stayed about a week,The location was perfect for me. I found everything clean and very homey. While I wasn't there very much it was the perfect location for myself to sleep at night. Location was quiet and close enough to stores and restaurants.
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great value and close proximity to Kendalville and Rome City.
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We love this spot, and Ann is an amazing host. The bathroom is newly renovated, and the pictures of the porch don‚Äôt do it justice. This was our second time staying at The Stable House, and it won‚Äôt be our last!"
2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place! Thoroughly enjoyed our stay!
2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We started here for a nearby wedding over the weekend. It was a cute little house, clean and well-kept.

2021-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,We really enjoyed our stay. If you have a child has a horse enthusiast this is a place to stay.
2021-05-01,3,Stayed about a week,"Overall, we had a nice relaxing week on the horse farm. It was very nice to be able to walk outside in the morning and see the horses. Some things in the house could have been improved. The dishwasher didn‚Äôt work and the water pressure in the kitchen sink was not strong, so it made washing dishes a real pain. Also, we found dishes, utensils, and pans that were not washed. Someone had stuck a frying pan back in the cabinet after making eggs, and we had to scrape food off of a spatula that we found thrown into a random drawer in the kitchen that had other non-food related items in there (like gorilla tape.) The floors also didn‚Äôt seem to have been cleaned for a long time; our white socks turned black after only walking around for a few minutes. It wasn‚Äôt a horrible stay, but definitely would have been a lot better had the place been cleaned properly."
2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The house is exactly as advertised, check in is easy, and it's fun to look out the window and see horses. It's the perfect getaway from city life! And the nearby town has everything you might need."

The owners were very easy to communicate with, happy to help out and eager to make our stay enjoyable. I would highly recommend this location and am looking forward to going back again. The highlight for my six-year-old was the fancy shower (weird child, I know‚Äîit IS a nice shower though!) And an overall highlight was being able to ‚Äúvisit‚Äù with the horses and see a baby horse/mother combo. All around enjoyable."
2021-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What a fun place to stay! The little house was perfect for our family and we loved walking around the land, looking at the horses, and watching the dogs across from our front door. Ann was very responsive and a welcoming host, willing to offer local tips. We enjoyed a hike at Bixler Lake and Tasty‚Äôs Donuts while we were in town, as well! Will definitely look to stay here again if we are back in the area."

2021-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,peaceful
2021-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Cute house on the property of a vet. House was well furnished, functional, and clean. Sits on a large property with lots of space to walk around. The horse pastures right outside the house are nice and are unique to the place. We didn‚Äôt find the bed particularly comfortable but it didn‚Äôt detract from the experience. Overall, a super nice place in a great location. If you like horses this place is for you"

2021-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Ann's place was a great place to stay. My daughterand I stayed 3 nights while playing in a homeschool basketball tournament in Ft. Wayne. It was so nice to come back there at the end of day. Was so relaxing and peaceful. We were able to cook some meals and throw stinky basketball uniform in washer to be clean and ready for next day's games. The horses were so enjoyable and relaxing to watch in the mornings and at the end of day. Ann makes it a home away from home. She left cookies for us and there were soft throws to cuddle up with a good book to read. My daughter said she would liked to have stayed forever. We loved it and hope to return again soon.
2021-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Ann was a great host! The place was just as we expected and we had everything we needed. If we visit the area again, we will look at coming back here. It was in a good location, close to anything we needed, and a good price. Ann was very responsive and had great communication."
2021-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Ann‚Äôs place is so cute and homey! She left us a little plate of valentines cookies and they were super yummy! She is very responsive and will work with you if you need a sooner check-in or later check-out!
2021-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is our first Airbnb stay and we will most definitely be chowing to stay at these over Hotels when we travel now. This place is clean, quiet and quaint! Many special decorating and thoughtful touches throughout! The bonus of being surrounded by horses was what made it super special! The awesome homemade goodies made us feel special while we were having alone time for our 24th Wedding Anniversary! We will definitely be frequenting this Airbnb and would highly recommend!"
2021-01-01,4,Stayed one night,"Close to where we needed to be, clean space."
2021-01-01,4,Stayed one night,"Picturesque scenery and a wonderful stay. Ann‚Äôs place was clean and had cute touches! I felt very comfortable. There was a small snafu with check-in communication, but, things happen. I don‚Äôt believe this to be the norm. I had a fabulous stay. Would definitely stay again!"
2021-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"The cabin so cozy and very clean. The furniture is nice and comfy. Many little touches throughout like blankets to curl up with and plants for decoration. My pup Bear and I had a really nice getaway. Viewing the horses and walking around was lovely. If visiting during the winter, consider bringing some slippers as the floor can be chilly. Also if you are a lover of a softer bed, you might bring something squishy to sleep on. Overall a great find and I recommend it."
2021-01-01,5,Stayed one night,Staying here was fantastic! The place was very clean and cozy. Being able to walk around the property and see the horses was a plus!

2020-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Ann‚Äôs house was very quaint and clean. She had the place decorated for Christmas which was so nice and brought us fresh baked Xmas cookies. We loved our stay and would highly recommend Ann‚Äôs house. If you like horses it is an added bonus!
2020-12-01,5,Stayed one night,Ann's place is really comfortable and located in a serene and quiet area. They made the house feel very cozy (including with Christmas decorations!) and laid out everything you could possibly need while staying there. We loved staying there and would definitely return if we pass through the area!
2020-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"Wonderful spacious home, very clean, and was even decorated for the holidays. Great communication from our host."
2020-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"We were so grateful to Ann for accommodating us last minute, and we weren't disappointed.

2020-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"Clean, easy place to stay on our road trip. Would recommend!"
2020-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Ann's place was wonderful. Perfect for our weekend away! It was relaxing to wake up around the fields and horses. She even put up Christmas decorations to add to the cozy feel of the whole home.
2024-06-01,5,Stayed over a week,Connie was a great host! The place was spotless and cozy!
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Connie‚Äôs place is cozy & quiet. The perfect location for visiting family & friends on NE Indiana/NW Ohio area. Everything was exactly as described and better. I‚Äôve already recommended to other family members. I will definitely stay again
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,It was great! Connie was very responsive!
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place was a very cute place to bring my wife for our 15th Wedding Anniversary. She was very pleased with my choice of stay. While inside, you would think you were at a very expensive, ""uptown"" place. The decor was fantastic. We spent most of our time in Auburn, only 9 minutes away. The drive through the fields and neighborhoods was beautiful. Connie was VERY responsive to our emails and questions. Thanks so much, we will be back for another ""little get-a-way""."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"I travel a lot for work, and this was one of the very best places I‚Äôve ever stayed. Connie‚Äôs place was absolutely immaculate! I could tell there was a lot of thought given to storage for a traveler, places to sit, bathroom accessories and more. There were two TVs, so if you were in the kitchen area, you could continue watching."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"Really cute, exceptionally clean unit. Would absolutely stay here again!!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"We thoroughly enjoyed our overnight stay. It was peaceful, quiet and the amenities were perfect for what we needed. A very clean, comfortable and modern room. Thank you for a wonderful stay."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Connie is a wonderful host. the check in and check out were super clear. we got in late and had no trouble at all getting in and settled. Connie's place matched the description as described. we felt at home at her place, although if driving at night you can easily pass the turn off as it is back from the road a ways. it was peaceful and quiet, the rail way you could hear but it wasn't invasive. all the amenities were present even some I wasn't expecting like certain toiletries (tooth brush, razor, mouth wash, first aid kit) those were a wonderful touch as even hotels don't usually supply those (unless your abroad)... Connie was super responsive and friendly and even offered local recommendations for things to checkout. we were going to be in ft. Wayne for our trip and this place was perfect for a weekend get away in a quiet town, the locals were very polite and friendly, and the food was great. You're close enough to a bigger town if you want things to do but far away enough for peace."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I really enjoyed my stay here. I could tell a lot of time and effort was spent designing this little piece of heaven.. I will gladly return in the future!
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Connie's place is a gem if you are traveling long distance and it is on the way. It's beautifully decorated and well designed with everything you need at your fingertips: well equipped kitchen, nice size bath, sitting area, comfortable bed, lovely linens, lots of organized shelving and hanging space for your things to be out of the way, plug in areas for your electronics, small desk, and very welcoming. If you are bringing your pet, there is spacious back yard area for walking and the suite is well insulated so noise is not a problem. Waterloo is a small town that is apparently a train stop center and the area is replete with trucks so the surroundings lack restaurants and adjoining property is nothing to write home about. Just bring your food with you or stop in nearby city to eat. There are rooms in another building on the property that look more ordinary than the suite, but it was very quiet; people seemed to arrive after 4pm and leave before 7am. Very near the interstate."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,It was our second stay and we will come back! Connie is so friendly and helpful. She has thought of anything you might need. The room is impeccably clean and designed and decorated perfectly.
2023-09-01,3,Stayed one night,"Room smelled of smoke, walls were very thin (we could hear snoring from the other suite), a lot of light and noise came in from outside"
2023-09-01,4,Stayed one night,place was just like the pictures and the view of the old barn/shed out of the kitchen window was so quaint! I did have to leave the fan on all night and lay my head at the opposite end of the bed because of the snoring next door. Easy access right off the interstate so that was helpful too.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,Connie was so helpful! Beautiful place!
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay. Will be staying again in the future.

2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great place to stay and exactly as listed! It‚Äôs was perfectly decorated and the bed was very comfortable.
I would stay here again when in the area."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Connie is a wonderful host. She was very easy to get in contact with and very nice and helpful. The place was very comfortable and clean. We will definitely stay there again...
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"WHAT A GEM in seemingly the middle of nowhere - but actually close to Chain-O-Lakes State Park, a Buffalo Reserve, and even a Windmill Museum.
Host is LOVELY and super responsive and accommodating.
This location is on a noisy state road, but among MANY thoughtful touches throughout‚Ä¶ as soon as you walk in you see a white noise machine provided‚Ä¶ worked great and has an amazing sleep!!
They have obviously worked VERY hard on renovating this unique property and adjacent dwellings.
Thank you so much for your excellent hospitality üíô"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,Everything was great. No complaints. Tip top shape.

2023-02-01,5,Stayed over a week,excellent place I was there for a month and Connie was always on the lookout
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Our second stay at Connie's place was just a wonderful as the first. Perfect! We will be back again next year!
2022-07-01,5,Stayed over a week,"I was bringing my new husband to meet my extended family and to introduce him to the area in which I had grown up, so was looking for something homier than a hotel for our stay. I had thought we might need to look in Fort Wayne, but I was pleasantly surprised to find an Airbnb in my old hometown of Waterloo.
As soon as we walked into the suite, we knew we had made the right choice. It was beautifully appointed and full of amenities to make it feel cozy and comfortable. We had a hard time saying goodbye to the place after our week and a half came to an end!
Connie, too, was an excellent host. She was super responsive, and regularly checked in to see if we had all we needed--while always being respectful of our privacy. We will definitely try to stay here the next time we are in the Waterloo area!
Highly, highly recommend."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"Couldn‚Äôt be more happy about the stay, wonderful host. Thanks for a great stop Connie."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This is a wonderful little spot to stay in Waterloo. We stayed for three nights while visiting family in the area. The pictures are very accurate. It's a great, modern space that's perfect for two people. Lots of storage. Two Roku TVs for your entertainment needs. Shower is a walk-in which we prefer over a tub. Auburn is just six miles away for your dining or shopping needs. Connie was very easy to communicate with. We plan to come back here during our next visit to the area."
2022-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"After driving for 625 miles on our way to Canada we had the pleasure of staying at this delightful Airbnb. Since we were traveling with our dog it was important to find a place that was dog friendly. The Lighthouse Inn and Suites was this place! Connie has thought of everything a traveler would need. The little details were spot on! The lighting by the bed, the luxurious bedding, the kitchen and bathroom amenities‚Ä¶the list goes on. Thanks Connie!"
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This little AirBnB is a wonderful little gem. Though there is not much to do in Waterloo, per se, it is close enough to Angola, Auburn, and Pokagon State Park. If you want a clean, quiet, private place to getaway too, this place is perfect.
Connie does a terrific job of communicating with her guests and has well-equipped this AirBnB with just about anything that you may need. This is the second time my wife and I have stayed in this AirBnB and have greatly enjoyed our stay both times."
2022-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Absolutely adorable place! Super clean, comfortable and quiet. Spacious and has everything you can possibly need. Our dog loved running around in their big yard too!"
2022-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"My husband and I went on a last minute get away for our anniversary. Waterloo Indiana was definitely not a place we thought we would end up, however we are so glad we did.
The beautiful little cottage feel, the beautiful decor on the inside, the comfortable bed and furniture and the quiet serenity of the neighborhood. The entire package was get away we never new we needed.
Connie even gifted us with a tasty glass of wine to celebrate.
We can not wait to come back and stay for another quick getaway for us both, or maybe just a night away for mama herself.
I feel so blessed to have found such a great place"
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"A beautiful, comfortable and relaxing place to stay. Connie obviously put a lot of thought into what guests might need during their stay. Check in and communication was easy. Location was perfect for my needs. I liked it so much I added a day to my stay."
2022-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,This a nice quite stay.
2022-06-01,5,Stayed one night,This place is absolutely adorable. I've stayed at a lot of airbnbs and this was the best designed small space!! Connie also was so sweet and stocked the fridge with drinks and even left us some fresh picked strawberries! Everything we needed was there and I felt right at home.
2022-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Connie was super communicative leading up to our stay which was greatly appreciated as we were unfamiliar with the area. The space was immaculate and so well thought out. We would definitely stay again should we find ourselves in the area. Thank you!

2022-06-01,5,Stayed one night,Our stay was great! We stayed here for our wedding night and it was the perfect little one night get away. Everything was super clean and comfortable! It was all well stocked and check-in/out was really easy. We would stay here again given the chance!
2022-06-01,4,Stayed with a pet,Great cute little place that was well taken care of. We only stayed 1 night as we were just passing through. Connie was an accommodating host who stayed in communication and walked us through any of our questions. Connie made the place a very homey feel that made the whole experience much more quaint and personalized than your run of the mill hotel stay.
2022-05-01,5,Stayed one night,Beutiful cozy spot to relax and unwind very clean and so cute!! Amazing amenties we will deff be staying here again!!
2022-05-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"A great space to enjoy the area! Looks tiny from the outside but the inside is quite spacious and very well put together. Tons of storage to get unpacked, and it has all the necessities! Connie was very communicative and we had no issues at all. It is right along the highway, so if street noise bothers you it might not be the best fit.
Overall the location was perfect for us and we would love to stay again!"
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Absolutely beautiful and clean suite!!
2022-05-01,5,Stayed one night,Very clean adorable efficiency. Better than a hotel. Visit Lake James. Such a beautiful area.
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Connie was amazing. I needed a space to work on some large work projects and her space was perfect for what I needed. Her communication was amazing and the room was so nicely decorated and well kept. It was an absolutely lovely stay and I will definitely be keeping it in mind if I ever need anymore getaways to get work done.

2022-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Connie was very sweet and helpful. She even left us a bottle of wine for our anniversary. It was obvious that a lot of thought went into the decorating and layout of the unit. Reading lights, a hamper in the bathroom, umbrellas and many other things that made the unit feel cozy and homey. It was a wonderful weekend getaway."

2022-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"My wife and I have stayed at quite a few places through Air B&B, and this is definitely one of the best. Self check-in was easy, the room was extremely clean, and communication was top-notch. The room was very well stocked with everything to make our stay comfortable. Lots of bathroom items, a very well-stocked kitchen (utensils, coffee, milk, snacks, etc.), and a very comfortable bed and sitting area. We will absolutely be going back when we‚Äôre in the Angola/Auburn area."
2022-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Really enjoyed this bnb! Everything was new, clean and meticulously set up. Very cute place. Would be tight with more than 2 adults. But perfect for a stay cation or get-away! I‚Äôd pick this any day over a hotel!!"

2021-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"Connie's place is beautiful and she was an awesome host; she responded quickly, and even made sure we had parking for our large vehicle on short notice. The place was exceptionally clean, she had plenty of storage space for our luggage on the shoe/coat rack and in the closet. There were plenty of kitchen utensils, drinks and snacks. The bathroom also had more than enough towels, rags, and toiletries. Love that there were even pots and seasonings to cook. Cleaning supplies, napkins and paper towels were also accessible, which was nice. We drove from upstate New York back to our home in Iowa, and were able to get a great nights sleep, the bed was very comfortable! We took advantage of the complimentary coffee before getting back on the road. Would definitely recommend to our family and friends driving out to visit us. This is the perfect half way point for our trip, so we love Connie's place!"
2021-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Exceeded all our expectations!
2021-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This airbnb is as beautiful as the pictures portray and Connie is just as wonderful. My family stayed over Christmas and even though Connie was busy with her own holiday she was gracious and attentive. I cannot recommend this location enough!
2021-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"FANTASTIC PLACE! Connie is a superb host! Absolutely spot on everything! Extremely personal sending you messages before your check in, during your stay and afterwards. Elegant, comfortable, well designed beyond well equipped place. Garnished with an adorable welcome basket with handpicked apples and a bottle of wine. Nice touch! EXTREMELY CLEAN! The photos and description are true and legit! The linens pure white heavyweight down cover, mattress the right firmness for a restful and restoring night of sleep. Bedroom TV with all the conveniences. Wifi super fast (I called overseas with no hiccup.) Bathroom accessorized with shower bar and an incredible foldable toilet bar. I just had surgery and that was extremely helpful. I really appreciated that accessibility. No detail overlooked! Make up towels, shampoo, conditioner, soap, hair dryer, hand sanitizer, tissue box all tastefully available to you. Kitchen/living room is darling. Another TV could entertain the kids when traveling with them or do some laptop work. EVERYTHING you need in a kitchen, Connie‚Äôs beautiful cabinets will have. Even nice sturdy to go disposable coffee cups (coffee pods included!) Connie‚Äôs place came as our second leg out of the 3 leg trip. Her place was exactly what we needed after a misleading first leg Airbnb description which put us on a predicament of choosing to sleep inside our truck instead of the filthy place. If we ever need to come back to Waterloo area, Connie‚Äôs place will be our to go home away from home!"
2021-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Connie is such an amazing host! The place is very clean and beautiful. She responds quickly and answered every question I had.
2021-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Thank you Connie! This lovely place was not only stylish but it had everything I needed. The use of space is wonderful and a nice sized bathroom. It was nice and quiet, good parking space. Everything felt so new, clean and well thought out. She also made touches for breakfast. I was able to communicate with her well and respond quickly. Love the side lamps and charging space."
2021-12-01,5,Stayed one night,Everything was as described and Connie has included a lot of thoughtful touches that make this a great place to stay
2021-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Connie is an absolutely wonderful host! She was so helpful and accommodating, she has everything you could possibly need ready for you here. The place was very quiet and clean and looks exactly as pictured. I will definitely stay here again if I have the chance."
2021-11-01,4,Stayed one night,clean
2021-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,"If you‚Äôre driving through or looking for a little weekend getaway, stay at Connie‚Äôs place. YOU WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED. It is great proximity to several major highways and close to a lot of cute little towns. The Airbnb is exceptionally clean, well stocked and Connie is great with communication. She had a bottle of wine waiting for us, great coffee, some breakfast items. Connie pays attention to the details. We definitely want to come back and visit the area and would love to stay here again. As a lesbian couple it can sometimes be difficult to find places to stay, but we felt right at home here."
2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful little suite. Very quiet and peaceful place to get away.
It was quite cozy, and was well suited for my needs as a single person looking for a space to do some writing and refresh. Coffee, soda, bottled water, a bottle of wine, and a few food staples were provided."
2021-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Absolutely lovely! We felt so relaxed and peaceful here. I wish we could have stayed longer. Very clean, very well-decorated, everything was perfect. So much thought was put into the kitchen amenities, everything was there you could possibly need. I especially loved watching tv in the luxurious bed (made use of the provided Netflix!). And Connie, our host, was super-responsive and kind. I definitely recommend staying here, and downtown Auburn is a few short minutes away with many dining establishments to choose from. If I could give 10 stars, I would!"
2021-10-01,5,Stayed one night,Connie is a fabulous and kind-hearted host. She was very communicative and hospitable. She had a little welcome personalized note when we arrived. Small touches like that go a long way! The place is absolutely lovely and I would stay there again any time!
2021-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great place to stay, great location ... easy on and off 69 AND BFM is a great local place to eat!!!"
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Connie was a perfect host! The place is exactly as shown in the pictures. It was immaculate and designed beautifully. Connie left treats that made our stay even better. We could not have asked for a better experience or a better host. We will be back.
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The place is really beautiful, it has everything you need, it is very clean and Connie's attention is incredible, lots of communication and always resolves your doubts and needs. Of course I would be staying there again, thank you for everything"
2021-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,Very clean and beautiful apartment! Great hospitality! We had a wonderful stay and I would enjoy coming again.
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Its been a week since my wife and I returned from our stay with Connie at the Lighthouse Inn, Waterloo, Indiana. The facility is located in a rural setting near Hamilton, Auburn & Waterloo with Fort Wayne being a 25 minute drive away. Connie is personable, friendly and has a great sense of humor. Communications via Text, Email & Phone Call couldn't be better.. She's simply the best Hostess ever as she's managed to think of everything one would want in an Airbnb from, Toiletries to Keurig coffee pods. Rooms were very clean and consisted of a bedroom, sitting room/kitchenette and a bath room with walk in shower. Two ROKU TV's were installed, one opposite wall of bed and the other in sitting area. free Wifi worked great with no problems connecting via the logon code provided. I could go on and on about how great Connie and this stay was but, I will end with this, If we are ever near this area of Indiana in the future we will definitely look to stay with Connie. Recommend 5 Star all the way."
2021-09-01,3,Stayed a few nights,"Connie was very thorough from the get-go. She even threw in a bottle of Moscato since I told her it was my wife's birthday. Day of, after dinner in Fort Wayne, I texted Connie to let her know we were heading north and should be there about 9:30 PM. She had informed us ahead of time that we would need an entry code to gain access to our suite. I didn't think to check for the entry code before driving up to Waterloo. We arrived at 9:20 and walked up to the door to our suite. It was then that I realized the access code was never provided. I tried calling Connie but it went straight to voicemail. I texted her and messaged her through AirBnB but still never got a reply. My wife and I waited in the car until 10:10 PM and then decided we would have to drive an hour and a half back home. Our host had forgotten the one vital piece of information that would have made the weekend super special.
Connie did contact me first thing in the morning. She obviously felt very bad for this miscommunication. She refunded us our money for the weekend and we were still able to stay there Saturday night for free since we were planning on spending the day at Pokagon State Park. Connie also went one step further and offered us a free weekend in the future.
This is a very nice place for a couple to getaway too. Location is close enough to Pokagon State Park and the outlet malls in Fremont. There is also a really neat Buffalo Preserve in Fremont that I would highly recommend touring."
2021-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"This place is quite the gem, there was so many small perks in one place. coffee containers right next to the Keurig machine, a relaxing shower, lots of places to charge things. The host fulfilled requests ( i requested hot chocolate and she threw in marshmallows too). It has lots of storage, with a small closet, storage bins in the bathroom, living room and in the bedroom. There is even a key fab for the door ( for those like me who can't remember a code ). The host gave me a personal tour of the place when I arrived and was very welcoming. It's a must see place perfect for your getaway."
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Connie‚Äôs place was just what we were looking for something close to Auburn for my boyfriends drive. The place when you drive up sneaks up on you if you don‚Äôt remember it so drive slow when it‚Äôs your first time. But beside that she was a wonderful host had a lot mini shampoo and conditioners and more stuff! She really cared about us and if we felt comfortable. I actually met her and she was so kind and heart warming. Thank you Connie!
2021-09-01,5,Stayed one night,Beautiful property!
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My girlfriend and I had the best time staying here! Connie is an amazing host and even had our room ready a little bit early! She went above and beyond to make us feel comfortable as well as our dog! The bed is very comfortable, and we took full advantage of the free Netflix at the end of the day! The suite was the perfect size for the two of us and was very well done! The location is perfect and is minutes to several parks and restaurants and grocery stores. We also loved being out in the quiet country as we came from the city! We cannot wait to come back!"
2021-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"If you have any reason to be in or near Waterloo, IN, this is the place you want to stay! I was passing through for work, and I loved the place so much, I wished I had reason to stay longer than the one night I stayed. Connie is great, and the room she created is stellar. She thought of everything! I absolutely plan to come back if I'm ever in the area for work again, or just for a getaway with my husband."
2021-09-01,5,Stayed one night,What a great host! This was my first experience with airbnb. Connie was awesome and explained it all to me. She worked hard to insure that I was comfortable. The room was amazing! Will definitely stay again!
2021-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,This place is adorable! It‚Äôs cozy without being too small and roomy enough for 2 people and a dog. The space is clean and the amenities included in the stay are fantastic. The kitchen is fully functional with all the cookware and appliances you‚Äôd need for meals. The location is nice. It‚Äôs a 10 minute drive from the beach and 20 min drive from Ft Wayne. The host Connie was great. She greeted us as we arrived and made sure to be available for us throughout the whole stay! I will definitely be back for a mini vacation.
2021-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"Everything about our stay was wonderful! Connie was so friendly & hospitable, & the suite was absolutely gorgeous, VERY clean, & comfortable on every level! We would not have changed a thing about it."
2021-08-01,5,Stayed over a week,"Let me start with Connie is an absolute delight as a host! (But she‚Äôll give you full privacy if that‚Äôs what you want). She welcomed us with a nice card, wine and treats for our furbaby, so nice of her! Communication was great, she replied almost instantly to all of my texts. She offers more than your average Airbnb, with a lot of essentials for cooking, personal items (even toothbrushes if you forgot yours), air fryer, coffee and some cereal for your first couple of days.
The place is perfect for one person or a couple and their furbaby (there‚Äôs a lot of space to walk them around the property).
I need to stop writing, but seriously book this place, you won‚Äôt regret it. We loved it and were sad to leave. Will definitely come back!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Connie was very kind and responsive and was very accommodating to any problems or questions we had. She helped us a lot and was incredibly proactive.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,Perfect place to stay

2023-08-01,4,Stayed with a pet,This was a great stop along our cross country road trip moving to Seattle. Our pets enjoyed the space. We were disappointed that there was no hand soap or body wash. Mattress was super comfy though! Overall good stay.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Another great stay! We will be back!
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful apartment, with tons of things to do around it! Connie was a great host and always responded right away!"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Charming apartment. Neat and tidy. The host was quick to respond. I would stay here again. There are many stairs leading up to the apartment if that is a concern for someone. Parking was not ideal. The other person using the area did not leave space. Even if it was ideal, someone may have had to move cars around several times depending who needed to get out and when. However, I made it work by parking in the funeral home lot just steps away. And that wouldn‚Äôt have been any hardship for the funeral home as it was a huge parking lot many spaces away from the business doors."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed one night,Place was cozy she is on with responding in being fast at it!!! I would for sure stay again!!!‚ù§Ô∏è
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Thank you

2022-11-01,4,Stayed with a pet,"Connie was very kind and helpful, everything you need was close by, quite neighborhood. The only thing I didn‚Äôt like was the stairs, with 2 dogs it was a little difficult also coming up the stairs needed more lighting it is a little dark."
2022-11-01,5,Stayed one night,Very cute and clean place to stay! Host was very helpful!
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great stay. All around great and homey enviornment. 5 stars all around from host to home.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was a nice small place for our family of four adults to spend some time in-between two larger family gatherings. It rained, so we made cookies, played games, and worked a puzzle. Our daughter was able to work remotely."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay for the week. Would be my first choice to stay again when i'm in the area.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We always stay at Sarah's when we are visiting family in the area. The house is always super clean, kitchen is well stocked, beds are comfy and Sarah is quick to respond if there are questions. We highly recommend!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Sarah is an excellent hostess I cannot say enough about her great communication, super clean, cozy homes, with everything you need to have a wonderful stay. Quiet neighborhood, very sweet neighbors, instructions on places to visit. We always feel safe there and a plus is that we may bring our dog. Awesome!!!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Sarah was great letting us know about check in. We enjoyed our stay. We would stay again. Very nice stay and she had many little extras.
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Sarah‚Äôs homes are always beautiful and exactly what you see in the pictures. She goes above and beyond to make sure that her guests feel right at home and is extremely quick to respond to any questions. We absolutely love staying at any of Sarah‚Äôs homes!
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We loved this home, was just perfect for our stay. We will stay here next time we visit."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We stayed at this lovely home for the month of February so that I could spend time with my Dad who is in rehab at nursing home in Kendallville.
The home was perfect. Well appointed. It had everything we needed to decompress at the end of each day.
The place is so cute and comfortable. The neighborhood is quiet.
Sarah communicated well and left very clear directions and helpful information.
I would definitely consider this place again. While no place feels like home, this place was so cozy it came quite close to home.
It's a great value when one considers what you pay for a hotel.
The place was also very clean. Sarah thought of everything and we are grateful that she shared this place with us."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed with a pet,It was so adorable! It was very homey. The area was quiet Sarah had a lot of nice extras. It had anything you need including coffee and shampoo and conditioner . It was just great!
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Perfect for a girls trip to craft and play games. The house was very nice.
2023-12-01,5,Stayed about a week,Sarah‚Äôs homes are our favorite places to stay! They are exactly as they are described- plus more! We are always so grateful to be able to walk right in and immediately feel right at home. The extra touches that Sarah adds to her homes make such a difference. We look forward to our next stay!
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Sarah decorated for Christmas with a cute tree that we utilized during our Christmas gathering. We made cookies and pasta and the kitchen was very well stocked. The hostess left butter in the fridge, spices in the cabinet, a bottle of wine from a local winery, and a helpful binder with local recommendations. We enjoyed a difficult Lego puzzle that was already there.
The town of Auburn, less than 10 minutes away and easy to get too, is super cute with bakeries and gallery and other fun things to do. The house was exactly as pictured, with plenty of towels and blankets. Fort Wayne is also nearby, about a 30 minute drive.
While the house is pet friendly, the yard is not fenced in and you will want to walk your dog on a leash as there are many neighboring dogs anxious to meet new friends. While the noise did not bother me, some of the houseguests weren't a huge fan of the noise from the nearby railyard.
I would recommend staying here."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This house was perfect for us! The kitchen had an excellent variety of gadgets and bakeware/cookware. Beds were quite comfortable, and there were plenty of extra blankets and pillows available. The rooms were all the size shown in the photos‚Äîno wide-angle camera tricks to make the place look larger. We felt quite at home there and would definitely recommend it to others."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,What a wonderful cozy house! Sarah was a fantastic host and I really enjoyed my stay. The house was pristinely clean and had everything I needed. Had the best sleep I ever had had in months. Will definitely be back.

2023-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"The house fit my needs perfectly. Clean, cozy, walk in shower, the area is quiet, and dog friendly which is important to me since my Bella travels with me. The neighbor was super friendly. Enjoyed visiting with her. Sarah was extremely responsive and helpful. I would stay again if I ever return to this area. 5 stars in my book! Thank you Sarah."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great location that was private, but near everything in town!!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We loved this property. We have traveled all around the US following our son and his hockey dreams. This was one of our favs. Sarah was great to work with. We will be back next year.

2023-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,Had a great time at Sarah‚Äôs place. Would definitely stay here again!!
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This house was beautiful and affordable! It offered everything to make us feel at home, and to be able to relax during a long road trip; coffee pods, washing machine and dryer with detergent and fabric sheets, everything you to shower, the beds were super comfy, and so much more! Also love the Roku on all of the TVs and the ability to login to our personal accounts like Netflix! We also love that it‚Äôs dog-friendly, which is super important because our doggies are our family and travel with us! The neighbor was super nice, and we had a wonderful and relaxing time! We don‚Äôt visit Indiana too often, but now this AirBnB is on our list to come back to, so we‚Äôll be back! Thank you so much, Sarah!!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,It was a great place and reasonably priced.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We LOVE staying at Sarah‚Äôs place. She has hosted us three times and each time has been wonderful.
Sarah is always extremely responsive and helpful. We‚Äôve never had an issue but I‚Äôm confident if we did she would handle things immediately.
We‚Äôve already booked our next stay and can‚Äôt wait to visit again!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,Great.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This was my first time at a airbnb what a beautifull home my family came from the next town so they were only 4 miles away. The neighbors were wonderful one made us cookies another gave my twin nephews and niece bubbles . couldnt have asked for a better place we grilled out most every day and had a fire in the pit most nights. If i come back to the area i will definatly stay here and i hope every bnb that i might stay in is as beautiful as this. Sarah has done a beautifull job on it. The neighbor told us the home was a railroad home and moved to this location and the wood inside was from the railroad. We wished there was a history of the house inside. Over all perfect vacation.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This is our 2nd visit to Sarah's house and it was just as great as last time! Everything is super clean, kitchen and bathroom well stocked, quiet street with plenty of parking. Sarah always responds quickly to messages. Will definitely stay again when we're in town!"

Much as the last time, we will look forward to staying at one of her locations again in the future.
Chris and Jen"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This home is even cuter in person and the town of Garrett is lovely. Sarah takes wonderful care of the property and her home was perfect for our family of four this weekend!

The house was immaculate, well stocked, safe, beautiful, welcoming, and so comfortable. Sarah herself is delightful, thoughtful, and an excellent communicator- she is genuine and kind, without feeling overbearing or obtrusive.
Staying here was more like staying at the home of good friend while they were away.
If for no other reason, the beds. Book this house if you would like the best nights sleep of your life.
10 out of 10. Will stay here again and again!"

But the drive was fast and easy and perfect for access to north Fort Wayne. This is a 6 star property. The decor/furniture choices are perfection. The place is beyond immaculate. She‚Äôs thought of EVERY need: from food in the pantry, wine on the counter, ice cream in the freezer, lots of blankets and towels. Great washer/dryer. Instantly warm gas forced air heat. Books, board games TV in not only living room but bedrooms. Easy to find. Ample parking. Keyless entry. Quiet neighborhood. Don‚Äôt miss this gem!"

If you have a dog one neighbor also has a dog but they keep it tied up when it‚Äôs outside. Also don‚Äôt freak out that occasionally you‚Äôll hear the tornado siren late at night, but the police and fire use that as an alert so when there‚Äôs a call the siren goes off and it can be a little loud late at night. Spooked us the first time we heard it but it was never a problem."
2022-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This place was (1) impeccably clean, (2) perfectly decorated, (3) quiet and cozy.

Having a garage was great as we didn‚Äôt have to deal with rain or snow loading and unloading our car and family.
One thing - GggleMaps will default to the wrong address, so pay attention to the instructions from Sarah rather than GggleMaps.

I would highly recommend this Airbnb. I particularly liked that it was a little out of the way, which made it a very quiet place to spend a couple of days. There is a nice bar/grill within easy walking distance."

2023-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Sarah was an amazing host, she checked in with us periodically before our stay and during to make sure we were comfortable and happy. The home was very clean and extremely well put together. She did a great job with the decor and I personally loved her style and aesthetic. We took advantage of the games she had, and the plush blankets while watching some movies. There is also a two car garage with another outside fridge that was perfect for keeping our drinks cold and not taking up room in the fridge inside. I think the amenities and details made us feel like we were in our own home and thats a huge perk for us given we have two kids under two we travel with. Most of all we appreciate her hospitality and trust in us to allow us to host our daughters first birthday in her home. Not many hosts allow gatherings but she never even questioned our request and was happy to accommodate. I will most certainly rent from her again anytime I am in town to visit family. 12/10 experience!!!"
2022-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,This was the cutest home we ever! We felt right at home! There was even a complimentary bottle of wine and chocolates! Highly recommend and would definitely stay again! ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è

We will 100% be back!"
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"It was a beautiful home, you could definitely tell that love and dedication lives there. It was very accommodating for us to be checked in early. The wine was great and the comfort of being in a home and not a hotel was the best part."

2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My sister and I and our 3 dogs had a wonderful stay! From the day of booking up to checking out on our last day Sarah was super friendly and helpful!

2022-10-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Sarah‚Äôs home was so nicely appointed and clean, and she thought of everything for her guests! It has such a good feeling about it. I would definitely stay here again, given the opportunity. It truly feels like your home away from home. Having the attached indoor garage to park in was amazing, especially given the inclement weather I experienced the first couple days. And the real china blew me away‚Äî I just have not seen hosts providing such quality for their guests before. I felt very blessed to be able to stay here for my trip, and to bring my dog along!! Thank you, Sarah!!"

so much Sarah for your hospitality
and sharing your home! Loved your

2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The house was so perfect, beautiful, nicely located for Chain of Lakes Kayaking and hiking, some great restaurants close, loved Country Heritage winery 3 miles away and Fort Wayne was only 25 minutes for retail therapy. The house itself was just the right size, stocked with everything you‚Äôll need and so much more, clean, decorated beautifully. Nice 2 car garage to keep your car out of the elements. Only suggestion would be to screen in the very cute gazebo, the mosquitoes were terrible."

Highly recommend, and would definitely go back."
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This place was perfect for our visit with family in the area! Enough space that we were able to invite some family over to play cards one evening. Thoughtfully appointed and very comfortable.
2022-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Clean and cozy home that provides all the little things needed when staying. The owner has not cut back or cheaper out.
I felt like I went to a family members home, quite comfortable. You will love this home!!"
2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This home is a wonderful little hideaway! beautifully decorated and incredibly clean! Sarah has truly thought of every detail, even down to adding a box fan to the bedroom closet, for those of us who can't sleep without one, all the way to having pet hair specific dryer sheets available for those of us travelling with pets! This home is not at all short on space and has such a warm feeling!!! Sarah is a great host who is quick to respond to any questions. My bit of advice for anyone looking for a great spot in a quiet town just a short drive from the hustle and bustle of Fort Wayne.......BOOK THIS HOME!!! YOU WILL LOVE IT!!!"

2022-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I would like to thank the most wonderful host Sarah for allowing my family to enjoy her beautiful home! The endless amenities will keep you indoors then the thoughtful gesture of having menus/guides for local attractions helped out tremendously! We thank you so much for the hospitality!
2022-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This house is so clean and well done, such a cozy & relaxing stay. Such a gracious host who accommodated us early for snow storm that came in. 10/10"
2022-02-01,5,Stayed with a pet,We stayed for a short weekend trip so we could visit Fort Wayne and Pokagon State Park. LaOtto is right between the two so it made our trips very convenient. The AirBnB was well stocked and furnished beautifully. Sarah has great communication and is an awesome host!
2022-01-01,5,Group trip,"Great getaway weekend location. Just 15 miles out of Fort Wayne. Sarah's home is very spacious and clean. Her communication before, during and after our stay was above outstanding. We would definitely stay here again when in the area."
2022-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We really enjoyed our stay at Sarah's place. She is an amazing host, very thoughtful, generous, and prompt. The home has a great atmosphere with lots of amenities. She pays great attention to detail which is appreciated. It was a quite and pleasant place to spend time with out of state family. We would definitely stay here again."
2022-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Place was great for my employees! Quick communication from host! Great amenities!
2022-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I highly recommend Sarah‚Äôs place. It was even better than the pictures! Sarah‚Äôs place was beautifully decorated and very comfortable, with a fresh and airy feel without strong artificial fragrances that can be common in Airbnb‚Äôs. (For anyone sensitive to chemicals, Sarah‚Äôs place was fantastic and I personally had zero issues whatsoever with chemical sensitivities). The layout makes it seem bigger than it is, with the bedrooms on opposite sides of the house. There is a nice sitting area and large dining table which was also nice. The use of the garage was extremely helpful given our stay was in early January. Packing and unpacking the car while being out of the weather and elements was especially beneficial given freezing temperatures and snow flurries. The kitchen was extremely well-stocked with snacks, food, and a variety of cookware - much more so than other Airbnb‚Äôs. It was apparent that Sarah cares about the details and went above and beyond to make us feel welcomed and comfortable. We would absolutely stay here again if/when the opportunity arises!"
2021-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Sarah's Airbnb rental was fabulous! I would recommend it to anyone needing a safe and comfortable place with many amenities!
2021-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Sarah is far and away the best host we've had on any rental platform, and we travel quite a bit. She is truly a *Superhost*. The house was in a great location, clean, nicely decorated, comfy, and stocked with everything we needed and beyond. I highly recommend staying here and if provided the opportunity in the future would love to stay again."
2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We‚Äôve stayed at Airbnbs all over the country, but this home was one of our top favorites. Everything was spotless and there were lots of thoughtful touches that made us feel right at home. It was a quick (and scenic) drive to Ft. Wayne, too. We highly recommend staying here!"
2021-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,This house was perfect for our trip. Everything you need and great communication.

2021-11-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Immaculately clean amd impeccably decorated, this cottage was perfect! Far enough off the beaten path to provide a quiet retreat yet near enough to shopping, restaurants and more. Sarah was very accomodating and responsive to questions. Check out the Country Heritage Winery while you are there, delicious wine, food and entertainment."
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I loved my stay here! Sarah was an excellent host, quick to communicate, and welcoming. Her home was everything lovely, well equipped, comfortable and lots of personal touches. There‚Äôs a nice outdoor area/gazebo and yards down the surrounding hamlet has enough to offer to go out for coffee or eats. I would happily return and recommend for solos, couples and families."

2021-10-01,5,Group trip,"There are no words to truly describe this beautiful comfy home. Sarah was AMAZING! Definitely will be back. You will need nothing but your clothes. Fully stocked . We very much enjoyed ourselves! You ROCK Sarah!
