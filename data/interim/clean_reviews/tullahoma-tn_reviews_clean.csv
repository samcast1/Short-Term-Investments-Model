2024-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Madeline's place was just what our family needed for a relaxing memory making weekend. The lake right out the back door was amazing. The kids, both old and young, all really enjoyed the kayaks, pedal boat and the flat bottom boat. It was much different than being on a big lake where you have to worry about motorized boats coming through. Plus, it was very peaceful with not many people around. There are some beautiful sunsets over the lake, as well. I can't say how peaceful and relaxing it was on that deck! The house was great, too. Everyone loved pool and pingpong and the arcade games. It's a short 10-15 minutes to restaurants, as well as Kroger and Walmart, so that was a plus. I can't say enough good things about our stay! Everyone wants to know when we are going back!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Spacious, clean lake retreat. This rental is a gem. So much space inside & out. Kayaks & pedal boat provided along with life jackets. Plenty of seating indoors & outdoors. This worked perfectly for our family. Definitely recommend, you will not be disappointed."
2024-06-01,5,Group trip,"The house is incredible and having such easy access to the lake was amazing. Would highly recommend to large groups of people who love late night campfires, floating out on lakes, and a homely feeling house."
2024-04-01,5,Group trip,"Just what you want in a rental. Everything was clean, house was very nice with great scenery. Neighbor was very nice as well."
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is our 2nd year here so you can imagine how much we like the place to come back. The hosts were responsive, kind & flexible with our schedule. The house is clean and spacious and the kitchen is fully equipped. We needed to bring very few things. Since we were there at New Year's we didn't use the lake, but the location is gorgeous and peaceful. The kitchen/gathering area is great for our group to hang around with each other and we rarely turned on the TV because the space was so inviting to just ""hang with each other"". The bedrooms are clean, comfortable and flexible. If you have small kids, you should be aware of the stairs, but our grandsons loved going to the basement and playing the ""vintage"" video games (man am I old that these games I played in HS are now ""vintage"" (Pac-Man, Galaga, DigDug)).
We brought firewood and kept a fire going each day and enjoyed S'mores and just time around the fire drinking hot chocolates. The deck has been rebuilt and it is spacious & welcoming"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,It was exactly as described. It was a shame on our part we couldn’t enjoy the amenities they had to offer. The beds were very comfortable and bathrooms were very accommodating….
2023-10-01,5,Group trip,We absolutely loved our time at this location. It was so gorgeous looking out at the lake in the mornings and evenings. A very nice place.

2023-06-01,4,Stayed with kids,"Overall was a great experience, just have to mention that one of the neighbors had two dogs that it seemed not very friendly to people every time we were outside they’ll be barking at us ,,, other than that was pretty good we enjoyed it .."
2023-06-01,5,Group trip,Madeline is an excellent host and her home is a great place to stay. The lake view is gorgeous. 10/10

2023-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Outstanding place, spotless and beautiful"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This was my second stay here and my family and I absolutely love this house! We bring our 85 yr old father here to fish because the water is easy to access and he doesn’t have to worry about others crowding his space or having traverse steep hills or stairs to get close to the water.
I wish I could stay here year round. It’s a beautiful and spacious home located in a quiet, cozy neighborhood. The hosts are great; they provide clear concise instructions and are extremely responsive to questions."
2023-05-01,5,Group trip,Pics were exact! Extremely easy to enter! Fun and comfortable home! Hosts were very responsive!
2023-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,Our hosts were super nice and responded quickly to questions. The house was perfect for our family and the open kitchen created a lot of memories of sitting around the island and talking while preparing food. I genuinely cannot think of any negatives and was so appreciative of our experience. We may even try a summer weekend together! :)
2022-11-01,5,Group trip,Great amenities.
2022-10-01,5,Group trip,Super place for a family stay in Tullahoma! Fully stocked with all the toys to enjoy the home and lake out your back door. Thank you hosts!
2022-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,The view was gorgeous and the house was better than expected.
2022-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The lake house was the perfect place to unwind and relax for our family for a long weekend. We grilled out, enjoyed the view of the lake on the big porch and had plenty of space to spread out. Kayaking on the lake was a highlight. It was the perfect home for a lake retreat with a group."
2022-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We loved our stay for a long weekend. Perfect place for a group of families to get together and relax. We loved kayaking and fishing on the serene lake, enjoying the beautiful weather on the porch, and campfire with s’mores in the evening. The kitchen was well stocked with cookware for us to cook for a large group. And the pool table, ping pong table, arcade games, and nice variety of board games were a hit as well. Would definitely come back again!"
2022-08-01,5,Group trip,Absolutely everything we anticipated based on the description. All of the available watercraft really made our stay! The fishing was pretty good as well. Also a short drive to 2 beautiful waterfalls in the area. Quaint sleepy little town to just get away from it all. Stayed 4 nights and didn't get into even half of the games and activities this house has to offer. We had a great stay and would highly recommend!
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Great place for a family outing. Lots of games, kayaks, paddle boats etc."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Loved the house!! It was clean, comfortable and spacious. Perfect for our larger group with plenty of areas to sleep and hangout. We were never bored with all the lake toys, board games, ping pong, pool table, and arcade games! We had everything we needed and had so much fun with family."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We had 14 people in our group and never felt crowded. We kayaked almost daily on the lake,it was so relaxing and enjoyable sitting on the deck overlooking the lake, grilling. They had so many amenities we couldn’t use them all. The location was good for me- it was close enough to Nashville, yet minutes from hikes, gorgeous waterfalls, and winery/distillery. Our entire group enjoyed themselves! Would highly recommend for big groups with families wanting to have an enjoyable, and relaxing vacation."
2022-06-01,4,Group trip,"Beautiful location! We had a large group of family (12) staying for a nearby wedding & we had plenty of space to stretch out. The view is incredible and we took full advantage of the kayaks to enjoy the lake close up. Peaceful with plenty of room to enjoy outside between all of the decks, fire pit, & large back lawn. We had a wonderful time staying here!"
2022-05-01,5,Group trip,"What an Amazing and Beautiful home directly on a Gorgeous lake. The house was spotless and has special touches all over. The kitchen is big and well stocked. There were so many activities both inside and outside that after a week we still didn’t get to everything. We were a huge group and we never felt on top of each other because the house had a great layout. Thank you for your hospitality, we will be back often."
2022-05-01,5,Group trip,"Awesome place! My family, which ranged in age from 14 to 84 all LOVED THE PLACE. In fact, we are trying to see if we can arrange another trip for later in the year. The home had lots of space and there was lots of things to do. The property was beautiful and the view of the lake was great. Plenty of cooking utensils on hand and so many other extras were supplied; it was just like having your own things at home. We enjoyed fishing and seeing the wildlife . We saw a fox 2 mornings in a row and also deer, geese and herons.
Most of all we just feel blessed by the opportunity for family bonding and making memories in such a great place.
Thank you so much for allowing us to share your beautiful home!
Donna and Family"
2021-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Wonderful spot for a getaway! House was full of amenities, everything we needed. Beautiful spot on a quiet cove. We just had a blast! SERENITY NOW!!!"
2021-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Beautiful and comfortable home. Perfect for our large family.
Many things to do. Of course, the lake, then the nearby waterfalls, a great playground close by, and can't forget shopping.
A very big THANK YOU!!!"
2021-10-01,5,Stayed about a week,This beautiful home is huge and it was absolutely perfect for our family trip. The kitchen is fully stocked. Our host was responsive and maintained great communication with us during our stay. The location is perfect and feels secluded although you are just a few minutes away from anything you need to do in town.
2021-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"Serenity Now lake house is amazing. I organized a short, last minute corporate retreat here and it was ideal. The house is large enough that everyone had room to spread out and not be on top of each other.
Communication with Madeline was great. The key was exactly where she said it would be. The kitchen is fully stocked. The living room is comfortable and it was easy to cast to the TV for presentations. The Game Room is super cool.
Outside is amazing. There are kayaks, canoes, and a paddle boat. The sunset is perfect over the lake. The view of the homes on the other side of the lake is very calming. Most of our meetings took place in the sunroom looking out that way.
I highly recommend this house for either a small corporate event or a vacation."
2021-09-01,5,Group trip,"Clean, peaceful, perfect. Thank you for a great stay!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Wow, what can I say about this place. This place was amazing. My wife and I ventured to Tennessee to view lots of waterfalls. Kim's place has a wonderfull sounding creek flowing in the back yard and the falls just down the road is simply amazing. Could easily spend a whole day there. The place was clean, stocked with snacks and foods. Simply amazing. My wife and I were very excited to be able to stay so close to a flowing creek and waterfall. We are both very excited to hopefully visit again soon. We would stay here over and over again. Everything was super easy, and Kim was very helpful with technical support and recommendations.
Thank you so much for opening your lovely Airbnb. Super cute, functional, peaceful, and amazing."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We loved Kim's place...she had everything covered....extras of every little thing we could have forgotten to bring. It was very nicely decorated, extremely clean in every way and so peaceful and quiet. The greenery and being right by the stream was absolutely perfect for our getaway weekend! We look forward to staying here again in the future."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,This place was a little piece of heaven. Kim went above and beyond to make this a beautiful place to stay. The snacks and drinks she left were above and beyond what one normally gets at an Airbnb. I loved sitting out on the patio and just listening to the river. I highly recommend this place to anyone!
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Kim's place is located next to a beautiful creek & very close to some amazing trails. The room was very clean ,comfortable & stocked with everything we needed and more . Would definitely recommend Kim's place and we definitely plan on visiting again."
2024-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful location. The creek was wonderful. We enjoyed coffee every morning on the deck. Kim has thought of everything a traveler would need …and more. This is the most completely stocked place we have stayed. We will definitely visit here again.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This is a beautiful location, right on the creek. Very peaceful and serene. Had a binder with recommendations on things to do. Rutledge Falls is beautiful and literally minutes from the home. Very clean and put together. Everything was as described!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,The view from the porch is just absolutely amazing. Kim was such a great host. Everything was absolutely how she said it would. Thank you again for sharing your amazing space with us.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"“It’s the journey, not the destination” is one of many inspirational quotes found in this beautiful AirBNB. I find myself contesting this quote after arriving at my destination here. This is the best airbnb I’ve ever been to. The location is surreal. I feel like I’ve stepped out of my car into a fairytale land with a waterfall, succulents and moss abound. We are looking forward to making this our go to spot when in the area in the future. Stellar home and host. Everything you could think of needing is easily found within the home. So many great snacks! Even fun activities for kids. My son and I had a great time reading, coloring, painting, and swinging together. The energy of this home and area is unmatched. The rain did not deter the fun. We were outdoors as much as possible. Rutledge Falls are phenomenal! We walked for hours and made a wonderful friend on our path. Wishing we stayed longer, can’t wait to come back!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great location; beautiful hiking around the area. The place itself was peaceful and very enjoyable.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Kim and Jessica are superb host, very thoughtful with all the extra amenities in the apartment and we hope to be back again!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Very nice place. Exactly as described and she has all you need there. Very easy check in and check out. The most relaxing outdoor seating area, & very close to an easy hike/walk to a beautiful water fall."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"My boyfriend, pup and myself had a lovely 2 night stay here. So many comforts and needs included… I forgot my toothbrush at home, and there was a new one in the drawer for me! It was such a peaceful and comfortable place to stay while we saw shows at the caverns. Our pup loved the creek area, and we had such a relaxing time with a fully stocked kitchen, super comfy bed and double recliner, which I loved to curl up in."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What a wonderful , cozy and peaceful place!
This is one of the very best Airbnb stays I’ve ever had! The stocked refrigerator, the comfortable recliner and beds, the books and so very clean! - just fantastic!
But the creek and the swing were the best. Just what my soul needed. Thank you, Kim and Jessica, for providing the his calming oasis. I will definitely be back."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Kim was an exceptional host. Her place was beautiful with well-appointed personal touches both indoor and outdoor. Great communication. Wonderful stay.
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I have stayed with Kim several times. She is an amazing host and her place is by far the best Airbnb that I have stayed. Beautiful space! Attention to so many details! Coffee, snacks, drinks, creamer… the most stocked kitchen I have experienced! Outside is as incredible as inside! I highly recommend her place and will visit again!"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed with a pet,We arrived around 10 PM. The door to enter is in the back of the house. There was plenty of light in the parking area and at the door. We felt right at home. The beds are very comfortable. We loved waking up to the sound of the creek. We used the gas grill which was in good shape. We enjoyed walking to the Rutledge Falls from the driveway. We plan to stay here again!
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Stayed at Kim’s place to be closer to distilleries..Jack Daniel …Uncle Nearest. Seeing the running water right in front of house is what hooked me. It’s beautiful !!!! So refreshing, so relaxing. To our surprise we open the fridge to see it filled with possible necessities we would need. Thank you so much!! It’s frustrating to arrive somewhere and be so thirsty and there’s never at least one bottle of water. Also, my husband is a type 1 diabetic, so hem his sugar for low guess what, the juice and cereal was the perfect snack to get him regulated. Place was clean and perfect for us two. And I always travel with pods and dryer sheets, but she had some if needed, which is very considerate. Thank you for thinking of what people may need/miss when traveling ! Would stay here again and hopefully will when we return !"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Staying at Kim's place was an absolute delight! The serene atmosphere and peaceful creek flowing nearby made for a truly rejuvenating experience. From the moment we arrived, we were impressed by the thoughtful personal touches throughout the home. Kim's attention to detail was evident in every corner, from the cozy decor to the array of breakfast options provided for us to enjoy.
One of the highlights of our stay was the thoughtful consideration for our furry friend. Kim had supplies available for our dog, ensuring that we had everything we needed if we forgot anything. It's rare to find such pet-friendly accommodations, and we appreciated it immensely.
Overall, our time at Kim's place exceeded all expectations. We left feeling refreshed, relaxed, and grateful for the wonderful hospitality. We highly recommend this tranquil retreat to anyone seeking a peaceful getaway with all the comforts of home. Thank you, Kim, for a memorable stay!"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed with a pet,This place is amazing. Cozy little basement apartment with a view of the creek. It had everything we needed and Kim is such a gracious host. We needed a place last minute and it was ready for us. Our stay ended up being nearly 2 weeks.
2024-01-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Kim's place was absolutely flawless. We felt like we were home and it was very cozy and comfortable. We really appreciated all the little things like having coffee, creamer, a few options for breakfast and snacks and just supplies in general. I definitely recommend this retreat. The creek was so serene to listen to and we walked to the nearby waterfall."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"WOW! what an outstanding property, in every possible way. I don't know if I have ever been in an Airbnb that is 5+ Star (really 10+!) in every category. The location is ideal, perfect for being in nature, yet close to any store/restaurants anyone may want. Sitting on that porch drinking coffee, watching my dog play in the creek that runs out back.... priceless. Inside was spotless, so extremely beautiful and clean. I was blown away by how comfortable and homey it was, the vibe is just perfect. The hosts have thought of everything! For more than expected, I could literally have brought nothing with me for this stay and would have had everything I needed. Thank you Kim and Jessica, I'm already trying to figure out when I can return and stay a lot longer."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Went for a work trip and really enjoyed not staying in a hotel. Really appreciated the atmosphere, location, and comfort."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Nice place for a getaway. Lots of snacks and basic utensils to use for staying and close to local stores and restaurants.
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Love this cozy retreat by the creek and Rutledge Falls! A last minute booking and Kim was so responsive. The space is adorable, very clean, and fully stocked. I will certainly stay again!"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place is absolutely stunning! And Kim left so many personal touches around that I can’t even name them all. If you’re looking for a relaxing getaway, this is the place!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Great stay!
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This little place was amazing. My best friend and I traveled to Tullahoma, TN for a wedding. I grew up exploring the falls and this gave me an opportunity to show my best friend where I grew up. The house was so easy to find even at night. The area was quiet and so relaxing to sit outside and enjoy the sounds of the fall season.
Kim is an amazing host and has everything you could think of. I would definitely stay here again and would recommend it to anyone visiting the area."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"The view was lovely and the stream so relaxing. The multiple spots to hang out by the stream (hammock, swings, tables and benches) were great. Wish it had been cold enough to light a fire in one of the fire pits. The kitchen and bathroom had everything I needed. And the fridge and pantry were generously stocked with treats, drinks, breakfast items, and basics like milk and butter. The beautiful fall decorations inside and out were cheerful and uplifting. The icing on a perfect retreat. Kim was delightful, and made sure I didn’t miss out on the nearby falls."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I cannot say enough about this hidden gem! I knew nothing about this town when I booked it. I booked only on the description pictures and reviews and WOW! 5 stars across the board. Beautiful area excellent location and lots of beautiful hiking rather close to the Airbnb. And the complementary items? Kim has thought of everything lol. And dog friendly just made it even better ! I’ve stayed at many air bnb this one is the absolute best one ever! Already looking to come back! Top notch!
Even if you are not choosing her place for hiking, you absolutely must see the waterfalls that is located across the street from the property on the short hike. Absolutely amazing and doable for anyone.!!!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Kim and Jessica’s Airbnb was by far the best Airbnb I’ve ever stayed at. I’m not one for “relaxing” out of my home, I get so homesick, but I was so comfortable here. It was easy to kick back and destress. We kept busy with porch singing, going hiking at Rutledge, and a fire at night. This place is gorgeous, peaceful, so worth the price, and just a 10 min drive from town! We will be back, and we’ll be recommending to our family coming to visit. Thank you!!!!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with a pet,It was perfect for a getaway. I felt extremely welcomed and pampered
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Awesome place surrounded by nature. The creek, waterfalls nearby, distilleries, and restaurants were all great. The apartment was spotless and had everything needed. We can’t wait to go back. This place and host is highly recommended."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,What a wonderful time we had! Sitting on the back porch sipping coffee and listening to the babbling brook. So very very peaceful. Highly recommended.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Enjoyed our stay. Everything is will stocked. Enjoyed the porch and the sounds of the water.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Very nice, relaxing vacation."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed about a week,"I referred to Kim's rental as the ""little apartment"" as I was showing the pictures off to friends and family before out trip. It did not disappoint! The first thing you notice is what you hear, water. Soft in the distance and constant. Very relaxing. Having coffee on the porch swing, listening to the creek and watching the antics of the tiny birds that frequented the strategic bird feeder near the porch was our kind of fun. The kitchen was great, having all the comforts of home. The bed was so comfortable, we slept several nights with the window open being lulled to sleep by the serenade of the crickets outside. It was very cozy & well appointed with fresh towels, linens and blankets. Our 5yr old Granddaughter had so much fun on the swings. The small one on the porch was just her size and the rope swing over the creek was great, even Grandma had a turn! We sought out Rutledge Falls. Kim had great directions and it was an amazing site to see and hike down to the creek bed. Loved it!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This place is truly a gem! It would be a bargain at twice the price! The location is so gorgeous and peaceful! You can just walk down the creek to Rutledge Falls, if you want. Everything is set up so well to encourage relaxation and enjoyment. Kim has really gone out of her way to set up everything to be so hospitable and have everything you might need to enjoy your stay!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a wonderful time at Kim’s Creekside guest sweet. The place was spotlessly clean, well stocked, and felt warm and cozy. We felt right at home immediately. It served us perfectly during our trip and was a great location between Chattanooga and Nashville, as well as Lynchburg for touring the Jack Daniel’s distillery. Can’t recommend Kim’s place enough. Wouldn’t hesitate to book with Kim again in the future!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Everything was perfect. She goes above and beyond to give the best experience. Didn’t need a thing. We were definitely recommend and go back.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Nice cute little apartment under host house. It was extremely clean and well cared for. The creek right outside the door was so relaxing.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Kim was amazing! Place was beautiful and so was the surrounding area. Definitely recommend getting out and exploring the the area as there are some breathtaking falls right down the road. If you are looking for a peaceful nature filled place look no further! Highly recommend and we can’t wait to go back!
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,What a wonderful place to relax. It was amazing. I look forward to returning. Thank you.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed over a week,Kim’s place is a beautiful location by a creek and within walking distance to Rutledge Falls. The apartment is cozy and a great place to relax or focus on work. This was my second time staying there and I would stay again.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My husband and I such a awesome, peaceful time it was so relaxing. The place was absolutely beautiful inside and out. She goes completely out of her way to make it feel so cozy and definitely thinks of anything you might need and it’s there. The place was super clean and just beautifully created. We’ve only been home 4 days and I’m already ready to go back. Charming little town and just feels as though you stepped back in time. Everyone you met was so nice and welcoming just all the way around made you feel right at home !!! Thank you so much for putting this together, so many will enjoy your beautiful place !!!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Our recent stay at this perfect little creek side studio was nothing short of amazing! Our host was informative and the property was easy to find. Upon arrival we,of course, did some grocery shopping only to find she had stocked the fridge with little necessities incase something was forgotten. She even had lots of plant based options for all lifestyles. It was incredibly clean and decorated with lots of love. There was even a little kid bed area that had so many cute things for the children to stay entertained if needed. We didn’t bring our kid this trip but would of been very comfortable if he had come. There just is nothing left unthought of, dog bowls and treats, bathroom toiletries, all the kitchen supplies you need. Everything. You won’t need to worry about going without, she has everything there. It’s conveniently located too and there is a book with lots of recommendations. Not to mention walking distance from a gorgeous waterfall that is easy to get to!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Atmosphere is one with nature! Absolutely stunning
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"My wife and I took our 2 boys for a weekend trip to Rutledge falls and we had a blast! Kim and Jess were totally awesome, quick response, so friendly, and the place had everything plus more than was listed online.
The back of the apartment is so peaceful and completely private!
I will definitely be staying with Kim again on our next trip to the falls."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,Would absolutely come again!!!! 10/10!!
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Enjoyed our stay. Will be back again soon.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My second time to stay here. Wow, what a beautiful location! A wonderful place to pause and take a break, surrounded by nature. Apartment has everything you need and more. Spotless. Helpful to have some basic food items and snacks already there. Kim is easy to work with, incredibly responsive. I hope to stay again soon."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"My fiancee and I recently embarked on a long-distance move, and after weeks of stressful packing, we were desperately in need of a respite. Fortunately, we discovered the most tranquil Airbnb along our 800+ mile journey, providing us with the perfect opportunity to unwind and recharge before tackling the remaining unpacking challenges that awaited us at our new home.
From the moment we arrived, we were instantly captivated by the serenity and privacy of this delightful retreat. Tucked away in a peaceful location, surrounded by nature's beauty, it felt like our own little slice of paradise. The stress of the move melted away as we entered the cozy sanctuary, and we knew we had made the right choice.
We chose to do our own thing and had minimal interactions with Kim, but we also enjoyed the comfort of knowing that she was available should we have needed anything or had any questions about the local area. This place is special and we hope to stay again sometime in the future."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Loved it
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We were very happy with our stay at Kim’s. The space was beautiful. The location was perfect for our event. The porch with the sounds from the little creek in the back made for a peaceful spot to enjoy morning coffee or a glass of wine and read a book. What really blew us away was all the small touches the Kim left to make our stay easy…milk and cream for our coffee, snacks, toiletries. We got in late and I did not feel the need to go out to find anything. It was all right there!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Kim‘s place quickly rose to our number one most favorite Airbnb of all time! It is very comfortable, quiet, serene, welcoming, private, and isolated, right on the creek away from the noise! Kim provided little snacks and other Amenities, such as coffee, creamer and milk, ice cream and cereal. It’s evident that she is a very thoughtful person. She also has impeccable, decorating sense and thought of absolutely everything, including a nook for a teen. To hide away and read a book.
Kim’s place is so amazing that we are already planning a return trip with a longest stay!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What a peaceful, beautiful spot. Kim was a fantastic host and completely responsive to texts and questions. The second bed is in what we thought was a cute little nook, and it is part of the bathroom/laundry room without a door, so no privacy for the bathroom when someone is in the second bed. Luckily that was ok for us, but good to know ahead of time. This was the perfect weekend getaway with peace and quiet. We loved it. We both commented we had never been in such a well stocked and thoughtfully done Airbnb. Kim has thought of everything from what you might need in the kitchen to walking sticks on the back porch, etc. We loved our stay!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful location, amazing price! The apartment exceeded expectations"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Kim did a great job of hosting. We felt right at home, with great surroundings and it's a wonderful place to visit with the creek right in the backyard. There were eggs, bagels, and other items provided for a nice breakfast and snacks. We would highly recommend!."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We had a great stay. The creek was so relaxing They had chairs tables firepits. Inside anything you might have forgotten you will find and much more. I will say the host have thought of everything. A must is a walk to the falls Beautiful. Would stay there again. kuddo kim and Jessica you have a great place
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My husband and I had a great getaway here. We loved the outdoor space and all the thoughtful touches. Kim has thought of everything to make your stay pleasant. House was very cozy. It was nice to hike to Rutledge falls from the house, although the hill is a doozy on the way back up. Conveniently located between Tullahoma and Manchester. Short springs was a beautiful area for hiking and the Thai food at short springs village was delish!"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This is a special place. So very comfortable and listening to the water from the massive porch was euphoric. I unplugged, hung out in the porch swing, put my toes in the creek, walked nature trails with my pup and totally relaxed. Hosts are super thoughtful about snacks and edibles having thought of nearly everything, down to the half dozen of eggs and bagels! What a treasure this space is, I didn’t want to leave."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Kim’s place was more beautiful than the photos. The view, the creek, the outdoor furniture made for a very relaxing stay close to nature. It had everything we needed including bagels, coffee, milk, drinks, condiments, snacks, toiletries and so much more! It had stuff for kids like books, crayons, games. It even had dog essentials like bowl, mat, pee pads and treats! We felt right at home. It is not very clear in the photos, but the 2nd bed (twin bed) is located by the bathroom/laundry. We highly recommend Kim’s place."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,Beautiful home with amazing scenery!
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We absolutely loved Kim's place. We could have just sat on the porch the entire time and been completely content. The sound of the stream and the birds chirping made for a beautifully relaxing environment. Kim has thought of everything, so many thoughtful touches. It's apparent she cares about her guests' experience. We will definitely be back!"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We loved everything about this place. This is an amazing getaway for any anyone! It was very quiet. The view and the sound of the creek are amazing and so peaceful to listen to even from the front porch. The inside was very clean and simple. We cooked every night and they have everything needed to cook a nice meal with. We took our dog babies with us as well and they loved everything about it, its so hard to fine people that are ok with our fur children and Kim is amazingly accommodating with our fur babies, we had no issues at all. Overall, I fully recommend 10 out of 10!!!!!!!"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,We loved our stay so much we hope to make it back again! The suite is very comfortable and the kitchen is stocked well for cooking or grilling on the porch. We spent most nights and mornings on the porch enjoying the sounds of the river. The path to the river and down by the river was such a bonus! We felt like we were on a retreat! Thank you for making our stay so special!
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"The location was perfect for our waterfall road trip. We enjoyed grilling and having dinner with a fire by the water. In the mornings, we had coffee on the patio. So peaceful and perfect. Even fun swings to sit on. Jessica also helped arrange the cutest decorations to surprise my boyfriend for his 30th. If we’re ever in the area, we’d for sure stay here again."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This is a nice place in a beautiful area! The kitchen was fully stocked for cooking! The hosts are responsive and kind.
2023-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Beautiful and would stay again!
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"It is an amazingly peaceful place with the stream right outside offering a great spot just to sit, listen to the running water, and breathe in the crisp cool air. She offered a king list of activities to do in the area with distances or drive times to each. She was very responsive the checkout process was very easy!"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Perfect for us.
2023-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,This place was amazing and we had a great time. I can't wait to come back if they will have us. I was really blown away by the whole experience.
2023-02-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Can’t wait to come back and stay again! The place was great and the hosts were amazing too!
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Kim’s place was amazing. Very clean and very thought out based ones individual occasion. We went for our anniversary and there was champagne on the bar for us. “Thank you”.
We had all the privacy you could ask for. The place was beautiful and I loved the well thought out positivity all throughout the space. It was clean and she thought of everything you might forgot.
We loved the creek behind the house! The sound of the running water and the popping of the fire was so peaceful.
I’m glad we chose Kim’s place and will definitely be back!"
2023-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"Kim’s place was magical and even better than the pictures. Thoughtful touches inside and outside, like the two-person recliner, multiple fire pits, and swing. The creek was so peaceful, and I really enjoyed yoga on the back porch at night. We had coffee by the creek in the morning, and it was lovely. If you’re a light sleeper and stay during the wintertime, I’d recommend ear plugs, as the sound of the heater fills the space. Even with that, I wouldn’t hesitate to stay here again."
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We love staying here - my son lives 2 miles away (walkable).
Already booked for March -- Thank you Kim for our Home away from Home!!"
2022-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Definitely one of the best places we have stayed. If we weren’t just passing through I would have stayed longer to explore and enjoy the area. So cozy, comfy, and accommodating. The view was nice and the area was relaxing. Kim thinks of everything and sets you up for a wonderful stay. I can’t recommend enough."
2022-12-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Nice place.
2022-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"The space was amazing! Clean, quiet, and so relaxing. Kim and Jess added personal touches like a Christmas tree and several other amenities.
I have stayed at several Airbnbs over the years and this one is definitely one of my favorites!
My two dogs and I were there to hike at Rutledge Falls, Machine Falls, and Busby Falls. The manual in the Airbnb was very helpful in that it provided directions and listed several other attractions in the area.
10/10 recommend, will definitely be back!"
2022-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This was a wonderful place for us to get a peaceful night away after a hectic holiday week with family and friends. We “escaped” home not knowing what our day held but found Kim’s place open and booked while e route to a day of adventure (settling on the Tennessee bourbon trail and antiquing). We really enjoyed the Christmas decorations, double-sized recliner and comfy bed. The tub was spotless and the water was hot. The backyard was beautiful the next morning and only wished we had arrived before dark to enjoy it the night before as well!"
2022-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great place, stocked with coffee, tea and snacks… spotless interior and a tall shower head with plenty of hot water. (I’m 6’5”.) My wife loved the interior decorating - “fun” was her word to sum it all up. Leaving we had to walk away from a beautiful stream at the edge of the property complete with chairs and a couple portable fire pits. Needed to continue our cross-county trip, but both LOVED this stop."
2022-11-01,5,Stayed one night,Was such a great place to unwind and unplug. Kim thought of everything and the place is fully stocked with everything you will need to have a great stay.
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Highly recommend! We had a great stay while visiting the area. The studio was very clean and nicely decorated. The porch and creek view was very nice. The host was very easy to deal with, provided excellent communication and privacy during our stay. All the little details were thought of, including snacks and drinks which was very nice and appreciated! No complaints!"
2022-11-01,5,Stayed one night,It was very clean and cozy
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Kim's place was wonderful! The little touches make it well worth the visit. We were just traveling through from Missouri to Virginia and Kim's is right around our half way point. You have a private entrance at the back of the house with a keyless lock. The apartment is well stocked from coffee creamers, snacks, dog treats, and a dog bed. She even left the little things one might forget- toothbrush, toothpaste, deodorant, ect. The sound of the creek that runs behind the house was very peaceful at night. Very clean and comfortable. We will be returning! Thanks Kim!!!"
2022-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Kim’s house is pleasure to live near Manchester and a memorable experience!
This is truly a delight for people who are nature lover-
The entire house is thoughtfully presented and kept for the guests.
I recommend and give 5 star rating for everything. This will be my first choice in future to live near Manchester!
Thanks Kim for this beautiful treat!"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Perfect host, location and place. Cannot recommend enough."
2022-10-01,5,Stayed with a pet,We had a great stay and really enjoyed hiking to the various falls!
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Nice & Quite. Enjoyable patio hearing the running stream. Good location on a picturesque country road.
Highly recommend!"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Absolutely wonderful! Comfortable, pretty and clean. Ideal location to visit so many areas. Make sure you walk to Rutledge Falls and see the waterfall.
My husband and I visited Kim’s place for our honeymoon trip to Tennessee. Her apartment was absolutely lovely! The decor was so pretty and she thought of everything. The chair in the living room is oversized and we were able to comfortably cuddle And there was the softest throw blanket. The kitchen and bathroom were equipped with everything we could possibly need, including a few drinks and snacks.
The most beautiful waterfalls are only a few minutes gentle hike/walk away. We used this location as a base to visit Nashville, the Jack Daniel’s distillery in Lynchburg and also the Corvette museum in Kentucky.
Kim recommended Top of the Rock restaurant when I asked about a nice place for dinner. Oh my gosh!! The view was spectacular and the food so delicious. I can’t recommend the chicken fried chicken or the filet mignon enough. They were so so good.
Overall, an amazing visit. Kim’s place is the perfect base for so many places to visit. Pretty, comfortable and clean- we can’t wait for our next visit."
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This is a beautiful place to stay. The setting is so peaceful and relaxing. The place was spotlessly clean and very well stocked with snacks and all essentials.
2022-09-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Yea booked 4 nights but only got to stay one. I wish i had i had someone like you to talk to like we did on your peaceful back porch. I'm pretty sure God had His hand in that because we have to much in common. I hope your kids appreciate you now. I miss my mom even tho she's still here. I hope my boys realize one day how deep a mothers love is. It's as close to our Gods as it can get yet no where near as deep as His. You are a true gift and you will never know what it meant for you to take time to listen to my story.
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,100% recommended! The property is beautiful and the host is great! Plenty of snacks and really feels like a home away from home. I would stay there again without even looking at another place.
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great spot!! Close to lots of hiking and waterfalls. The host is wonderful! She stocks the place super well!! The nook is in the bathroom area, so if you are hoping for any privacy that’s a little tough. She has everything you could possibly think you’d need and more! It was perfect for our mother daughter getaway."
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The place is beautiful, right near the waterfall. The apartment on the lower level was perfect, with a cute nook and extra bed. Laundry was available, as well as detergent pods. She even had other toiletries available for use if needed. Also, she provided snacks, bug spray, and anything else you could need for the stay. The details were well thought out with care and I honestly plan to stay here again in the future just for fun."
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a great time at Kim's place. The communication was super easy and quick, and the place looks exactly like it does on the pictures. It was very tidy and lovely and equipped with everything you need. A good bed, nice bathroom, and great scenery! And she even provided snacks:)"
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Thank you for your stay. Your place was absolutely beautiful
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"A beautiful place to stay if you’re looking for something peaceful and relaxing. Easy to reach and very clean, I would definitely recommend staying here!"
2022-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,Great place Extremely clean
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is was exactly what we were looking for; a quiet place to unwind and relax with our dogs. We had so much fun exploring the yard, walking in the creek, and making s’mores. Everything was spotless and beautiful. All the small touches made our stay very special, such as the extra dog bed, portable Bluetooth speaker, and miniature zen garden. We couldn’t have asked for more, and hope to return!"
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is one of my favorite Airbnbs I've ever stayed in. Kim thinks of everything you could possibly need. All around were little thoughtful touches that give the feeling of being home. The studio is very clean and organized and the kitchen was lovely to cook in. Our favorite feature of this space is the outside patio that overlooks a creek that feeds into one of the most beautiful waterfalls I have ever seen. We were very sad to go and hope to visit again some day. Thank you so much, Kim!"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed about a week,Beautiful property. A great place to get away.
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What a wonderful place to relax & recline! The view of the creek behind the house is such a soothing bonus as you retreat to the outside porch. Kim thought of EVERYTHING in the BnB, even an extra pair of reading glasses! It is so peaceful there!"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This place is the perfect mix of outdoors and luxurious/cozy stay. We walked to Rutledge Falls twice while there (less than 10 min walk). You can hit the grocery store and brewery before you go and then have no needs while there! Hiking and waterfalls near by. It was a wonderful romantic weekend of reflection and connection. The place has everything you might need. Kim and co-host were very accommodating and generous. Thank you Kim!
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Kim’s place was immaculate. She goes above and beyond to make sure the place is clean, cozy, and comfortable for guests and even provides snacks and has all essential toiletries if you forget to pack something. We didn’t bring a pet, but she has super cute and thoughtful amenities for those with doggies. The location is beautiful and perfect if visiting Rutledge falls. The swing by the creek was a huge hit with my daughter!! If in the area, we’ll definitely stay here again!"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is a little slice of heaven. Kim is a great host, everything was spotless. Exactly as described and as the photos show. Kim had put a lot of consideration in stocking the fridge and offering snacks. We had a great time relaxing by the creek and the covered patio. The hike to the falls was a highlight!"
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place for a peaceful getaway
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Hands down the best place I’ve stayed at! So pretty and private. Very well taken care of. Very positive experience
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"If you're looking for a remote place in the woods, this is it! Which also means that you may find cell service and WiFi less than reliable. The A/C worked great but I would love to visit again when I wouldn't need it and could really enjoy the sound of the creek and nature. The patio is not screened in but the ceiling fan was always on and seemed to keep the mosquitoes away. The apartment is well stocked with snacks, coffee creamer, oatmeal packets, condiments, soap, etc. and even had a basket outside with bug repellant, sunscreen, etc. It's the woods in summer, so there were some bugs but nothing too bad. We had fireflies at night and even had a frog make a surprise visit on the patio. This place is also VERY close to 2 beautiful waterfalls, which is why I chose it."
2022-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,The description is spot-on and the property is serene. Kim has thought of absolutely everything and my stay was perfect!
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very clean and tranquil location. Check in was easy. The host is very accommodating.

2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place is truly spectacular! Cleanest airbnb I've ever stayed at. whether solo, or with a companion, if you're looking for peace, serenity or inspiration, this is your spot!! Everything was just magically perfect!!"
2022-05-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This place is as amazing as all the other reviewers made it sound! Comfortable, beautiful, practical. Loved the sound of the falls from the back porch. The porch is huge and well-appointed. The bed is comfy. Also, with the price being equivalent to a hotel in town, the value is off the charts! Will stay there again when I can!"
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Words can not describe how amazing this place actually is! Not only is the actual location breathtaking and beautiful, cozy and comfy, relaxing and reinvigorating but there is nothing that has been overlooked. Snacks, dishes, bathroom amenities, EVERYTHING you may need has been provided. I didn't have time on our trip, but you could have made a full meal if you want, including the grill on the porch. I only wish there were screens on the windows and door so that I could have fallen asleep to the sound of crickets and the creek running by!"
2022-05-01,5,Stayed with a pet,What a find!! This was the best little getaway for me and my mom for Mother’s Day. The location was great! And the house was so clean and very thoughtfully designed. We definitely hope to stay again if ever back in the area.

2022-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Excellent getaway!!
2022-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This studio apartment is so cute, very clean, and child friendly. I loved being able to hear the babbling creek from the cozy porch. The backyard is woodsy and peaceful and just a short walk from Rutledge Falls. Kim and Jessica thoughtfully provided snacks, coffee, and tea, as well as books and games. I will definitely book again!"
2022-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Great, clean place so close to the waterfalls! Check in and out was easy. The space was cozy, the beds were comfy, and you can’t beat the sound of the creek rushing by while out on the porch. Would definitely rent again!"
2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Lovely setting, clean well-appointed place. Appreciate her attention to detail. Highly recommend."
2022-03-01,5,Stayed about a week,We loved staying at Kim's place! it is everything she described. The setting is gorgeous with the river and trees a few steps down from the back yard. The space was clean and cozy and the beds were comfortable. We had everything we needed and will definitely visit again.

2021-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"This place is magical. The brook below sounds delightful. I wish it was warm enough to have the windows open. The space in incredibly clean, well stocked and considered carefully. There is a great place to walk the dogs across the street but truth be told we really didn’t want to leave. We will be back!"
2021-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful relaxing stay! Definitely the best air bnb I’ve been to. Super clean and well stocked with everything you didn’t think of bringing. We will be back!
2021-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is the most serene retreat that I have been on since beginning my ‘momcations.’ Snacks, drinks and the patio are amazing qualities of this Airbnb! You’ll love it!!!"

2021-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"If you want a quiet place to chill, this is your place! Being in the woods setting along with the rolling creek was so relaxing! The house had everything you need! Very clean with a comfortable bed, nice tv with Netflix, full kitchen, washer/dryer, and even snacks, coffee pods and some refrigerator goodies! There’s a very nice covered patio with a porch swing & couch and a grill. There are also some hiking trails to water falls which we really enjoyed!"
2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,great little spot. the only thing that we noticed and it isn't really an issue is the faucet in the kitchen drips a little bit.
2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This is an idyllic getaway for a couple or very small family. Meticulous attention to detail and a long list of surprise bonuses make this cozy apartment a perfect retreat from daily life. We had never stayed in an attached property but I could tell little or no difference. A perfect 10 for me!
2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Kim’s place was a lovely retreat area both inside and out. She provided so many special touches that makes this one of the best places we have ever stayed. I wish we could have stayed longer and hope we can return in the future. If you are seeking tranquility, this is your place."
2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The description is completely accurate. The sound of the creek is so peaceful and the suite is more than adequate. She has literally thought of everything you might need - right down to a spare pair of reading glasses. We would stay there again in a heartbeat.
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We cannot say enough good things about this place. It was beautiful and so relaxing. We have never seen a place so well stocked with everything you could want and more. The creek was so relaxing and the beautiful large windchime sounded so lovely. The hosts are so kind and quick to answer any question. This is truly a 5 star get away from it all experience.
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Wonderful stay. Kim really puts thought into her place. The snacks were a lifesaver after a long drive.
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Did not want for anything. Very well stocked. Really cute place. Wife would have approved. Was away from it most of the time. Could have just hung out there for a day. Highly recommend.
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,A wonderful experience for us using Airbnb for the first time. Highly recommended!!!
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place was perfect for our quick weekend stay! It cute, cozy and has just the right touch of detail!!! We will definitely be back!"
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very relaxing patio area. great for winding down after seeing the sights in the area.
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Kim has pretty much thought of everything you could need for your stay. Every time a drawer would be opened there were more little things that she'd thought of. The location is spectacular and there's Rutledge Falls a couple of minutes away, they were beautiful. We discovered a great old fashioned burger joint in town called Jiffy Burger, we highly recommend the grilled bacon cheeseburger it's a melding of a grilled cheese sandwich and a cheeseburger. Prices were very reasonable too. All in all we enjoyed our getaway to Manchester."
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is truly a magical place!! Whether you're looking for a quick getaway to relieve some stress from the city or a longer soul searching journey, this is the spot!! Aside from being one of the top 3 most beautiful properties I've ever stayed at, it was also the cleanest. Kim put such care and attention into every detail. The room was super accommodating and the view and sound of the creek was absolutely majestic. Kim put such care and attention into every detail to make sure you have the perfect experience...and for me, it was."
2021-09-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Nice place with a view of a creek below the house. Close to a waterfall too.
2021-09-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful space. Very clean and a wonderful outdoor space to enjoy the river. Very quiet and relaxing.
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Kim’s place was one of my favorite Airbnb experiences. She puts a lot of thought and care into everything. She provided coffee, snacks, miscellaneous toiletries. So many little details which were so nice. The location is also perfect and so cozy. Right off a creek and a short walk to Rutledge Falls. Will definitely be staying with her again in the future!"
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is my second stay at Kim's. That should say it all. It has quickly become my ""secret hideout"" when I need to get away from the stresses of the world. It is perfectly situated on the creek - so close you can sit on the porch swing and read a book with the creek babbling in the background. It has all the amenities you would need: fully stocked kitchen, including all dishes/pots/pans/silverware/cooking utensils; fully stocked bathroom with towels, shampoo/conditioner/soap; full size washer and dryer; I even found a drawer with some doggy poop bags! She thinks of everything. It's the perfect size for three people if two are in the bed-sharing mood. There are extra blankets, board games, and even a doggy pee pad and towel. Oh, and the bed! The bed has got to be one of the most comfortable beds I've ever slept on. It has an amazing mattress pad and it's so soft and comfy. The pillows are nice and flat, too, if you like that sort of thing. I HATE hotel pillows that are so big and uncomfortable! Her pillows are perfect. As for accessibility - once you park, it is a flat walk to the front door, but there are two steps to get into the apartment and then a step to get into the bathroom. Then there are multiple steps down to the creek as well, but it's a very nice gravel and wood walkway. I WILL be back!"
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"It was a nice stay! Wish we had more time to enjoy the property.
Rutledge falls, right around the corner was super cool!"
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Hubby and I wanted to get away from the hustle and bustle of populated city life. I stumbled across Kim's place and knew this was exactly the kind of place we needed to be. It was so quaint and quiet and Kim had everything you could need for your stay. Hubby and I are definitely re charged and will be back the next time we need time away! Thank you Kim for everything.
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Kim's Airbnb is truly a gem. The location is spectacular. Only a 5 minute walk to the nearest waterfall. Kim was very accommodating and is a great communicator. The space is private and spacious. There is an outdoor grill and plenty of space. The door to the airbnb opens up to a large flowing creek that is absolutely serene. I highly recommend staying at this Airbnb.
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a wonderful stay in this peaceful and beautiful home! The creek and surrounding areas are beautiful, make sure to check out the nearby waterfall. Kim provided lots of snacks and supplies, above and beyond anything I would have expected. Just a great experience, highly highly recommended!"
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Kim's place was amazing! She thought of everything. The backyard was gorgeous too.
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful area and nice stay! Communication was great and was exactly as described. Thanks Kim!
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Highly recommended. It's a private suite on a shared property (basement walkout apartment with house above), but that is fully disclosed in the listing. So, no surprise there. It is obvious when you enter, however, that Kim has put so much thought into the comfort and well being of her guests. I've been in a lot of Airbnbs and have never had one so well stocked with snacks, drinks and little extras everywhere you turn. The location was excellent for hiking or just a peaceful retreat."
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Cute little studio apt. Didn’t realize it was under main home. But never heard noise upstairs. Steps down to a beautiful clear creek. Made a short hike to Rutledge falls. Well worth it. I will def come again. Just the perfect little solo retreat or maybe a great couples getaway.
Kim greeted me upon arrival. Lots of little treats like coffee and snacks and breakfast items. She went and hunted down a blender for me upon request as I had brought smoothie items. Very clean studio with lots of well thought out extras."
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Kim's Place is by far my favorite stay. Walking in through the French doors, it's like a cozy woodland cottage, super clean and magically stocked with everything you need from tea & coffee with all the fixings, to breakfast, snacks, and even dinner items! Everything was well stocked from the kitchen to all of the extra toiletries and handy first aid and personal products to assist in anything unexpected. I was pleasantly surprised at everything she thought of for my stay!
I spent most of my time out on the porch, taking in the beautiful scenery and just plain relaxing while watching the bumble bees, butterflies, geckos, and occasional frog. But each day I started a few steps down at the creek with my coffee, in the quiet calm of morning mist rising from the rushing water in the sunbeams, like a fairy tale scene to go with the cottage. And after that first cup, swinging on the rope swing over the creek was sure to wake me up happy and start the day with a smile!
I can't say enough good things about Kim's Place. I'm very much looking forward to staying again!"
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"clean, quiet"
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This air bnb is a mind blowing and whimsical retreat. We saw deer, blue heron and even a opossum on the creek! The short walk to the falls was so beautiful."
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful and relaxing. Everything was perfect for a quiet getaway.
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had such a great stay! Kim’s place is so lovely. There were so many little touches that made our stay so special. If you are traveling with a pup this is the place to stay! Kim had treats and a dog bed for our dog to use. There are so many beautiful hikes near by, we loved machine falls! We would definitely consider staying here again!"
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"this is a great stay its private, relaxing, and the best part, its right on a creek. you can tell Kim thinks ahead about everything a guest may need."
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Gorgeous location and very nice private apartment. The creek in the yard is wonderful. It doesn’t (a least in July) flow too strong where it is dangerous for children or small dogs. Great hiking trails are super close by. Apartment is very clean and she provided very generous snacks. We had a relaxing trip.
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Kim’s AirBnB is great. Everything was as expected and then some. It was extremely clean and everything was very thoughtful. The views and location are great too. We would definitely stay again.
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We have stayed in many AirBnBs, both in the States and overseas. This is the first review I’ve ever left. Kim’s place might be small but it is mighty- she has provided everything guests might need and more. We have never had a host provide the amount and types of food she had available. Our dog loved playing in the creek and surprisingly there were very few mosquitoes around. The covered porch was spacious, decorated nicely and although we didn’t need them, she also provides a swing and small child’s table outside. She was very flexible with a request we had as well. Great place!"
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,What a great place! Kim has thought of everything you may need! The space is sparkling clean! The outside area is beautiful! We had a wonderful stay! You will not be disappointed!
2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This place is fantastic. Everything we could have asked for. Very private and relaxing. We will be back.
2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a wonderful getaway for 4 nights at Kim’s place. Kim has literally thought of everything to make you feel at home. We brought prepped meals from Sunbasket to cook and she had all the utensils, pans, oil, condiments we needed plus much much more. The space was SPOTLESS which we really appreciated since we had experienced otherwise at AirB&B locations. The location is secluded and serene. We only left a couple of times our whole stay to hike. We highly recommend this gem of a place!"
2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Clean, comfortable, relaxing, and for us private. Had the owners been home we probably wouldn’t have stayed only because we wanted our privacy. We went to see waterfalls and eat and this place didn’t disappoint! Within 5 to 15 minutes of several!"
2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Kim’s place was perfect for our weekend getaway! It’s close to anything you could need in Manchester, but the wooded area and running creek in the backyard makes you feel like you are in a private area completely secluded. We spent most of our time sitting on the back porch or down by the creek. We also ventured through the trails and walked to Rutledge Falls - highly recommend visiting the falls during your stay!"
2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"You will not be disappointed. As a matter of fact, you’ll be pleasantly surprised. Both inside and out are homey and relaxing. It was so much more than expected. I highly recommend."
2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Kim did a fantastic job hosting our stay. My wife and I greatly enjoyed our time and the scenery from the porch swing. We would come back in a heartbeat.
2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is our 3rd time to stay at Kim's place, and it won't be out last. This is the best Airbnb that we've ever stayed in! Kim has thought of everything you need, and things you didn't know you needed! The nature outside is soothing to the soul. You won't regret booking at all. You'll be so thankful that you did!"
2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Kim was a great host! she has lots of great amenities that we used, and the view was unbeatable. my boyfriend and i definitely want to come back& stay longer next time!"
2021-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,"If I could rate this place at 10 stars, I would!! Clean space, comfy bed, stocked snacks, and fridge stuff too! Decorated beautifully and with everything you could need! Creek on the property was beautiful. My 5 year old loved playing in it. The Rutledge Falls nearby are so cool!! Def a must see!!
Kim was a great host and thought of everything when prepping this place for guests. Definitely would stay again!!"
2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This was my first time booking an Airbnb. This places was so cute and very well decorated. The bed was so comfortable and the hospitality with the little snacks and coffee were perfect. I even forgot my tooth brush and if she didn’t have a spare! I will definitely be going back but next time taking my daughter. There is a creek with a fire pit that we would love to sit and listen to music. Thank you for you hospitality and an amazing experience!
2021-05-01,5,Stayed about a week,"This was an absolutely amazing place to stay with an amazing host! I stayed for a week for a solo writing retreat with my cat, and it was more than perfect. It was quiet and serene with so many places to sit to relax and think. The patio was superb for yoga, just chilling, and the Wifi extends there for outdoor Netflixing. I enjoyed the ability to explore the creek and walk through the woods. The beds and chairs inside were all super comfortable, there's reliable Wifi, and as most have said, lots of snack and thoughtful accommodations everywhere you look. Kim was great at communicating and making sure I was well taken care of. Overall, an exceptional experience at an exceptional place with an exceptional host. I will be back!"
2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We would give 10 out of 5 stars if we could. Kim literally thought of every little detail to make our stay enjoyable and stress free! The room was a perfect size for my wife and I and the creek was so pretty! I definitely recommend going to see Rutledge Falls!! Absolutely beautiful. Thank you Kim, we will be back."
2021-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Kim’s place was absolutely beautiful! We booked it hoping it would be a great start to mine and my husband’s honeymoon and it definitely did not disappoint! There were plenty of snacks, beverages, and peacefulness provided!"
2021-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Amazing location and great snacks provided:)
Loved being near the creek during our stay"
2021-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I will definitely be back! Highly recommend this beautiful find.
2021-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Kim has such a BEAUTIFUL property. She was kind enough to include snacks and little amenities that I didn’t even think of. Easy to find, easy check-in/out and worth every penny! I was a little hesitant about it being attached to the home, but we had no idea she was there! Will definitely recommend this to others!!"
2021-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Lovely apartment. There were lots of snacks to graze on. The Food Lion in Manchester isn’t too far if you want additional provisions. The covered porch is wonderful for enjoying the birds and the sound of the rushing creek water. There is also seating and a fire pit closer to the water’s edge. We found it very relaxing. I had been under the impression that this was a freestanding property, however it’s an efficency on the bottom floor of a house. If the top floor had been occupied, I don’t think we’d have enjoyed it nearly as much. We appreciated the isolation. I had read reviews that Rutledge Falls was within walking distance but we chose to drive since we were unfamiliar with the spot. It’s right around the corner. You can then drice to Machine Falls, which was a decent hike and very beautiful."
2021-04-01,4,Stayed with kids,Wonderful Creekside setting. The host provided so many touches and it was decorated with care. Snacks and extras were appreciated
2021-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We had the most lovely time here. The place is filled with thoughtful touches. The porch and yard is beautiful and relaxing. The host was quick to communicate and accommodate. Perfect place to unwind and relax.
2021-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"Cozy stay, wish we had better weather to enjoy sitting on the porch and down by the creek."
2021-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Stay here! This place has it all. Private, beautiful apartment with a gorgeous view of the creek running through the back yard. Comfortable bed, tons of snacks & personal touches to make you feel at home."
2021-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,She thought of everything wonderful location!
2021-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Kim’s place was absolutely perfect for a small getaway! The view was absolutely stunning. Kim was a wonderful host and was quick to answer. Kim puts a lot of thought into making this place feel like a home away from home! We will definitely be going back!
2021-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Best of the Best
2021-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"If you're staying in the area, stay here!! Amazing place I'm nature but close enough to do a bunch of stuff around town! A wonderful home away from home with special touches fr Kim it made it an amazing stay!"
2021-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This was my absolute favorite stay of an entire trip hiking across Tennessee! We travel with multiple dogs, so I am always hesitant to book anything close or connected to hosts or others, but even being a small space I never felt cramped! The creek out front was just magical and the space itself is cozy as can be. So many thoughtful touches and extras! Kim really thought of everything a guest could need, was so easy and quick to communicate with, and has great taste in decor and snacks. I will be back!"
2021-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"If you ever want to get away, this the place, so relaxing and quiet you can sit on the patio and listen to the creek running. The the sorunding area has plenty of things to do all easy access, will be back again"
2021-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Amazing location, so relaxing. Kim went above and beyond by having anything one could need for a getaway. Beds were very comfortable and I didn’t want to leave the yard. Perfect place to reset and relax."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great stay, Host is very friendly, responsive . Had clear instructions for everything . Would recommend !"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay ..
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We do this a lot for work and this was by far the best place we’ve ever stayed !!!
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place was cute and well put together. The listing is accurate. The bed was comfy (although the frame is a bit squeaky so you can hear each other move around). Having the soaking tub was handy for some sore leg muscles. Well-supplied with soap/shampoo/towels/toilet paper. Extra blankets were available. We ate at the marina down the road, and bought breakfast biscuits from the bait shop on the corner. Bought a TN fishing license there, as we had brought a pole. Used as a base for two distillery tours, and loved driving the back roads to get there. Suggestions to owner for some small tweaks:
1. Put a small table next to the bed on the other side - big enough to set a phone on. (There is already one nightstand on the other side.)
2. Provide written instructions for logging in to the TV (for live news, sports, etc). We were not used to the format and found it hard to navigate.
We would stay here again! Brittany was very communicative."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"It was a great one night stay, not far from town to get a bite to eat. Super cozy, clean, and cute!"

2023-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Great find! This cozy cabin was exactly as pictured and worked out perfectly for us. We'll definately re-book when we're back in the area.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,Great cabin that’s in a really convenient location. We went for a quick golfing trip to Bear Trace and this cabin was the perfect place to stay. I couldn’t find the email with the code to the cabin but Brittany was quick to respond with all the information we needed. The cabin had everything we needed and was very peaceful.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,This cabin was the perfect amount of cozy to feel like home for the night! We ate at Bluegill Grill right down the road and I 100% recommend checking that out while y’all are there! It’s located in a quiet spot but at the same time only about 20 mins from any store you might need. We ended our night with roasting s’mores in the backyard before heading to Rutledge Falls in the morning. (btw is only about 21 mins from the cabin and is absolutely breathtaking!)
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Clean, beautiful and peaceful space. Smells wonderfully of cedar. There are plenty of towels and beds are comfortable. Everything was as described and Brittany was super responsive to any questions we had. The neighbor was also extremely friendly. Overall awesome experience!"

2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,We are pleasantly surprised by how nice this place was. Everything is so well thought out and the place is beautiful and very clean. We could not be happier with our stay.
2023-04-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Brittany is a great host!
2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,Amazing place to stay. Brittany was so responsive and helpful. We were completing part of bucket list items and this gem should be on your list. These Oregonians will definitely be back. Thank you for sharing your home AMAZING
2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,Nice place for a quick get away!
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Nice place

2023-04-01,4,Stayed with a pet,The cabin was great! Clean and decorated well. We had a pleasant stay. We would certainly stay there again when in the area.
2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,Lovely cabin tucked away close to the marina. My only regret was not staying longer!! Host is friendly with fast response times and great communication. I highly recommend this cabin!!
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The cabin was perfect for our little weekend getaway. Very clean and beautiful area
2023-03-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Great little cabin in the beautiful rolling hills of Tennessee’s peaceful mountains. Cabin was exquisitely well built and the decor was all perfectly thought out! We especially enjoyed the little “nook” which included a glass top table made from an authentic Jack Daniels whiskey barrel. The best feature was the woodsy aroma from the red cedar-lined walls that greeted you every time you walked into the door.
Everything was so well thought out… well-equipped kitchen, magnifying makeup mirror, hair dryer, and jacuzzi tub in the bathroom, as well as the comfortable furniture in the living and sleeping areas.
Staying here was such a relaxing and peaceful experience!"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Needed a getaway from the city and this was prefect. Bear and I will be back!
2023-02-01,5,Stayed one night,The cabin was lovely and very comfortable - it felt like home. Will definitely stay again!
2023-02-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"I really love this cabin! It was beautiful and just right for a spontaneous weekend away with friends! It had everything needed! It had everything she said it would, was clean, easy to locate, and easy to check in and out!"
2023-02-01,5,Stayed one night,This a beautiful place to relax! Loved it!
2023-02-01,5,Stayed with a pet,We had a wonderful time in the cozy cabin. We hiked with our pups near the cabin and enjoyed ourselves.
2023-01-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Nice cabin, shared driveway with another cabin very close but there is a garage in between. There are three dogs that will greet you every time you are outside at the fence that is directly across the driveway in front of the cabin. They are aggressive, we had our dog with us and they would not leave when she was outside with us. When we were outside without our dog they were fine. I tried to let them to see but the owner came out and said “the larger two dogs are aggressive” so I left them alone after that. Overall they did not cause us any issues but I would not let your dog get close to the fence. We really enjoyed the cabin and would stay there again if we were in the area."
2023-01-01,5,Stayed one night,Brittany’s cabin was beautiful and we loved the Christmas decorations inside the place to keep the Christmas spirit going through New Year’s Eve.
2022-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"This was a cute place to stay in the area! We were just on a short getaway for our anniversary. We went down to Tim’s Ford State park for a short hike, ate dinner at FILO’s Tavern in Winchester, relaxed at the cabin"
2022-12-01,5,Stayed about a week,Fantastic!
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This Cabin was very comfortable and tastefully decorated! Felt very at home here. Amenities were great! Great place to stay in Tim’s Ford area!
2022-11-01,4,Stayed one night,Great cozy cabin clean and comfortable easy to find
2022-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Could not recommend this stay more. The cabin was beyond accommodating with the full kitchen, two bedrooms, gas grill, jacuzzi tub, all the blankets this Florida girl could need in the chilly month of November. The decorations and cozy atmosphere are immediately calming and welcoming. Perfect cabin stay!"
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The cabin was a perfect little getaway. It was clean and cozy. Check in was easy and Brittany, the host, was available any time for assistance. We had a great stay :)"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed with a pet,STAY HERE! I have never automatically felt so welcome and warm in an AirBnB like I did when I walked into this home. Everything is open and cozy that you will instantly relax and want to just exist in this space.
2022-10-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Hello, we came here for our two year anniversary. We had an amazing time. Check the cabin before you go grocery shopping. There was a lot at the cabin as far as seasoning and cooking supplies we didn’t have to buy. The cabin is great! It’s right in the middle of everything we wanted to do. If you’re going to do a tour and taste test at Jack Daniel’s, we recommend to get an earlier tour that way you can take your tickets into town and get a free shot glass with a min $10 purchase at the general store. The pizza place on the square is AMAZING! Tim’s Ford State Park right up the road has very easy trails to hike, we took our dog there and had a great time. If you want more challenging trails then Short Springs Natural Area is definitely worth going to. They had quite a few rapids and waterfalls to take pictures at. Mrs. Brittany was always available to answer any and all questions we had. We will definitely be coming back to this cabin!"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed one night,Perfect stay
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We had a great time! Loved our stay.
2022-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"Brittany was amazing! We needed a place to stay late in the night due to our AC going out the night before a wedding. Brittany replied asap and was helpful in getting us in. Such a cute space!! Spacious, even better than described. Great price for high quality, quick lodging!!"
2022-09-01,5,Stayed one night,Such an amazing and cute place to stay! Communication was so easy also.
2022-09-01,5,Stayed one night,This is a wonderful place! A peaceful place away from town. The smell of the cedar cabin is refreshing and relaxing. We WILL be staying again!
2022-09-01,5,Stayed one night,Cute cabin and decor! You do need to bring your own shampoo and conditioner.
2022-09-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Super clean, great getaway spot."
2022-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"This place is perfect! Spotlessly clean, beautifully decorated, and comfortable! 5 stars!!"
2022-08-01,5,Stayed one night,Clean and neat
2022-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"My husband and I enjoyed staying at this cute little cabin. The cabin and comfortable. Brittany was very responsive to us, which we appreciated."
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Really enjoyed our stay at Brittany’s cabin! Her instructions for checking in/checking out were very clear so that process was a breeze. The cabin also has ample space and has all of the basic necessities we needed, so that was perfect. And make sure you spend time out on that back patio!
In addition to all of that, the proximity to local distilleries can’t be beat. I highly recommend staying here!"
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This well designed well thought through cabin is a prefect home away from home. So much so we are sad to be leaving. 😉 Every inch of the space is comfortable. It has plenty of space to spread out and the back deck is serene for your morning coffee or evening cookout. And the TREES ❤️❤️❤️
Brittany was an amazing host. Very responsive and even helped share on a local group when I lost my DL hiking Machine Falls.
The location is perfect. Close to several towns and lots to do and it’s also perfect for a staycation to relax & recharge.
Next time we come through Tennessee we will for sure pick a route that allows us to stay here again."
2022-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Cute and very clean! Really makes an effort to make your stay special. We could ask questions whenever however most everything was clear and marked well. Plenty of kitchen ware as well. We loved our stay here and so did our fur babies. Thanks so much for everything.
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The cabin was very comfortable and clean. The location between the Tims Ford and Tellu was convenient and the Distilleries were not far.
2022-07-01,5,Stayed one night,The cabin was incredibly clean and so cozy. Super easy checkin and great location to Tim’s Ford Lake and Lynchburg. Hope to stay here again!
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Cozy, quiet and relaxing. About 7 minutes to a free boat launch. Nice weekend!"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had an awesome stay. Brittany was an excellent and quick communicator. The pictures don’t do the cabin justice. It’s gorgeous, well built and well insulated, and we loved having the security of the alarm system at night. We were able to grill and cook, and didn’t have to run out to buy anything other than our food we needed. We would absolutely stay here again."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Such a cute cabin with so much attention to detail from the labeled light switches to the makeup mirror in the bathroom. Everything is so well thought out. There was propane in the gas grill, coals for the charcoal grill, coffee for the coffee pot, some snacks and even sugar salt and pepper plus many more nice touches and surprises. Also a crock pot and air fryer! The decorating was amazing and the best part was this was the cleanest Airbnb I have stayed in. The bed was very comfortable and the air conditioning worked really well. I’ve been to some where I want to leave immediately due to just a dirty feeling but could have stayed here so much longer due to comfort and cleanliness. The nearby marina was underwhelming(very small) but it is close by as advertised and serves food and drinks. Do try the Dickel drop! The lake was great and we had a really nice time kayaking in kayaks we brought with us. The lake is very large and nice and quiet.
Highly recommend!!"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The place was easy to find and so cozy! We were able to visit waterfalls, rope bridges on hikes, and the Jack Daniel’s Distillery. I would definitely go back again."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,We really enjoyed our stay at this adorable cabin. It had everything we needed for a relaxing and comfortable stay. Brittany is a an excellent host who is attentive to her guests needs and her communication is very responsive. The cabin decor and finishes were beautiful adding to our enjoyment of this property. Would highly recommend!
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This was a wonderful little luxury cabin! It is very clean and welcoming and we loved the back porch. The kitchen was very well stocked with plenty of pans and tools to cook. Everything was exceptionally comfortable, including the ample dresser drawer space, nice mattresses, and lovely touch of providing a specific towel for wiping doggy paws. Brittany was very accomodating and responsive. A couple of small maintenance items came up, but Brittany responded to our questions very quickly and said she'd be looking into fixing the issues. A little note for future tenants' awareness, next door are two large dogs behind a fence that are very interested in the goings on at the cabin. While they didn't cause any harm at all, they were a bit on the assertive side and caused some nervousness in our smaller dog and young daughter. Otherwise, our stay was absolutely lovely and we wish we could have stayed longer! We will be recommending that visiting family stay here in the future."
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great cabin close to the lake! Disc Golf courses are a short drive away.

We still loved it and hope to stay here again!"
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very cute and comfortable

2021-07-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Very nice cabin with private parking and super close to the lake. Conveniently located to just about everything you can think of. Great lake house/cabin feel and the hosts were super attentive. Several lakeside grills with the Drafts and Watercrafts being the newest addition on the lake and the lake itself is monstrous. Plenty of activities to do on the water. WiFi worked well and having the washer and dryer in the cabin was great. Hosts have everything covered. We will keep them in mind our next time around that area.
2024-06-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Loved staying at Mathew’s place! He’s very responsive and kind, and the house was beautiful and spacious.

2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Everything About The House Was Great!!
2023-12-01,5,Stayed over a week,"We stayed at this home for the month of December and it was great! We really enjoyed the patio fireplace, the outdoor heater and grill. The house was perfect for two people working remotely. The wifi worked perfectly. The master bedroom had lots of space to store your clothes and a very comfortable bed. The kitchen was designed well and had everything we needed. The couch was super comfortable. The Reserve community is nicely isolated but close to fun cities like Tullahoma, Winchester and Lynchberg. We enjoyed coffee from Fuel Me Up, frappes from The Celtic Cup and breakfast from Bait, Beer and Biscuits. The Food trucks in Tullahoma were great including sushi, gyros, coffee, hot donuts, and tacos!! Lynchberg has great boozey fudge and Winchester is wonderful for coffee and baked goods. We liked the Tullahoma Publix for food shopping, and took ample advantage of Tim’s Ford State Park, only 8 minute drive! Great launch pad to visit nearby Nashville, Chattanooga and Huntsville."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Great place. Wonderful neighborhood and location with access to Tim’s Ford Lake. House was very clean and had lots of great amenities. Perfect for thanksgiving with family.

2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I really enjoyed staying here! I stayed here with a few friends for fall breaks and it was everything we expected and more. The house was very aesthetically pleasing and comfortable. We took full advantage of the fire pit area which was amazing! The kitchen was stocked with pretty much anything you needed. The land surrounding the house were beautiful we weren’t able to get to do everything, but this is definitely an a great place to have a peaceful getaway especially if you enjoy nature! Mathew was very helpful and accommodating."
2023-10-01,5,Group trip,Very responsive host. Property was pristine and very well worth the rental price. Will certainly return if we’re in the area in the future. Excellent experience and excellent weekend out of town!
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Thanks
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We absolutely loved our time at this house. We are already planning our next trip back!
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great location! Golf cart was great way to get to and from the courtesy dock where we kept our boat at the marina. House was the most well stocked we’ve ever stayed in. Comfortable beds. Would 10/10 stay here again.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This was just the get-away we needed. The outdoor space (deck, fire pit, and hammock) were so incredibly peaceful. The home is beautifully decorated and Matthew is an extremely gracious and responsive host. This might become a yearly retreat for my family!"
2023-07-01,5,Group trip,Very clean! Beds were very comfortable!! Covered porch was cozy and loved the TV. Very responsive and would stay again.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Matthew and this location was an oasis, we took a vacation after our vacation. They had the most comfortable beds, couches and linens!!!! So airy and comfortable vibes. Yet, new, clean, and fun. Lots of stuff to do at the house! A golf cart!! Rode that to the path in the woods to a hidden lake bar/restaurant. Pretty rad. Matthew told us all the local attractions towards our group (little ones). Adults only would be a blast as well! Swings in the basement, games, hammocks in woods, fire pits.
And the water pressure was the best I think I’ve ever experienced. So jealous.
Favorite part of our family vacation after our vacation was this house. We made great memories and truly felt in good care along our travels and met a pal to keep in touch with. This spot will be another vacation for us or always a safehaven down the road. Thank you again. Blessed to have stopped."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Our favorite place to stay. Nice little neighborhood with path to the marina. Great host and the house has everything you could want and more.
2023-06-01,5,Group trip,This is our second time staying at this house. We loved it both times and had a great time at beautiful Tim’s Ford Lake.
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"The house by Tim's Ford was excellent! Plenty of room, high speed internet, and within walking distance of the water. Matt was very responsive and proactive, and the area was beautiful. Definitely recommend visiting if staying near Tullahoma!"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We stayed for a month and had a great time. The house is beautiful and well appointed. Matt is an extremely responsive host and any issues that arose (hardly any) were quickly resolved. The neighborhood is very safe and although there aren't sidewalks, it is very walkable as all neighbors were very courteous and safe. The surroundings are beautiful as the house backs up to a nice forest. Excellent Wifi speed and smart TVs in all rooms made things easy. Working from here is not an issue. The house contained all necessary amenities and everything worked as it should. My favorite feature was the covered back deck with fireplace, heater, and TV. Most nights ended here. A great way to end the day. Matt was a great host and was available for any and all questions. My wife and I thoroughly enjoyed our stay and look forward to returning. Thanks, Matt."
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was our first time to the area and we will definitely be back! Great place to getaway and enjoy a peaceful weekend. Loved the house, the host and all of the local recommendations."

2022-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,Great place and great host!
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Our family of 3 wanted a quiet getaway for Christmas this year and decided to go to middle TN. Matthew’s house was the perfect distance and location, nestled in a quiet neighborhood next to Tims Ford Lake. Prior to our arrival, there’d been some winter weather with resultant rolling blackouts. Matthew called and texted me to give us a heads up and was incredibly accommodating. The house was spotless, very well-equipped, and perfect for our Christmas trip. The kitchen lacked nothing — saying a lot since I made 2 huge Christmas meals there — and my law school student son even did a little laundry while there. The outdoor fireplace was our favorite part of the house, but the great room was a close second due to the comfy, unfussy furniture. It was a perfect little holiday retreat, and I hope we can return in the summer when we can take advantage of the lake! Thanks, Matthew!"
2022-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This house was perfect! Mathew was very easy to deal with, helpful, and responsive. We’ve stayed in quite a few Airbnbs, but this house felt like our home for the week - with thick, soft luxury towels and bed linens - fully stocked kitchen - fire pit with a stack of chopped wood ready to go - all of which made relaxing very easy. Located on a quiet street with hiking paths and golf cart access to the lake - where the kids enjoyed feeding the ducks. We had no issues and no complaints. We will definitely stay here again in the future!"
2022-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"My family and I had a great stay at Mathew’s place. The house was very modern and up to date and had the most comfortable mattresses ever. The house had everything we needed. We especially enjoyed sitting on the back porch by the fireplace and watching football in the evenings. Mathew was super accommodating and very easy to communicate with. I would 10/10 recommend staying here. Mathew also provided a list of things to do around the area, which was super helpful. We can’t wait to come back in the summer and go out on the lake!"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The place is beautiful and exactly as listed. It is clean, nicely decorated and very functional. The extras like coffee and a well stocked kitchen was excellent. The host was easy to work with and reach if necessary. Highly recommend this house if you are in the area."
2022-10-01,5,Group trip,"He was very nice and he responded very quickly to our questions, and again best beds I have ever slept in ."
2022-09-01,5,Group trip,"This place is exactly as advertised. We had plenty of room for everyone, the place was clean on arrival with everything you would need to a weekend to extended stay. The back deck with the fireplace and tv was the perfect spot to unwind at the end of the day. It was a great location to travel from to where we had plans for each day and close enough to go back to tullahoma if we needed anything else. Mathew was great at communicating just prior to and through out our stay. I feel like if we needed anything else he would be happy to help us out or get us what we needed. Thanks for a great weekend!"
2022-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,Great spot!

2022-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,Great vacation and a wonderful host! Communication was excellent and he truly strives to make sure everything meets your expectations. The amenities provided with the home exceeded anyplace we’ve ever stayed before. The host has thought of everything.
2022-07-01,5,Group trip,"Comfortable, classy home. Very clean and fresh and bright. Really great back porch with lots of seating. Golf cart made it easy to zip down to the lake and to the Blue Gill Cafe. Mathew is an excellent host, easy to communicate with and easy check in/check out."

2022-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Mathew’s place was immaculate and spacious, everything felt brand new and was perfect for a short stay with our 2 small dogs. It has a very well stocked kitchen with spices and cooking utensils so if you want to cook or grill it’s perfect. Bed was comfy, hot water lasted both people showering, the Wi-Fi was fast. The back porch was heavenly to watch tv and just hang out. The neighborhood is super quiet and safe. We loved taking the golf cart out, was so fun and convenient to take down to the Blue Gill restaurant. Food there is ok but the atmosphere is fun. You can also fish off the docks there. I would recommend Twin Creeks Marina (20 min drive) if you need boat rental that is dog friendly and around that area Emil’s is a great restaurant. Above all Mathew was an amazing host and his communication was top notch, he really made sure we had everything we needed. Would def recommend and we’d love to stay here again."
2022-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"All details have been accounted for.
Great taste in finishes in the home. Extremely clean and comfortable.

The beds were nicer than most we’ve experienced in rentals and Mathew paid close attention to all the details of the property and our stay.

2021-06-01,5,Group trip,We had a very nice stay at this house and Tims Ford Lake is beautiful. The house is quiet new and in great condition. The house is well decorated. I would definitely stay there again.
2021-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This is a wonderful, clean, well-decorated, and comfortable home. The bed sheets are so soft and comfy with luxurious bath towels and everything you would need to feel right at home! The kitchen has a variety of pots, pans and utensils. We were obsessed with the back deck and the nice views of the woods and cozy fireplace, and the fun patio area with corn hole was a nice touch! When we weren’t grilling out on the back deck, we loved to use the golf cart to venture down to the marina, which has our favorite restaurant on the lake- The Blue Gill Grill! There is a nice courtesy dock for boat parking convenient to the house as well. There is room in the driveway for 4 cars or one large boat trailer and 2 cars. Matt provided all the basics like shampoo, conditioner, body wash, dish soap, laundry detergent, and there were even cleaning products to help keep things tidy if you’re a neat freak like me! The washer and dryer are full size and easy to use, as well. I really can’t say enough about this place and Matt, who is very responsive and easy to work with if issues arise. If you are looking for a relaxing getaway near the lake, this is the place for you!"
2021-02-01,5,Stayed one night,FIVE-STARS all around! We booked a last-minute getaway to this beautiful home on Tim's Ford Lake and are so glad we did.

We will definitely be booking again to visit family."

2023-10-01,5,Group trip,Great house loved the property we will be back!!!
2023-10-01,5,Group trip,Beautiful and very spacious home! We had 1 hiccup and the team was very willing and able to accommodate. Other than that; great place to enjoy for peace and wildlife. The air fryer microwave was the best and I also loved the many charging stations.
2023-09-01,5,Group trip,This wonderful Air B n B was just like the photos and descriptions. We were in town for a family wedding so the extra space was perfect. We did not cook but the kitchen was well stocked. Bathrooms were clean and plenty of towels for everyone. Small amount of shampoo etc but we usually bring our own anyway. The setting was so peaceful and we really enjoyed the back covered patio. It was about 10 minutes from Tullahoma where most of our activities were. We would definitely recommend and would stay again!
2023-08-01,5,Group trip,"We had an amazing stay at this well-equipped and spacious retreat. The peaceful country setting provided the perfect backdrop for a relaxing getaway. The cleanliness was impeccable, and there was plenty of room to comfortably accommodate all seven of us. Our only minor suggestion would be to add a toaster or make it easier to locate if I missed it. Overall, a fantastic experience!!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The house is very comfortable, spacious, clean, and beautifully decorated. This house is an 8 minute drive to Lynchburg (Jack Daniels Distillery) or Tullahoma  -  a great location. The host has provided everything you could possibly need – many extras I have not had in other airbnbs.  The setting is awesome with pasture and woods around you. Sitting on the back patio was very tranquil and peaceful – plenty of privacy.  If you have children, the host has provided a pack and play along with a highchair, toy box with toys, games and books and toddler eating utensils. The yard is enormous for any outdoor activities you want to do. I can’t think of much that the host has not provided. She was very kind and responded quickly to any questions we had. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay and will definitely book again! Be sure and read the guide book provided by the host. It has great recommendations for activities and local restaurants…another great touch!!"
2023-06-01,5,Group trip,"Warm, inviting, relaxing, and accommodating. Everything we could ask for in our quick getaway for our family of 6. The place was quiet and peaceful, located in an area that had neighbors but still very private. It's beautifully decorated and very comfortable. Morning coffee on the covered patio was especially enjoyable. Evenings in the sunroom with it's large windows allowed us to enjoy seeing the fireflies dance about (city folk here, don't get to see that very often). We can't speak highly enough about our host. She responded within minutes whenever we had a question and was extremely pleasant when doing so. The home was well equipped with EVERYTHING we could ask for with attention being paid to the littlest of details (welcome snacks and beverages!!!). Our host thought of it all, down to toys. highchair. sippy cups and toddler cutlery for the little ones. If we ever return to the area this will always be our first choice for our stay. Thanks for having us!!!"
2024-06-01,5,Group trip,"Wow! Stayed at Cynthia’s place for a weekend visiting family in the area and to attend a church picnic. The house was so, so perfect! Spotlessly clean, very comfortable beds, a primary bedroom on main for my elderly grandparents - this house was the absolute best! The back porch is the perfect place for morning coffee and nightly chats by the fire. We felt right at home. We’re already looking at dates for the fall. Thank you for a cozy, comfortable, absolutely perfect home!"
2024-06-01,5,Group trip,"This was our second time staying in Tullahoma, and we will absolutely book again. This size home was great for this trip. The screened porch was great, kitchen was stocked, everything was clean, (the cleanest Airbnb I have stayed in). We were in town for a visit to Jack Daniel's for a barrel pick experience. We got up the morning of and took a mile walk through the neighborhood. Everyone in our group enjoyed the experience and the house. Can't wait to come back."
2024-06-01,5,Group trip,"Cynthia’s home was absolutely beautiful. It comfortably accommodated 7 members of our family. The dining area allowed all of us to sit together for meals and catch-up conversations. The kitchen was fully equipped. There were two areas for guests to watch TV, play games or read. The bedrooms were large, beds comfy, and the bathrooms well appointed and stocked with helpful toiletries and lush towels. The surprise was the wonderful screened in back porch with fireplace. The house smelled fresh and clean. I highly recommend this property and host. I would happily return should we be in this area again."
2024-06-01,5,Group trip,The home was exactly as listed plus more! The host was gracious and let us check in early since it was empty the night before. That was awesome! It was easy to find.. easy to get in. We fit 4 cars/ smaller suvs in the driveway. The whole house was immaculate! Plenty of room for 8 of us to spread out. Beds were comfy and it was also nice that each floor had its own thermostat. We hope to be able to stay here again if we return to the area!
2024-06-01,5,Group trip,The Got-Away delivered on all levels! We loved that there is a living area on each level. The screened in porch was our favorite spot for morning coffee. Already looking forward to our next visit!

2024-03-01,5,Group trip,This home is absolutely stunning!Cynthia was also a fantastic host. She was quick to respond to any messages. She also went above and beyond for our stay.

Stop looking and book it now!
2024-02-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"What a lovely place! There is plenty of room to relax and enjoy this house on all 3 levels. The weather was a bit chilly, but my favorite was the screen porch with the gas fireplace. Such a nice floor plan for a vacation home!
The kitchen was extremely well outfitted for cooking and serving meals. It had every gadget and utensil I could imagine, and plenty of plates, glasses, bowls, cups, etc. And each room was thoughtfully and comfortably decorated, with seasonal touches as well.
To sum it up, I’ve stayed at Airbnb’s all over the world and this one takes top prize!"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We enjoyed our stay in this beautiful, well-appointed home. Traveling to a restaurant is a bit out of the way so we prepared most meals in the home, which had everything we could have needed. Despite being close to other houses, the neighborhood was surprisingly quiet. Just what we needed for a long weekend away. One of our favorite activities was walking the trails at the state park which is close by."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Our family was in the area for a wedding. The 8 of us were impressed with the home and all the amenities. The community was quiet and secure. This home is very well maintained.

2023-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,We went with friends for the Thanksgiving holiday week to get away. It was quiet and calm. The house was the perfect get away with a well laid out space.

2023-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We only had one con to our visit! We only had ONE day to stay! This is an amazing house that is super clean and has more than enough room for 7! The only Air B&B that had room enough for ALL who stayed to sit and eat together! Each of the three levels is like a little house on its own! Enough space for everyone to enjoy the company and then go into their own little space to have some quiet time. The back screened-in deck with fireplace was MORE than anyone would hope for. it was great to sit by the fire and unwind from a long day of travel! Down below either in the park or marina, they were having a party and we could hear them on the deck but once inside never heard them at all! So peaceful! There is parking for four very small cars. We had two medium SUVs that had no problems fitting in the driveway. The kitchen was the best-stocked kitchen for cooking that I have ever seen at a rental! All top-quality items. Again more than enough to cook for 8! This is a MUST stay location!"

Beds were very comfortable and lots of space to hang out❤️
Sweet little extras placed in the bathrooms that were perfect for our girls weekend away! The host definitely paid attention to the fact that it was a girls trip with great friends.
Loved the pumpkin spice coffee syrup for the fall season!
It is a quiet little town, so best suited for those who want to chill and enjoy the peace and quiet.
We found all that we need in the kitchen, bath and bedrooms.
We had a wonderful weekend!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We were in the area from out of state visiting family in Wartrace/Shelbyville/Fayetteville and this was convenient to all. The home and neighborhood was beautiful and just as described. Older kids enjoyed the media room/bedroom downstairs and all beds were comfortable, a/c worked well, and home had plenty of extras perfect for preparing meals.

2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Wow! Words truly cannot begin to express how amazing Cynthia’s house is. The house was impeccable from the moment we pulled into the driveway to the moment we left. It was absolutely incredible. My family and I were blown away by the multitude of thoughtful touches and designs by Cynthia that made this house a home away from home. In fact, we didn’t even want to leave! This was, by far, the greatest home we’ve ever stayed in on any vacation we’ve ever taken, and if we are ever anywhere near the area, we are definitely going to stay there again. Thank you, Cynthia!"

2023-11-01,5,Group trip,Everything is exactly as listed. Home is spotless and roomy. Think of it as 3 separate living spaces. We were 3 couples and we could have easily accommodated a fourth.
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,We had a great stay! The home is absolutely beautiful! Very comfortable & relaxing. My favorite part was the outdoor fireplace but my kids favorite was the hot tub! We loved walking down to the lake each day for my kids to do a little fishing. We rented a boat one day. The folks at the marina were great! We went on several different hikes during our stay. There is some really beautiful sights to see in the area! Overall it was a great getaway. Shawn & Jennifer have a wonderful home & were excellent hosts!

2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I’ve stayed at many Airbnb’s and this by far has been one of the best! The hosts were amazingly responsive and accommodating from the time I reached out with questions prior to booking, adding an extra night, during my stay and up until the time I checked out. We were in town for a family reunion in Manchester and this home comfortably accommodated my family. It felt like home! I could live there permanently! The pictures don’t do it justice! Can’t wait to go back.
Thank you both!"

Thank you! Would love to come back."
2023-07-01,5,Group trip,"Jennifer is so warm and welcoming and provided great communication throughout our stay! Any questions I had, she responded to quickly. The home itself is lovely and the layout was perfect for our family with bedrooms, baths, and comfortable gathering spaces on every level. Loved the open kitchen/living room with nice space to gather for conversation, a movie, or meals around the large dining table which could easily have held more than our group of 7. The chair swings and fenced in area out back are nice touches we enjoyed, and although we didn't use the hot tub or fire pit on this visit, if we had visited in cooler weather, those would be great! This place is very convenient to Tim's Ford Lake with 3 different marinas close by (one just 3 minutes away). The State Park is only about a 10 minute drive as well. We really enjoyed our stay and would definitely consider returning to this home next time we return to this area!"

2023-07-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"The neighborhood and location were great! The Reserve was a beautiful little neighborhood with a (steep!) walking path to the Marina. House was beautiful and as listed as description. Main staples available within the home - toaster, drip coffee, etc. A/C felt amazing after a hot day on the lake!
the houses cleanliness definitely could have used some attention. The carpets were not cleaned, was obvious things were not well maintained (broken furniture and tv) and glass all over lower walk out patio.
Overall, we loved the space and our stay, but for what we paid, we wish the home was cleaner."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay. Shawn and Jennifer were very friendly and quick communications.
2023-07-01,4,Stayed with kids,"The location of the home is really beautiful. Spacious rooms and nice decor. Host provided a special request of a baby gate which was very useful during our stay. The house could have used a little more cleaning. Overall, it was a nice stay for my family."

2023-04-01,5,Group trip,Everything was great.
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We loved this beautiful home. Our family spent Easter weekend. The back yard was perfect for an egg hunt for the littles! The kitchen had what we needed for a perfect Easter meal. We loved the fireplace and hot tub. Pictures do not do this place justice. We had more than enough space to spread out and for the teenagers to have their privacy. And the hosts provided enough trash bags, toilet paper and paper towels. Bedding was clean and comfy. And extra blankets laying around made it very homey. Thank you! We hope to stay here again!"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The house is excellent! There were only four of us, but more could have come! There are two bedrooms upstairs, one in the main level and one in the basement. The hot tub was excellent and the kitchen was well stocked with dishes and cooking tools!"

2023-02-01,5,Group trip,"This was a great space to host a girls weekend. It's a beautiful home with very firm beds. There were 8 of us and we all felt comfortable in that we weren't piled on top of each other. We all were able to have our own sleeping areas and there were enough bathrooms so no one was waiting to use a restroom at any time. The hot tub was relaxing and the karoke machine was awesome! The hosts were great, very accomidating and responsive. We requested batteries for the remotes and they had doordash deliver along with garbage bags that were needed as well. The only thing the group mentioned was that although pretty and open the curtains in every window are sheer and there are no blinds so all dressing or changing must take place in bathrooms. This wasn't a major issue for us but realize some may not like the sheerness at night. Overall we had a wonderful stay and I can see us returning for another fun weekend."
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Wonderful location and accommodations for R&R. Hope to return here in the future.
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful home, great location and wonderful hosts! Would definitely stay again!"

2023-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,Shawn and Jen's house is beautiful and well-equipped. We enjoyed the hottub and loved the enclosed deck and fireplace. We would like to come back during warmer months when the marina can be used.
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,It was a nice escape! Great space and plenty of room. Kitchen had everything I needed with high quality appliances. Wish I could have stayed longer.

Beautiful home and very comfortable we will recommend 💯 %"
2022-11-01,5,Group trip,"Their place was really pretty and clean. It had so many rooms and space to spread out in. theirs 3 family rooms I didn't realize, one upstairs, one on the main floor and one in the basement.
They do have a hot tub outside, on the lower patio and a grill, I didnt realize until we got there, so that was dope.
They also have a fireplace on the upper deck that came in handy.
My whole family and I grealy enjoyed our stay and would definitely stay here again."
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Lovely place to stay near Tim’s Ford State Park. Lots of space for a family get-away with 4 bedrooms, lots of TVs, and activity areas. The space is very clean, and the kitchen has everything one would need. So much natural light too! We came in November and Tim’s Ford was still so pretty."
2022-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,Beautiful home with beautiful views in a beautiful neighborhood. Well appointed house with high quality finishes. Jennifer and Shawn are gracious guests.
2022-10-01,5,Group trip,AMAZING !!!! 100/100 recommended!

2022-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We had a fantastic stay at Shawn & Jennifers's beautiful lake house. The house was well decorated and equipped with really nice and quality amenities that helped to make our stay incredibly comfortable. It was also much larger than we originally realized with plenty of great gathering spaces including the living room & patio on the ground level, a large basement as well as an upstairs loft with couches and tv's in each space. The house comfortably accommodated 6 of us. From the patio, you have a view of the lake through the tree's. It's also only a 5 minute walk down to the marina from the house or a few minutes drive to the marina if you're launching a boat. We would definitely stay here again!"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"From the moment that I stepped into the cottage At Tim’s Ford I knew I made the right choice. Shawn and Jennifer were fantastic host and very quick communicators that made everything very simple and made me feel very welcome and prepared. Very well designed, meticulously clean, in the back porch and Jacuzzi tub has an amazing view of the marina. It was really nice to start a fire and sit around as the sun went down. Highly recommend!"

2022-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,A beautiful home! The back porch is amazing and so close to the marina
2021-11-01,5,Group trip,"Well laid out. Each floor has a bedroom (top has two), full bath, closet and, at minimum, a good-sized sitting area. Large screens galore. No cable TV. Rooms are good sized; for example (see site photo) each dining-room bench seats 4 easily. Guest 1/2 bath at the front door. Lots of light. Functional. Pleasingly decorated. Very very clean. Very new when this is written.
When this is written, construction is still ongoing on other cottages in this very pleasant vacation/holiday community connected by golf cart or a vigorous walk to the marina below it."
2021-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,We were their first guests in this beautiful home and we were blown away! We will definitely be back! Shawn and his wife are absolutely wonderful hosts and went above and beyond to insure we were taking care of!
2024-06-01,5,Group trip,This place is absolutely beautiful and the hosts were amazing! Would 100% stay here again!
2024-06-01,5,Group trip,"Probably my favorite AirBnB experience to date! Beautiful home, thoughtfully stocked kitchen, comfortable beds, friendly/available hosts. No complaints! ❤️"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We’ve stayed at many Airbnb’s since our family loves to travel and I would be lying if I said this wasn’t one of my favorites! Where do I even begin?! The host called ahead to see if we needed any special accommodations… my kids broke a coaster holder they had in their living room and when I reached out offering to pay and apologizing they were very understanding and told me not to worry about it! Then, I wanted a few recommendations on good fishing spots and the host gladly provided me with a view good spots. Also, every time I messaged or called they were very quick to respond with anything we had a question about. We went to enjoy my birthday/ Mother’s Day with four kids ages 12,11,2,&1 and this house was more than spacious with a little something for all of us to do! They had a fun kids double bunk room with toys for the littles and even a. Wii system for the older two with guitar hero! My family and I enjoyed the Walnut Hill Coffee Company for breakfast! We will definitely be back"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This home was stylishly furnished, the back porch was amazing, and the kid's bedroom was a huge hit! We had everything we needed for a fun week. The hosts were friendly, responded quickly, and so helpful which I really appreciated."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This home on Tim’s Ford Lake did not disappoint! From the time of our booking until the time of checkout the host was proactive, caring, super friendly, and extremely responsive to everything! We were in town for our daughter’s wedding so we had several questions and a few requests…the host was on top of it all! To be honest, this was the best Airbnb experience we’ve ever had! It was perfect in every way! If you have the chance to stay here…just do it! No doubt you’ll love it too!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed about a week,Hosts are very responsive and friendly. House was perfect for us and just as described. We have stayed at Freedom Property Management’s properties multiple times and will do so again in the future. Thanks for the great stay!!

2024-04-01,5,Group trip,This house was great and the pictures and descriptions were very accurate. Great location to visit Jack Daniel's and George Dickel. the patio TV and fireplace was awesome at night. The grill is pellet smoker and had tons of pellets if you use it.

2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,great location for family getaway to relax and make memories.
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was a short getaway, but had we stayed longer, we would have loved to have taken advantage of all this property had to offer. The home is super clean and beautifully decorated with comfortable seating everywhere. All the pictures in the listing are accurate. The lake is a quick walk or golf cart ride away. Check-in was easy, communication was great, Justin texted to see if we needed anything, and even followed up with a courtesy phone call. The beds are super comfortable. It’s a great get away for a small or large family, as there are so many places to gather in and around the home! The nearby restaurant was closed for the season, but it gave us a chance to go to a neighboring town for dinner one night. (FILO’s Tavern-highly recommend!) It was so peaceful, just what was needed!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We stayed here with our three young kids and were extremely pleased with all the thoughtful amenities, from kids books and games to all the kitchen appliances. The back deck was lovely, and we enjoyed the hot tub, located right under the back deck. TVs and Sonos speakers were in all the main rooms (and the deck), and the bonus room on the second floor was a great space for the kids to play. We enjoyed hiking and biking at nearby Tims Ford State Park, and overall had a great time!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The home is exactly as described. very clean and had everything we needed to fix our meals etc. The beds were very comfortable.

2024-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Above & beyond is the best way to describe this place! The home was BEAUTIFUL. I can’t say that enough. It was about a 15 minute drive from downtown Tullahoma - tons of restaurants and shopping. It would have been even better if it was lake season. The neighborhood itself was precious. The hosts were incredible, so kind and responsive though we didn’t have the first issue. Highly recommend this stay!"
2024-02-01,5,Group trip,"Beautiful home. The company worked with us to figure out parking, so we would not get towed. Check-in and check-out were very easy."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay

It was a great stay for my husband and me, plus my sister and her husband. Courtney was a great host!"

2023-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Our stay over the Christmas holiday was perfect! My family and I have stayed in many vacation rentals, I have to say the cottage was the cleanest one yet! The cottage was well stocked with cleaning supplies, paper towels, toilet paper, plenty of towels. Also very comfortable beds! Our family has already discussed our next stay."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"It was an adorable place and nicely done. Unfortunately for us it was a little too small, not as far as adequate sleeping arrangements for the four of us but it was a little too confining for 4 adults and 2 dogs and the stairs, were as the description said but very steep and none of us adults felt real comfortable going up and down. But it was a really cute place. My grown kids said they would come back as a couple and love it. We reserved it for too long for all of us comfort wise and just decided to leave early."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Exactly as described. Really enjoyed our stay!
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We had a great time at Tim’s Ford Lake. The house was super cute and cozy. We would certainly come back!

2023-09-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"I can't praise this lakeside property enough. It is beautifully and creatively designer-decorated inside and out, well stocked with quality supplies for the bathroom and kitchen, fluffy towels, plenty of coffee, and essentials so you don't have to dash out for items as soon as you've arrived. There was even a scented candle for us to use. The shower has the softest water. There are two great outdoor seating places to sit and relax and admire the view over the lake and trees, or have dinner. It's so nicely designed & comfortable, it was easy to keep clean and tidy. The house is located on an inlet and it was very peaceful. You don't get boats passing. We all loved it here and didn't want to leave.
Chairs are provided at the jetty with a slide and lily pad for swimming. You will want to spend all day there.
Courtney recommended the Holiday Marina nearby for boat rental and for the lively and friendly Blue Gill restaurant which we went to several times."

Everything was fantastic a cottage that felt like a home. Thanks for putting up with our difficult times late night arrivals and check out due the festivities at the caverns. 10/10"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"We loved our stay here! The place is private and beautiful. Amara was communicative, accommodating, and an all-around fantastic host. The bed was very comfortable. I loved that it was on a private road where I could take a jog safely in the morning, yet super close to lots of restaurants and things to do. Really easy drive to get to Jack Daniel’s Distillery too. I would definitely recommend staying here."
2024-04-01,4,Stayed with kids,Anything you could ever need very close by. Clean and owner was very responsive.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"The home was quiet and safe. The town was bigger than expected and a lot of places were closed on a Sunday, but was close to other fun cities. Would stay again"

I have been wanting to hike Machine Falls (trailhead is 15 min away!)for a very long time and this was in a great location to do that. Extremely clean, convenient, very reasonably priced! Beds were so comfy and kitchen was amazing to cook in, well stocked and beautiful granite countertops! Spacious layout! And the shower was amazing, just what I needed after a full day of hiking! Our host even provided toothbrushes and earplugs, the very two things we were needing! lol! It seemed meant to be. The soaps were lovely, I will be purchasing some for my home! I just can’t say enough good things about this stay and all the little touches. Kids had a great time, loved the chocolate bars sitting next to the towels!
My family felt so at home and comfortable here. Thank you for sharing with us!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"My wife and I visited Amara’s place for our second anniversary. We needed a place not too far from home because we were traveling with a 6 month old.
The place was open and airy, very clean and comfortable. They’d put out chocolate and sparkling juice for us and a very kind note to congratulate us. Wonderful hosts!
The little cottage was tucked away in a neighborhood but just couple minutes from any restaurants or grocery stores you may need. There’s a great park with good hiking and a beautiful lake we were able to visit.
We had a great stay and would definitely try to book gain if we are in the area!"

2024-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"It’s the little things when it comes to feeling home away from home and Amara did a really good job making us feel cozy. From the snacks, to the fully stocked kitchen, we couldn’t want for anything. We definitely will be back, with a longer stay as well."

2023-12-01,5,Stayed one night,I was only in need for a one night stay due to a two day sporting tournament at the high school. The location was perfect and price was cheaper than area hotels. Amara was very clear in her communication and providing check in information. I would absolutely stay here again should I find myself back in Tullahoma.

2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"As i was by myself I felt extremely safe.
Managing the temperature in the rooms was easy. I had no need to cook; but kitchen was completely supplied with utensils, pots, pans etc etc.
A little more direct light/ lamp by sofa would have been helpful. If/ when i return, i need to learn how to stream tv.
I have stayed in 4 Air BB in last 2 years; this was the best!!!"

2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Took my littles for a 1 night stay at Amara’s beautiful little home. The kitchen was STUNNING. The decor was comfortable, yet simple (great for littles as there were no glass items to mess with and break). The perfect place to get away from my chaotic home, I felt like I had room to BREATHE! There was a nice bonus of additional things such as bamboo toothbrushes, ear plugs, soaps, candies, fruit and more! Thank you Amara for the perfect stay ❤️"

2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Just as described and reviewed. Great place to stay while we explored the TN Whiskey Trail. Comfortable bed and space! Thoughtful extras! (PS. Road and train sounds were negligible. Room ACs soon were background noise and didn’t interfere w enjoyment of cottage)
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I only managed to stay one night but it was incredible. You can tell when effort has been put in to something, I wish I was more respectful to the Amara and her husband as I came in after a bad day and I will regret that for a very long time. Trust me when I say this family takes Airbnb very seriously. It is a beautiful thing to see."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is a great place to stay! Amara was helpful and responsive, made sure we were okay when a storm hit and the power went out. It is a very nice space, comfy bed, clean bathroom, extras in the kitchen. There is also a nice yard space. I would stay there again!"

2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"The stay was great! I was a little concerned as I was expecting more of a cottage than a barn (based on the exterior), but when I stepped inside I was pleasantly surprised. Its really cute! And completely worth the price. It’s privately nestled between two houses, and the “shared” driveway doesn’t feel cramped. Nor did we feel like we were encroaching on anyone else’s space. Amara was so accommodating, and even allowed us to check in early without a problem. I would recommend this property and the host to anyone."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,Thank you for a wonderful stay! This was the perfect spot to relax after Bonnaroo. We will definitely be back next year.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Amara's place was fantastic. Nice and clean! Amara was quick to respond to me and even allowed us to check in a little early after driving through the night. Would definitely stay again
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,very cute space! east check in and very clean
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,The cottage was as described and worked perfectly for our one night break from camping as we drove cross country.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great!
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We really enjoyed our stay here. The place is very spacious and nicely furnished—comfy sofa and bed. We really appreciated all the extra amenities! The location was great and we never heard the trains others have mentioned. Very quiet. One thing to note is that you have to go through the bathroom to reach the bedroom.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The house was super clean and welcoming. The air conditioning units were loud but tolerable. Overall a comfy and cozy vacation space.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Amara’s place was exactly as listed, and suited my needs perfectly for my weekend visit. An excellent value. I arrived after dark, but the exterior was well lit. Amara’s husband greeted me outside to welcome me and offer a bit of guidance if needed. Check in was easy!!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Amara's place is amazing. very private and quiet! they have everything you could possibly need, and we felt right at home. we will definitely be staying here again!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Would go back
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,Was a great stay for our little family. Enjoyed a movie night with our little family in the very spacious open floor plan living room / kitchen. We really loved the spot and being only 5 mins from my dads house was really convenient. Definitely returning here
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Amara was very helpful and very responsive. The place is beautiful and clean and comfortable.
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Wonderful cottage, peaceful community, with easy access to main streets, restaurants, coffee shops, etc. I used to stay in the local hotels when visiting family and will definitely stay here again in future visits."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"Although we only spent one night, this would be great for a longer stay! There was so much space and would be comfortable for a singleton, a couple or even a family. The location was close to some awesome parks and outdoor spaces, but right in town, so plenty of access to stores and restaurants. Host's recommendation for LuLu's Cafe was welcomed. The hosts were very welcoming and willing to accommodate our needs for a change at check in. Highly recommend."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"The place was clean, cozy, and quiet. My husband had forgotten to bring his toothbrush, but we were pleasantly surprised to see that she provided several toiletries for just in case. She’s very thoughtful and considerate of her guests. We felt right at home!"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"We were only there for 1 night but wished it was longer! Great, stylish, comfortable accommodations. Everything we needed, including a couple of beers chilled in the fridge! Easy to get into, quiet (we did not hear a train?) and felt private. Great bed! Did not want to get out of it! The shower is fantastic. Loved the rainfall showerhead!
The whole place was mobility-friendly. When I stay places, I think, ""could my dad stay here?"" He has limited mobility and things like steps or trying to safely get into and out of a shower are important. The only recommendation would be for a handheld showerhead and perhaps access to a shower chair, which is something that may be available but we did not need it so didn't ask.
Extra special touches: the little tray of things you may have forgotten: toothbrushes, toothpaste, Kleenex, the world's tiniest and cutest packages of Tic Tacs!!
Would love to stay there again!"
2023-04-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Great, open space!"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,Great stay! Thanks for the hospitality

Detailed thoughtful touches were so gracious. Fresh fruit…. and more!!
All was very clean and awaiting my arrival!

2023-01-01,5,Stayed one night,The best design that I have ever seen in an airbnb! Absolutely gorgeous. Private and close to stores. The host was the best of the best. I just was unable to sleep due to the constant trains. A need for ear plugs if you are a light sleeper such like me.
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Darling one-bedroom place! Excellent communication with owner!
2022-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,This cottage is all brand new and nicely decorated.

2022-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"Woodland Court Cottage is a sweet little place to get away and all the amenities needed to feel at home. This cute place is spacious and wide-open living and kitchen area with a walkthrough (full) bathroom into the bedroom. The bed is so comfortable, you’ll sleep well. This cute place is one block off the main road but you would never know it as this guest house sits at a dead end road and is situated just so, you feel like you’re in the country. Watch for wildlife too! During our stay we saw deer every evening, raccoons and a Cardinal. Hosts Amara and Nathan are an amazing couple and so welcoming. Amara’s attention to detail makes this place a relaxing, quiet, peaceful and beautiful place to stay. If you’re new to Tennessee like us, there is so much beauty surrounding Tullahoma and many places nearby to visit. Be sure to check out the towns of Lynchburg, Bell Buckle, Chapel Hill, Franklin, to name a few. Also be sure to visit Machine Falls and Rutledge Falls."

2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We were attending a wedding in a town nearby and selected this lovely home. Newer cul-de-sac neighborhood tucked behind corn fields. The house looked just like the pictures. We enjoyed cooking and spending time on the covered back porch. Just 21 houses down we found a pedestrian/golf path to the Bluegill Grill restaurant and marina. At the front of the neighborhood, we found a walking trail. It has several steep areas but was a good way to get in some hiking/exercise. I highly recommend a walking stick. When we arrived, we had an issue with the upstairs ac and the owner had it addressed within hours. She was a wonderful communicator! If ever in the area we'd definitely book this home again."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Kim was very responsive and helpful, when we needed a last minute place, after a booking error! The house is beautiful and very clean! Had a great time with our family, and look forward to visiting again!! Highly recommend!"

Our Airbnb host, Kim, was professional and we appreciated her prompt communication!"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Many great things about this house…location is remote yet in a neighborhood where many use their homes as cabins for the weekend. Bluegill Grill is just down the road (we drove but you can walk…just a STEEP hill). Check out their website for live music! We rented a pontoon from Bluegill and enjoyed the day on Tims Ford lake.
House has adorable decorations and most of what you need! It states no hair dryer but there was one which was a bonus! Makeup towels were a nice touch and plenty of towels for everyone!
Kitchen has basics…plates, glasses, silverware, pots/pans, strainer/cutting boards and a sharp set of knives. We left salt/pepper! Keurig and a couple games provided.
Tullahoma or Winchester Towns are about 18-20 mins in either direction.
Jack Daniel’s was not to far for a day trip.
Can’t wait to visit again in the fall!"
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The cutest lake house on Tims Ford Lake! Only a couple minute drive to Holiday Landing marina where we were able to rent a boat for the weekend. We had plenty of room - 3 full bedrooms + a bunkroom. We will definitely go back again!
2024-06-01,5,Group trip,We came for my daughter's graduation and had a wonderful time at Carla's home. It had everything you needed and what we did not have Carla ensured that it was provided. Carla was really a superhost!
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Both Carla and her home were incredible! We are locals who are having work done in our home, which forced us out - and nothing makes being displaced a little easier than a smooth check in and a comfy space. Carla was quick to respond to any of my questions, and was most accommodating on the chance that we may have to extend our stay. I will absolutely consider Carla’s property for any future stay-cations!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed about a week,Excellent stay at Carla’s house. Beautiful home and neighborhood. Carla was so kind and accommodating to our group. We will absolutely stay again!!

2024-03-01,5,Group trip,The host was very gracious and understanding
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This lake home was the perfect place to get away from it all and unwind and just be after a day full of work in the area. The surroundings are beautiful with a wooded preserve-type area behind the home. There is a spacious back yard and a beautiful porch that has an outdoor gas fireplace that was lovely to sit beside in the quiet mornings and evenings. The golf cart was easy to access and use and made it easy to navigate the neighborhood. The cart rail was closed while we were there, so we did not get to make it down to the marina, but looked beautifully maintained. There’s a sitting room upstairs on the landing between the two bedrooms along with a full bath. Very easy for two small families or one good size one to retreat in. It was like a house with an apartment. Our host, Derrick was the was the perfect blend of personal and professional. Definitely recommend 10/10."

When i tell you we were exhausted, we were exhausted, HOWEVER, when we arrived at 406 EVANS DRIVE our EXHAUSTION became ENTHUSIATICALLY ready to enjoy Tullahoma, TN, THE LAKE THOUGH, Breathtaking, and its surrounding places.

The kitchen was well equipped (and bonus: snacks were waiting on the countertop which was extremely helpful when traveling with small children). The coffee bar in the dining area was phenomenal!
The living area had plenty of lush seating, cozy blankets, and tons of family games and books. We loved the conversation starters in the Question Books!
All the bedrooms were wonderful; the pillows were the best! Everyone had plenty of space for themselves when they wanted it.
The bathrooms and laundry room were stocked with everything you need for a stay away from home. Another bonus: we fell in love with the towel warmer and are now in search of one to buy for our own home - it was a super nice touch!
The outdoor patio became a family favorite. This space is set up perfectly for families, and we loved it. If we ever go back to Tim’s Ford Lake again, we will book again!"

2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay ! Close to everything.
2023-08-01,5,Group trip,"The home was beautiful and well cared for. My kids loved the upstairs game area and the screened in porch it gave them a place to their own for games and TV. The golf cart was a great addition it made the trips down to the lake easy and fast. We visited some of the suggested waterfalls and parks, and the scenery was amazing. Our week flew by even the rainy day was fun with plenty of games and TVs in the home to keep everyone entertained."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We had a fabulous time at Bueller’s Boat House! The house was beautiful and impeccably decorated, yet still made you feel right at home. It was situated in a prime location to the cart path that leads straight to the lake and marina. Which was made even better by having access to the golf cart. It was very spacious and was perfect for our family trip. The screened in back porch was extra special and made for a great movie night. Farris was so proactive and clear in his communication which was very appreciated. We had a wonderful time and hope to visit again in the future!
Highly recommend this spot if you are looking for a relaxing and fun trip to the lake!!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We had a much needed week to relax at Farris’s place. The house was perfect, and I’m currently searching where to find beds and pillows as comfortable as the ones in the home. The screened in porch was a favorite of ours especially during the rainy days/nights. We loved the coffee bar, kitchen, and also the short distance to the lake.
Thank you for sharing your home with us."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Our stay was wonderful! Farris’ home was beautiful and had everything for a home away from home. It was VERY clean and was beautifully decorated. We had to leave early on checkout day due to work and we were disappointed to miss out on our coffee on the back screened porch. The coffee station was amazing too…better than ours at home. We also appreciated the info that Farris sent on things to do. We took several recommendations and enjoyed the food at Whiskey Trail in Tullahoma and the Blue Gill Grill was great…you could walk or use the golf cart…which was awesome by the way. Rutledge Falls was great too…bring swim suits! The falls were a challenge to get to/from but worth it for sure! Great stay for a long weekend. Thank you!!
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Farris was an excellent host. I’ve stayed at many properties over the years and by far, this was the nicest with an exceptional host. I’d highly recommend this property on Tim’s Ford Lake"
2023-06-01,5,Group trip,"We had a wonderful stay during June. The home is so nice and clean, and Farris is an excellent host. Perfect place to enjoy the lake. The golf cart is a fun addition, and the back porch was our favorite spot to hang out."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,Our family had a great time! The house was laid out really nice for all 9 of us and the screened in porch was a nice touch!! The kitchen had so many extras for us to use while cooking a meal and the house was very clean upon arrival! Would definitely recommend this place to anyone visiting Tim’s Ford lake!
2023-06-01,5,Group trip,👍
2023-06-01,5,Group trip,"Great stay, great house, nice and quiet."
2023-06-01,5,Group trip,Great place to stay!!
2023-05-01,5,Group trip,"After having some trouble with a different rental, we found this home. WHAT A PLEASURE! They got us in early as our other rental was in some ROUGH ROUGH SHAPE. Check in was super easy, neighborhood was nice and quite, everything was 100% as advertised and spotless! We really felt at home here (which is so hard to find in a place) and we will be back FORSURE! This house is GORGEOUS, truly made for a perfect vacation for our family! Thank you!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,An amazing place that is as pretty as postcard. Host could not have been more helpful and courteous. The way this house was furnished and presented was second to none. Highly recommended to anyone visiting the area
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We had to move out of our home to have repairs made after a flood. We live about 15 minutes away. This home could not have been more perfect for our family of 5 for 8 days. Superb amenities , extra special small touches , THAT coffee bar and the kitchen is fully stocked.
The screened porch with the tv was incredible. My kids enjoyed the cart down to the lake.
We didn’t spend as much time in the home but our evenings were relaxing and enjoyable.
Farris called me on our day of check in to make sure everything was as it should be. Nice touch.
We will definitely recommend this Airbnb to any out of town visitors we have.
Thank you. Highly recommend."
2023-04-01,5,Group trip,This house was perfect for our family. We were in town for a funeral and shared the house with 2 other couples in the family. We will definitely be booking again when we have to come back to TN for family functions. Thanks!
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Let me just start off by saying we travel 3 to 4 times a year… For multiple weeks at a time with a baby and also own multiple Airbnb‘s of our own, and this was by far, The cleanest and most comfortable Airbnb we have ever stayed in.
I’ve never felt such comfortable furniture lol the couch’s (living room chair is honestly the most comfortable chair I’ve ever sat in in my life), the little screened in porch, the beds and pillows. This home has everything you need.
I thoroughly pack for us and we also grocery shopped when we got there and we should’ve went to the house first because of the majority of what we bought was left and provided for us, it was so thoughtful and helpful!
We are planning to come back in August for my husband‘s 50th birthday and we will definitely be staying at this home from now on when we travel to the area! Love it.
Thanks again.. we had THE BEST time!"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"My first stay at an Airbnb and it was great! Beautiful house with exceptional attention to detail. The host was proactive and helpful. I recommend this home to anyone wanting a peaceful getaway and families who want to enjoy the great outdoors.
Super clean home away from home."
2023-04-01,5,Group trip,"This was the best Airbnb stay I have ever had. Extremely clean, incredibly helpful host, and so cute! We enjoyed our weekend here SO MUCH! Cant recommend enough!"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"One of the nicest we’ve stayed at. We will keep this on the repeat list. Very responsive hosts and above and beyond with the amenities. They are even shipping my wife’s glasses that had slid back in a bathroom drawer. They made sure to thoroughly search for us. Again, above and beyond! Very peaceful and quiet location."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,The attention to details shown by this family shows how caring and observant they are. From the very beginning all the way to the end I still found my self saying that I forgot something only to find it already available in the house. The coffee bar and welcome snacks we an awesome surprise. This home has more than enough activity for a rainy day inside with 3 kids. Very well thought out and prepared home!! Wonderful hosts as well. And we have come home with some new decor and activity ideas! Thank you!
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The house was as advertised, beautiful and well decorated. Farris communicated with us extremely well throughout the entire process. The house is relatively new and still has that new house smell when you walk in. We especially enjoyed the screened in porch and fireplace. The coffee bar is incredible and well supplied. We had a great time at Bueller's Barrel House and would highly recommend staying there."
2023-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,Great place!
2022-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Our stay at Ferris’s Boat House was everything we were looking for. We celebrated Christmas there and they even had the home decorated for the holidays and it was simply perfect.
The home itself was clean and tasteless decorated and we simply felt at home from the moment we arrived. The area was experiencing rolling blackouts and we lost power when the temperatures were in the single digits, but there were plenty of blankets to keep us warm and the home quickly warmed up once the power was restored. Ferris even offered to come out to the property to check on us, but these things are out of everyone’s control and it simply is what it is. His care and thought was enough and that’s what made the stay that much better.
We can’t wait to return in the Spring and enjoy some of the surrounding activities and the lake, but we were delighted with our stay and recommend it to anyone with a family or looking for some time to simply disconnect and enjoy the peace."
2022-10-01,5,Group trip,Everything we could’ve asked for in an air bnb and more! Farris is an amazing host and their home is absolutely beautiful
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,You couldn’t ask for a better house. The house is set up with everything you need. Great mattress in the master bedroom! Awesome towels and linens. They didn’t miss a single detail ….definitely on point with the short term rental gig! Impressive!
2022-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Absolutely WONDERFUL stay! Clean, stocked with everything you could ever need and MORE! So fun for the kids and adults. Short golf cart ride down to the marina. Highly recommend!"
2022-09-01,5,Stayed one night,Beautiful house! We had a wonderful stay! Thank you!!!
2022-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,Great place to stay. Easy water access
2022-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,The house perfectly matched the description. It was a seamless rental experience and Farris is an excellent host with good communication throughout the rental. I recommend this rental to others without hesitation.
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place was fantastic! A beautiful house, it has to be brand new because everything was perfect. If anyone is even close to this area and needs a place I would do my best to get in this house. You will be happy you did."
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Farris and Brittany’s home is the most beautiful home we have ever stayed in. As soon as we got there Farris called to ask if everything was ok. He was so kind. We were so impressed with everything they provided to make our stay wonderful. We highly recommend this home. It’s awesome!
2022-07-01,5,Group trip,"We’ve stayed in a lot of Airbnb’s and although this one was only a 20 min drive from our home, it felt like a beach vacation! The amenities were perfect and the hosts were more than welcoming and accommodating! We would most definitely stay here again!"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Incredible! Grab this house if it’s available! This home is brand-new and the hosts have not spared any details to make it a fabulous stay! They were incredibly responsive, even though we didn’t even need a single thing! It’s located right next to Tim’s Ford lake and only a golf cart ride down to the Holiday Marina and our new favorite hangout, the Blue Gill grill! Thank you Farris and Brittany for a great vacay!"
2022-06-01,5,Group trip,"Bueller's Barrel House was absolutely outstanding. We were staying for a soccer tournament over an hour away and the drive to be able to stay here was worth it everyday. Their home was beautiful, very clean, stocked with everything you can think of and those things we forgot to bring. Hosts were very responsive, we didn't reach out of for any reason than to repeatedly thank them for their hospitality and amazing home. If I could give more than 5 stars I would. It was fabulous and I would recommend to anyone looking for a peaceful stay in a beautiful home."
2022-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,They thought of everything! We won’t stay in another spot anytime we go to Tims Ford… attention to detail was off the charts! Highly recommend!
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a quiet and restful weekend at Julie’place. It is a working farm, and Julie and her husband shared interesting information about the animals and surroundings. Baby goats, friendly dogs, horses, cows can be petted (Julie provided treats) and only add to a great experience. The barn is comfortable, clean and with all that is needed. There are a couple of good places in town to eat and waterfalls and green spaces to enjoy. We hope to be back."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed over a week,Julie was wonderful to work with. She is very accommodating. Unfortunately we had to cancel our reservation as it was no longer needed. I would highly recommend The Barn @ Dreamcatcher Farm.
2024-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What a fun stay! We loved the animals and the farm was beautiful. The space was clean and exactly how the pictures show. Fridge stocked with treats for the goats and horses. :) Host had a book full of local recommendations - our trip was cut short due to a work schedule, but I wish we could have stayed to check out the hikes she recommended. Thank you!!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Julie’s barn was clean,spacious, comfortable and inviting. All the animals were extremely friendly and we enjoyed getting to know them. Julie gave us a bunch of recommendations we tried out in Chattanooga and Nashville. The waterfalls near the barn were breathtaking. This was one of the best air bnb’s we have stayed at and would love to come back again to explore more."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful farm and excellent hospitality, we would absolutely stay here again"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Stay was perfect. Felt right at home and my son loved how friendly they were. Great place and great people
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,What an absolute gem! It was amazing coming outside each morning and not only having goats and horses greeting you but the pupper (Rocky) as well. Julie makes you feel so welcomed that you feel like you’re one of the family. Her daughter even took time to give us a tour of the farm which allowed the kids to feed the animals! We can’t wait to stay again!
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Wanted to unplug my kids for spring break and this was the perfect way! The kids loved feeding the goats and horses, we went to all of the hiking trail recommendations by Julie and the kids LOVED it. The basketball court even made a perfect crash pad for chalk art and scooter riding. Thank you Julie and I can’t wait to return sans kids to explore the whiskey trail and local breweries!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"I don't have enough good words to say! This is the best Airbnb we have ever stayed at. it was beautiful and well cleaned! Julie and her husband were very welcoming and we even got a tour of the farm and did the morning feedings with all the animals. We have family down the road from here, we definitely will be back!!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The hosts are wonderful, the barn is spotless and comfortable, and the surroundings are extremely peaceful. Love staying there!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This place is awesome. We love it. Our kid love animals and he felt right at home. very quite, peaceful, private place to relax."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Such a fun place to stay! Julie is a great host, very responsive and great with suggestions and if you have a chance for a farm tour definitely take it (she even brings treats to feed the animals!)
The space had all the needed amenities plus a few extra touches in case you forgot something."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This stay at The Barn was better than I could have imagined. You really are up close and personal with all the animals. I felt welcomed and invited and also had space to decompress on my vacation. I will definitely be making this my go to Air BnB on my future trips to visit my niece. Julie and her husband were very accommodating and reliable source for resources about the area. I believe most of the people I met in the area had a very welcoming vibe about them, and Julie and her husband did not let down. I recommend this place to stay. It’s a place that will always add more experiences to your vacation. Thank you again."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,Such a beautiful place to stay quite and cozy
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Do yourself a favor and book to stay here if you are in the Tullahoma area! It was wonderful! I have to go to Tullahoma around once-twice a year for work and I've usually stayed at a hotel. However, I tried an Air BnB this time and I'm so glad I did! The place is a perfect size for 1 person, a couple, of small family. It was clean, cutely decorated, and well stocked for anything you need. She even had snacks left out, which was a lifesaver in the mornings when I had something quick to grab on my way to training. The couple who own the place are the salt of the earth! Absolutely precious! This is the 1st time I've had the opportunity to interact in person with the hosts. They were so sweet and even showed me around their farm and let me feed the cows! As a woman traveling alone for work, I felt safe and had all the comforts of home in a private setting. I will definitely be back! Thank you for your hospitality!"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Julie was a wonderful host! Her place was immaculately clean and very peaceful! Julie greeted us with hospitality but also gave us our privacy. We felt right at home and would absolutely stay with her again!!
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Julie was prompt, courteous, and clear in communicating with us and making sure we were comfortable with our surroundings. We love the area and look forward to going back."
2024-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Everything was perfect for our stay. Definitely a family atmosphere, and even great for a couple to have peaceful, and yet down home southern style living. If we are anywhere close in the area, we will not consider anywhere else!"
2024-01-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Very clean and warm 🙂
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was the best Airbnb we’ve ever stayed at. Clean, quiet and comfortable. Julie made sure we had everything we needed and was very attentive to us. She really cares about her guests and their comfort. Would definitely book The Barn again."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I don’t usually spend the time to write reviews, but for this trip, it’s a must. This place was pure magic. Don’t even think twice, this is the place to book. If you’re like me and you’re looking for the 1 star reviews to “see what people really think” this isn’t the place you’re going to find them. Julie is a 100000/10, the goats, horses, cows, and barn cats a close second. We got to hang with the goats, and feed them snacks. You ever see a horse take a bite of a whole apple, and not just eat it? Here you will.
Here’s the part you’re really here for with this review, I have nothing negative to say. The house was perfectly clean, the shower was nice and hot, washer and dryer a great added bonus.
Julie gave us so many great recommendations, it was truly the best time ever.
Julie I hope this review made you laugh, and I hope it brings in good business. Y’all deserve it!! Thank you again, I look forward to the next time!! (I ran out of space LOL)"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The Barn was absolutely perfect for our stay! I am so glad I chose to stay there instead of a hotel. It was peaceful and calm and we really loved all of the animals!!! Most important to me, it was squeaky clean! Julie went out of her way to help give recommendations and put out a few welcoming items.
It was close enough to the main house to ask questions, if we needed anything, but plenty private as well. We were superbly happy staying there and would definitely go back again!!!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Second stay! Was just as good as the first. I’ll definitely stay again if visiting the area.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,A gem of a find. Spotlessly clean and the location is beautiful and private. Julie offered several suggestions of things to do in the area all of which were great and made the stay that much more enjoyable. Definitely on the list of places for another visit.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Multiple stays for a local hunting trip. Perfect size and location for our needs. Julie was helpful and always responsive. Will, definitely stay again."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This is our second stay here. We haven’t looked for a second option in town since Julie’s place has everything we’re looking for. Rarely do we have time to sit back and enjoy all the amenities here but love the area and visiting. We will be back.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We loved our stay at The Barn. Julie and Herb were very welcoming and friendly with great recommendations. The Barn was extremely clean with lots of attention to detail. Feeding the animals was a real treat!
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We absolutely loved our stay. Julie was wonderful and so accommodating. Such a sweet place filled with beauty. It’s the perfect place to find restoration. The kids (and adults!) loved seeing and interacting with animals they don’t typically encounter. The starry night sky was the cherry on top. If you’re going to be anywhere near the Tullahoma area, stop looking and book here."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"So glad we found this hidden gem. Julie and Herb are the most welcoming and friendly hosts we have encountered so far. The barn was very clean and well equipped, we had everything we needed for our stay. We were given some great local recommendations on things to do and places to eat. Loved meeting all the animals and relaxing by the fire in the evening. Don’t hesitate to stay here, we would love to return."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Julie is by far the most helpful and informative host I’ve stayed with! She gave us a tour of the farm, let us feed and hold the animals, and had lots of great recommendations on places to eat and sights to see! The space was very clean and had plenty of amenities! I enjoyed the town very much and will definitely rebook with Julie when I come back to visit!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The place was just as listed.
perfect location for my destination.
unit was clean plenty of coffee and the animals always make it great."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We loved our stay at The Farm again this year! The accommodations were clean and welcoming as always. Great place, great hospitality, great location, thanks again!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was the cleanest AirBnb I’ve stayed in. My friends, and I really enjoyed the animals, very friendly. The stay as a whole was a nice experience. Would definitely recommend."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The barn was a great stay, my husband and I stayed here on our Honeymoon, there were Several options for food nearby, and Julie was super responsive to our questions and concerns. I highly recommend staying here, especially if you want a different but very cozy stay."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This rental was perfect for my needs. The goats and cats were just something extra nice!
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The barn was the perfect escape for the holiday weekend. Was easy to find and the space was superb. The little amenities to make it feel like home was amazing. Julie greeted me along with her dogs and cat when I arrived. If your looking for a place to experience something new it was worth my 9 Hr drive. Julie was very informative about the area and gave me a range of places to check out. Could not recommend this place more!
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This was my second time here in a year and just as wonderful as the first time. The hosts are always friendly and super responsive. The location is great. And the place itself is so cute and comfy. I’ll be sure to come back a third time!
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Delightful!
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Words can’t describe the coziness of this home. Julie was an amazing host, very attentive and helpful. We felt right at home here and hope to be right back this time next year! I HIGHLY recommend this Airbnb and host ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Dreamcatcher Farm was everything we imagined & more! Waking up to the animals every morning was just wonderful. My girls would've stayed forever if they could. Julie was a fantastic host with amazing recommendations. Everything we needed was right there for us, including a first aid kit that came in handy when one of my littles skinned her knee & I hadn't packed band-aids! We will absolutely be staying again the next time we visit Tullahoma."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We had an incredible stay at The Barn! Julie has put a lot of thought into the space. It was cozy and comfortable and we had all the amenities we needed and more. She was attentive and responsive if we needed anything. She even welcomed us with a sweet treat bag! One of the highlights was getting to see the baby animals on the farm. We highly recommend staying at The Barn and are looking forward to staying again in the future.
2023-04-01,5,Stayed about a week,"This was my 2nd stay at Julie and Herb’s farm. I absolutely love it, and felt perfectly comfortable staying there by myself. They provide everything you might need. I got to meet a baby goat, born that morning… so cute. During our last visit, we were greeted by a kitten, who greeted me again this trip. Julie and Herb are lovely people with a beautiful farm. My family lives in Manchester and I was so pleased to find this place as a welcome alternative to a hotel. I will stay here again and again."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The Barn is a fantastic getaway. It is even cuter than the pictures, spacious and spotlessly clean. Julie is an excellent host. She gave us restaurant and park recommendations, arranged a play date with her baby goats and delivered a yummy snack tray when she heard we we’re staying in to watch the Final Four. Her home is surrounded by warm and fuzzy animals with a few horses and cows to boot!"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Easily one of the better accommodations listed on Airbnb. Great location if you’re looking to get out of the city but still within easy reach of multiple attractions in the surrounding towns. Julie was very helpful with recommendations. Cherry on the top was small touches inside the accommodation to make you feel at home (coffee, snacks, toiletries if you left anything behind)."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Our stay was perfect. We had a wonderful time! My boy saw his first waterfall, mountain, concert, and got to hold a baby goat. It will be a trip he will always remember. I’m grateful for our hosts allowing that to happen!"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"WOW! My family and I had the best experience. My daughters got to feed the horses, goats and cows and a bull.
Julie was always responsive, Herb and Haley gave us a personal tour of the farm and intro to all the animals and the history of the farm.
We'll be back! An experience that won't be forgotten."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a great time! Julie was a fantastic host, and maybe we'll be back sometime! Highly recommended"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What a wonderful 40th anniversary we spent at the DreamCatcher Farm! Julie was a friendly and helpful host with great suggestions on things to do, however, the time spent with the animals on the farm were the highlight of our stay! The apartment is quiet with all the amenities and then some. Julie made our long weekend getaway so special and unforgettable! We are already planning another trip in the Summer; I have sent the link to friends, too! We will be back, Oliver, Sweetpea, Rocky, and Reese!"
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We loved our time there. We came to middle TN because it’s one of our favorite places to visit. Julie’s house is located in Tullahoma but very close to Manchester, where we visited Old Stone Fort. They left us a nice card on the counter and the next day, they took us around their farm and showed us the animals. Then we just sat and talked to them for a while. Very easy to talk to and very friendly. We enjoyed our conversations with Julie and Herb. It was a lovely little house, with everything you need. Very clean. Lots of nice touches, like water and snacks. We will always remember our visit there and we thank you very much for everything. God bless."
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Thank you to Julie and family for always making our stay at The Barn the highlight of our trips to Tullahoma. We got an extra special treat this time getting to know the baby goats.
Thank you for always making us feel so welcome! We absolutely love The Barn from the cleanliness to the hospitality, we couldn’t ask for more! Til next trip!"
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Our stay was definitely a relaxing one! Great location, near so many outdoor activities. Even staying in was so peaceful and accompanied by some great little and big friends! The goats, cows, horses, cats, and dogs were so welcoming as well as the hosts :)
For sure will be back during the warmer months to swim in the nearby water! If you don’t stay here. You’re missing out!"
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This was such a nice place to stay! Julie was very nice and quick to respond with any questions! We would definitely love to stay here again.
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I was hesitant to book an Airbnb, my last few stays were not what was expected. But Julie was a gracious and welcoming host. Their little hideaway is perfect for a weekend getaway. Our day and a half there felt like 3 or 4 because we were able to slow down and relax. 10/10"
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We were extremely satisfied and the attention to detail was outstanding….. better than a 5 star hotel. We loved the animals and felt right at home. I was taken back by the personal touches. Thank you Julie for having us as your guests !!!!! We will definitely return.
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is by far the best Air Bnb we’ve ever stayed at! Julie was an amazing host, everything was as it said it was in the listing. The area is very peaceful, but not to far from numerous things do in the area. If you’re planning to visit the Tullahoma area, you NEED to stay here!
Getting to meet the Baby goats was the icing on the cake!"
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We loved our stay at the farm!! The baby goats were so adorable! We loved seeing them every morning. We look forward to staying there in the future if it’s available and will recommend to friends coming to the area!
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We really enjoyed this get away from the world and would love to visit again! Had lots of recommendations of things around the area to do. Very peaceful.
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was without a doubt my favorite place I've stayed so far. From start to finish you can see the thoughtful attention to detail that Julie puts into everything. The unit itself is actually incredibly spacious and functional ~ it's also squeaky clean but still feels super cozy and comforting... and the best part... what you're surrounded by...rolling acres of gorgeous land with friendly farm animals at every turn. It truly is one of the most revitalizing, peaceful and pure places I've stayed at... needless to say will be back again :) Thank you Julie for providing such a special experience!"
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Above and beyond care and service to make our stay very special!
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The Barn was located at a very peaceful location, off the beaten path, and near our planned family reunion/Thanksgiving get together. The unit had all the amenities one would need, and Julie thought of many other details that you typically don't find in an AirBNB, such as extra toiletries, phone cords next to each side of the bed, and extra batteries just to name a few. Julie was very responsive, before, during, and after our stay. We have family in the Tullahoma area, and we will certainly be booking the Barn again for our future outings."
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was a surprise weekend away for my husband. He had no idea until we got there. The place was quiet and peaceful. LOVED the farm animals!!! Julie was very helpful from the time I booked the reservation. She suggested a great restaurant for the special occasion and made sure we had clear directions to find the ""barn.""
Will definitely stay here again!!!"
2022-11-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"By far the cleanest and friendliest Airbnb that I have stayed in. I would stay here again, clean and cozy absolutely perfect for a couples getaway."
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My husband and I enjoyed celebrating our 15th anniversary at the Barn at Dream Catcher Farm. The place was clean, cozy, and comfortable. The decor made it feel nice and homey. Julie was very responsive in communicating with us and even went out of her way to set up the fire pit for us and provided stuff for us to make s'mores. Feeding the animals was a fun experience. There are several hiking trails and waterfalls nearby. My favorite part though was Lettie, one of the barn cats. She was the sweetest thing ever! She spent the first evening curled up in my lap at the fire pit, purring away, making biscuits, and giving me kisses. We would definitely love to come visit again. Perhaps next time there will be some baby goats as others have mentioned in their reviews."
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Julie was a wonderful host. She suggested many cool places to visit, places to eat, and checked in on us throughout the visit to make sue we were comfortable. She even gave us some treats to feed the goats and cows. The ""barn"" (I use it loosely because it is quite nice)is very nice and updated. There is a nice kitchen and large bathroom. Plenty of space for the two of us to be comfortable. We even had a nice rainy day staying inside and watching a football game.
We stayed here for a concert at The Caverns music venue. It is about a 30 minute drive but a very easy one straight down the highway. I really don't think there would have been anything of this quality any closer to it.
There are beautiful sunsets every night across the fields and we got so many laughs watching the goats.
All around a wonderful, quiet weekend getaway. Will definitely stay here again if I am in the area."
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We visited Tullahoma to see family and stayed at The Barn. Julie made our trip perfect. The location was great, The Barn was amazing. Super clean, well stocked, so cute and comfy. The highlight while staying at The Barn was feeding the goats, horse, and cow. Thank you for making our trip complete!"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Dream catcher Farm is like something you see in the movies. It was super clean, super happy animals and beautiful scenery! Julie is an excellent host and very communicative! Me and my fiancé wished we could’ve stayed a bit longer to take it all in since we were there for a local event and didn’t have time to mosey around the Farm. 10/10; absolutely recommend!!"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Really nice couple on a beautiful lot with awesome animals. The place was immaculate, well decorated, full kitchen, and comfy! Wish I could stay here again but it's always reserved!!"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had an amazing stay out in the Barn. Our timeframe didn’t allow for much of a chance to see the animals on the ranch other than their super friendly cat. She? I think? greeted us home nearly every night. Coffee was provided and they also left a gift that was appreciated on our late arrival. Everything was clean and they had a comfy Murphy bed. Overall, we enjoyed ourselves and we will be back!"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What a wonderful stay! My mom lives in Manchester and I was thrilled to find The Barn which is five miles from my moms’ home.
Thank you Julie for so many thoughtful touches and for your incredible responsiveness each time I reached out. My husband joined me on this trip, but in the future, when I visit by myself, I will not hesitate to stay here alone. An added bonus was the precious little kitten that would greet us each time we arrived back at The Barn and the cow that seemed to watch us each time we headed down the drive, almost like he was saying goodbye. Lol. We slept amazingly well while we were here. Thank you Julie, for your obvious thoughtfulness and opening up your amazing property to guests like us."

Rutledge Falls and Machine Falls are a must see, especially in the summer if you are looking for a nice swimming hole. We also had a wonderful day in Lynchburg eating at Mary BoBo’s and touring Jack Daniels distillery. We would love to stay again if we are ever back in the area!"

They even let me hold the baby goats (definitely a highlight of the stay!). The farm is so charming with all of its friendly animals. The barn itself is extremely clean and equipped with everything you need for a home away from home. Julie was even kind enough to help me right away with the TV when I couldn’t figure out the Internet. Also, I was super excited that a few great hikes were only minutes away from this location. It really was perfect and I can’t wait to come back."
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We stayed at The Barn while seeing two concerts at The Caverns. The location of the Air B&B was a short drive away. The place was immaculately clean. There were provisions in case you forgot something and it was a perfect size for the weekend.
It was very quiet-we got in late and slept in and I never heard them feeding animals or coming or going.
Julie gave us great recommendations for dinner (one22) and lent us umbrellas. She was very accommodating and easy to work with.
We would stay here again if we’re in the area!"

2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The Barn is a little hard to find because Google Maps took me completely took me to the wrong address. Fortunately, the hosts provided another way to find their place.
I was very impressed by how super clean the apartment was when I arrived. That is not trivial since you are out in the country. The other thing I noticed right away is how well equipped the apartment is. There’s everything from a full sized refrigerator to a washer and dryer. This would be a great place for a long term stay since you have everything you need.
Julie thoughtfully provided an array of snacks and drinks, including ingredients for s’mores. . I didn’t make any s’mores, but I did eat a couple of pieces of chocolate.
I’d definitely come back to stay again, especially when the baby goats are around!"

2022-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,"My family and I loved our stay in the barn! It was clean as could be and fully stocked with everything we could have needed!

We had everything we needed for our weekend and there were extra touches that Julie had added that made our visit more memorable . Julie was quick to respond and gave us some great advice on hikes, restaurants and biking. We intend to visit the farm again for a longer stay. Thanks for hosting us!!!"

Accommodations were clean and exactly what we needed. I will recommend the Barn to friends who travel in this area!"
2022-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Julie's Airbnb is located on a beautiful farm with sweeping views of blue skies, deep forests, sweet farm animals and dogs, and the perfect resting place with all the amenities. She was extremely accommodating of our requests, which I appreciated so much. We played basketball, fed the animals, and built a bonfire with her permission in the designated spot. It was lovely to hear the sweet melody of wind chimes off in the distance as we sat in front of the warm fire. It was as if the forest was singing to us. The Airbnb space was spacious, modern, very clean, and well appointed with a comfortable bed! Could not ask for a more perfect stay! Thank you!"

Great location when it comes to hiking, to get away from city noise and perfect for families who want little ones to see animals and learn some cool things about them. Our family had an amazing time at the barn and meeting Julie's family.
They were always looking after us and made sure we were comfortable before we even started our road trip. We were welcomed with a warm apartment on a cold night. Which was the perfect way to receive guests. Julie and her family provided tips on nearby parks were we could hike and see some waterfalls. They taught us how to care for some animals in the farm and we also had snuggle time with some newborn goats. We fed the horses, kitties and the goats. Such a great experience. We are looking forward to coming back again and catching up with everyone.
You will not be disappointed with Dreamcatcher farm!"

Their fire pit was awesome and the apartment was immaculate, full of little touches - like charger cables, that most hosts wouldn't think of. The farm was also so convenient to at least three breathtaking waterfalls/hikes, not to mention great restaurants, coffee shops, etc. It couldn't have been easier to find and navigate.
