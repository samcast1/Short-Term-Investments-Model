2024-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Beautiful home and cool garage. Would stay again!
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Loved this cottage!! We enjoyed a relaxing family gathering in the game room/garage…what a gem that space is! The house was immaculate and very cozy. Kent is an A+++ host; very easy to communicate with, gave us all the info needed and always very quick to reply to questions. We felt right at home!"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Kent & Erika’s place was just what the doctor ordered! Unfortunately it was not a vacation that brought my family to Iowa. It was a medical emergency. My father-in-law was in crisis in a hospital near Clear Lake. We needed a place to stay quickly and were resigned to staying in a motel until I found Kent’s place. Erika responded right away and we were able to check in same day. They were extremely responsive, sympathetic to our situation and made it seamless to transition to their place quickly. They were even flexible on extending our stay if we needed to given the uncertainty of my father-in-law’s situation. Staying at Kent & Erika’s house was the best decision we could have made! It was comfortable, had plenty of room and allowed us a place to decompress when not in the hospital. It would be an amazing vacation spot in spring/summer since it’s a stones throw from Clear Lake! I can’t thank Kent & Erika enough for their hospitality!"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed with a pet,A+ host.
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was a nice place for a short stay. The house was clean and presented as advertised. The only negative was the TV which was streaming only, no network channels so we couldn’t watch football on Sunday. Maybe if we had a teenager along they could have figured out how to make the thing work. Not a big deal."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We loved our stay at this modern cottage in Clear Lake! The process was easy and had great communication from reservation to check-in to check-out. The house was well equipped with all of the essentials for cooking, sleeping, and bathing! The outdoor areas like the porch swing and fire pit were comfy and super fun for our 3 year old. The quirky style inside was fun for a getaway with the tin ceilings and square black toilet. We wished there had been more family friendly seating inside like a small dining table and outside for around the fire pit. The location was super convenient - walking distance to parks and South Shore Donut Co. Overall a 10/10 experience and we will definitely be back!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place a block away from the lake. Plenty of room with a spacious separate garage. Had plenty of amenities for our short stay. Highly recommend staying at Kent’s Lake Retreat!
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"The house was a great get-a-way location for our quick family vacation. The beds were comfortable. The house was clean. The kitchen appliances were very nice, making cooking a breeze. The garage was a fun extra space to relax and watch a movie."

2024-04-01,5,Group trip,"This was the perfect place for our mini-family reunion. Enough space to spread out in each room, yet have time to gather in the living/dining room and enjoy our evening meals together. We enjoyed watching the ducks & geese float down Willow Creek while having breakfast.
Kathy was very responsive and flexible to our family needs. We will definitely rebook for our next family gathering in Mason City!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great stay at Comfort on Willow. We appreciated the backyard view & patio furniture, easy walk to East Park & ability to use the garage. We had everything we needed to cook meals. Looking forward to our next visit."
2024-02-01,5,Group trip,Mason City has little treasures to see and do and this home fits right in next to the creek and small wildlife. Kathy is a great host and would recommend staying here.
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I've stayed many times alone and with friends. Always feel safe and welcome. Backyard has a creek running through it with some beautiful deer that visit nearly every day. It is a peaceful and comfortable get away.

2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The view looking out the kitchen window was great. We spent a lot of time sitting on the patio just watching the wildlife and the creek. She even had tiki torches to help keep the bugs away. Very peaceful relaxing home to get away to. This was so much better then staying at a motel for the weekend. I would recommend this home to everyone.

The house is charming and the location is absolutely beautiful. We had a very fun and relaxing stay.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,We absolutely loved staying at this house! We’d been driving for 12 hours and were exhausted and irritable when we arrived. Kathy’s signs made the house easy to find and getting in was a breeze. We walked into the house and everything looked nice and tidy then when we walked into the kitchen and saw the huge picture window with a view of the AMAZING back yard we instantly felt more relaxed. We walked out the back door and the first thing we heard was birds chirping then the next thing was the sound of the creek babbling at the bottom of the hill in the yard. We spent a great deal of time on the patio in the pack yard because it was so peaceful! We will definitely stay here again if we ever travel back to that area! Kathy was also a great hostess and very responsive to our requests and concerns. STAY HERE if you’re looking for a place in the area!

2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,Nice place to stay while in town for a wedding. The creek was beautiful but it’s been a really buggy summer there so didn’t get a chance to walk down. Very cute old home but the floors are very creaky as I’m sure they’re original hardwoods so if you’re traveling with light sleepers just keep that in mind! Overall had a lot of essentials and was well stocked.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed over a week,"Kathy is attentive, polite, friendly and with just the right amount of contact with us. We enjoyed our stay. Our first time with AirBnB. We will do it again."

2022-09-01,5,Group trip,"We had a fantastic stay over Labor Day weekend. I needed to get my husband away from the house so he wouldn’t do any work because he had some minor surgery a few days before, and this was just a place. Nothing to do but relax. The house was spotless, and Kathy wins a major award for having lots of extra stuff. There were spices, extra condiments, loads of extra towels, pillows, sheets, even earplugs. Sitting in the backyard every morning having coffee was great as we could sit and watch the creek go by. Even saw a mama and her two baby deer run across the backyard our first morning there. Thank you for a lovely weekend and if we ever are in the area again, we would definitely stay again."
2022-09-01,5,Group trip,Comfort on Willow lives up to its rating! It’s in a great location and very well maintained. The cleanliness and amenities are first rate. It’s easy to tell how much the owner cares for the house and in making her guests as comfortable as possible. Awesome place!

It was the perfect size for our family, as we had three adults staying there and two additional adults came over for a day of fellowship. The setting was quiet, and we especially enjoyed the backyard extending to a creek for some peace and quiet. Kathy even had firewood, camp chairs, and a fire pit available for use, which we were able to utilize for one evening. The amenities were wonderful, especially the variety of kitchen utensils for use, which included a toaster and an air fryer. This definitely served as a home away from home for us, and we couldn't have been more pleased. Thank you, Kathy, for a wonderful stay! We will definitely look here first if we come back to Mason City!"

(It’s winter here now) The kitchen has a great view of Willow Creek and the tall natural limestone wall on the far bank... great for watching nature and relaxing.

2019-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great house. The back yard is fabulous! So peaceful. Loved sitting outside at the patio table with coffee and just taking in nature. It's close to the main things to do in Mason City. Everything very clean. Well equipped kitchen. Even had some cards and other games that you could play. We had a wonderful stay.
2019-09-01,5,Stayed one night,This Airbnb is in a great and quiet location in Mason City. This is the second time renting from Kathy and we hope to do it again.
2019-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This sweet 2 bedroom home is in a quiet relaxing special location in Mason City, Iowa. Very close to downtown and historic neighborhoods but since the back of the house is alongside Willow Creek, you feel like you're in the country. The creek is beautiful with bluffs and light playing against them, and abundant wildlife - we saw herons, deer, ducks, geese and heard about minks. The house was spotless and squeaky clean. Kathy is a wonderful host, very welcoming and available. We had a great visit and wished we could have stayed longer."
2019-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,Kathy was a lovely host to my friend and I when we brought our children for a short vacation. The kids loved the creek and it was nice waking up each morning and having coffee to the soothing sounds of nature. The house was comfortable and had everything we needed. It was also close to the downtown area and we were able to walk to restaurants and the art museum.
2019-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Very nice place to stay. Great location, great setting, very clean and comfortable."
2019-06-01,5,Group trip,"Kathy’s home was a great place to stay while in Mason City for a wedding! The home was in great shape, was in a perfect location, and Kathy was a fantastic host. She was readily available whenever we had a question, and she even offered to bring up fresh firewood for her outdoor fire pit. I highly recommend Kathy’s home to anyone wanting to spend some time in Mason City!"
2019-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What a great place to stay. Clean comfy, relaxing. You couldn't tell you were in a city at all. I could sit outback all day and listen to the river and watch nature."

2019-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Very cozy little house. I loved the cheery colors and little touches. Beautiful large windows with a great view of the creek behind. Very glad to have a garage w/ remote to park inside in the wintery weather. We also enjoyed the medium-sized hill in the backyard for sledding - big enough to be fun for the kids but small enough to not get too tired climbing back up it!
Check-in was super convenient even though we arrived late thanks to the keypad lock. Kathy stopped by to check on us and make sure we had everything we needed.
Price was comparable to a single room at the local hotel but so much more space and amenities plus we were able to have separate spaces for kids and parents and hanging out before/after kids went to bed. (BTW - our 5 & 11 year old kids both gushed about how silky & soft the bedsheets were!) The kitchen was very nice and well-equipped for our simple meal prep and saved us money and indigestion compared to eating out every meal."
2019-02-01,4,Stayed with kids,A nice place and host near central mason city and a peaceful view in back. Cute!

We look forward to staying there in the future!"
2017-11-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Host requested to switch us to their personal residence instead of the home we rented the day before we arrived for our stay. After communication between the host and airbnb we did ended up staying in the home we rented. Dealing with the back and forth communication took up part of my day and caused unneeded stress.
Once we arrived at the house check in was a breeze and the house was exactly what we expected. Host was cheery and friendly she brought us freshly baked banana bread before she headed out of town. The host was available to contact throughout the weekend and questions were answered promptly. The house was clean, cute, and had an amazing view of nature. We had a wonderful relaxing weekend."

Not disappointed at all in our stay."

In the evening - curl up on the sofa - wrap a blanket around you and enjoy a movie or book or cozy chat - unless you are by yourself - then sing aloud! Conveniently located and so much more than a hotel.
Tracy was a most gracious host - she answered questions promptly and was there whenever I had a question- well the three times I had questions."

2023-11-01,4,Stayed one night,"Pretty lights were on and in the den, a string of lights came on in the evening and off at night. Rustic was just fine and without WIFI we talked, played games, and took time to unwind. Fresh eggs in the refrigerator made for an easy and ""country"" breakfast. Candy jars on counter had seasonal treats! Instructions on counter and signs posted around helped us know the quirky things to pay attention to and how to navigate appliances and take care of trash. Well done."

the old farmhouse has been well kept and well stocked. Janelle communicated well and was a good host.
I would not call this a 2 bedroom. it's a 1 bedroom with a nursery. I was traveling for work and this resulted in one of us sleeping on the couch in order for each of us to have some privacy. for a couple with small children this would be an amazing stay."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"what a wonderful stay. I wish we had more time. it was such a kid friendly space, inside and out.

2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"A very cute, homey place! We weren’t able to check in until later in the evening, but Jenelle made it easy for us. And the farm fresh eggs were an added bonus!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is a wonderful, peaceful farm stay. It is an old farmhouse, so if you are looking for sleek and modern, it may not be the place for you. For us it was perfect. Jenelle has it decorated in a sweet farmhouse way. She left menus for the nearest restaurant and fresh produce and snacks. She was quick to respond to messages. I confess, I was a bit worried when I realized it was in the middle of a wind farm, but the trees provided great privacy and I barely noticed the windmills. Watching the wildlife and listening to the crickets at night was a delight."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"What a delightful place. Although it certainly lives up to the rustic name, the little touches and cute details were tasteful and very well received. If we’re ever in the neighborhood, we will stay at Rusty acres again, we enjoyed the serenity. Jenelle was a great host."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"Our stay was great! It was very peaceful, quiet and spacious! Janelle was a fantastic host and answered any questions we had. We will definitely be staying there again!"
2023-08-01,4,Group trip,"I booked this Airbnb same day and it was super easy to check in. I messaged the host when I booked it about fire restrictions in the are and she told me there were none and there was even extra firewood in the backyard that we could use. When we arrived, there was a note on the counter from the hosts stating , “we would prefer no fire.” We were afraid that if we had a fire anyway that we would receive a bad review. We also felt rushed to leave before checkout, in the same note, the hosts indicated that someone was checking in after us and to let them know when we left so that they could clean. Overall, it was a convenient stay, but the note felt passive aggressive and made us all a little uncomfortable."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The property was absolutely beautiful. There’s something very special about being in the pristine Iowa farmland. It was a truly relaxing & very cool place to stay.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"Jenelle's Rustic Farmhouse was very quiet and peaceful. Comfortable beds and extra touches like farm fresh eggs, snacks and welcome note made the stay extra special."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Very cute and comfortable house. We booked very last minute, and we were very appreciative that they accepted it with such short notice. The farm fresh eggs were a very nice bonus, along with the snacks and drinks provided that were able to hold the kids over until dinner. We would stay again! The pictures don’t do the place justice, at all. Everything was very clean."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"The place was a blast from the past. It was like waking up in my old farm house. Good instructions, little extras were much appreciated. Extremely private and peaceful stay."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Wow! We were blown away with this place. We needed a place to stay on our road trip from Missouri to Minnesota & this couldn’t have been more perfect! We have a very active (almost) 2 year old, & to say this place is kid-friendly would be be an understatement! There were so many thoughtful little details for families, from a high chair to a step stool. It was amazing! Would highly recommend to anyone traveling through the area, but especially to families with littles!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Every time I stay here, I enjoy it."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I loved the farm fresh eggs and this time there was home made strawberry jam in the refrigerator for only a 3$ purchase. It was like staying at a farmers market. If you stay here make sure to stop by a grocery store in your way, there is a full kitchen and even a charcoal grill so you can prepare dinner. There is only a gas station nearby. I enjoy my stays here."
2023-07-01,4,Stayed one night,"This house was great for a family vacation. Jenelle had complimentary snacks, fresh eggs, cold water and juice available. We really appreciated that after a long drive.
There were instructive notes posted around the house and handmade/homemade items for sale, which I thought was a charming touch.
Jenelle was very responsive and friendly."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"My family stayed for a night and I felt like I was visiting my grandmas farm. We enjoyed exploring the grounds of the old farm and checking out all the things growing. Lots for little kids to explore if they enjoy outside. The house was warm and welcoming. Extremely clean! The little surprises left for us were much appreciated! Janelle makes hand embroidered tea towels for sale and it was hard to decide which to buy, a great souvenir to remember our stay! Beds were extremely comfortable. Farm fresh eggs- the best we have had. If you want a relaxing getaway- this is your place!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place is such a treat. I expected less and was rewarded with so much more. Is it an older rustic farmhouse? Sure! But sit outside in the morning for just a couple of minutes and see a deer family playing, squirrels chasing each other from tree to tree, then come the bunnies all while the sounds of birds echoing around you Very Clean. Helpful instructions complete privacy, and great hiding places for my child and his young cousins"
2023-07-01,4,Stayed one night,"Jenelle's place was a quiet, peaceful stay for myself and my group while passing through the area for 1 night. Her place offered a very spacious living room area and a good sized kitchen and bedrooms. That being said, there was pet hair that was on the couch that my friend slept on and also rust in the water while my friends were taking showers during our stay. Overall, it was a decent place to stay, but future guests should be weary of the issues that I described above during our time there."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Fun stay especially considering options in area.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Beautiful old farm with lots of wildlife. We got there and there was rain the first couple days. (The locals were quite happy!) Enjoyed sitting on the front porch, drinking coffee, and watching the rain. So peaceful."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I loved my stay. I would come again.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,Jenelle offered such a beautiful and serene stay at this private farm location! I spent the entire time outdoors hammocking and also enjoying the nights at the provided fire pit. I encourage everyone to book this beautiful home for their trip!
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great private place to stay, you get the whole house to yourself. Beautiful surroundings and mowed paths to walk."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,We really enjoyed the stay and beautiful surroundings!
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We enjoyed our stay. This is an old farm house surrounded by fields and turbines. It was peaceful and we enjoyed sitting in the yard watching baby birds. The house felt like a time capsule. It smelled musty when we first walked in but otherwise was quite clean. It’s family friendly with toys, a crib and booster seat."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"Super cute rustic house with plenty of privacy. Lots of thoughtful little touches throughout and a great fire pit. Also, the hand embroidered towels are a steal for $3, make sure you bring a little cash."

2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,We booked the place last minute for a cross-country drive and Jenelle was very helpful to get the place ready and let us in pretty late at night. The space is very large and comfortable and there were farm fresh eggs for breakfast. We wished we could have stayed longer to enjoy it!
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,Old ranch house with lots of character. Got to play the old upright piano.

2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I thoroughly enjoyed my stay. The location was perfect and very private. I look forward to staying in the farmhouse in the future. Her farmhouse brought back wonderful memories of growing up in my farmhouse in Illinois.
2023-03-01,4,Stayed one night,"Very cozy stay near Mason City. Just what was needed for my trip. Could feel the history of the place. Janelle left water, juice and farm fresh eggs in the fridge which were a nice touch for our morning breakfast. Flexible with check out time. Nice stay!"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"It was a great place to stay. It is cozy, tidy, and spacious. I would suggest brushing with a water bottle instead of the tap though. I would stay here again!"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Staying here was what we hoped for and expected! Charming farm house with easy access to HWY 35. Extremely clean, well stocked, and kid friendly which was a pleasant find. Homey and comfortable place to stay, highly recommend."

2022-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Great place, Jenelle made check in super easy and is quick to respond to messages. Definitely recommend this place."
2022-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Lovely gem tucked away on a peaceful property. If you’re looking for modern, new, super clean this is not the place for you. It is very clean but it’s an old farmhouse. Simple and spacious, with walls that you can tell have been filled with love and life over the years. Brings back memories of visiting grandma and grandpa on the farm. Deer in the yard, a fire pit and wood, even wild grapes to pick and eat. We loved the place and plan to return just to step back in time and unplug. Thanks you for being a great host."
2022-09-01,4,Stayed one night,Great place for a quick overnight!
2022-09-01,4,Stayed one night,"Rustic Acres is a great place to find peace and quiet. Roomy and comfortable. Juice, water and breakfast rolls were provided. All in all a good value."
2022-09-01,5,Stayed one night,Beautiful property
2022-09-01,5,Stayed one night,Rustic and spacious. If you grew up living in the country you'll feel right at home. If you're a city person you'll still feel comfortable. Loved the fire ring outside. We slept 2 people in the main bedroom and there's a twin bed in another room. Very private and easy driving diastane to many places.
2022-08-01,3,Stayed a few nights,It was a peaceful place to stay
2022-08-01,5,Stayed one night,I enjoyed the unusual type of accommodations.

2022-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"Gracious host, easy check-in, and the entire secluded property offers all the privacy one wants. Rustic property with history to tell. It's a very old farmhouse that was gently renovated, retaining much of the original rustic features. The grounds were freshly mowed with interesting old structures still standing on the property. It was fun walking around imagining what life would have been like back in the day. I would love to know the history behind the property!"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great country getaway with wildlife and a big yard to wander. Also a place to make a fire.

2024-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This is our first experience staying at an AirBnB. Tony's place set the bar high.
Tony's home is a very quaint and cozy place to stay. It does have some modern touches to it. It's within a 5 to 10 minute walk to downtown Clear Lake and to the lake. He does allow pets. We brought our Rottweiler and our Yorkie mix. We ensured that the dogs did not damage anything and did not get up on the furniture.
Tony is very easy to work with.
To people planning on staying there, please be respectful of his property.
My wife and I would highly recommend staying there.
We do plan on making Tony's home our go to place for our stays in Clear Lake."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed about a week,This was a great rental! Location was within walking distance to amenities affiliated with the beach/lake. House was as described and equipped with the necessary supplies for our stay!

2024-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Very clean & comfortable home! All amenities you need.
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Tony’s place had everything three adults needed. We didn’t cook, but there seemed to be plenty of supplies - even spices and coffee.
Our weather was cold and snowy, so we did not explore much, but the house seems close to many restaurants, a couple coffee shops, cute stores, and there is a lovely park right across the street.
It was nice to park one car in the garage while the snow fell to avoid scraping the next morning! The driveway was plenty big enough for four cars.
Old friends had an excellent time just hanging out on the comfy couch and retiring to our comfy beds."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a great time in Clear Lake even during the off season. Tony’s home was very clean and comfortable. There was only two of us, but plenty of rom for families or groups. Tony was very friendly and responsive! We would recommend their place! It might seem like it’s on a busy street, but the noise was minimal, almost too quiet for us from the twin cities 😊"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Just the cutest and comfiest little home!
2024-02-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This is our second stay at Tony's place--we come annually for the Color The Wind kite-fest. This year there wasn't enough lake ice to hold the event, but Tony encouraged us to come anyway, and we are glad we did. We were able to enjoy the town without the crowds, dine at local restaurants, take in a movie at the Lake Theater, and go on lovely long walks with our dogs. We originally booked the house when we owned only one dog (Lucy the Dobie), but impulsively adopted another before our trip (Kora the Chihuahua mix), and Tony took the extra dog in stride (which may have been easier given that she's pretty tiny)! We had a great time and would love to come back in the summertime to enjoy the lake when it's even warmer."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Tony’s home is very comfy & clean! You are a short walk from downtown restaurants and Clear Lake. We feel right at home every time we stay.

2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We enjoyed a lovely weekend here while visiting relatives nearby. We liked being so close to downtown Clear Lake and were grateful to have a garage to park in given the cold weather! We noted all of Tony's attention to detail: there were plentiful, soft and new linens, beautiful wine glasses, lots of spices available in the kitchen, an easy-to-use TV and more. The sofa looks and *actually is* comfy, as are the beds. The space was nice and clean, as advertised, and also very welcoming–we felt right at home. Check in and out was easy and low-key. We would definitely stay again the next time we're in Clear Lake! Thanks for being such a gracious host, Tony!"

He has beach towels and koozies near the front door for use. The living room was very cozy and the beds were comfy. We did not use the garage but it was nice to know it's an option. Check-in was super easy too!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"My husband and I enjoyed our stay in your cottage. It was cozy and well equipped. We especially like d the king sized bed. Most places only have queen sized.

The location was perfect. There was a beautiful park across the street that had live music in the evenings. We walked 1-2 blocks downtown to all the restaurants and establishments. The communication from Tony was great. The check in process was easy. This place had all the extras we didn’t expect and we’ve never seen before in rentals. Such as fans and all the bedrooms, extra plug-ins, A little desk in the kitchen area with all kinds of cords for your Cell phones. It also had a basket of beach towels and cups to take to the beach with lids. Games and cards to play. A cooler in the garage. They seriously thought of everything to make your stay wonderful and convenient. Well equipped with anything you can think of in the kitchen. The beds were very comfortable, and the bedding was top notch. They had extras in every room of the house you wouldn’t expect. The master bedroom downstairs with a master bathroom and a very big closet with very soft towels, robes and hampers. There was also another bathroom downstairs for all to use so they didn’t have to go into the master bedroom. This bathroom was big and had a washer and dryer in it. Upstairs there was two more bedrooms and another bathroom. A great little fenced in area for your fur babies. The lake was six blocks away, and the place we rented a boat from was one block away. Everything was very convenient. I can’t say enough about this place, we will definitely stay here again for a little getaway and we highly recommend."

2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"April 2024 2-night stay for a family memorial service in Osage. This home was within block of the church and great places to eat if you choose not to cook. (Holly has a few favorite places to eat posted on the fridge, we would add BecMar Diner to that list for a great breakfast.) We had ample room for a few of the cousins to gather at the end of the day to tell more stories and just relax a bit before we all headed back out.
This is a lovely 4-bedroom ranch home from the late 1980’s early 90’s is pretty much as pictured, in a quiet neighborhood. The basement bedrooms both have very accessible egress windows and wells. Holly has filled the kitchen with just about every thing you need for a multiple day stay. The furniture and beds are comfortable and well maintained. The weather was a bit cool so we didn’t take time to enjoy the front porch or the rear deck, but did enjoy the visit from a neighborhood tabby through the patio doors, while drinking coffee.
We would recommend"

2023-11-01,5,Stayed one night,My only complaint was most air bnbs let check out be at noon so we felt a little rushed trying to do all the stuff she had on the list for us to do before checked out. We got in really late from a wedding so was feeling a little rough this morning and had to have everything done and be out at 10am. If it wasn’t for daylight savings time it would of been a bit more of a hustle. Otherwise everything was wonderful holly is great and i felt the fee for the place was extremely reasonable and in a great neighborhood and everything really can’t complain. Just my suggestion is little later checkout.

2023-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"What a charming and cozy house! I stayed here with three girlfriends for one night. We had seen the pictures so knew we would like the house, but were pleasantly surprised that it was even better than the pictures.
The open living room/dining room/kitchen provides a comfortable gathering space, and two separate bedrooms upstairs allow some privacy. In one of the bedrooms, there is a nook where one could likely set up a twin air mattress, if needed.
We were impressed at what we assumed were some upgrades made to the original home.
We would definitely stay here again if the need arises. It was very homey!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,This was our third time staying here. We very affectionately call it the hobbit house because of the archway and small door. It's just so cozy. The couches and beds are VERY comfortable. Such a gem of a house!

I would highly recommend this house to anyone traveling to clear lake!

The bedding is extremely soft and luxurious...my sister and I hope to purchase the sheets and blanket for our own beds! (We checked the tags.)

Check-in was easy, parking too, and the air conditioning an appreciated blessing in the humid and smoky air. We walked out to dinner and enjoyed the quiet neighborhood we were in. The bathtub was a little small, but did what it should, and we did a load of laundry so that was handy to have as well. Tracy was an excellent communicator, always getting back in touch quickly when I had a question. I am glad we could choose a one night airbnb rather than a hotel. The ambiance was much much nicer! Thanks, Tracy"

Great location! Walking distance to city park and city beach. There was a very loud train in the middle of the night. This only happened a couple of nights and our kiddos slept through it (thank goodness). Otherwise, the neighborhood is very quiet and peaceful.
Didn’t notice any bugs (except for 1). I feel like this is hard to do at a lake house and we appreciated that."

2023-06-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Decker House is convenient to many interesting sights in Mason City. We stayed there because we had a family wedding to attend in Joice, Iowa, and had never visited Mason City before. Around the corner is the Music Man Square, a few blocks away is the Historic Park Inn designed by Frank Lloyd Wright, and nearby is an area with homes designed by Wright and his architectural disciples. Breakfast at Decker House was scrumptious!! Delicious bar cookies with chocolate chips satisfied mid-afternoon and evening snack cravings. The bed was comfortable. The private bathroom was modern with quaint touches. It was good to have the box fan one night when the air conditioning wasn't working well, but that problem was fixed the second night. In spite of the historic house, we appreciated having the TV in the room. Cynthia was a delightful hostess. We liked staying in this historic place and would highly recommend it to others."

The historic house has been painstakingly restored to its former glory with lots of period antiques and tasteful decorations. My room was lovely and the bed was very comfortable. The private bathroom for the “Tulip Room” was a few steps down the hall. (The rest of the rooms have on-suite bathrooms.)
Cynthia served me a delicious and plentiful breakfast of eggs, a homemade gingerbread muffin and fruit. However, the best part of the breakfast was getting to chat with Cynthia! She is friendly, kind and so welcoming.
I will definitely return to the Decker House B&B the next time I’m in Mason City."

She is very careful about making her accomodations and she is so considerate of her guests needs (and extravagant wants too!)"

We arrived right after the big winter storm rolled through and Tracy was very accommodating to the weather related delays on our end - the driveway to the garage was even shoveled making it a breeze upon arrival. The house was very easy to find off of a main road, also making it easy to get around on plowed streets. We were quite comfortable and had everything needed and our pup enjoyed the winter walks around the neighborhood. We hope to enjoy another stay here the next time we are in Mason City."

The house was clean and stocked with all essentials to get us through. Such a great experience!
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,My family of 4 had a wonderful stay at Tonya’s place! Everything was extremely clean and very updated. This place has a prestigious vintage feel that is adorable. We walked to sweet spot ice cream shop. Biked the neighborhood and to PM Park Tiki Bar. We also took our bikes to Mason City on some really cool trails. We sat on the front deck in the very comfortable chairs at night and enjoyed the gas fire pit! We also enjoyed walking around downtown. Lots of fun parks for our boys to play. Definitely book this cute as a button house!!
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The Wren House was utterly charming and cozy for a girls' weekend away! The place is snug, but all 3 of us were very content in the space. As one can guess from the pictures, the kitchen is particularly tight, so I wouldn't recommend planning to make any complicated dishes, but everything was functional and perfect for our needs. We were so comfortable that we ended up not even going out to the lake at all; we all agreed we'd definitely love to return and explore the area too!"

We found the PERFECT spot at the Wren House. It was just like the pictures - beautifully decorated - so cool, spotlessly clean, a state-of-the art kitchen, comfortable beds, and a spacious living room with cozy furniture for hanging out and lots of talking! The check-in process was so smooth and we felt right at home. We enjoyed the parks around Clear Lake for walks and the Surf Ballroom, and also checked out the unique architecture in Mason City. Getting around was easy from our home base at the amazing Wren House. Alyse was a great host and we highly recommend this cottage!"

Alyse is a excellent host, providing everything you need to make your stay comfortable.
We will definitely be back!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Alyse’s Wren Cottage was completely charming. Spotlessly clean and everything of the highest quality, but it was the design sense and decor that was especially wonderful. She took a small lake town cottage, kept the charm and added comfortable, interesting, and artful furnishings, paint, and decor. Everything we needed was at hand, the kitchen was perfectly fitted out, the beds comfortable and linens and towels great. Alyse immediately answered ?s and generously offered use of her paddle boards. What a lovely place to stay while enjoying the town, lake and parks. Thank you, Alyse!"
2023-09-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"This was a nice place to stay! Close to the water; we enjoyed walking to a dock to watch sunsets every night. We walked to mini golf and the cone sweet shop for some treats as well! Easy access to get to downtown. There are two bedrooms, but both are pretty tight and may be hard to get around if you have mobility issues. House was very clean and welcoming with a TV, couch, and WiFi access. Cute little patio set in the front area as well! The house is a little close to the main road, making it a tad noisy at times, but really wasn't much of a factor overall. We enjoyed our stay!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"The Wren house is adorable. It is decorated beautifully, and very cozy. The neighborhood was quiet.

2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Absolutely adorable little cottage home! The decor inspired me for a couple rooms at my own home! Cone is right across the road (go get some ice cream!) Very short drive (or walk if your kids aren’t “so tired” from all the activities 😂) to beach areas, pm park. Bike rentals available in town if that’s your thing. Overall it was a great experience! Beautiful, relaxing, quiet place to land after a day full of activities!
Alyse was a fantastic host, responsive and thoughtful with the little extras that came in handy as well! First aid kit, kitchen items, toiletries in case something was forgotten, amazing throw blankets!
Thank you for making our first time to Clear Lake welcoming and comfortable!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We would give The Wren House a 10 Star rating, if possible! Our stay was absolutely amazing in every way. Alyse is a Primo Host and we so appreciate all the things that made our family time together here extra special. Her attention to details is evident from decor to quality bed linens and soft towels, comfortable beds including the sofa sleeper, the sweetest offerings in the bathroom if by chance you forgot your toothbrush, Advil, sunscreen or bug spray to name just a few items, a kitchen stocked with all the things you could ever need for meal prep to table, and the washer/dryer was on point after spending ours days at the beach. We enjoyed walking for ice cream and through the neighborhood where people were kind and friendly. We had pizza delivered twice during our stay from Papa Everett’s and a daily visit to South Shore Donut Co. After a family group vote, it was unanimous that we will DEFINITELY return to The Wren House. We thank you, Alyse, for sharing your home. Be blessed!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place was perfect for our wedding weekend at PM Park. Super cute, we had our dogs with us and there was a kennel already in the basement. Didn’t spend a lot of time at the place but everything was easy to figure out and laid out so well for instructions!"

2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Alyse was VERY responsive and her place was really cute and functional. My BFF and I just wanted a quiet retreat for a few days to watch movies and do craft and this place was exactly as describe but even more adorable.
