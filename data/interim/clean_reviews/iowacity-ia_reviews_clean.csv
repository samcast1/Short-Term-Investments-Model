2024-06-01,5.0,Group trip,"I met up in IC with four other friends. Brandi‚Äôs place was perfect. First of all it is spotless and well appointed. We had several places to gather both inside and outside the home. It‚Äôs on a quiet residential street and within walking distance from restaurants and coffee shops, the university and downtown.
Brandi was quick to respond to questions and delightful."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great host that was super responsive and provided the perfect home for a weekend getaway. Would book with Brandi again!
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Very unique and great house for a group or family!! We were in town for MBA graduation and it worked perfect for us with a perfect location. Plenty of room for 5 adults & 2 kids. We enjoyed the backyard and nearby playground. I asked about a baby gate & Brandi went and bought one! Thanks for a great experience & fun weekend! My only feedback is the basement gets a lot cooler than the main level with AC on.
2024-06-01,5.0,Group trip,"Perfect space for family to celebrate graduation this year! Everyone raved how beautiful and what a perfect space it was for us. Updated home, clean, lovely basement and outdoor space perfect for entertaining and spending time together. We made several meals together and found it to be SO MUCH BETTER than staying in multiple hotel rooms. Great weekend together. Looking forward to booking again!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Group trip,A great place for a family gathering.
2024-05-01,5.0,Group trip,Couldn't have asked for a more perfect place! Everything exactly as described and such a nice house! Couldn't be happier with our stay!

I highly recommend this house for those coming to Iowa City, close to campus, nice neighborhood, clean. Great backyard!"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,The house is spacious & so well furnished; nice to have the upstairs space w/ a nice deck & 3 bedrooms w/ comfortable beds!the kitchen was spacious & the table comfortably seats 8. Nice that there are 3 TVs (1 in upstairs LR & 2 in the basement - both areas downstairs have huge TVs & sofas w/ chaise lounges! The FP is downstairs so cozy. The laundry is in the downstairs bath which has a walk-in shower. Linens are luxurious & all the towels were plush! An easy 1 mile walk to UIHC which is where my brother was for an autologous stem cell transplant which is why we were there for 2 months! It made it easier to be so close. So much nicer than being in a hotel!
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Lovely home! Great backyard for the summer; not so nice in the winter snow:( Really comfortable beds! Lovely kitchen; Sofa for 2 & lg TV in the main level. Only down sides: very small single garage & the walk-in shower is on the lower level & the bedroom down there is the bunk over a full bed. Brandi was easy to communicate with, flexible & very helpful when a huge snowstorm hit IA during our stay."
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"great place, attentive host."
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,The house was great for my family's Christmas. It was exactly in the middle for my indiana kids and nebraska kids and of course grandkids to meet. Brandi had even left the Christmas decorations up which was an added bonus. Will definitely consider it again.
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We had a family gathering and this place was wonderful. It was even decorated for Christmas and was very cozy and like home!
Beds were comfortable. We had everything in the kitchen that we needed to cook. Would recommend!"
2023-12-01,4.0,Group trip,"The place was represented well in the detail beforehand so well done. The beds, linens, bathrooms were all in great shape and plenty of towels, soap, shampoo etc. the kitchen had minimal supplies where more glasses were needed, there were additional glasses at the basement bar, same with paper towels. For a longer stay, more supplies should be provided.
We really enjoyed the Christmas decorations including a fully lit tree and numerous other items. Thanks for the special decorations effort. We also like the Iowa city location for ease of getting around. Thanks"
2023-12-01,5.0,Group trip,Wonderful stay
2023-11-01,5.0,Group trip,"Our family felt right at home in Brandi's lovely home in Iowa City! The home has numerous spaces for people to gather and enjoy themselves- a large, fully stocked kitchen with a table for 8 with an adjacent living space with tv, plus two more spaces with large screen tvs downstairs! The deck, patio, and fenced yard are also nice additional spaces. The bedrooms and bathrooms are very nice. The three spaces to park in the driveway were nice! The park nearby, with playground, was super nice for the little ones! The location is prime for fun in Iowa City! It's close to the football/hospital area and a super easy five minute drive to grocery. Brandi is SUPER accomodating- and we hope to stay here again in the future. Thanks Brandi!"

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Clear instructions were provided, the check in was easy! The place was nice and homely. The neighborhood is quiet and the room opens into a beautifully kept backyard.

Peaceful neighborhood that‚Äôs in a good location if you have a car. There was a brochure in the room for a pizza restaurant that turned out to be great. Would stay there again next time I visit Iowa."

2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is my 4th stay at Horatio's place. It is is neat and cozy and very convenient to family member who lives a couple blocks away.

2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Another good stay
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Okay - I'm afraid to write what I really think, because I plan on staying there again when I go to Iowa City, and I don't want him to raise the price.
I had stopped using airbnb for several years, because hotels weren't that much more expensive and always nicer. But I picked this one because I was short on funds and it was cheap and looked nice enough.
This was the best Airbnb I have EVER stayed at. Not even close. There was plenty of privacy, and plenty of space. It had a big main room, my own bathroom, and another room - it was like getting a suite at less than half the price of a hotel. The place was immaculate. The bed was a REAL bed, not a shitty old futon with the cheapest possible mattress. It was comfortable, nice clean sheets, clear instructions for wifi, recommendations for restaurants, etc.
Horacio clearly took time and care to make this a good pace - not just good - Nice. Above and beyond. Clean towels, nice pictures on the wall, etc. I could go on - character limit."
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Clean and cozy place to stay! Horacio is a very considerate and responsive host.
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Horatio's place as within 2 miles of our family members so it was perfectly located. It is also only 1 block from an excellent coffee house and less than two miles from the football stadium!
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great spot for an overnight stay. It was clean and we were very comfortable. The cost was very reasonable and best of all there was no cleaning fee.

2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Horacios basement is fantastic, 100% recommended, love you horacio absolute legend"
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The place was perfect for me! I am traveling across the country and needed to book a place for that very night, and Horacio was very responsive. I was relieved to know I had a place to stay once I decided how far I was going to drive. He was very communicative and it was a safe, cozy place with everything I needed. You can hear a little walking around upstairs but the price is right and it didn't bother me."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,It was great! The stay was an incredible value based upon location and quality!
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Nice and comfy! Glad there was a microwave!

2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Very nice, private, and relaxing place!"
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Another great stay @ Horacio‚Äôs place! Great place for travel nurses to stay!
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This place is well worth it. Just a 5 minute drive from Iowa's athletic facilities and in a quiet neighborhood. Everything I needed was provided and it made for a very smooth and enjoyable stay. If in the area again I will most certainly reach out to stay again.
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Horacio was very helpful and responsive. He always goes above and beyond to make sure his guests have the best experience. His place is clean and as described.
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This was a perfect AirBNB stay for my needs. It had everything that I could possibly need, and I would definitely stay here again. I would recommend this stay to other travelers."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,100% Horacio‚Äôs place was perfect for what I needed and it exceeded expectations. Would not hesitate for a second to recommend.
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Cozy spot at a great price. Horacio was very responsive to questions, flexible, and friendly. Good water pressure in the shower, handy mini kitchen, and space was very clean. Two things to note: if you are sensitive to noise, bring earplugs. Walking and taking from upstairs carries down (though it was quiet from 9:45 pm to 7:45 am). And the bed was comfy, but on the soft side, so just a heads up if you are someone who needs a firm mattress. Overall, a perfect spot for me to stay while helping someone out with surgery at the hospital without having to pay an arm and a leg. Nice neighborhood location, too!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We‚Äôve stayed here numerous times now. Good value.
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Horacio was extremely responsive and helpful. Every message we sent was replied to within 30 minutes. The place was clean, and had extra towels and condiments in case we needed it. All of this was offered with an extremely low price! I would definitely stay here again if I ever need to be in town overnight."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Great place. This was my second stay here.
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Very comfortable for my one-night stay as I drove across the country. Relaxing. Great value. Horacio is a very responsive and friendly host. This the second time I've booked Horacio's place, and I will book again."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Perfect place to stop for the night on our road trip! It had all the basics and the bed was super comfortable!
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Easy to access, flexible check in."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Every host should have a video with instructions on how to check in - what a great idea! Everything was clean and easy to use.
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Thanks for a great stay Horacio! This is a perfect place for travel nurses!
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Everything was good . Great price , great communication."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Horacio Is friendly and flexible. We would definitely stay again.
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Good stay as usual.
2023-09-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,There was no sidewalk to the back of the house to get to entry door. That was not a problem until it rained. Being in a lower level there was some basement smell. The bed was extremely comfortable and linens and towels all in new condition. Location was extremely convenient for us and easy to find.
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We were traveling and needed an overnight place to stay between CO/PA and Horacio's place was perfect! It is easy off/on from I80. The area had every kind of restaurant you could think of, coffee shops, gas stations, etc... Probably the best location you could ever ask for!
Horacio was proactive, sending a message with all the instructions needed to make our check-in/out effortless, plus he put a YouTube link that instructed us how to get the back of the house.
We would definitely stay here again, and would recommend it to family and friends."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Horacio was a great host and his home was comfortable and clean! Horacio was responsive and provided local recommendations. The room was spacious and clean and the home was a short drive to shopping, restaurants, and Iowa City. Was a great place for a quick overnight on a road trip!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We enjoyed our stay. Responsive host. Quiet neighborhood.
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great place and easy access to the university nearby. Will be back!
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great spot to stop for the night for value and comfort.
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great spot especially if your looking for a short stay!
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Traveled to Iowa City for a brief visit and Horacio's place was an excellent choice. All the amenities as well as a desk to work at and a couch made my stay a real pleasure. Clear instructions made check in a breeze as well. I arrived about 30 minutes before check in and was going to wait in my car but Horacio was working in the garden and welcomed me in, everything was ready for me already. I had an lovely stay and I'll be sure to see if I can stay here again when I'm next in the area!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great price and the private entrance was nice. Bed was very comfortable. Didn‚Äôt stay very long but it was just what I needed. Horacio was very helpful with the check in process.
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Was just looking for something basic didn‚Äôt need a hotel room for a one night stay. I didn‚Äôt like the entrance though as it was not well lighting at night and probably won‚Äôt be a good place to stay in winter time as there‚Äôs no sidewalk to the entrance as you literally walk through a dirt path to get it. But other than that it wasn‚Äôt to bad
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Worked well for my needs, traveling through. I enjoyed running in the park nearby."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,A very nice place to stay.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great deal & had all the amenities!
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I only stayed 1 night because I was just passing through town, but it was very comfortable and relaxing after a long drive. I would recommend this spot if you are staying in the area for any length of time."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Homey space, great for night stay. A quick drive to UIowa campus."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Horacio‚Äôs listing was great! The check-in instructions were extremely clear; the entry felt very private; Horacio was very responsive; and the space itself was clean and overall great. Definitely a great value!
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Great spot to stay, good value, clean, very nice private entrance it's like we were staying at our own place. Would stay again if in town."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The space was clean and I appreciated the fridge and microwave. Parking in their driveway, off the street was good. The bed was just like home and the shower had great water pressure. The towels and linens were fresh and clean smelling. The shower was stocked with shampoo and soap but I brought my own. It‚Äôs a basement apartment and a bit outdated but when you check the prices of hotels near there this is a great place. Several windows to let in light. Two minutes to the Coralville strip and five minutes to downtown. A gas station with snacks and food a block away. I will definitely stay there again.
As with any BNB in people‚Äôs homes there were noises of family pattering above me but it was quiet after 8:00 pm. I found a big fan in a storage room and it was perfect for air flow and white noise."
2023-07-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Fairly priced. It‚Äôs in basement, so good for a short stay. Host is responsive and live upstairs."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Very clean, modest room. Squeaky clean bathroom. Exceptional value. Close to gas stations and restaurants."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Very accommodating. We had a great stay!
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great place to stay. Clean, private space. Easy self checkin / checkout. Horacio was a good, helpful, and responsive host."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great value and close to hospital. We will come again!
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Very nice place, in a quiet and peaceful neighborhood, you felt safe, fair price."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"what a perfect stop on our way to Michigan! it was very clean, comfy, and safe. It felt homey and was right in town. the bed was so comfy we slept in! the shower was very clean!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Good stay as always, great host"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This place was great! Perfect for if youre passing through the area at a very fair price. Horacio was great with recommendations and anything you might need. 10/10
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I must say it was an exceptional experience. From the warm and welcoming atmosphere to the impeccable hospitality, every aspect of my stay exceeded my expectations. The host were incredibly gracious and hospitable."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The perfect space for a nights rest going through town. Horacio was super responsive and helpful. With a separate entrance to the home, check-in was super smooth and provided enough privacy while still being in someone else‚Äôs home"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Very wonderful accommodations and guest areas for such an affordable price! I highly recommend staying at this location, whether it be for one night or multiple!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Really glad I found this place to spend the night in Iowa City. I used public transportation all the time and the bus stop was very close to Horacio's place. Clean, comfy, and private."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Horacio gave great instructions for checkin and was very responsive. The neighborhood was quiet, the bed super comfy, and the shower instantly hot. I would stay there again."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Comfortable, homey and cute!"
2023-06-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"Stayed at Horacio‚Äôs place for 1 night. Easy check in, host responsive, comfortable bed."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Fantastic place to stay. Only stayed one night, but if we went back, we‚Äôd book this place again!"
2023-05-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"As a 66 year old without a smartphone, I do all my communicating with my ipad. I don‚Äôt have a flashlight on my ipad. I brought a flashlight with me but, of course, it didn‚Äôt work when I needed it to. You access the entrance to the place down a fairly steep grassy area. There are lights that come on in the front and the back of the house when your movement triggers them, but there is a bit of space where you are in the dark. I just walked very slowly with small steps down the slope until the back light came on.
The other issue I had is that the bathroom had a step up, a bit higher than normal, onto a platform to reach sink, shower and toilet. Just something to be aware of if you have any maneuvering difficulties.
Otherwise, I found it a pleasant place to stay, in a convenient location. I would stay here again.
Horacio‚Äôs communication was so thorough before I arrived, I had no need to text him during my stay. We waved when we saw one another in the driveway."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Easy to find and very clean! The bed was very comfortable!
2023-05-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"When I realized this was a basement space I worried it would be damp and dreary but I have to say it‚Äôs a comfortable King Suite located just slightly below ground, none of that super loud clomping you often hear from floors above. However, the place is not kid-proofed‚ÄîI say this because the boiler room is unlocked and there are two closet doors hanging off their hinges. Once these areas are blocked off would recommend for the whole family!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,I liked this space. lots of room. close to downtown and grocery stores. I would stay here again. I would recommend this space.
2023-05-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Bed was comfortable, shower good. One recommendation: add a mirror in the main room. With 2 people getting ready it would have been helpful."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Very comfortable stay and the host was very responsive!
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"A nice, easy stay for one night. The host was very responsive when I had any questions. The space was a great deal for the money and the bed was comfortable. The neighborhood felt safe and there were shops within walking distance."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"It was a nice place, clean, private, comfortable bed. It was raining and night when we got there, so we had to walk in wet grass and down a small slope to get to our place. And he gave us one set of towels, that could of been my error for I don't think I mention spouse and I were coming. I am sure if I asked him, we would of gotten another set. My spouse left his iPad charger, and Horacio was sweet, he mailed it to our home, and did not charge us postage. He definitely is very easy to work with. Thank you. Horacio."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Nice, clean space. Owner was very quick to respond. Space was cozy and private."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great place to stay in Iowa City. Nice, clean room in a good location. Would definitely stay here again."

2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Horacio,
Thanks for letting me stay at your house again. Being familiar with the premises came in handy this trip as my plans changed and I got in later at night, then left a little bit later the next day. I was able to quickly unload that night. Then connect to work to get a few things done before bed. In the morning, I was able to get about three hours of work done before leaving. All in all, a very productive stay for not being planned! I look forward to staying again when I drop my daughter off after the semester break.
Happy Holidays and see ya next year. üòâ"

It's a perfect place for a few people - just enough space to be comfortable and close to everything while feeling quiet and tucked away. What I most appreciated was the lack of clutter and simultaneous presence of everything we needed. So many Airbnb's over-do it on the knick knacks, which makes it hard to find places for your own belongings. Frank's place is comfortable, simple, clean... and a great value as well. We look forward to another stay in the future."

2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Quiet neighborhood, off the beaten path a little, but still very easy & quick to get to everywhere we needed to go"
2023-09-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Very cute place, private and peaceful. Neighborhood is easily navigated on foot to many restaurants. We took a stroll each morning to get coffee, often finding a neighborhood cat to say hello to on the way.
Far enough away to avoid the rambunctious undergrads but close enough that we walked to the University art museum. Truly perfect for anyone visiting the University of Iowa.
Only negatives were the dust and the humidity inside the house. Beneath the bed was so dusty I avoided sliding my suitcase under. There was no exhaust fan in the bathroom so every shower made the already humid bedroom even worse. A dehumidifier in the space would be a good addition.
Overall, a great stay and a wonderful trip to Iowa City."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had another great stay at Franks Place. We have stayed here several times. Great stay for any Hawkeye parents, easy short Uber ride to uptown, we also accessed the hiking trails nearby on Hickory Hills Trails.

Large supermarket with wide selection of groceries just a few minutes away. Check-in was very easy. There is a super convenient designated parking space behind the home, accessible via an alley that can be a bit hard to miss the first time you arrive. The alley is unpaved and a little rough, but even cars with low clearance will be fine if you go slow enough."

The kitchen is high-end and well appointed. The perfect size dining table for two and couple's love seat set a wonderfully romantic tone for a cottage get away. The bedroom was comfy and the bedding delighted the senses. The ample bathroom with generous space for showering led to a relaxing evening after a long road ride. The final touch, as one passed downstairs to the basement, was the very large washer and dryer combo that brought all of the amenities into a perfect package. This beautiful little cottage, with delightful front porch, nestled in a luxurious Victorian neighborhood and community, left me wishing for a longer stay."

2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Great place. I ended up needing a place to stay within 24 notice and found this spot.

It‚Äôs a perfect spot for a few nights for 2 people.
Frank was super responsive and prompt to any question/requests I had. Would absolutely stay again."
2022-11-01,4.0,Stayed one night,Cute place. Perfect for two people. Quiet and homey and has a full kitchen and bathroom is updated too. Challenging finding the driveway from the back alley in the dark but worth it.

The space is the perfect size for 2 people. It was peaceful and relaxing. We enjoyed morning coffee on the deck while making our game plan for the day. It was a great space to decompress at the end of a fun filled day.
We appreciated the cleanliness upon arrival and Frank sent easy to understand instructions on how to gain entry. Central air was a huge bonus since it was extremely hot during our 3 day stay.
We will definitely stay again next time we are in town."

The explanations for everything Were clearly written and posted on the side of the fridge, the lock on the door so easy to use, the automatic outdoor lights eased entry after dark. And the shower was a delight, love the tasteful gray slate tile and the generous showerhead. The big old trees on the property are so beautiful, and the porch was a nice place to sit for morning coffee. I‚Äôll be staying here next time I come to Iowa City!"

Frank was quick to give check-in info, and we didn't need to contact him otherwise. A nice perk was the parking behind the house so you didn't have to find a place to park on the street. Iowa City was a blast and this stay was the cherry on top. We will definitely book here again if we are coming through the area."

2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,value is worth he and trip love you he and place I fall in love very well kept. The lack of flour TV I fell in love with a little off putting a different guy and this shop is very comfortable he and sweet shower it worth it.
2022-01-01,4.0,Stayed over a week,"A little gem in Iowa City, located in a wonderful neighborhood and managed by a great host. We stayed for an unusually long period of time (three weeks) and during the coldest spell of winter. So perhaps our stay is not representative of the usual. The central heating did not make the environment warm enough for a cozy stay, although a portable radiator that was provided helped a lot. The internet was also too slow. Again, probably too specific for an unusually long and wintery stay. That said, I would certainly recommend the place whatever your reason is to visit Iowa city."
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Super sweet place. Really quiet. Great location. Hot shower. Full kitchen. Great neighborhood.
I love hiking and birding and so accessible to Oakland Cemetery and Hickory Hill.
HyVee close by for supplies
And I discovered Press Coffee shop as well.
It was a cold weekend but in nicer days you could walk downtown and back easy.
I live in IC a long time and this place made it really easy and fun to go back."

2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This little cutie has so much to offer. We loved the quiet location, in a sweet neighborhood about a mile from Prairie Lights Bookstore, restaurants, coffee shops and more. Of course the University of Iowa is right nearby. The studio-type apartment itself is a wonderful statement in compact simplicity, yet there‚Äôs a perfectly serviceable kitchen with everything you might need. The bed is oh-so-comfortable, the decor is gently minimalist, and the atmosphere is restrained and rustic. Very pared down to the relaxing elements of a short-term stay or a longer quiet sojourn. I am already thinking of how I could come back!"
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is my second time staying at Frank's ‚Äî comfortable, cozy, and secure during the unseasonable winter storm that swept through while I was staying. So glad that all of the amazing trees around this place made it through the windstorm! I had to change my travel dates a few times and I appreciate Frank's understanding and flexibility. Communication was good and check in was simple. This is a perfect apartment for visiting UI and Iowa City. If I have a reason to return, I hope to stay here again."
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Wonderful, cozy place on a quiet street in historic north side, with parking. The bed was super comfy! We will definitely stay here again.

2021-11-01,4.0,Stayed one night,Frank's place is very easy to find and barely a five minute drive to the Iowa City city center. The bed was comfortable and the space was clean. The neighborhood was quiet with very little traffic/loud engines passing by. The only tricky part was finding the house from the alley in the dark since it is winter and gets dark so early. Can we please stop turning clocks back and forth!? Rant over.
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Frank‚Äôs place was such a nice place to stay. Very clean! Frank was an awesome communicator! Wish the weather would have been a little nicer so we could‚Äôve had a beverage out on the cute little patio, maybe next time! Will definitely be back!"

2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The door was easy to find with the instructions you‚Äôre given. It‚Äôs a very comfortable space that looks and feels like a small furnished apartment.
The d√©cor and surroundings were very beautiful. The fall leaves and surrounding trees were absolutely stunning.
I have Mint Mobile and reception was spotty in the area, but the internet made up for it. It was reliable and fast enough for me to text and internet call when I needed.
Overall this AirBnB was a great experience and very well kept."

2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I loved this stay in Iowa City, a university town 2 hours from where I grew up. Coming back from California to visit my brother and his family, who live here now, this was the perfect location. I love this neighborhood with its gorgeous old houses, lovely big trees, greenery, parks, and good little stores and restaurants. This place is private and comfortable and pretty. My husband and I slept well on the good bed; the bathroom was clean and everything worked well; the kitchen is well stocked and handy; there is a nice little sitting and dining area; and a cute porch that is surrounded by trees and feels very private. It was nice having my nephew over for takeout dinner and then my brother hang out with us there in the evening. It's a great deal and I would love to stay there again next time I visit."

2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Frank‚Äôs place is great! For my quick one-night trip into town it provided the perfect place to get ready & crash at night. The A/C was crankin, it was clean & bright, and as someone who needs white noise to sleep I was overjoyed to find both a ceiling fan in the bedroom as well as an optional table top fan! I was actually impressed with all of the thoughtful amenities & extras like Q-tips and a hairdryer. The parking sitch is a bit of an adventure but it‚Äôs awesome to have a designated spot. Would 100% stay here again!"
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"A very clean, comfortable, and quiet one bedroom ‚Äî surrounded by mature trees on all sides, the views from the windows make this small apartment almost feel like a treehouse.

2021-08-01,4.0,Stayed one night,Frank‚Äôs place was very nice. It was very clean. The only downside was that the mattress was very uncomfortable. It felt like a waterbed without the water. Not a mattress for two adults to sleep on.

2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"I rated ""Accuracy"" a 4 instead of 5 only because the published photos do not show the nice loveseat and pub dining set that are in the unit, which were a very pleasant surprise.

2024-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,It was so peaceful and quiet here! Fantastic location and exactly as described!
2024-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Staci is always responsive and accommodating !!
This unit by far is my fav! Even though it‚Äôs smaller than her other units, it‚Äôs perfect for me!
Being on the second floor allows for a beautiful breeze, with the windows open.
I have had no issues with any kind of noise, which is great! I enjoy my sleep.
Thank you, Staci for always being an awesome host !!"
2024-05-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Very good and functional place.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Love that this unit is on the 2nd floor! Super quiet and peaceful.
Extra perks like garage door opener, key card and security lock on front door. Felt very safe and secure!
Underground parking garage is amazing! Parking can be tight with larger vehicles.
Space was smaller than anticipated. Pics make it look much larger. But for one person it‚Äôs perfect!
The couch is a pull-out so not greatest to sit on. Would have liked a table to sit at to eat. There were some T.V. trays available however they were very flimsy and I had to put a bed pillow on the couch to avoid sinking into the abyss.
Got lots of natural sunlight. Blinds in main area are broke and couldn‚Äôt open/adjust. No curtains on windows as shown so had to put blanket over the bedroom window to block out alley light at night.
Staci is always responsive and available if I have questions. Will keep coming back to check out more units!"
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,Great location and security

2020-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Staci was a great hostess-the unit was easily accessible with no touch check-in. I especially enjoyed the added benefit of underground parking. Very clean and perfect for an overnight in Iowa City. Added Note: Check out Wig & Pen Pizza or Big Grove Brewery‚Äîboth had delicious food, great service and were within a couple minutes of the AirBnB."
2020-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Wonderful place to stay
2020-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Amazing location close to the university and to the downtown area.
2020-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Staci was very accommodating and responded to our needs during the reservation and stay. The lower level indoor parking spaces are an added benefit when parking is hard to find on the streets around multiple living facilities in the area. The unit was located in just the right place for our hospital visits. We were often able to get to the parking ramps early enough to find parking spots that did not require extensive walking times to our appointments. Staci is a terrific manager and we recommend this location to other hospital visitors. Thanks Staci
2020-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Very clean and easy check in!
2020-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Place was very clean and great location. Garage parking was a huge plus.

2020-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Sparkling clean! Plenty of towels and extra blankets and pillows. Check in was very simple and we LOVED that we could park in a parking garage for free. It was awesome that there was an elevator in the building that went right to our floor from the parking garage. Not far from tons of restaurants and entertainment. Great location. Will definitely be staying here again
2020-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Staci‚Äôs place was great! A great location, very clean, and a quick drive to where I needed to be!"
2020-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The apartment was fantastic and in a great location! The host was so helpful and quick to respond when I messaged her.
2020-10-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was a nice, modern, apartment very close to the university hospital which is just what we needed. Check in was easy, communication was great, the apartment was clean and well appointed. It was noisy. Being essentially on campus some noise is expected, but with two outside walls, noise from outside went on until 2am and the upstairs neighbor sounded as if he was playing pool on the floor well into the night. The bed was comfortable, but sleep was hard to come by. This is not the owners fault, but should be noted."
2020-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We would highly recommend staying this property.
2020-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Staci‚Äôs place was a great spot to stay. Definitely recommend.

2020-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Staci‚Äôs place was just what we needed while we were in town for our friends‚Äô wedding. It was close to many local restaurants that we were excited to try and we ventured up to Lake McBride State Park, which was only a short drive away. The bed was comfortable, the space was so clean upon our arrival, and Staci was quick to response prior to and after our arrival. Truly the best host! Thank you, Staci, for making our time in Iowa amazing!"

2020-09-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Staci's space is a perfect location for virtually anything in the vicinity of Iowa City. It was convenient for us to visit a friend in Amana, hike near Cedar Rapids, and enjoy social distancing outdoors near Lake McBride and Coralville Lake. Had circumstances been different, her space is also located conveniently for events on campus, at the hospital, and it's not far off I-80 either."
2020-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Excellent, quiet, private and such a great location for those who are looking to be close to the medical facilities."
2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Everything from privacy to cleanliness to professionalism was grade A.

2020-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Staci's place was extremely clean, the check in instructions were very clear, and the space is very cute. I was just passing through for one night, but the bed was really comfortable and the apartment was quiet. Staci was very responsive and accommodating. I imagine it would be an excellent option for someone needing a longer term stay. The location was really convenient both for finding takeout and for a nice jog along the river. I will absolutely stay here again if I'm ever in town in the future!"
2020-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great location close to Iowa City. Very quick responses from the host and detailed check-in instructions!

2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Second time staying here and it was amazing again!! Already booked again!
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Urban feeling in a charming college town setting, home away from home for this Iowa City native Brooklynite. High ceilings and big windows make the place feel airy and light, yet it‚Äôs cozy & comfy at the same time. Helpful and friendly hosts. Loved the location, walking distance to restaurants and shops, and well situated for car pick-up and drop-off. Elevator access and code-operated doors were very much appreciated when hauling luggage around in brutal winter weather. WiFi worked great, everything did. Spotlessly clean. Terrific shower. Full-size laundry and other appliances. Personally the area is one of my favorite neighborhoods in Iowa City - the coffee shop across the way, the Prairie Kitchen store, Artifacts, Hamburg Inn - and just a short walk to downtown. The Campus Wellness/Recreation Center down on Madison is a state-of-the-art workout facility if looking for indoor exercise while there. The city rec center is closer but much more modest. Thank you for a great stay!"
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This is a beautiful space in a great location. Everything was just as described and shown in the pictures. We would definitely stay here again!
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,Everything went well
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Fantastic place! It was easy to walk to everything downtown and the unit was extremely comfortable and tidy. I hope to be a repeat customer!
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great space in a great location‚Äîclose proximity to downtown, above a great restaurant and next to a fantastic dive bar. The apartment comes with great amenities‚Äîincluding laundry (so convenient). Would definitely use again on a return visit and would highly recommend."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Nice open modern comfortable place & in a convenient location. Place was exactly like the listing! Hosts were very responsive & accommodating when I had questions.
I was in town meeting others & this was a great central area for us. We didn‚Äôt rent cars & were able to walk all over, which thankfully the weather permitted. Many coffee shops, restaurants, cafes & stores are very nearby.
As another review mentioned, this is above a restaurant only open for dinner (note; reservations in advance are required) & next to another bar that has a back patio. If you are a light sleeper & going on a weekend, you will hear the activity & noise/music until they close. (Plan appropriately.)"
2023-11-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"We enjoyed our stay at Ross‚Äôs condo. Walkable area
of Iowa City with great restaurants and a wine bar nearby. The condo was spotless and well supplied! Communication was clear and all instructions for entering the property and parking garage were
accurate. The only reason I give this rental 4 stars is that the unit lacked a few amenities. We were traveling to attend a memorial service and had two suits and two dresses. There was nowhere to hang
our clothes. No closet or freestanding clothes rack, which would easily fit into the large laundry room. No dresser to store clothes in either. We ended up hanging suits and dresses
on the coat stand at the entrance. Under cabinet lighting in the kitchen (wiring was in cabinet) would have been nice also. I believe this unit is very new and probably just lacks a few finishing touches that create a 5-star property. Placing a closet system in the laundry room would be great!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"LOVED this place and would highly recommend it! Everything was perfect, great instructions on how to get in, wonderful location, very safe, busy - but not loud."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The place was fantastic. Super clean, lovely location and just felt very homey."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Excellent place and location, would highly recommend! Exactly as described."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We loved our stay because of its prime location and Ross‚Äôs accommodations for us. He sent very clear instructions the day prior on where to park and how to get in. We came in for an Iowa game and were able to walk to the stadium, bars, campus, and restaurants. The place was so cozy way better than a hotel and it had beautiful views of the sunrise each morning. Would 100% book here again!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was by far the best Abnb that I have ever stayed at! Her extra comforts, minimalist decorations and absolutely fully stocked kitchen was so appreciated, I will definitely stay here again when visiting my hometown, thank you, Michelle!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Michelle‚Äôs home was wonderful! It exceeded all of our expectations! It was extremely clean and full of amenities! Highly recommend!

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at Michelle‚Äôs place. The house was immaculate and nicely decorated. The kitchen was stocked with most everything we would need for our backyard barbecue. Close location to town and Kinnick stadium. The backyard was private and was the perfect setting for our barbecue before the Iowa homecoming game. Michelle was very responsive and also gave some great recommendations for local restaurants. We highly recommend Michelle‚Äôs place and will definitely be back again!
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is my number one choice of a place to stay in Iowa city whenever I come here. It is very nicely maintained with a private yard a good functioning kitchen, where I cook several meals, a beautiful dining table, everything works great. Our wonderful host even let us check in early a true winner."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Our family had a great stay here! The house was immaculate and had everything we needed. Michelle was extremely friendly and helpful.
We came for a Hawkeye football game and to visit family in North Liberty, which was just a 20 min drive. Pro tip... we parked in Lot 11 for the game and it was a traffic-free, 5 minute drive back to the house."
2023-09-01,5.0,Group trip,"We loved the house. It was so beautiful, and walking distance. Very clean, and had what we needed."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Such a charming place to stay and within minutes drive of so many things to do! The house was cozy and cute and had everything we needed. Love Michelle‚Äôs style. Should we be in the area again we would definitely stay here!

Super clean and comfy - great place! Michelle was very helpful!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We really loved this Airbnb! It was a wonderful space to relax and enjoy Iowa City.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Michelle's place has the best of both centuries: a classic MidWest North American house from the XX Century, but with the accommodations, the remodeling and the appliances of the XXI Century.
This house was definitely a great space to spend a few days in Iowa City. The second floor was great and cozy, both bathrooms are great, and the patio is spacious and calming.
I would definitely come back anytime!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Family member had to be admitted to Iowa City Hospital and Michelle was so helpful with dates and staying flexible for our family. Thank you!!
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Michelle was an excelent host, responsive quickly when needed. The description of the house is precize, as well the photos. Maybe we come again."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Michelle‚Äôs place was absolutely lovely. We stayed for a week for our wedding and couldn‚Äôt have asked for a better experience. It was the cleanest place I have ever stayed at, literally spotless, and so cozy. We used to live in the neighborhood where Michelle‚Äôs house is, but moved away two years ago. This was our first visit back and we felt right at home immediately, just like we lived there again! The house is on a fairly busy street but it is so quiet inside and the backyard is so peaceful. The houses next door are close, which is normal in this neighborhood, but because the yard is fenced it feels extremely private. The kitchen, bathrooms, and bedrooms are stocked with everything you could need, extra towels and linens, etc. I had some questions before we arrived and Michelle was super responsive and friendly. Our only regret is that we wish we stayed longer! We plan to stay at Michelle‚Äôs anytime we visit Iowa City in the future!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful home very cozy and great individual space when needed for all of us. When in Iowa City again we will stay here! Love the front porch and back yard seating areas so many cute places to rest and recharge!
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Clean, cute, and easy."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I seriously cannot brag about Michelle‚Äôs home enough. It‚Äôs the cleanest, warmest Airbnb I‚Äôve ever stayed in. On top of that, Michelle was gracious enough to accommodate our strange scheduling, which spanned several days a week over the course of three weeks.
I truly believe this house has helped me write my next book. It‚Äôs literally *that* inspiring. My daughter and I even took to calling the house ‚Äúour summer home,‚Äù so I definitely hope we have many more opportunities to stay!
The little cafe down the street is sweet and quaint and the neighborhood was comfortable enough for my daughter and I to take late evening strolls.
As a queer old lady with green hair and many tattoos, I never once felt unsafe in Michelle‚Äôs neighborhood or in iowa city more generally. Having never been to the city, I was somewhat nervous, but truly it was a dream trip.
xoxo"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We stayed at Michelle‚Äôs place for my brother‚Äôs graduation - everything was perfect! The house is so charming and spotless. The home is older but that doesn't seem to have any affect on it‚Äôs maintenance - the floors are preserved perfectly (they look better than my home!) and the upstairs feels entirely new. It‚Äôs so charming! You won‚Äôt regret booking - only not booking!
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Feels like a relaxing retreat amid a bustling campus and downtown. And, always great book recommendations throughout. Have returned time and time again."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We were in Iowa City for a weekend. We found great places to eat and it was easy for friends to find us.
The atmosphere of Michelle‚Äôs home is peaceful and a bit artsy!"
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"This Airbnb is perfectly maintained and very comfortable, with a wonderful bed, mattress pad, cover, and sheets in the top bedroom, where I slept better than I do at home. It is very walkable to downtown Iowa City, which I did every day for two weeks when my dad was hospitalized at Mercy. The neighborhoods around the house are beautiful, with lots of old houses, trees, and birds. There are buses going by, which is also convenient, but which I didn't even notice until the last days I was there since it stays quiet inside and feels very private with a fenced in backyard. I love the big table in the dining room and it was nice having my brother and niece over for take out. It was a hard time for us with our dad sick and needing to take care of him, but so comforting to be able to retreat in Michelle's wonderful place. I also loved the reading nook upstairs, which was very relaxing. Michelle was a great communicator and her nephew removed snow from our driveway twice, which was so nice!"
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,It was a great stay.
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I really enjoyed my stay! The house is beautiful, and it was just a short drive away from everywhere that I wanted to go. The host, Michelle, was super nice and helpful as well."
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"It was our second stay, and despite a blizzard, Michelle‚Äôs place was again perfect and a wonderful stay for Christmas. The place is spotless and the kitchen was very well appointed. The home was quiet and beds wee comfortable. We‚Äôd recommend staying here without any reservation."
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Michelle‚Äôs home is amazing. It‚Äôs warm and welcoming and makes you feel like you‚Äôre wrapped in a soft blanket. It has everything you could ever want in an Airbnb home at the right price. We loved it and everything about it!

2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Michelle's place was easy to find and provides plenty of parking. Located in a quiet, well lit neighborhood. The home was well kept, comfortable and clean. I really appreciated the window shades, they allowed the bedroom to get nice and dark for bed time (a win in my book). The kitchen was our favorite place to hang out. The kitchen was well equipped with utensils and dishes one might need. We enjoyed our short stay. Michelle was great at communicating in a polite and timely manner. information was clear and helpful. We would recommend this place to anyone"
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Absolutely perfect spot! Ample of space, very cute decor, comfortable everything - literally. Communication was 100% and check-in/check-out was very easy. Would recommend 10/10 to anyone!"
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"From the darling and inviting decor, to the cleanliness and amenities, this home was the perfect place to stay for our reunion weekend. We had a great time going for walks in the neighborhood, grabbing brunch from DeLuxe bakery, shopping downtown, and attending the football game (which was just a quick Uber ride away!). If the weather would have cooperated, we would have hung out on the patio in the backyard and enjoyed the fire pit. Communication and arrangements were wonderful. We felt like the home was prepared special just for us. It‚Äôs clear to see how this home has been lovingly restored and updated - we would certainly love to come back. Thank you for hosting our special weekend in such a special place!"
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,You could not find a more welcoming place. It is within walking distance of cafes and parks. It was very easy to check in and could not think of anything missing.

The house has several brand new smart TVs, but even better there are multiple comfy reading nook with warm throw, great lighting, and books provided! Having a dedicated work space, contemporary and clean bathrooms with great water pressure, and really pretty updated surroundings made for such a nice stay.
The house / home is very special but the host, Michelle, is even more so. Her communication is excellent and she makes sure to help in any situation and was very gracious in every conversation we had with her.
We didn‚Äôt get to use the backyard because of the cold weather but it is fenced and private and has lighting and nice seating. The front room is a four season porch and has such pretty light and seating. We will be back! Thank you to the host!"

2023-08-01,3.0,Stayed one night,James was responsive and easy to work with. Water and some snacks and lots of coffee on hand. Place overall wasn‚Äôt very clean - hair and dust left behind. Could use a good deep clean. Hallways up to the unit is very small and loud - was fine for an overnight bag but if you were bringing luggage it would be pretty rough. Love the location and neighborhood. Be aware street parking rotates sides each day and can be hard to find when school is in session.

The only downsides I would say are, 1. The pet fee is very high. We paid $180 for our small, non-shedding dog to join us for the night. 2. The floors were very dirty, our toddlers feet turned black within a few minutes."

Clean, nice amenities, really everything I needed. Free, street parking was easy to find on Burlington. Walking distance to great restaurants and the Ped Mall. What more could you ask? The coffee shops across the street could have opened earlier, but that‚Äôs not Miles‚Äôs fault! The only thing that was ‚Äúdifferent‚Äù is the big windows without coverings. There is a bit of a lack of privacy in the living room and kitchen because of that. But I kept the bedroom and bathroom doors closed, so it was fine. In the end, great natural light! Bed was great! WiFi worked great! I‚Äôd happily stay here again!!!"

We walked to everything but also really enjoyed the neighborhood feel of this location. The unit itself has incredible windows with tons of light streaming in and tall ceilings so it felt open and airy. We enjoyed our morning coffee and evening wine on the balcony.
We felt like staying here was a much better value than the overpriced hotels in the area."

We would absolutely stay here again if the opportunity presents itself!

This unit was unbelievably tidy. Every part of the space was thoughtfully designed with travelers in mind‚Äîthere was a little rack with hangers so we could hang up some of our clothes, a luggage stand, and a bathroom stocked with a first aid kit, hair dryer, and other essentials. There were a comical number of pillows to choose from, which I loved as my wife and I both found pillows close to what we had at home.
And the location of the apartment was great, too! Just across the street from a walking trail and close to campus, too. If we‚Äôre ever back in Iowa City we will try to book here again!"

Brittney is a great host. She was quick and responsive to my many inquiries about location and how to get around. She left me a walking map in the unit when we arrived to make it easy for us to get to the football stadium on foot.
The space was clean and spacious, exactly as seen in the photos. Well appointed, Brittney thought of everything, down to two styrofoam cups for us to take our morning coffee when we departed. Plenty of natural light and plenty of soaps and shampoo in the bath. We definitely will want to book again next time we are in Iowa City! Thanks Brittney"

Highly recommend and hope to come back."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Fabulous from start to finish! The parking space is right at the entry door, no stairs or walkway or anything, so loading/unloading the car was super fast. The place was clean and had everything I needed, although I only stayed one night. A longer stay might be a little tricky with the tiny dorm fridge, if you plan to make all your meals in the unit. Restaurants and grocery stores are a short drive away. The spot is right on the river, so you have access to a walking trail that follows that, AND there's a very pretty tree-filled neighborhood that starts here and goes up the hill away from the river. On top of all that, the host is super nice and responsive. You really can't go wrong here!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"As a host, Brittny was personable, welcoming and responsive.

2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was the perfect spot nestled between campus and the football field, just a short trip to either one.

Highly recommend this place to anyone wanting to be close to everything but also have your privacy!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Brittney was a wonderful host & the River Side Suites was exactly how the description and pictures showed. Her house rules were easy to follow & she also gave lots of great recommendations of the area! There‚Äôs even a map in the air bnb of the area near the entrance. The river is directly across the street and is beautiful!! My only complaint was at night, we could see the light from the street light right outside the bedroom. She has white curtains which make the room light up & my husband & I are pitch-dark sleepers. But that‚Äôs an us preference, not the air bnb fault. Otherwise, the place exceeded all our wants and desires! Thank you again Brittney for letting us stay the night & we would definitely stay again in the future!"

I will not only book this place for work next time around but highly recommend it to anyone staying in the city."

Host was very responsive, let me know about an upcoming storm and even offered me to stay beyond check-out time to stay safe.

The only problem was that we were hit with a strong, unpleasant odor the moment we walked in. It smelled like dog. Despite keeping windows open and fans blowing, it was always there and we were unable to fully relax. The place was otherwise a charm. Perhaps if someone is used to dogs and not bothered by the smell of them, this may not an issue."

The location is ideal to get into town quickly (about 10minute walk). It seems that the owners have thought of everything as well, from leaving little treats to a very detailed binder of things to do/places to eat. It was very clean and seemed recently updated/new; it comes across to how much the owners care and look after their guests.
We loved the coffee maker in the morning and the super-comfortable bed at night (we could adjust the firmness of the mattress!! Amazing!!).
Thank you for providing such a wonderful place, Gloria! We will certainly stay here the next time we‚Äôre in Iowa City!!"

We each had a private place to sleep (i was on the couch, but had no problem with that). Time on the porch was priceless. Proximity to downtown while still being in a residential area (on a quiet street) was ideal. The unit was clean and well-stocked with a lovely fresh-cut flower in a vase waiting for us. The attention to detail was appreciated and we would stay there again in a heartbeat."
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"It was a perfect setup for covid in that we did not need to meet Gloria in person to check in, there is a keypad entry so we did not need to keep track of keys! Lots of little perks sprinkled around the apartment, and most everything you would expect from a 5 star stay. The only shortcoming for us was the lack of laundry facilities, which was only an issue as this was the second leg of a 3 part holiday, so that may not matter to you. We easily found laundry facilities nearby, as the Gloria provides an extensive information booklet about local services and restaurants. A very beautiful and comfortable apartment."

2021-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Sparkling clean and comfortable apartment.
2021-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a very pleasant 4-day stay here. The apartment has lots of personality and little amenities to make the time here comfortable and enjoyable. The kitchen is well-equipped, and we especially appreciated the coffee and coffee maker provided. The bed was very comfortable, the bathroom bright with shower toiletries provided, and everything inside was spotlessly clean. We loved the location within walking distance of the historic north downtown area, and although the housing in the area is very dense, the apartment was quiet and felt very safe."
2021-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"It was so easy to get around Iowa City by foot or car from this location! The stay was lovely, clean, and comfortable. The kitchen was also perfectly stocked for an impromptu pizza-making night :)"
2021-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This property is a gem! If you enjoy cooking, you won't find a better equipped Airbnb kitchen. The knives and cookware are top quality, unlike many other Airbnbs that tend to give you secondhand kitchenware. This cute little place is also spotless and has a very comfortable working desk, couch, and Sleep Number bed. Even though you're still very close to downtown Iowa City, you'll feel like you have your own quiet retreat at this lovely place!"
2021-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We really enjoyed our stay. The accommodations were very √ßomfortable, peaceful and clean."
2021-02-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"Quiet, cozy, immaculately clean, kind hospitality and great value. So much nicer than a hotel. It felt like home away from home for our two week stay. Highly recommend."
2021-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We loved our stay at Gloria‚Äôs. The apartment is just blocks away from downtown Iowa City. It was clean, well-furnished, and full of wonderful decorations and amenities. Highly recommended!"
2021-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Gloria's space was warm, inviting, and sparkling clean. Check-in was extremely easy, and the host was very quick to answer messages. I would absolutely stay again!"
2021-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Gloria's place was excellent, would definitely stay there again. Plenty of nice homey touches, and in a perfect location in Iowa City. Not too close from downtown but not too far away either. Walking distance to the co-op. Perfect."

2020-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Gloria's place is one of the most put together airbnb's we have ever stayed in. We are also super-host and know what it takes to make a beautiful spot that people feel comfortable in. Gloria has done that with Grace and style
2020-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Glorias place was amazing! So clean, so beautiful and a great location! We loved our stay!"
2020-10-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Gloria has thought of every detail. Everything we needed and more was stocked at the apartment. The space is wonderful, much larger than appears in photos."
2020-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I loved this apartment, and would stay here again the next time I travel to Iowa City if it is available. The location is perfect, a short walk to downtown, but slightly removed and very chill and quiet. I was here for work, and could easily walk to the archive at the library, I think it would be an easy walk to the football stadium - once it is safe to go to football games again. Speaking of which, I was very pleased with the contactless check-in, I felt safe, as I am travelling during the pandemic and wanted to minimize my interactions with people. The apartment is decked out with so many nice touches, I don't think I have ever seen so many kitchen appliances in an Airbnb, and all of this made eating by myself, either cooking or ordering take out, much nicer. It is a clean, cute, well decorated apartment, and I love how thoughtful Gloria is. The soap dispenser in the shower is a great example, it has soap, shampoo and conditioner. Super grateful I got to stay here, thanks again for everything!"
2020-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Gloria's apartment is just wonderful! Everything was spotlessly clean when we arrived. The furnishings are so lovely - beautifully decorated- and many thoughtful touches like snacks and treats for our stay. The apartment is very close to the heart of town - you can easily walk to restaurants, shops, etc. The bed was heavenly - very, very comfortable. Gloria was very accommodating and quickly communicated. I highly recommend Gloria's apartment."
2020-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Located super close to downtown and the university, Gloria's apartment is super stylish and full of numerous extras, such as a full kitchen, satellite TV, an extra comfy bed, and more. But it is her decorating that sets the apt apart. From a fancy backsplash in the kitchen, to decorative ceramic pitchers and plates on the wall, to books on the shelves in the LR and BR, to wicker baskets -- it is all decorated with style and panache. This is not your typical bare bones apartment at all. Very comfortable and very enjoyable."
2020-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This was the perfect location with amazing service. Would recommend to anyone coming for a short or extended stay.
2020-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This apartment had all the amenities to make a brief stay very comfortable!

2020-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Gloria space was absolutely stunning! It will definitely be a space that my husband and I keep in mind when visiting family in Iowa city. It‚Äôs such a great warm inviting spot in an excellent location.
2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I had a wonderful stay here. It‚Äôs comfortable and pretty. I don‚Äôt have much to add to the other raves. I didn‚Äôt have a car during my stay and it was a fine walk to and from food, not far."
2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"It doesn‚Äôt get any better than this! A fabulous, comfortable apartment that is close to downtown and the UI campus.

Love the sweet signs and way she decorated the whole place!"

2020-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"At the last minute, I was unable to travel with my son to Iowa City for The Chieftains concert. My son was able to make the trip. He found Gloria's place to be an ideal place for him to stay in Iowa City. Clean. Charming. Well located.
I could have done a much better job communicating my change in plans to Gloria. In spite of this, she was understanding and accomodating.
Highly recommended"
2020-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Gloria thought of everything to make our stay comfortable and convenient! The place is updated and super clean!

We had an extra guest join us at the last minute and she responded within seconds and came over within minutes to get the extra bedroom ready. Such incredible customer service!! It was the perfect place for us for our weekend visit to Iowa City! Walking distance to everywhere. Would recommend to anyone visiting!
2019-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Very cute, clean, and well located place to stay in Iowa City. The bed is a sleep number mattress so you might even learn something about yourself (mine's 60). It was my birthday so Gloria left a cupcake (and a bunch of other treats) out for me which was really sweet."

2019-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Perfect for the 2 of us for a fun weekend in Iowa City. Great location near downtown, and the apartment was clean with many nice decorating touches and everything we needed. Gloria regularly checked in with us to see how things were going and if we needed anything. Having the parking space in their driveway was a big benefit as parking is tough at times in that area. Highly recommend and was exactly as advertised!!!"
2019-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is an amazing find. The location is ideal, walking distance to shops, bars, and restaurants. The kitchen is well-equipped and there are two good work spaces.

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful place, very comfortable and cozy. Clean, tidy, with everything you need to be well. Super spacious. Lacy was super friendly with us. We'd definitely be back!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,An amazing place to stay!
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We can't say enough, this place was perfect for my daughter and I taking Campus tours. Price was better than a hotel, amenities were great, location outstanding and parking just outside the door. The space was clean efficient and provided plenty of separation between a Father and Daughter. The check in process was a little confusing but the hosts communicated effectively and met me in the parking lot to make it a smooth process. Once checked in everything was EASY! I would highly recommend this Unit if visiting the University of Iowa."
2024-04-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"This is a wonderful space right in campus town. The loft area is great. We felt that the entrance is dark and unmarked. There was a homeless man camped out very, very close to the entrance. The back door to the entrance hallway is left wide open, making us feel quite unsafe."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"A genuine gem if you're looking to stay in Iowa City!
Sandwiched between a row of stellar local shops and restaurants (Brix, Hamburg, Goosetown, to name a few), and just beside the university and downtown hub, we were well within walking distance of everything we could have thought to explore. Paired with the size/layout of the place itself, easily accommodating 4 guests (with lots of room for privacy, as well as spaces for gathering), there couldn't have been a better spot to come back to each night, or to regroup at throughout the day.
And not to mention the excellent communication from Lacy! Every question we had, even a month out, was met with a darn-near immediate response -- always clear, and always understanding at that.
Don't even get me started on the price! All things considered, it was an incredible deal for three friends looking to stay for a few days. We'll definitely be booking here again :)"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Amazing unit and Lacy was very flexible and communicative. 10/10 recommend!
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Great place! Would definitely book again.
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Made for a great girls weekend stay! Very clean. Walking distance to lots of great places to eat. We would definitely stay again.

2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"This was a great place to stay. It was clean, spacious, and very conveniently located. We definitely would love to stay again!"
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This really is the perfect place to stay in Iowa City! It‚Äôs right in the middle of the Northside neighborhood which means it‚Äôs an easy walk to tons of great shopping and restaurants (especially Brix, the wine bar below the apartment). My husband and I stayed during a holiday weekend and even though it was busy downtown, the apartment was so quiet and peaceful. Lacy was a great host as well! She checked in to make sure we had everything we needed and was super quick to respond to all of our questions without making us feel bothersome. We‚Äôll definitely be staying again when we‚Äôre back in Iowa City!"
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"A wonderful place to experience Iowa City! Steps from restaurants like The Webster, Blue Bird, Hamburg II and Pop‚Äôs, as well as Lacy‚Äôs place, Brix, downstairs, and minutes from the heart of downtown. Yet it‚Äôs completely peaceful and private, with some comings and goings of Brix staff in the hall during business hours, but nothing intrusive. And HUGE! I couldn‚Äôt believe how massive this place is, with an upstairs living room and sleeping area, dining room, downstairs bedroom and high vaulted ceilings. It‚Äôs just as comfortable to spend the day in working or just lounging in the natural light from the windows and skylights. The alley parking might be tight for larger vehicles, but is convenient for loading and unloading. Lacy is really nice and responsive. My only note is that because of the high ceilings, the bathroom wall does not go all the way up ‚Äî there are no secrets. Keep in mind if traveling as a couple or group. Otherwise, I‚Äôll definitely stay here when I‚Äôm back in town!"
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,will definitely being staying again my next visit
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We were pleasantly surprised at how large the space was. Very clean, had a lot of extras that I don‚Äôt normally find when I go to an Airbnb, such as makeup wipes, washer/dryer, and fans (we sleep better with a fan on). Great place. Will stay again!"
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,I absolutely love this loft! This is my 2nd trip and ive aleeady booked my 3rd. The location is so perfect. I visit from Texas to see my Iowa family. Hands down absolute best air bnb! Lacy and Nick really go out of their way to ensure your stay is amazing. Communication lines were wide open the entire stay as well. The downtown shops are all within walking distance and have something for everyone. We ended up at Brix a few times this trip. Delicious menu all around! I cant thank you guys enough!
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Very clean, pretty and comfortable. Lots of good places to go within a short walking distance. Liked having a dedicated parking space right close to the door of the b&b that was easy to get in and out of, especially in a busy downtown area. Though downtown, This Must Be The Place was still quiet and restful when you got inside. Absolutely loved this place!"
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We had a wonderful stay. Lacy was very responsive and helpful. She even let us check in one hour early which we appreciated. Super walkable location. We did hear some of the restaurant related noise later at night and also some in the morning, but that is to be expected above a restaurant. We appreciated all the attention to details and would stay here again!"

2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"We had a very pleasant stay at Lacy's unique loft apartment. It was spacious and well furnished and equipped. The only drawback was the unusual bathroom which was next to the kitchen and had no independent ceiling, the strong exhaust fan helped.
Lacy and Nick were very helpful, responsive and friendly. We would certainly stay again."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We loved Lacy‚Äôs place in downtown Iowa City! My husband and I are Iowa alums and came to town for a family reunion.

The location was perfect, with easy access to local cafes and shops. The hosts were friendly, good communicators and filled the unit with thoughtful items. Iowa City was relaxing and pretty with lots of green rolling hills. We enjoyed delicious burgers and drinks at Pullman's Diner, which was so good we returned for breakfast that exceeded the dinner. I felt like a local and can't wait to return! Highly recommended!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Everything was as displayed and described on the web, the responses to our messages were very fast, we did not miss anything, everything we might have needed was provided. We will come definitely again."

We brought in dinner a few times - the microwave, mini fridge, and small set of dishes meant we could comfortably enjoy some of Iowa City‚Äôs great food and beer from the comfort of our Airbnb. Thanks for a nice stay!"

2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"It was great in every way. All the other reviews have basically said it, but I will add this..
We have stayed at a lot properties over the last 5 or 6 years, and so you come to see a pattern of hosts who ‚Äòget it‚Äô and hosts who don‚Äôt. karma gets it. There are little thoughtful touches everywhere, like a nice throw on the couch, an outlet in the right spot, a coat rack where you‚Äôd put it if it was your space. Highly recommend."

2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I knew from the listing and reviews that Karma's place was special, but I couldn't have imagined what a beautiful and supremely functional space we'd find. Artists created this! The d√©cor is delightful and it felt like a haven instead of just a place to sleep. It's a private space with patio access in a quiet neighborhood. There were fawns just 20 feet from the door! We had a lovely chat with Karma too on our way out. I will always do my best to book with her when I'm coming to town. Thank you so much for the wonderful experience!"

Karma was easy to communicate with and made our stay pleasant. The house itself is just a short drive off the interstate which is what we needed. The only complaint I have would be the thin pillows on the pull out couch-we normally bring our own pillows while traveling but forgot them this time. Slept fine with them though!"
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We really enjoyed Karma‚Äôs private level suite. It was a very quiet location in Iowa City to unwind and rest while we traveled. It was also located very close to the college campus and bars and restaurants. Her place was extremely clean and cozy and the check in process and communication was very clear! Can‚Äôt wait to stay here again!
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Look no further, this is the ONLY place in the Iowa City area that you will want to stay at....again and again and again!

2021-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Karma‚Äôs place is outstanding. Bright, clean, and welcoming with very thoughtful extra touches. The sweet little personal welcome sign in the window was heartwarming at the end of a long day of travel. She was extremely accommodating in my initial contact and adjusted her normal booking times to fit our travel schedule and was very gracious throughout the process. Our night there was wonderful. Unfortunately we were not able to stay long enough to enjoy everything her place has to offer, such as coffee outside on a charming patio, but we loved being able to relax and sleep in such a spotless and welcoming spot. Karma has a charming gift of hospitality that adds an extra warmth to her stellar place. I would definitely go there again if I were in the area."
2021-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We would definitely recommend Karma's Airbnb. It was cozy, clean and extremely peaceful. We were visiting our grandson at the University of Iowa and it was very convenient. You won't be disappointed!! Dave and Linda"

,,,My wife and I and 6 month old daughter walked into air bnb and someone elses stuff was still in room. They never left. Cleaning lady and owner never touched base. It smelled real bad and glad there wasnt someone in there when we arrived. Make sure to run and better business.
