2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The location of this unit couldn't be better!! The patio overlooks the ocean and beach. With a keyless entry, we were able to just head out to walk the beach without bringing a bag. The kitchen had plenty of dishes, cookware, appliances & three types of coffee makers. You'll need to bring the food of your choice, because there's only salt & pepper in the unit. Be sure to bring your own soap, shampoo, conditioner, they only provide small samples. This is an older community that is well maintained and this unit has recently been beautifully renovated. We stopped at the Publix grocery store before checking in for breakfast, lunch, and snacks. Since this was Memorial Day weekend, all the restaurants had a long wait & traffic in/out was horrible. This unit was so comfortable, I would have preferred to stay in & prepare dinner in the condo also. The pools were crowded with lots of families with kids, so we preferred time on the beach. We just relaxed but there's plenty of activities"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Chad’s place was fantastic.
We were very pleased with our time spent there.
Wonderful views, clean, cozy and comfortable.
The view from the balcony was amazing.
At night time we had an awesome view of the full moon over the ocean.
Chad communicated well."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We absolutely loved Chad's condo! Amazing views, perfect location, and refreshing living space. Condo was very relaxing, peaceful and had lots of great amenities such as board games and awesome coffee station. It was the perfect getaway my husband and I needed to relax. Thank you!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed about a week,"I enjoyed staying here for a 9 day solo vacation. The location of the unit is steps away from a walkway to the beach, and a short stroll away from a small pool. (There’s also a much larger pool on the property.) The closest entrance to the condo does have a short flight of stairs. Grocery stores/restaurants are nearby, and there’s a bar and restaurant on site.
The condo is comfortable, well-equipped, and generally quiet, though the sound of the wind can be audible at night. The view of the ocean from the balcony was a highlight of my stay! (Note: BYO pantry basics like oil, spices, tea, etc.) The mattress is on the softer side, but the blackout shades were great. Whenever I had questions, Chad communicated promptly and quickly resolved minor issues. He provides very thorough info/directions (ex. beach towels aren’t provided). Please take the time to read them before you come, so there are no surprises. I had such a wonderful trip that I’m already dreaming of my next getaway!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We had a great time on HHI. Chad’s place is exactly as pictured and was very clean and well-appointed. The resort has easy parking and quick beach access. The views from the balcony were beautiful and the cross-breeze in the corner unit was perfect. Chad is a very communicative host and left plenty of information about the property and the island. Thanks for a great stay!
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Loved that this place was steps away from the beach.

2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Gorgeous, updated condo in an amazing location with incredible views and amenities. It was our first time to Hilton Head Island and there is so much to do close by. We did the Dolphin Discovery boat ride to watch dolphins up close in their natural habitat, rented E Bikes from Arrow Bikes who delivered them right to the condo, biked to shopping and resturants. Walked on the beach, drank Pina coladas by the pool and just enjoyed! Excellent trip, great hospitality from the host and an incredible spot to relax at the end of the day and watch the sunset from balcony."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Ocean Overlook was as described with great views of ocean and very nice beach. We enjoyed our stay there and Chad is very responsive.
2024-02-01,5,Stayed about a week,"We have stayed at SOOO many places over the years during our winters on HHI, and we have never had a host that was so communicative. Chad has thought of everything to make your stay enjoyable. I also greatly appreciated the higher end deck furniture. Perfectly comfortable for the hours you’ll spend sitting there looking at the most perfect view."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed about a week,Chad was an excellent host. The condo was lovely and comfortable. The view spectacular. An unexpected issue came up which Chad took care of promptly. He responded to all our questions very quickly. We hope to return someday.
2024-02-01,5,Stayed over a week,Chad was a tremendous host and communicated extremely well. This property exceeded our expectations - the view of the ocean is incredible! The condo had everything we needed for our stay and we highly recommend booking soon!
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,A great place to stay! Beautiful views and a great place to get away.
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very cute and comfortable stay!
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Perfect location for a long weekend birthday getaway. End unit with a wonderful view of the beach. Boardwalk to the beach was just outside the building. Building was at the back of the complex so was very quiet.
Chad was very responsive to any issues that came up.
Would definitely recommend this condo."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We had a great stay, very close to the beach with beautiful views"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We loved our time in Hilton Head and the condo was wonderful! We especially loved being so close to the ocean!
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had an absolutely wonderful stay at your beachfront condo last weekend. The condo itself was beautifully decorated, sparkling clean, and extremely welcoming. The living spaces were comfortable and well-appointed, and the view of the ocean from the patio was stunning.
The location right on the beach could not have been better. It was incredibly convenient to step outside and be right on the sand. The beach itself was clean and peaceful, perfect for long walks, playing games, or simply relaxing. The sound of the waves along with the ocean breezes setting the scene for a tranquil getaway.
We had a fantastic time during our stay. In the evenings we enjoyed preparing meals together in the well-equipped kitchen and dining while looking out at the sunset over the water.
I highly recommend this Airbnb rental to anyone looking for beach vacation. Great experience Chad!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed over a week,"If you are looking for a prime spot to view beautiful sunrises and even catch sunsets from the same spot, then look no further. It’s your corner office away from the office.
Well appointed, including an actual properly sized main TV — I can’t tell you how often this is either overlooked or just plain neglected which is crazy knowing that large TVs now can be obtained for a rather small investment. You’ll appreciate this.
Lots of space in the kitchen and plenty of counter real estate for prepping meals if you decide to not take advantage of the plethora of restaurants. We made food in-house often, well my wife did, because she is an amazing chef.
A king-sized bed is key and they took care of not only having this, but making sure it was comfortable as well so it is easy to relaxe into restful nights. The shower is ample size and furnishings throughout are well done. We would recommend this spot to anyone as a worthy expenditure of your hard-earned money."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great location. Great view of the ocean. Easy ocean access. Nice and cozy and comfortable. Chad was very responsive and communicative.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Me and my wife really loved this great gem! We went to Hilton Head for her birthday, and THIS PLACE REALLY MADE THE WEEKEND!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is a beautiful condo with a spectacular ocean view! Super clean, comfortable and a great location. It is an older community but it is well maintained, clean and quiet. The unit itself has been beautifully updated and felt brand new. We didn’t have time to use any of the community amenities but there seemed to be a lot of options available. We were in town for our daughters wedding in Bluffton along with several others which meant we visited some of the hotels in the area as well. Hands down, this condo has the best view, ease of beach access, and was the most comfortable. Chad was excellent, he sent check in details ahead of arrival, checked on us once we were settled, and checked in again as we were leaving. My husband is already talking about coming back for a real vacation and staying in this unit next year!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Our stay was perfect! The condo is better than described - the view and location could not have been better! Chad’s an awesome host, great communication and very accommodating - we will absolutely be back!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This has been a great experience. The condo was immaculate, and its oceanfront location was the best! We could continuously hear the surf, which made for a relaxing and peaceful stay. We did not want to leave!
We travel frequently and stay at AirBandB’s often, and this is one of the best stays. If you want to experience the ideal place on the beach, you should not hesitate to book this one. You can’t go wrong.
Chad, the host, was very responsive at all times. We had an issue with the refrigerator’s temperature control, and Chad arranged for two different repairmen to come promptly. As it turned out, the refrigerator is actually being replaced with a new one, within days of our stay.
Bobbie and Don, High Point, NC"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed about a week,Chad was an extremely responsive host when I had questions. I would definitely rent from him again. The condo was wonderful.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Our stay was wonderful, very peaceful and a very short walk to the beach. The restaurants at the resort are great, we would absolutely stay again!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a fabulous week at Chad’s place! The unit was clean, peaceful, and exactly as described. Chad was very kind, proactive, and responsive. One more hour of our drive home, and we are already talking about how we miss Hilton Head. We will definitely be back! Thanks again! :)"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The unit is beautiful! It was totally what we were looking for. Direct beachfront! There were a few minor things that we were not sure of. Chad was very responsive and helpful. I would definitely recommend any of his properties. We already booked ours for next year!
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Chads home was outstanding! My wife and I watched the sun rise every morning, spectacular! The bed was very comfortable. We had everything we needed for our stay. We sat on the balcony every evening, enjoying the constant ocean breeze before going bed. Just 10-15 minutes from Harbor Town, and 5 minutes away from the grocery store. Moments away from multiple restaurants. We did not want to leave."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,great location with easy access to the beach and great view from balcony

2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The place was great!
Chad was great!
Book it and enjoy!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Beautiful spot! Our family of four were very comfortable in this beachfront condo. Big TV’s, comfortable beds and a gorgeous view from every point. The beach was very busy in a summer weekend but that’s to be expected. Be aware there is public access to the beach to the south so you may see more traffic than you expect down that way. All in all it’s a huge beach and there’s plenty of room. We body surfed the whole time 🤙🏼"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed about a week,"“Super Host”…..super view….loved walking the beach for early morning sunrise, finishing with coffee on the balcony.
Chad’s unit is very convenient for accessibility to and from the beach. The unit is as described….you will feel comfortable and at home. Would stay again!!!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,We had a wonderful stay!!
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We enjoyed a wonderful 5 night stay at this beautiful ocean front condo. I would highly recommend this place for a relaxing beach break. The condo was spotless and had everything we needed (and more!). The views were spectacular! Chad was on hand to answer any queries. Book this place - you will not regret it!
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Chad went above and beyond with communicating and made sure we had everything we need to have a great time. Folly Field Beach might be the best we've visited. The seashells are lacking but the sand is so nice and packed, you don't end up taking it all back with you. We loved the seaside view and enjoyed a couple of nights watching lightning storms across the ocean. In the mornings, you can also see the dolphins from the balcony catching a sunrise swim.
The only note of improvement I have is the lack of water pressure in the shower but that's an easy fix.
The resort is dated but well maintained and has some wonderful amenities just a short walk or quick drive from where you are. If you're looking for a location on the quieter side of town, this is it!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great space… very accurately described in the overview of Chad’s place…. We will stay there again in the future!
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Perfect for a couple, clean and updated furnishings. Loved the lay-out. Quick access to the beach. Quick in and out of the property to get to all the popular restaurants and shopping.
I am very picky about where we stay and this place was awesome!
Celebrated our 28th wedding anniversary and my husband's 1 year anniversary of a double lung transplant. It was a great get away for us."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great location! Steps from the beach and a corner unit. Very clean.
He was very responsive. Responded immediately.
The unit has one bed and a pull-out couch will is a full-size.
Perfect for a couple!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Perfect getaway location to recharge. The condo was clean and inviting with updated furnishings. Nothing missing, we enjoy the great experience of oceanfront living. Great location and great views from the third floor, which never disappointed. Chad reached out prior to and upon arrival to check if everything was in order, (it was). Chad’s information binder was very useful, for information about the condo as well as recommended locations within the area. We highly recommend this place. Again, the sunrise views were amazing."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,This place was great for our first family vacation!! Only steps away from the beach and so much to do within a 10-15 minute radius of the condo. We loved sitting on the porch to end and start our days. Would definitely recommend!
2023-04-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"This one bedroom condo was cute, cozy, and remodeled. It was small but perfect for two. The view from the living area and balcony was breathtaking. We enjoyed watching the sunrise and dolphins at breakfast each morning. The beach is nice and was not crowded in April.
The bed is very comfortable and has a thick memory foam topper. There was a nice selection of pillows, but there were only two pillows cases. Chad did offer to have some delivered, but we made do with what we had. The linens could be a little better quality.
The entry door opens right next to the bed which was odd, but the unit is at the end of the building so it's fairly quiet, and we felt safe.
Chad is an excellent communicator and was quick to respond to and resolve any issues we had. Prior to our stay he sent a lot of helpful information. The binder in the unit also has instructions for practically everything.
Favorites on HHI: The beach, biking in Sea Pines, Harbor Town, Coast, Cinnamon Bear, and Hudson's."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Staying here was amazing!! The view of the ocean from the balcony was beautiful plus the tall chairs and table made it easy to sit and see over the railing. The condo was so clean and comfortable, with everything we needed and more! The location is great as well. We didn’t want to leave. Thanks Chad for everything!"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Fantastic oceanside property. Immaculate property with helpful responsive host. Great place to relax, explore the island, listen to the sound of the waves on the balcony, or even in the very comfortable bed! Could not fault the property or the host.

Condo was stylishly decorated, welcoming and truly felt like an oasis. Fully stocked kitchen and on-site laundry and gym to workout.
Host also graciously provided us with great recommendations. We enjoyed the Gullah tour and museum, visiting a host of Ocean front restaurants, HH light house, Audubon Nature tour and other activities.
I highly recommend staying at Chads space. Waking up to scenic panoramic ocean views is priceless. Thank you Chad, for helping to make our trip to HH a truly memorable experience. My husband and I will visit again."

We will definitely be coming back to stay and would recommend this place to anyone!!"
2022-09-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Chad could not be a better host. He is so organized and made sure everything was clear and easy for us. This extended past just the accommodations and into making sure we took full advantage of the island. He had recommendations for restaurants, activities and the most detailed golf write up with his person ranking. The condo was gorgeous and clean and had the most amazing view. It was so nice to pop down to the beach and be such a quick walk back to the condo. It was nice to have the restaurants on site to grab a drink or jump into Coconutzs sports bar to catch part of football Sunday. The staff at the bar was great and we loved the company in there. We’d recommend this in heartbeat! Thank you Chad!!"

It's not large, but it's not so tiny that you can't enjoy your time there. I will say that both the bed and the sofa bed were comfortable, the sofa bed would have been tough for me to share with somebody else just because I like my own space. but it would work great for a couple of nights and be absolutely fine for a week with smaller kids. I loved having the option of a Keurig or a drip coffee maker. The shower pressure was awesome. The sun rises were amazing.
Checking in and checking out. were very detailed which was welcomed. Chad is an awesome communicator and made me feel as though he really cared about our experience. He didn't have to but it was appreciated that he did.
I'm sure that if I venture back to Hilton Head I will be checking on the availability of this condo first."
2021-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This quaint villa is exactly as described. You can not be much closer to the ocean at Hilton Head without swimming. in it. The place has upscale decor, newly remodeled and views that are worth every penny. Super Host amenities and superb comminication throughout. The resort is family friendly with playgounds and tons of activities. There was even a craft fair during our stay on the grounds. The guest book is full of excellent reccomendations.
Would definately rent from and stay again - a true gem in Hilton Head!
Oh and don't forget to 'sign' your sand dollar on the wall. 😀"
2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Words aren't enough to explain the beauty that is captured within this quaint corner overlooking the beach! The place is beautifully renovated, comfortable, and functional (utilized the space well)! Waking up early most mornings & sitting on the back porch to catch the sunrise was worth the trip! The space was perfect as we celebrated our 8 year wedding anniversary."
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I can't say enough positive things about our stay here. The home is updated and beautiful and the view and location can't be beat! A perfect, quaint space for two. Chad was wonderful to work with and provided us with everything we needed and more. He was extremely accommodating and clearly put a lot of thoughtful touches into the home and communication. The home is equipped with everything you need for your stay. We loved waking up to the gorgeous sunrises right on the coastline, breakfast on the patio, and how close the home is to direct beach access. We hope to be back very soon for another visit."
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We would go back to Ocean Overlook in a heartbeat! It’s by far the best Airbnb we have ever stayed in….well-equipped, extremely clean, neat and organized, beautifully decorated. Chad is detail oriented and obviously takes pride in his work. The view from the balcony and the proximity to the boardwalk alone would make for a wonderful stay, but then having a host who makes his place warm and comfortable for his guests really raises it up a notch. We hope to re-visit sometime soon."
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Perfect location with a short walk to the beach. Such a relaxing stay…the King bed was pure luxury! I would definitely stay here again.
2021-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great view , home on smaller side really only accommodate 2 people. Home was newly renovated and in great shape."
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Chad was extremely communicative and the condo was top tier. We loved the ocean views! We will book again if going back to Hilton Head.
2021-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,Great condo. It was clean and had everything we needed. Excellent view of the ocean.
2021-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,We had a wonderful stay in this property. It was clean and everything was as advertised. The host was welcoming and all was in order. Steps from the beach with a great view.
2021-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Great condo in a fabulous location! Steps from the beach, breath taking sunrises, beautiful remodeled condo. We loved biking to shelter cove for dinner and fireworks."
2021-07-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Chad was an excellent host. The condo is as described, with a beautiful deck providing the greatest beach views. Entire condo has been renovated and is super modern and cute. The unit is on the end with no foot traffic by it, so very quiet. The bed is very comfy and huge. Lots of room in closet for everything you packed. There are baskets on top of the refrig to put all the chips and snacks in so they are not all over the kitchen. Even on a packed July 4th week we were able to find parking right under the condo. The washer and dryers are only steps away and it was nice to be able to wash our beach towels and swim suits daily.
You can have chair and umbrella service by the day or week provided by the resort. It was a bit pricey, but well worth it to us not to have to pack up all that stuff every day. There are bike rentals in the resort as well. Cool trolly service provides rides all over the island if you do not want to drive. It was a wonderful stay and we have already decided to come back next year."
2021-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The Ocean Overlook is absolutely amazing and has all the amenities you will need and more! There are several restaurants within walking distance if you don’t feel like leaving the resort and Gator’s pizza (highly recommend) delivers if you don’t want to leave the condo. We were right on the beach and a very short walk to the pool, which is great if you have little ones in tow. The condo has beautiful modern finishes and was very clean, we highly recommend Ocean Overlook for an exceptional HHI experience!"
2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Wonderful ocean front villa! We enjoyed our stay very much!!
2021-06-01,5,Stayed about a week,"My husband and I had a great time staying here! I have been coming to this resort since I was young and have stayed at many different units over the years and the view you have from your balcony of this property is unreal! My parents stayed in this particular unit prior to Chad purchasing and renovating and the updates Chad made really brought it to the next level! We had booked our reservation before the new upgrades were completely done so we booked based on the view alone and the few pictures that were available. Chad sent pictures every few weeks to update us on the progress that was being made which was super nice of him! The villa was extremely clean and the perfect amount of space for the two of us. We can’t wait to stay here again in the future and would definitely recommend this property to friends, family, or anyone looking for a a relaxing beach getaway!"
2021-05-01,5,Stayed about a week,"My wife and I were looking for a week beach getaway with incredible views and the Ocean Overlook did not disappoint! The units recent renovations are incredibly nice and you can’t get any closer to the beach. Besides the proximity to the beach, my favorite part of this unit was being able to watch the sunrise in the mornings and then the high tide roll in during the evenings from the spacious 3rd floor corner patio.
If the views and renovations aren’t enough, Chad, the host, was hands down the most hospitable host We’ve ever dealt with on Air BnB. From the time I booked to the time we left, Chad was incredibly helpful and genuinely wanted us to enjoy our vacation. Prior to our trip, Chad was even kind enough to spend 20 minutes speaking to me reviewing amenities and other recommendations on the Island.
If you are looking for a luxurious beach getaway then this is the place for you!"
2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Chad was great. Provided lots of suggestions and his place was great. Highly recommend. We’ll be back!
2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"You can hear the waves gently lapping the shore as you enter Chad's condo. The view is absolutely breathtaking, but the benefits of staying in the condo do not end there. Chad has literally thought of every detail. The condo is beautifully appointed and it is evident that much careful planning and meticulous thought went into every inch of space. You will want for nothing staying at Chad's condo. In addition to the space itself being above and beyond expectations, Chad is an incredible, thoughtful, and responsive host. He includes information and FAQs on every question you could possibly have. He checked in with us to ensure we were satisfied and to see if we needed anything additional. The level of service he provides is truly commendable and beyond anything I have ever experienced at previous AirBnB stays. Just as an example, we foolishly forgot some personal items at the condo. Chad was immediately responsive and offered to ship our items back to us. He did not berate us for being nuisances and was so kind despite the inconvenience to him. I could rave about Chad and our stay in perpetuity. However, I believe I have painted enough of a picture. In short, you MUST stay here!!!! Thank you a thousand times over for a truly magical vacation, Chad!"
2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We were really impressed with this place. It’s been totaled remodeled! So nice to have everything brand new!
Chad was so attentive!"
2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful ocean front condo that is perfect for a beach holiday. Chad made booking and staying at his unit so easy. He responded to any query almost immediately. The place was spotless. The bed was great and the ocean view was unrivaled. Shouldn’t say this but compared to a hotel, it was a bargain at twice the price! We will be back!!"
2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Chad was an extremely informative, efficient and wonderful host. His place is the perfect combination of beautiful view, as well as updated, modern and clean. We found everything to be perfect! His communication was great and our stay was wonderful. Very highly recommend!"
2021-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Ocean Overlook is a beautiful, fully updated condo with an amazing view! It is exactly as pictured and everything was new and so clean! We enjoyed sipping our coffee and watching the sunrise and keeping the windows open and listening to the waves as we drifted off to sleep at night! We even had the bonus of being there during the Pink Moon! Chad is an incredible host with great and fast communication, and he sent us detailed instructions on how everything worked. The check in and check out was convenient and easy! I would highly recommend Ocean Overlook if you want a great place to stay in Hilton Head!"
2021-04-01,5,Stayed about a week,"My wife and I and granddaughter thoroughly enjoyed Chad’s condo in Hilton Head at the Hilton Head Island Beach & Tennis Resort. We have stayed at that resort many times and Chad’s place is newly refurbished and is a very nice upgrade to other condos we have stayed in there. The view from the 3rd floor balcony can't be beat. Everything is as advertised and as shown in the pictures. He is a great host and was very responsive to all our inquiries and also to an issue we had with the new dishwasher, which has since been resolved. The new king size bed is very comfortable as well. We will definitely stay there again in any future visit to Hilton Head Island."
2021-04-01,5,Stayed about a week,We LOVED this vacation. Hilton Head was so charming and Chad’s place was unreal! Wow!!!! The view was worth every penny.

Everything was newly remolded and top of the line!!!’ Thank you again Chad!!!!

The space was fully stocked with everything you need for a day of fun in the sun or if you wanted to cook your own meal and spend the evening inside playing games.

Right next to shops, a popular restaurant, general store and ice cream shop on one side and right across from a peaceful beach on the other side. We spent our nights walking to get ice cream and then over to the beach to see the dolphins. The condo is within the Sea Pines area which has everything you need! Lots of playground areas if you’re traveling with kiddos.
The house is extremely clean the beds and pillows are so comfortable, and the shades make everything nice and dark at night. There are extra linens and a ton of amenities including things for the beach and a ton of items for kids (pack and play, booster seat, cutlery and more). We’ll be back!! A perfect stay! Thanks Kim!"

2023-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The condo was perfect for my family of 5 (3 little kids). Pack n Plays, portable booster for high chair, clean living space, beach amenities and even kid friendly cups/utensils and plates (which was the added bonus I didn't know about). Kim was a great host and quick to respond to any questions I had. The location is great - the building backs up to the pathway to the beach. Quick little walk to Salty Dog Cafe and the little shops around there. When I say quick walk, I mean it! It was super easy with 3 kids in tow. Bike riding rentals right at the tennis courts. Location was great!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Kim was an extremely responsive host. Her place was wonderful. Our 21 month baby learned how to crawl out of her pack and play on this trip so it was so helpful that her place was kid safe. We loved that she had dishes and toys for kids. Her unit is beautiful and we had a fantastic stay.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with a pet,We loved our stay in Hilton Head at Kim’s cozy beach condo! It was a perfect beach getaway for our small family. The condo truly had everything we needed from a well-stocked kitchen to helpful baby supplies for our young daughter. The location is stellar with plenty to walk to - we loved walking to the Salty Dog for lunch and it was a quick hop over to the beach! Kim’s place is clean and comfortable with many of the amenities of home. We enjoyed playing cards and drinking a glass of wine on the porch each evening in the rocking chairs overlooking the water. Thank you for a wonderful stay! We hope to be back next year!
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Kim's place was very clean. The beds were super comfortable with lots of extra pillows and blankets. I'm so glad there was a lighter for our birthday candles which I did not remember to bring.
The third floor might be an issue with some older folks who can't do stairs but it was fine for us. The location truly can't be beat!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Kim was a great host, friendly and very responsive, and the condo was just as described with everything we needed. The beach is just a few steps away and lots to do within walking distance. Lots of free parking. Great place."

2023-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Everything just as described and pictured. We enjoyed the stay.
For beach lovers- the beach gets a high tide and low tide every 6 hours we were told. During low tide beach was wonderful. Calm, found starfish, lots of blue crabs, hermit crabs, saw dolphins, perfect for kids. High tide meant no beach sand at all, we walked towards the blue tower beach, which also had amenities like bathrooms and was about a 10 min walk from the place. The bay is perfect for fishing and felt like we were on a lake which kids enjoyed anyways.
It was easy to book a banana boat ride, kayak tours and paddle board tours right from the marina by salty dog cafe.
Kim’s place was comfy and had everything you may need."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Great location! We had an amazing vacation staying at this rental. The condo was just steps away from South Beach, pickleball courts, the Salty Dog Cafe, and marina. It was also right next to the trolley stop, which we used to travel around Sea Pines during our stay. The place was clean and comfortable and Kim was very responsive to any questions I had. Would definitely rent this place again!"

2023-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Great stay! Host was very responsive. Kitchen was well stocked - one of the best we’ve experienced in a rental. Loved that they had so many kids amenities onsite - dishes, pack n play, booster chair, beach towels and toys, etc. Saved us from having to travel down with a few extra bags. Location was great. So close to beach, bike paths and Salty Dog. Loved all the storage/organization options like having a laundry basket, lots of hangers and extra bins for sandy shoes. Great rental. Would definitely recommend."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed over a week,Kim was extremely helpful and responsive to all our questions. The condo unit was very clean and comfortable and had everything we needed. We really enjoyed our stay for the month.
2023-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Thank you again Kim and Ty for a wonderful month long stay in your fabulous home. Everything described about 4 Bluff Villa is spot on! The amenities were perfect. The open floor plan was so welcoming and bright. We enjoyed sitting out on the balcony with a view of Calibogue Sound out front! It was a short walk to the beach with fabulous sunsets nightly. Steps away were the marina and shops. Harbor Towne and Sea Pines Shops were a short drive with great restaurants. Location, Location, Location!
Your accommodations want us coming back again!
Nancy, Bernie, and Coco"
2023-01-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Great place, nice hosts"
2022-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"The place was amazing and an exceptional location. So close to the beach, South Beach Marina, and courts (yes…pickle ball & tennis). Kim was responsive and communicated with us about our visit. We would definitely stay again…a true HHI experience!! Thank you for the memories."
2022-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"What a fantastic space on a beautiful island! This condo really delivered a clean, family friendly, beachy experience. Kim was so kind and responsive. We strongly recommend you book this space if you can! Seriously, book it now!!!!!"

2022-09-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This place was terrific! Location, light, bright, clean, beach just steps away, Salty Dog steps away(actually had several meals there, very good) we really enjoyed the balcony overlooking the pathway to the beach-just beautiful! Great communication with Kim regarding any questions or needs we had- super quick and detailed responses. Could not ask for more!"
2022-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,Such a nice place! Great location right off south beach and next to Salty Dog. The condo had everything we needed for a comfortable stay. The place is also very kid friendly! Nice bonus for anyone traveling with kids. Thanks again Kim and Ty!
2022-09-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Wonderful stay! Very good location, so easy to get to the beach at the very toe of the island! Thanks to Kim for excellent communication ahead of the stay too."
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"IMPECCABLY clean and so, so cute. Tons of little details that showed the hosts care about your comfort. Highly recommend!"
2022-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Great stay in Hilton Head! The condo was comfortable and had everything we needed for a long weekend in Hilton Head. I appreciated the extra touches like providing a beach bag and towels and chairs we could borrow. Easy walk to beach. Communication was fast and easy. Highly recommended!
2022-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This place is fabulous! It is the perfect location near the beach, bike rental, and Salty Dog. It was clean, quiet, beautifully furnished, and with lots of parking. Hosts were helpful and friendly. I highly recommend!"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed over a week,"Condo was clean and well stocked for our two week stay. The location to the beach, pool and all the south beach amenities was a short walk.
We hope to return here next year.
Only drawback for some vacationers would be the stairs, the condo is on the third floor."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Great location, peaceful and very comfortable stay. We had a nice and quiet visit during a busy time on the island."
2022-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The condo was terrific and the most child-friendly place we've ever stayed -- booster seats, a pack-n-play, children's beach toys, etc. The owners went out of their way to be responsiveness and helpful. And the location is unbeatable - perhaps 100 yards from the ocean (view from the balcony), and about the same distance to Salty Dog complex with food, activities, etc. Would definitely return again if the opportunity arises."
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"AMAZING FAMILY TRIP! We had such a great time walking to the beach, pool and even rented bikes at the nearby South Beach Marina. My mom was so surprised how comfortable the pull out couch was she had me get in bed with her to try it. My kids loved riding the free trolley down to Harbor Town to see the boats and eat at the new Quarterdeck restaurant at the lighthouse. Great trip and the hosts made sure everything was perfect. Thank you Kim and Ty!"
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Such a great Airbnb! It is clean, spacious and a quick walk to the beach. It is also a minute walk to salty dog."
2022-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,Fabulous! Thank you
2022-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Had a great time in HH. The property is beautiful and the condo is only about 100 yards from the main hub of the property where the marina, Salty Dog, general store, etc. are. The condo was very clean, comfortable and roomy."
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Pictures are accurate. You can see the water from your deck so easy beach access. Very clean. Cozy beds. Kitchen has everything you may need. You even get a gift from your host.
2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great host, excellent communication. The property is beautiful and well equipped, the bed is very comfortable and the apartment very clean. The location is great, a very short walking distance to a beautiful beach and we were fortunate to see dolphins within about 10 feet offshore. There is a Marina a short walking distance away, where you can eat and shop."
2022-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,Don't waste your time reading this message if it's available you better book it or you will miss out on great location and beautiful views.. We saw several dolphins in the mornings literally 15 feet away from the shore it was amazing.
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Perfect getaway for my husband and our 2 dogs! The view was even better than the pictures. We saw dolphins and little fawns every day. The space was perfect for us. Plenty of room, comfortable, and clean. Had some great eats and drinks at Harbour Town which was a shockingly short walk away. Our beach of choice was Coligny beach which was a quick 12 minute drive. All around love love loved this stay and would book again!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Amazing location, amazing view, amazing price"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,We enjoyed our time here. This place was unique in its design and we had plenty to do. We would not hesitate in recommending.
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"My wife and I drove down from Charleston with our two boys and dog for a getaway weekend and it was perfect. Such beautiful views and the house is really cool. The bed was very comfortable and the house was equipped with everything you could need for a visit. Our kids loved seeing all the wildlife- dolphins, deer, birds, crabs, etc. Kathleen was very helpful and a good communicator. We loved it and hope to be back."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This place was very nice and clean. Great for a small family or a couple. The view was spectacular and love the wildlife. Especially the deer.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful home in the most stunning location. We adored the view, the sunsets, and the occasional dolphin sighting. A very magical place. The home was modern, well-appointed, and tastefully decorated."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Wonderful stay - great location! Loved that they had bikes available - highlight of our trip to ride the HHI bike trails.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Beautiful, pristine house with unobstructed view of the bay and marsh. We had one rainy day, but it was nice to have floor to ceiling window with view of the outdoors. The host was responsive, but heads up the pool is under renovation for 2024 and inaccessible. Also, the house only came with 2 bikes instead of 4. Overall, we enjoyed our stay!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,First time in Hilton head for us. Location was great. Close to restaurants and shops. View was beautiful especially the sunsets.
2024-03-01,3,Stayed with a pet,"Great place but we had issues with the TVs, internet, and barely any toilet paper. And if you have any issue it has to go through AIRBNB, the management company, and the owner. So I spent our vacation trying to get our issues resolved and providing proof to 3 different entities and other than giving us the wrong password, we never got any of the other issues resolved. Very frustrating."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was a fantastic place to get away for a few days. The views were beautiful, you could easily walk to all the activities in Harbor Town, and the house was tucked away to where you felt plenty of privacy mixed with nice quiet and peaceful environment. The house was clean and the host responded immediately with answers to any questions. We would certainly stay here again."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,We enjoyed our stay. It felt like we were living in a tree house. It felt very private even though we had other homes near by. Great location for walking into HarborTown.
2024-02-01,5,Stayed over a week,"Wonderful time. Walked to Harbour Town, great restaurants. Best was our view from the house over the bay watching dolphin, boats and wildlife.
Highly recommend"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Beautiful home and setting. Spectacular views withs daily Dolphin and Deer sitings. The home is modern, quiet, and so very peaceful. Even with houses close by, you feel very private. Walkable to restaurants, shopping, tennis, and walking/bike trails. I recommend this home and Hilton Head Island!"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful location
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great location and wonderfully nestled in a little wildlife sanctuary. Wonderful visit.
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had the most beautiful 30th anniversary here. It was so clean, comfortable & cozy. The location is out of this world. We left like we were the only ones along this area. The bay is spectacular. We saw dolphins, plenty of birds & the sweetest little bats who pop out occasionally late at night. They have zero interest in people so don’t freak out. Just enjoy watching their flights. The deer were lovely. We watched a whole family of them throughout our stay. The fawn was obviously our favorite. There are so many places to eat within a 5 minute walk. If you don’t want to walk, plenty of restaurants will deliver to you. Our ABSOLUTE favorite delivery place is called Local Pie Woodfired Pizza. We ordered salads, pasta, pizza….pretty much half of the menu. Every item was delicious & fresh. I could go on and on about how wonderful this location is. The best compliment I can give is we’d go back a hundred times over if we could."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Thoroughly enjoyed the tranquil atmosphere of this beautiful retreat, yet it was just a short walk to great restaurants, coffee shops and markets. We were drawn to the area for a vintage car show, a first time visit to Hilton Head. We look forward to returning and spending more time exploring all the area has to offer. The bike paths throughout Sea Pines resort, amongst the majestic oaks was magical."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,It was a beautiful place for our honeymoon and we love it so much! I forgot to log out of my YouTube TV account though so if you see this I need your help hahah but 10/10 amazing!
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Highly recommend! Cannot say enough great things about the space and location. The host was also friendly/gracious and very responsive. Will definitely be staying here again in the future, if available."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,A little slice of heaven. 10/10 recommend booking here!
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with a pet,This sea side home is a real gem at a wonderful location
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Such a beautiful rental with the MOST gorgeous views! Incredible hosts, very kind and responsive. Will definitely stay again!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"If Sea Pines and bayside is your preference, this is a great option!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Definite repeat spot! What a wonderful place to post up for a few days! The view is top notch. I personally really appreciate the cleanliness of this home too. Thank you for making us feel at home. Great spots to eat near by. Read the ones in the guest book!
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I don’t usually take the time to write reviews for our AirBnb stays, but this location stands out above any other place we’ve stayed. The home is absolutely gorgeous and the location and views were incredible. Having access to bikes & beach chairs and a guest pass to Sea Pines made our trip that much more enjoyable and stress free. The host was incredibly responsive and provided fantastic restaurant recommendations. Will 100% stay at this location again in the future!!!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"While this place doesn't have beach access on property, it is extremely close to Harbor Town and great restaurants. You're just a short walk from the lighthouse and marina, with wildlife all around you. Bike rides to the beach access points were short and scenic as well. Perfect for us and our two pups!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,A truly special place - the view and outdoor living are immaculate and the inside is the perfect combination of cozy and chic.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What a beautiful place! Short bike ride to great food, beautiful beaches, and sunsets on the deck. Will definitely come back!!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We really enjoyed our stay, beautiful water view from inside and out! Loved sitting on the deck and watching the dolphins and boats go by."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Can not beat the location and the place is worth every penny. Just wish it had been available for 2 weeks. Already planning our next stay.
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Excellent experience! The view was gorgeous, a quiet location right around the corner from great restaurants, and they even allowed our sweet pups. Also, saw more dolphins than we could count. ❤️"
2023-04-01,4,Stayed with a pet,"The View Is Incredible due to the location, and location allows one to walk into Harbor Town for any meal."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a wonderful time at this home. The location was perfect, the home had everything you would need on vacation. Hosts were great."
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Overall we really enjoyed our stay! There is a house fairly close to the deck but mostly feels private. The views are unmatched and ultimately I think that’s what you are paying for. Our last full day we saw dolphins and 5 deer that came up close to the house. There were also a bunch of little lizards out around the deck which was cool to see! The sunsets from the house/deck are beautiful. The house was clean and the bed/linens were comfortable. The kitchen mostly had everything you would need to make meals. There isn’t a ton of silverware. We were only 2 people so if you are a bigger group and plan on eating a lot of meals at the house I would just suggest bringing plastic silverware or be prepared to be washing dishes/running the dishwasher often. This was not a reflection of the house but there was construction going on 2 of the 3 days near the house which was loud and took away from the atmosphere a bit. Overall enjoyed our stay. Would come back again and recommend to others!
2023-01-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Great spot, gorgeous sunsets!!"
2023-01-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We had an amazing stay! Everything was as described and the furniture, including the bed was very comfortable. Gorgeous sunsets and lots of wildlife."
2023-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The location of this stay is UNMATCHED! Located in the heart of Sea Pines, steps away from Harbour Town (which is my family’s favorite place!). The sunsets were beautiful here and it was extremely peaceful. Though it is a little treehouse, it was so cozy and never felt too small even though there were 4 of us and a great dane puppy. Our guest contact was beyond helpful and sweet. It was very clean as well! Would recommend 100%!"
2022-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We love Deer Island, and by far this was one of our absolute favorite spots!!! Will definitely book again!! The sunrise and sunsets were spectacular over the water views!! We enjoyed the location , this beautiful treehouse was perfect to relax while spending time near to Harbortown with all our favorite restaurants and close to our daughter who lives in Sea Pines, this was a perfect spot for our trip!! We will definitely be back again soon!!"
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was a vacation for our 25th anniversary. We could not have been more happy. What a very beautiful home with excellent views! We saw deer and dolphins on our first night. If walking or biking is for you, This is a great place. We ended up renewing our vows on the deck of this home. Our host Kathleen was excellent responded very quickly with any question we had, and she had great recommendations.
We couldn’t have asked for anything more for 25th anniversary!"
2022-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We loved our stay! The location of the house is amazing-incredible views and close to restaurants and shops. We saw such amazing wildlife - deer, eagles, hawks and dogs - all from the house. It was great to have bikes available to use. The Sea Pines resort is so beautiful with so many things to see and do! We had such a great time and can’t wait to visit the Island again!"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Kathleen’s place was amazing! We were hoping to get a relaxing week and we got so much more. The views from anywhere in the home are incredible, the sunsets from the deck or inside were stunning and close to all the shops!
Bikes provided to ride into town as well. We could not have asked for a better place to stay on our anniversary. We will be back!"
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Loved this place! Great location and very clean.
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The house is lovely, and the owners have gone to great lengths to make one's stay pleasant. Its size is relatively small but quite functional. Its outdoor spaces are very gracious and provide quite a welcoming backdrop. Extras include bicycles, a child carrier, a weber grill, a firepit with wood, and of course, usable Wi-Fi. I found the owners to be most helpful, and should the opportunity to return present itself - I would do so in a heartbeat!"
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This treehouse sits in a natures paradise! It is absolutely a place to restore a weary soul! The house itself is charming, cozy, and was beautifully clean!"
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful home with stunning views. Kathleen was very quick to respond and had many wonderful recommendations. We loved that bikes were included with this rental. Highly recommend this place!
2022-05-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This property surpassed all expectations! The home is located in the heart of Hilton Head’s Harbour Town, yet is remote/private. The available amenities (including bikes - a must have in Hilton Head) and a tasteful/modern decor surpassed all expectations. Most impressive was the view, arguably the best the island has to offer. Nature enthusiasts will love countless dolphins, blue herons, and deer. Looking forward to returning to this gem of a property very soon!"
2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My husband and I booked this for our anniversary. The very first thing we noticed is the amazing view of the intercoastal. Not only is the view incredible from the top deck, but it just as beautiful on the lower deck and from the inside of the treehouse. No matter what room you are in, the view is mostly of the water. The treehouse has everything you could possibly need, and it was very clean. One of the things that we both appreciated was that all of the bedding from the sheets to the pillows were fresh and clean. The sheets were very soft, and the pillows were newer. The best part of our stay was all of the wildlife on the island. One evening when we were enjoying the sunset, we had five deer come right up to the lower deck. Amazing!! The water views and all of the wildlife from the deer to the dolphins, and all of the different birds makes this treehouse so peaceful that you do not want to leave. Kathleen was great when it came to communication and was very helpful."
2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"amazing location, cute and clean.. just perfect for a nice relaxing time in Sea Pines!"
2022-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Great location - walking distance to the harbor restaurants, shops, and playground. But the best part was the view. We loved watching the sunset in the evenings."
2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The location of this place is wonderful. The view of the water and wildlife is stunning. The ability to walk to downtown Harbortown and some restaurants was a pleasant surprise. All of the area activities are walkable, bikeable or a short car ride away. We never left Sea Pines. The host was very good at communicating with us and offered plenty of good recommendations for local restaurants and activities. The building itself was unique and adorable. The only negative is that it was smaller than I was anticipating which made storing our belongings challenging, and not much room for keeping non-perishable food or cooking. My family of 4 prefers a little more room to spread out. Everything else was amazing and I would highly recommend this rental to those who have small families or don't prefer to have a little space."
2022-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,This place is truly a gem! Super clean and a great location. Hope to stay here again!
2022-03-01,5,Stayed over a week,"Lovely views, responsive hosts."
2022-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Perfectly clean and well updated. Bed was comfortable and the space provided exactly what we were looking for. Location couldn’t be better. We loved Harbour Town and the bikes provided were great as there are many paths to ride around. Great stay!
2022-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,One of the nicest views and locations on the island.
2022-01-01,4,Stayed about a week,"It’s a great location, peaceful and beautiful and close to everything you need. We watched dolphins and birds and got up close to deer. The host was lovely and very helpful and responsive. It was a great time."
2022-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,The pictures don’t lie! This place is stunning. My husband and I are actually from Hilton Head and know how beautiful the island is and this location is unlike any other. The house itself is gorgeous. But the views are unmatched. Seriously worth every penny just to wake up the view. We had great communication with the host and encountered no problems during our stay.
2021-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Such a lovely, cozy place with wonderful views: definitely an amazing part of Hilton Head Island. Saw deer while sipping coffee outside in the early mornings and very much enjoyed our walks around the area. Very clean, very equipped and as mentioned, a cozy home away from home for our family. We will be booking again!"
2021-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Wonderful place and stay. I would highly recommend this place to family and friends. Cozy, clean , and just the right amount of space."
2021-10-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Thank you for allowing us to bring our dog! Your home is beautiful and so is Harbour Town.
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Absolutely perfect getaway. Saw deer and dolphins within hours of arriving. Can’t wait to come back!
2021-09-01,5,Stayed about a week,"One of the best experiences we’ve ever had! From the adorably decorated house to the unbeatable location, we felt right at home from the moment we checked in and honestly.. didn’t really want to ever leave! The listing is completely accurate and the neighbourhood itself was such a nice surprise. Beautiful, walkable/bikeable and all the residents were so friendly to both us and our pup Bodhi. We saw dolphins and friendly deer daily and couldn’t stop staring at the views from just about every corner of the house. I also can’t say enough good things about our host Kathleen. She was proactive and responsive and just a joy to communicate with. The extras at the home like the bikes and the fire pits really made our stay in Sea Pines extra special and we can only hope to return some time soon!"
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is one of the best Airbnb properties my husband and I have stayed at in the past several years. The property is clean, well-maintained and walkable. There are multiple restaurants, shops, a coffee shop, and the HH lighthouse within blocks of the home. We drove to different beaches and none took more than 20 minutes to get to. The backyard is stunning - we saw a family of deer and lots of dolphins.
Kathleen was a great host; she provided a lot of useful tips and was very responsive.
It only took us 50 minutes to drive from the Savannah hotel we stayed at prior to our stay in HH, which was an added bonus."
2021-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Beautiful view, quiet, and clean."
2021-08-01,5,Stayed about a week,Great views. Very clean. Perfect location.
2021-08-01,5,Stayed about a week,Excellent house within the Sea Pines resort. Bicycles for use was great as that is the best way to get to the beaches etc. Would definitely recommend!
2021-07-01,5,Stayed about a week,Great location and a lovely place. We had a great time and we hope to be back again soon!
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Fantastic stay. The home had everything we needed and more. It was clean, with a well equipped kitchen. We absolutely loved the beautiful scenery. It was quiet and peaceful with so much wildlife to see- deer, dolphins, birds, lizards…yet also so conveniently located. We enjoyed the short walk to Harbour Town for coffee, ice cream, shopping and drinks. Catching the free trolley to the beach was a breeze. Wish we could have stayed longer. Definitely hope to stay here again!"
2021-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,My family and I had the best time! Such a special place! The most beautiful views surrounding you. Perfect location for walking/biking into town for breakfast & dinner. Close to beach & park for the kids. We absolutely loved it - thank you for a great time! We hope to return again :)
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is the most incredible place!!! The location has stunning views and is secluded from all of the tourism, yet, is only a 5 minute walk to the amazing Harbour Town! My wife and I were blown away with everything! The host was amazing to work with and very responsive. On our daily walks we saw numerous deer that were very friendly and would approach you! The sunsets were breathtaking and dolphins swam by daily. We will always stay here when we vacation to Hilton Head because I don't think any other place will compare to this one!"
2021-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Great location! Truly a unique experience for a very reasonable price. Total relaxation - spent much time on the deck right on the marsh with magnificent view of the Sound. Dolphins, deer, raccoons and all sorts of birds. It felt like you were secluded and yet the Lighthouse and all amenities were just across the small bridge. We spent a good bit of time just exploring Deer Island during our daily strolls and bike rides. Each evening, we'd relax in the glow of our fire pit while enjoying the picturesque sunsets. We were able to enjoy with the whole family, including our puppy dog, Millie, who enjoyed early morning walks on the secluded beach. Cannot wait to go back...."
2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great trip! Host sent a fantastic welcome email with instructions and local recommendations. The place itself is modern and homey, with a great view."
2021-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,Such a cute place! Loved location and that it was dog friendly. Enjoyed watching dolphins from the deck and riding the bikes to the beach! Hosts were super responsive!
2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Perfect place for a wonderful beach vacation. Recently renovated, beautiful and sparkling clean. Enjoyed stunning sunset dinners at home, early morning bike rides on the beach with dolphins keeping us company, after dinner walks to Habortown. Would love to come back one day."
2021-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay! Very clean and location was convenient! Kathleen was wonderful!
2021-04-01,5,Stayed about a week,See previous review
2021-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Our stay better then we expected! The location is great - pure beauty from every angle - we saw dolphins, deer and birds everyday. We can't wait to visit again!"
2021-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,One of the best AirBnbs we have ever stayed in. Kathleen was great and communicating with us every step of the way. Can’t wait to return here in the future.
2021-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We loved the uniqueness (our own tree house!) and beautiful serenity/landscape of our rental. Clean and tastefully decorated. The owner was incredibly responsive to our questions (we recommend leaving instructions for the television). We met friends for a week and this was a wonderful setting for our reunion.
2021-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Excellent stay. Very convenient to Harbor town and local restaurants
2021-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Lovely high end sea house. Deer island is an unusual little piece of natural space right next to the touristy harbor town. The drive through sea pines is so pretty. We thought we’d spend time biking and touring but there was no need. The house is perfectly positioned for bringing your picnic back to the house. No beach but we didn’t mind. Wonderful little kitchen and bathrooms, fantastic bed and bedding. The view from the sea house looking over the grasses is full of marsh ducks, herons, some deer and little boats on the water. Fire pit was great, friendly and unobtrusive neighbors. Relaxing space for adults. Harris teeter grocery store had everything we needed and we cooked in every day and night, including firewood, fire starters, and wine. Wonderful for staying in but being immersed in nature, especially for 2 people. If getting out and about is your intention, then 4 would be ok too"
2021-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place!
2021-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,"A warm, inviting home with an amazing view of water, sunsets, and wild animals in their natural habitat. I found this home to be relaxing and comfortable."
2021-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This was one of the best airbnbs I stayed at! The entire place was so clean and well maintained. The surrounding area is so peaceful and quiet. The bed is super comfortable and the place is so much better in person. Take a nap on the hammock!
2021-01-01,5,Stayed over a week,"We loved everything about this place! The views were unbeatable and we felt very safe in the area. The beaches were gorgeous and we even saw dolphins from the living room window. I would 100% recommend this place to a friend and visit again.
My only words of advice to future guests are to careful of ticks/lyme disease. The house is located on Deer Island with a lot of high grass and deer. We found them throughout our stay so be extra careful not to wander off any trails. Or come prepared with permethrin, a tick-repellent you can buy for cheap on Amazon.com.
The host was very helpful as well."
2020-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Wonderful views, very well decorated and furnished, adequately stocked kitchen. Loved the brick deck, fire pit, bicycles, walking distance to the harbor, quiet and nature so close to the harbor.
The host was very responsive, the check-in was easy and almost overly communicated- multiple texts. Will definitely come back."
2020-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The house has a good view. We love walk or ride the bikes to the lighthouse and restaurants. The room is clean and cute. We will come back again.
2020-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Breathtaking bungalow! Perfect location, very homey, majestic views, very responsive friendly owners! We’ve stayed on HHI several times and this was by far our most favorite place! Great place for girls to get ready before our wedding and then a great mini honeymoon spot for my husband and I! Oh and let’s not forget our fur child, she LOVED staring out at all the birds and boats. The bikes and provided were perfect to ride around and explore the island too! We will be back!! If you need a relaxing vacation- this home will more than surpass your expectations!!"
2020-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place and great location. Kathleen was a fantastic host. We hope to return!
2020-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We absolutely loved our stay at this incredibly well designed and stocked rental. The views are priceless and the location does not disappoint. The host is friendly and responsive and the suggestions made our first trip to Hilton Head a huge success. Highly recommend!
2020-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This space is immaculate. The renovations were exceptionally done. Two great showers, the bed is large and comfortable, great kitchen with everything you need. The view is spectacular and you can walk to everything in Harbour Town and bike to everything else.
The communication was outstanding as well. We had an issue with a severe storm with strong winds blowing in and causing some damage, but Kathleen was awesome and we got everything sorted out.
Definitely stay here, you won't regret it!"
2020-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We enjoyed our stay. Such a beautiful place.
2020-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Our stay was amazing here! The view is breathtaking. You can see the ocean from every angle at the house. We brought our dogs along and they enjoyed walking to all of the different places around Hilton head. Many places have outside seating that allow dogs. Be sure to check out the Salty Dog and Beach Club. Our absolute favorite was ordering from Guiseppi’s pizza and drinking wine watching the sunset at the house. It was a nice peaceful getaway for us since our wedding was postponed due to covid 19. The house is super cute and it feels like you are in a little tree house! Also, Kathleen was a great host and communicated very well with us. We’ll be back one day :)"
2020-09-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Just spent a week at this tree house and it was absolutely perfect. The view from the deck is incredible and somehow looks even better in person than in the photos. We enjoyed it so much that we spent most nights in eating dinner on the deck. Check in was fast and easy and the hosts were always easy to reach when we had questions during our stay. I will definitely be booking this place again and I would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a clean, stylish, relaxing space with a beautiful view."
2020-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful house within walking/biking distance to Harbourtown. The house was very clean and had everything we needed. Very quiet and relaxing with amazing views all around! We loved our stay and would recommend it to anyone wanting to stay in the area!
2020-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Not a beach from location but ended up being the perfect place for a mixture of relaxation and fun! The views from the deck/patio are beautiful, provided bicycles allow you to explore and bike to the beach (about 2miles away), and bonus we saw dolphins everyday from the patio! We loved It so much more than we thought we would and can’t wait to return!"
2020-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Perfect location, all the little touches make this place a wonderful place to go and relax!"
2020-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This place is a gem. Let start with the sunset view- it’s quiet, the tide comes up, we could watch the parasailers, boats, and birdlife from the deck and from inside, as well as a nightly sunset visitor from a friendly deer. THREE outside seating areas for dinner and sunset views. Kids could bike to Harbour Town’s playground and we could walk to ice cream, dinner, and shops. Yet a quiet place tucked on the sound, very private. The place itself- amenities and finishes are 5 star. It is comfortable for a family of four and our dog. It’s got a hammock, bikes, nice beach chairs and a guitar, beautiful touches to make our stay comfortable. Water pressure- check. Linens and bedding- check. Cleanliness- check. Kitchen supplies- check. Owner was more than responsive and accommodating. When we returned home, our 7 yr old and 10 yr old exclaimed this trip was better than Disney World, now that’s saying something! Overall, this place is a GEM and worth the long review :)"
2020-07-01,5,Group trip,Quiet and clean home in HHI with beautiful views! Excellent host with quick responses! We will definitely be back!
2020-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This space is absolutely spectacular. The finishing touches are great, as it was just renovated. It was perfect for our family of four. The view and the location is amazing. It’s walking distance from shops, dining and activities but hidden on deer island with an ocean view. The host was great, helpful and responsive. We highly recommend this spot and plan to come back next summer."
2020-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"5-star amenities, breathtaking views and comfort of staying in your own house make this a rental you don’t want to miss out on."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Fantastic location! Short walk to the beach and bike path a few steps away. Comfortable bedroom with king size bed, everything you need and clean.
Very close to restaurants and shops. We had everything we needed to cook a few meals as well as plates, glasses etc.
Nikki was so accommodating about our stay and left us with a lot of information to explore Hilton Head. We have a great time there during our stay and we will book it again."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Hidden gem in HHI! Easy and beautiful walk to a not crowded beach, even during Memorial Day weekend. The first-level condo made access simple, and it was very clean. Plus, it's close to great restaurants in Coligny Plaza. The host was extremely communicative and kind. We will definitely stay again. Highly recommend!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We had a great stay! Theresa was very responsive and helpful during our stay.
2024-06-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Absolutely loved this condo and its beachfront location. The condo overlooks a natural beach with amazing high and low tides, sunrises, birds (bald eagle, painted bunting and even a spoonbill among the many variety of songbirds and shorebirds) and aquatic life. Wonderful beach for shelling as well. The whole complex was casual and relaxing with two outdoor pools, pond, indoor pool, sauna, jacuzzi, tennis courts. Theresa offered so many thoughtful amenities in her condo: beach chairs, beach umbrella, binoculars, sound machine to lull you to sleep, fully equipped kitchen, spacious shower, excellent selection of books, reference guides and local history. Condo was comfortable, clean and beautifully decorated. Check in and out was a breeze. The view from the balcony was the best on the island. Easy to get to plenty of fine dining and casual restaurants. Very laid back, peaceful location. Theresa responded promptly to all questions. Couldn't recommend it more. A+++++"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,best views and accommodations. Theresa was very helpful with restaurant suggestions and we went to the skull creek boathouse which was amazing. thank you again for allowing us to stay at your beautiful beachfront home
2024-05-01,5,Stayed about a week,"The place was beautiful along with the view and the grounds. We enjoyed watching eagles on the beach every morning and night. There were so many beautiful birds, deer, and raccoons that came through the property too. The condo had a wonderful balcony and everything was so clean and pretty. The bed was super comfortable and we felt right at home. I can't say enough good things about this place!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great location, cozy getaway for two. Felt very private despite being part of a complex."
2024-04-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"This condo is on the second floor of a 3 story building overlooking the water. We enjoyed watching the painted buntings, cardinals and nuthatches behind the condo as well the shorebirds roosting on the sandbar and regular visits from a bald eagle. The condo was located a short drive away from many wonderful restaurants and golf courses. Highly recommend if you are looking for a quiet, beautiful location to enjoy sunrises over the water. Teresa was very responsive when a problem arose (beyond her control) and went above and beyond to correct the situation."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed about a week,"The view from Terry’s balcony is amazing. We loved getting up each morning to have coffee, watch the sunrise, and look out for wildlife, including shore birds, cardinals, deer, and even a bald eagle who regularly stopped by. Walking the beach at low tide is a unique experience. Just a little note that If you are a very light sleeper, the floor directly above the bedroom squeaks loudly when walked upon. We enjoyed our stay and would recommend."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,very helpful and have great info about the area. will definitely book again.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The condo was nicely decorated and very comfortable. Beautiful view. Will visit again.
2024-03-01,5,Stayed over a week,There was a bald eagle that perched near the condo almost every day!
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Im picky about where I choose to lay my head and spend my money and Theresa's place is so great and exactly like the pictures. The only thing that threw me off was I had no idea that this was a high tide/low tide area. I couldnt enjoy the beach as planned each day I was there but thats on nature though, not on Theresa. Also, this is on the second floor, so plan for that in case ur expecting a lower level. The residents around us were so nice and welcoming. If you plan to cook she has everything you need, plenty of silverware, pots/pans and a Keurig. The table outside was perfect for sipping my hot chocolate while watching the tide come in. The bed was comfortable. Theresa made sure to make this place as comfortable as possible, the little details she made are great down to the little bars of soap and even the make up mirror. The labeling of the switches was extremely helpful. Because of the location of the condo I will definitely book here again but for a summer stay this time."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We've stayed here before and it was just as lovely as the last time. the unit is exactly as described, and we love the quiet seclusion of this location on the island. Thanks for everything!"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The area was just as described with a gorgeous water view and areas for walking. The unit was very clean, well maintained, comfortable, and had everything we needed. The weather allowed us to take advantage of many of the walking trails and historical sights on the island. Thanks for a pleasant and relaxing stay!"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was a wonderful place to stay in Hilton Head. The condo was well-appointed, comfortable, clean, and welcoming. The view was incredible and the beach was only steps away. Looking forward to staying again in the future!"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This little villa is a beauty- a true gem! The place is super clean and well appointed with darling decor. The incredible sunrises each morning and beach walks made this a perfect spot for our romantic getaway. We highly recommend and hope to be back.
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,My husband and I had a wonderful stay for a quiet and peaceful new year's eve and new year's day.
2023-12-01,5,Stayed over a week,"Theresa's place was as described. She was responsive to my questions about internet speeds at time of booking and provided thorough instructions for arrival and throughout our stay. She clearly went above and beyond to make the condo comfortable. The balcony view over Port Royal Sound provided us plenty of opportunities to watch the tidal changes, sunrises, birds, deer, and even dolphins! The Spa at Port Royal Sound is close to great food options (Hudson's Dockside Seafood was our favorite), coffee, groceries, walking trails, bike rentals, and of course walking the beach. We're just sad we couldn't use the outdoor pools being it out of season!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great spot, would stay here again. Very friendly host"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The condo was clean and comfortable with wonderful ocean views. Private beach was gorgeous. Everything we needed for a vacation was in the condo. Little extras for us ladies like great makeup mirror, iron and ironing board and hair dryer. Plenty of towels and blankets too. It is a very nice place."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a great time at Theresa’s place! The views were spectacular, and it was great to watch the tide rise and lower throughout the day. The location was great and easily accessible, the walls were a little thin, but that didn’t hinder the great time we had at the beachfront condo. We definitely would stay again!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Terry's place was a little slice of heaven! Quiet, clean, spectacular views. We had a wonderful time during our stay in HHI! Would definitely stay again!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This space is designed for those who want to be out of the main touristy area and have direct access to a beautiful view with front row access to the beach. Teresa is a very attentive host and deeply cares that each guest have a great experience. We developed a new appreciation for high and low tides while staying here and where amazed with how the landscape changes! The accommodations are very casual with no frills or fuss! Great for a few nights in the area for strolling a quiet beach, reading in a porch swing and getting away from hustle and bustle."
2023-10-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Nice and quiet
2023-09-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Terry's place is very cozy and clean. The attention to details really made us feel like home. Terry also kindly gave us advice on how to rent bikes and getting around HHI.
We absolutely loved the gorgeous view from the balcony! The beach was less crowded and had lots of wildlife, which we truly enjoyed. Watching hundreds of birds taking off on the sand beach at low tide was an unforgettable experience for us! We would definitely come back!"

2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I highly recommend! The view was amazing - right on the water with beautiful sunrises and great beach walks.

Close to a lot of HIlton Head restaurants and things to do - they provide a notebook filled with ideas to make your vacation more memorable.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Theresa was amazing from the start. She was super accommodating to us as guests, allowing us to stay at her property even with us being younger than she would normally allow. Her instructions were clear and precise, check in and check out were super easy. The location was amazing, the place was serene and beautiful. We will definitely be back."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Theresa’s condo was perfect for our anniversary stay! The natural beach might not be everyone’s cup of tea, but we loved it. We had to get used to how drastic the tides changed the overall beach, but no matter if the waves were up to the dunes or out a 10 minute walk, we loved all of the little wonders that were uncovered with the changes. Having that close of beach access at any time of the day was amazing. The condo was clean and lovely, had every amenity we needed, and had written instructions everywhere that made us feel secure and right at home. We opted to make breakfast there 2/4 mornings! There were beach chairs, beach towels, camping chairs, plenty of extra linens, toiletries…so much was provided that even if you forgot something or didn’t totally prepare for the beach the way you should have, Theresa had you covered. We would love to return sometime. Thanks for an easy and relaxing stay!! 🥰"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Terry's condo was so clean and well stocked with kitchen items, and she had Keurig pods with creamer to get you started. The view is the absolute best!! I have stayed at Shelter Cove, Palmetto Dunes twice, Beach and Tennis 4 times and this is the 2nd time at the SPA. This condo is the cleanest and has the best view. The area is quiet and serene. I definitely will be back."

The bed was super comfy, surroundings were quiet, place was extremely clean and had great items in stock (plates, cups, silverware) all of good quality. This was exactly what I needed for a long weekend recharge away. Teresa was super helpful and I appreciated the time she took to prepare recommendation binders for local restaurants/things to do. We used them and tried a couple great places to eat! I would stay here again!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Super nice,clean, just as described!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Theresa's place was awesome! We loved it so much. It was quiet and peaceful. The energy was much more relaxing than a resort. The condo was decorated so cute. So much nature to see and experience here. I am forever in debt to Theresa because we arrived there much later than expected (after all stores closed). I wanted more than anything to wake up and have coffee while watching the sunrise. I didn't think that would be possible, but low and behold, Theresa to the rescue!! She had coffee pods waiting for us!! My coffee dream came true. Would definitely come back"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,perfect place with a perfect location overlooking the ocean. couldn't have asked for a better weekend.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Amazing view!! This listing is beautifully decorated and well thought out. Had everything we needed and then some. It was also very clean! We loved being able to look out over the beach from the second floor balcony and still be steps away if we wanted to walk down to it! The grounds were also well kept and the location was secluded, yet close enough for shopping and dining. Highly recommend Terry’s property!"

2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I wanted to get away for a long weekend at the beach. Teresa’s condo was the perfect place to relax and enjoy the warm spring weather. I spent one full afternoon reading with the sound of the ocean coming in the patio screen door.
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We had a wonderful stay in this beautiful oceanfront retreat. The condo had everything we needed for our comfort and enjoyment. Terry was a fabulous host who made sure that everything was in perfect working order. Her recommendations for local restaurants were appreciated as was her timely response to any questions we had.

2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Perfect little get away. You will love the balcony and private beach. Both are great for morning coffee. Loved the sea birds too. Bring your camera!!!

Only thing that would have been better if we did not hear the above unit walking around in the middle of the night and if we were smart enough to work the tv in the living area. Lol.

It was set up perfectly with everything you could need and the perfect spot for my husband and I."
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Stayed here 3 nights on a girls trip and absolutely loved it! This has to be the most quiet beach I've ever been to. We woke up early and enjoyed watching the sunrise on the balcony with coffee. We also enjoyed all of the plants and birds down below the balcony. Lots of walking on the beach and relaxing! I would definitely recommend this gem and I sure hope to stay here again!
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This listing is exactly as described, including the great view from the balcony.

2022-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"I thoroughly enjoyed my morning coffee with an amazing view. The condo was thoughtfully decorated with a coastal theme. It’s a compact space, but the view makes up for that. It was a comfortable stay for my family of 3. We had a few meals on the front porch which beat any seaside restaurant view. Comfortable king size bed and a spacious shower. Well-equipped kitchen. Nice condo and great host.
Natural beach is great if you enjoy exploring, seeing various sea creatures (hermit crabs, blue crabs, horseshoe crabs, several fish, and a few dolphins spotted in the distance, and tons of coastal birds). There’s a flower garden in front of the condo on the first floor and it attracted so many beautiful birds. If you want more of a sandy style beach, it’s to the left of the pier. We switched back and forth during our stay. When the tide is low, the water goes out very far, so it’s easy to spread out.
Tip-Be prepared there’s no elevator and it’s on 2nd floor of building. We kept our beach chairs and wagon in the trunk of our car to avoid carrying it up the stairs."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We loved the slower pace of this resort and the fact that it’s away from all the hustle and bustle. We will definitely stay with Theresa again if possible
2022-07-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Theresa's place is beautiful - the view is the best part! There are also many local restaurants and great golf courses with great weekly specials if that is something you enjoy doing. We never drove more than 15 minutes for different activities and with the beach only steps away, it was a perfect location."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Great as always! Terry has everything and anything needed for a cozy stay. The unit is fresh, beachy, and the view- amazing!"

We really appreciated every detail Terry put into her condo, and she even provided a bottle of wine for our arrival, so we could celebrate our anniversary ♥️! She is a fantastic hostess! This was our first trip to HHI, and we will definitely be back! Thank you again!"

2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The view is spectacular! The space was exceptionally clean and the host has made every effort to ensure the comfort of guests. The bed is very comfortable.

2022-02-01,5,Stayed about a week,"This was our very best vacation in Hilton Head although we stayed at several five star resorts on earlier stays.
Our hostess anticipated our every need and provided much more in detailed information about HHI, restaurants and adventures her previous guests enjoyed. The full and part time residents were friendly, helpful and more than happy to share what they liked about local venues.
We enjoyed our coffee on the balcony as the sun rose and many walks on the beach each day. We also were blessed with the light of a full moon shimmering on the in coming tide."
2022-02-01,5,Stayed about a week,This Villa is a little slice of heaven on the beach. We enjoyed a relaxing week away from the cold of Michigan. It was clean cozy and comfy and felt like a home away from home. Theresa made sure we had everything we needed. Thank you!

2021-10-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Staying in Theresa’s condo at the Spa on Hilton Head Island was a wonderful experience. The views are breathtaking with so much nature to experience from the deck or walking the beach. It is close to the other popular beaches, stores and dining.

2021-10-01,5,Stayed about a week,"We loved our stay! Everything was super clean and well appointed with conveniences that made our stay so easy and just like being home. Plush beach towels, everything we needed to go down to the beach in comfort--chairs, an umbrella, etc. A super getaway location close to everything yet feeling off the beaten track. Terry is a great ""communicator"" and checked on us a couple of times just to make sure we were sailing along :) We'd come back in a heart beat."

Everything she said was exactly as was portrayed on the Airbnb site, her attention to detail was outstanding, the response time was outstanding, her villa was stunning & super clean; the porch was our favorite spot to view the beautiful scenery and wildlife and she had everything we needed for a restful and relaxing vacation.

2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We are so grateful for our stay at Terry’s villa. The private beach views are incredible and getting up early to see the sunrise is a must. The villa had all the amenities we needed to make breakfast and coffee in the morning, do laundry, and more!
Terry is also wonderful in terms of communication and checking in on how you are doing!
The villa is very close to the Hilton Head Airport, as well as the local winery and distillery. We didn’t end up visiting any of the public beaches at Hilton Head because of the private beach at the villa!
One of the things we wish we had done on the island is rent a bike. You really can get almost anywhere on the island by bike because of the island’s pathway system.
Would love to schedule a future visit to the villa!"
2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful place exactly as we expected! We will definitely be back!

2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a great time staying at Theresa’s place on Hilton Head. Everything was great-the view from the balcony, the short walk to the beach, the cleanliness, and the very comfortable bed. We would definitely recommend and plan on staying again!"
2021-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a great quiet, peaceful get away here! The view from the balcony and living room is hard to beat! Beautiful sunrises every morning while drinking coffee. The place had everything we needed to for the beach and all appliances and pots/pans needed to cook breakfasts in. The beach is quiet and peaceful! The place was very clean! Would not hesitate to book this! We had a very peaceful, restful get away here for our baby-moon!"
2021-03-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Great location for a stay at Hilton head! This is a perfect location for a quiet stay at Hilton head. We felt like locals staying about twenty minutes from the major tourist areas. Still has grocery stores and restaurants just down the road but much quieter. This was a great home base for us as we spent most of the days at the beach and exploring the island.
2021-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We thoroughly enjoyed a weekend getaway at your retreat. We especially appreciated how clean, quiet and helpful the tips for exploring the island were. We'll definitely be back. 👍"
2021-03-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Terry's place is amazing! The view is amazing to take in the beautiful sunrises and we even got to watch dolphins one morning from the balcony! The property in general is well kept, and maybe because we were there before spring break, it was very quiet. So peaceful and relaxing. Terry's extra touches make it feel like a home away from home. Hoping to return next year!"
2021-03-01,5,Stayed about a week,"What a great condo, great location and great attention to detail! It was everything and more of what was promised. We couldn’t have asked for a better vacation and a better place to call home for the week. We definitely plan to return and we will share this with everyone we know. If you decide to book here - You will not be disappointed! Fans for life - Chris and Marti O."
2021-02-01,4,Stayed a few nights,great place
2021-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,👍👍
2021-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My boyfriend and I spent 3 nights here last week and would absolutely stay here again.
Teresa is a fantastic hostess... she is very quick to respond to any questions, and she provides very detailed information about check-in and parking and amenities and many other little details that make getting settled into the condo quick and easy.
There is a lovely view, the condo is well-decorated, and the bed is extremely comfortable. Also, the blinds in the bedroom are excellent so if you want to sleep in just close the bedroom door and sunlight will not wake you up.
Only two cons to consider: although there is plenty of hot water, the water pressure is poor. And parking close to Theresa’s condo is a bit challenging during the late afternoon and evening. This is because it is at the back of the parking lot right near the beach and there is less parking there. To me it’s a worthwhile trade off to have an ocean view, but I thought it was worth mentioning.
Definitely a lovely place and a relaxing getaway!"
2021-02-01,5,Stayed about a week,Cozy place great location excellent host. Right on the beach. Can’t go wrong here.
2021-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Theresa's is a very welcoming, clean, well-designed, hospitable environment. The view cannot be beat! We walked the beach, watched the myriad birds, and took in the sunrise. The space is perfect for a romantic getaway for two. Also, we found Theresa very accommodating and responsive."
2021-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Do it. Beautiful views, great beach, lovely people. The condo is amazing - my favorite was the sitting area on the deck to do a puzzle, drink coffee and listen to the waves."
2020-12-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Terry is s real Super Host! She just renovated and did an amazing job. The unit is absolutely spotless! And what you see in her website picture of the Tree, beach, and water is what you see from Kitchen,LR and furnished balcony. The Sunsets and Sunrises were amazing! We stayed 9NTs in 12/20 and would have been happy to stay longer. It was the perfect getaway for the Two of us! We would love to return!"
2020-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful Beautiful Beautiful. You will not be disappointed. Theresa’s place is a hidden gem on the north side of Hilton Head. Hudson’s and Sea Shack are our favorite seafood places. You will not be disappointed!!
2020-12-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Great stay overall. The view is to die for, definitely book this stay!"
2020-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"If you want to wake up each morning and revel at the beauty of the sea, this is the place. The view is incredible and the beach is just steps away. A perfect place to rest and relax."
2020-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This is an extraordinary place for a great get away. So peaceful and beautiful. I could not rate this any higher.
2020-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My fiancé and I had the most perfect weekend in Theresa’s condo. As soon as you open the balcony door, you feel as though the ocean is in your living room. There is so much natural beauty to be seen.
The location was convenient to everywhere we wanted to visit while in Hilton Head. Theresa also provided a binder full of information on the island. The condo was an extremely clean and updated space. My favorite space however was the balcony, I could have spent all day there.
If you are looking for a secluded romantic retreat, this is definitely the place for you."
2020-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place! So clean! Great view!
2020-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Theresa’s place was perfect for our stay!

The balcony was our favorite spot for breakfasts - that view is hard to beat! Would definitely stay here again!"
2020-10-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Theresa's place was just as described and the beautiful location overlooks a centuries old live oak tree, a peaceful tidal ocean, and a beach made for walking! Our stay was relaxing and memorable. The intimate condo is nicely furnished and contains all your need for a comfortable stay. What we loved most about this location is it is near multiple important historic sites, particularly Mitchelville. Mitchelville is the first self-governed, thriving town of free Africans in America - https://exploremitchelville.org/history. Besides being a nice vacation location, we learned a lot about the history of African Americans in the area."
2020-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Theresa's place is exactly as described. Immaculate, Spectacular views, great amenities."
2020-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Awesome place! Great view! Close to everything and the tips and advice given to us was excellent!
2020-10-01,5,Stayed about a week,"If your looking for beautiful ocean views for breakfast, lunch, and dinner look no further! We greatly enjoyed our stay here when visiting HHI! The beach was very private compared to the areas public beaches and the resort was very quiet. Say hi to the very friendly next door neighbors that live there year round! Great people! We had everything we needed to cook at the condo, and enjoyed sitting on the balcony to eat. We spotted dolphins multiple times during our stay!"
2020-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place is a paradise. Its perfect in everyway. The view and location is amazing. You don't have all the traffic that other parts of the island have. So comfortable to be in and just to sit and listen to the waves. We will be going back there someday,"
2020-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The condo was spotless and well equipped. Terry was a wonderful host and we can't wait to go back!
2020-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We had a great time! Very quiet and peaceful area! Will definitely be back!!
2020-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The condo is amazing. It was super clean, and beautifully decorated. The host is easy to contact, and gave all needed info prior to the trip. The condo is on its own private beach. The beach is beautiful, and isn’t crowded. I was happy that the unit had a working washer and dryer, and didn’t have to deal with wet/sandy clothes after beach time. The condo is also near Walmart and the airport, which is a plus. During our stay we made several trips to the shopping plaza with ease, as well as a couple of trips to Savannah and Tybee Island."
2020-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Such a wonderful host! Couldn’t have asked for a better stay!
2020-07-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Beautiful view!! We loved the condo, very clean and comfortable. Terry is an amazing host!!"

2020-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place is perfect! The view, the location, the thoughtful details...everything was amazing! HIGHLY recommend!!!"
2020-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I booked Theresa's place for my parents, so I didn't get to experience her hospitality firsthand -- but my parents called me the second day of their trip already raving about the apartment, the amenities and the view! Leading up to my parent's arrival, Theresa was incredibly communicative and helpful. Thank you, Theresa, for setting the stage for a wonderful vacation for my parents!"
2020-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Theresa was a great host.
Our AC went out and she got it fixed within the day.
She was very responsive and helpful in many ways.
Awesome place!"
2020-06-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Teresa has a sweet, cozy little place, and it was perfect for our first anniversary trip! The view from the balcony was our favorite part!!! The amenities were perfect, and the beach was the best beach we visited on the island."
2020-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,"My 2 year old daughter and I stayed here over Memorial Day weekend and it was perfection! Steps to a gorgeous, private, tidal beach. We never left and ordered in every night! The view from the balcony is epic and tranquil!"
2020-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Has all the amenities of home. Great, peaceful place with a beautiful view."
2020-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Our visit to HH came at quite an interesting time with much of the island restaurants & shops closing due to COVID-19. However, Theresa’s home makes you forget about all of that. Peaceful, relaxing, and cozy, it was just what we needed. The beach did not get crowded, home was stocked with all you needed, and everything was sparkling clean. Theresa really thought of everything. We were so upset to leave and look forward to visiting again. Views are unreal and we look forward to walks on the beautiful beach that is just steps away."
2020-03-01,5,Stayed about a week,This is just a delightful one-bedroom condo with an amazing view. Everything was sparkling clean and the king-sized bed was sink-down-comfortable! The small but perfect kitchenette had just about everything needed for breakfast and lunch but may be a little challenging for an all-out dinner. We had a couple of friends over for lunch and it was do-able but a tad small. This condo would be best for a couple who will be dining out and breakfasting in. For this is was absolutely perfect. The view is not exceeded by ANYWHERE else on Hilton Head Island and it was for this reason we chose it and it did not disappoint! The access to the ocean is perfect and not to be underestimated. Loved it!!
2020-01-01,5,Stayed over a week,Great place with nice view at ocean. Good location and sparkling clean place.
2019-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The two of us stayed at Theresa's apartment over Christmas. We enjoyed both the beautiful view of the beach from the balcony and having such easy access for daily beach walks and shell gathering at low tide. (Bring boots!) The apartment itself had everything we needed to cook (although we brought a little too much to fit in the fridge), as well as being clean, nicely furnished and styled, with a comfortable king bed, and hot shower. We enjoyed the Jazz Corner and mini golf, both approx. a 10 minute car ride away, longer walks on the nearby beaches, and a quick visit to the nearby brewery which is an easy bike ride away. Thank you Theresa for giving us the opportunity to enjoy Christmas at the beach in your lovely apartment!"
2019-11-01,5,Stayed about a week,"This listing is exactly as pictured and described! Theresa has a great little space in paradise! Perfect for two that are looking for a little peace and tranquillity! Her communication is fantastic and her book for places to eat and things to do is great. The sunrises are fantastic!!! We recommend the sunset cruise out of the Salty Dog Cafe! We happened to be there for the full moon which made it a bonus!! We made day trips to Savannah and Beaufort!! Hunting Beach/Lighthouse was pretty cool too! We also went Hilton Head Distillery and Brewing, both very close to the condo. We hope to be back someday in the warmer weather. Definitely 2 thumbs up."
2019-10-01,5,Stayed about a week,Best place to stay in Hilton Head! I will definitely be returning
2019-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Terry is a wonderful host. Her condo is so clean and absolutely beautiful and comfortable. She has all information about restaurants and attractions in Hilton Head and helped us experience many new places based on her recommendations. We have stayed at 2 of the 4 star hotels in Hilton Head and did not receive the care and information that Terry offered. We appreciated all of her time and effort spent and her thoughtfulness was evident when we arrived. We look forward to being able to stay again next year!
2019-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great location and comfortable stay. Check out the distillery and brewery practically within walking distance.
2019-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We enjoyed this villa/condo. It is beautiful here! Everything has been so great. We love the peacefulness and the quietness that is here. We basically have the beach to ourselves this time of year. Sitting out on the balcony drinking my coffee in the morning has been awesome. We have not had any issues. We have found one of our favorite getaways and we will def be recommending this place to our friends and family should they want a quiet place to escape too. Hilton Head is beautiful and has not disappointed us. We did drive into Savannah one day and it too was beautiful. Perfect Relaxing Vacation!

2019-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What a find! We loved everything about our stay here. This is a perfect spot for a couple seeking a quiet getaway, and the view from the balcony is superb. Kudos, also, to Terry who is a fantastic host. Can't say enough about how thoughtful she is... from the way she has furnished and decorated her condo to her inclusion of guest-focused amenities to her communication throughout the process. Wow...."
2019-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This place is amazing! The view is beautiful. It was our first time on the island and we are definitely going to come back. Theresa is a great host and has everything you need to know about the island in the condo. I would definitely recommend to anyone who wants a romantic spot right by the water.
2019-08-01,5,Stayed about a week,"This is a great little beachside condo with the home away from home feeling. Theresa really thought of everything you would need. Beach chairs, small cooler, beach umbrella, even sun screen and bug spray! It was really nice to have all of that there already and not to have to go buy it at Walmart after we realized we needed it and didn’t have it. Also great value for money. Pro tip: watch the sun rise from the balcony, it’s amazing."
2019-08-01,5,Stayed about a week,"The space is great, tastefully decorated, everything you need at your fingertips, labels on everything, a house manual that leaves no question unanswered, menus and local tips galore. Next time I go to Hilton Head I will not “shop around “ for a place to stay I will absolutely book here again."
2019-08-01,5,Stayed about a week,Beautiful condo with an even more beautiful view! Perfect updated condo with everything you could need! We had trouble with the door and Theresa responded quickly to help us out. She checked on us throughout our stay which was so kind. Thank you again for a wonderful stay! 😊
2019-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Theresa’s condo is absolutely beautiful and so clean. I would venture to say the view from her balcony is the prettiest in all of Hilton Head. She was so easy to work with and quick to respond to any question I had. She provides everything you need for your stay. I would highly recommend anyone wishing to go to Hilton Head to stay at Theresa’s.
⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️"

2019-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Theresa is such a great host. She replied to my messages really quickly. Her place is beautiful with the most breathtaking view you can imagine. There is everything you would need and it’s spotless with a really comfy bed. Thank you.
2019-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This condo is absolutely perfect for a romantic getaway. The unit is stocked with literally everything you need. Check in was a breeze and unit was immaculate. The pictures of the view do not quite do justice for how beautiful and serene the space actually is. The pool and beach access is less than 200 feet from the door.
2019-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My husband and I truly enjoyed ourselves at this quiet romantic getaway! The space was clean, organized, well decorated, and had everything we could think we could need. Theresa really is a super host!"
2019-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This place was a little gem! Quiet secluded beach ! Beautifully remodeled! And the biggest amenity is the view and distance from the beach and sunrise! Really spectacular ! Can’t say enough about what a lovely relaxing time we had! Terry was responsive and lovely!
2019-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Amazing place!!
2019-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We loved our stay at Terry’s condo! The condo was clean and comfortable and Terry put a lot of attention to details. Check-in and all instructions were very clear and she left a lot of information for the condo complex and the island. The balcony and view was one of our favorite parts and we loved the access to the beach. The area was quiet and we had a very relaxing and great week!
2019-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Terry’s place was above and beyond one of the best places I’ve stayed. All the great amenities. Breathtaking views and a relaxing space. We could not be happier with our experience. We will be back soon without a doubt. Everything you could want and need to feel at home.
2019-02-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"We were visiting HHI to watch our son play in a college golf tournament. I loved the location of Theresa’s rental, especially the views that we had seen posted. The layout is a great use of space. It is cozy! My husband appreciated the assortment of coffees for the Keurig. There was a nice collection of books, especially on local history, plus recommendations for the area (restaurants, activities, grocery stores). The sunsets were stunning in the mornings! Loved having beach chairs to use. The mattress was on the soft side, so my husband ended up sleeping on the couch. We also could hear some noise from the upstairs unit at times. Otherwise, it was a nice space, great value & quiet location."
2019-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"A wonderful place to stay, great view, very roomy for two people. Owner provide great and thoughtful amenities. Very clean and well supplied."
2019-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Absolute perfection. Pictures very accurate; the beach and the water are right there. Views are wonderful. It was clean and quiet, and the kitchen is well equipped. Terry was super-responsive and helpful. Would return in a heartbeat. Hated to leave!"
2019-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Super nice and attentive host. Lots of suggestions for local places to go. Peaceful retreat.
2019-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"You can expect the most spectacular view! A very well appointed condo! Cozy space, with everything that you could possibly need to make your stay pleasant and comfortable!
Theresa, is such a kind host! Just the best!"
2018-12-01,5,Stayed about a week,This was our second year in a row staying at Theresa’s place and it was perfect again. We did have a question and she responded promptly to it. It was everything we expected. I would highly recommend this place.
2018-12-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Super host is an understatement! Theresa is so amazing and thinks of everything!! Absolutely no complaints with her or her place. Her eye for detail was very much appreciated to make our 10 year anniversary trip so perfect. The place is so clean and she has set up everything to be so convenient and comfortable. The kitchen was so handy and she provides everything you need to cook in. The bathroom is so nice as well, very nice big shower. The pictures don’t give that view justice. Quiet surroundings made it very peaceful to sit out on private balcony. The beach and pier were such pleasant walks even in the cooler setting. The location of the condo on the island was so easy to get to everything. Local attractions she suggested were well worth the visits. If we get the chance will definitely come here again! Such nice new memories thanks to Theresa!"
2018-11-01,5,Stayed about a week,"This quite HH condo was perfect. It was clean , bed is comfortable, and the deck , although small was amazing. The views were absolutely stunning.
The host was very accommodating and responded to Comunications."
2018-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Everything you need and more. Cozy, clean, and beautiful place. Nice and quiet with and amazing view. Well beyond our expectations when iy came to the little touches. We would love to come back."
2018-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This place was nothing short from amazing. The view and condo are exactly like the pictures listed. Theresa is so thoughtful and kind with everything she said and did. I will definitely be back.
2018-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We hardly wanted to leave the property. It was lovely to to have meals on the balcony, especially watching the sun rise over the water!"
2018-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"If you are looking for an amazing view for an affordable price, look no further than Theresa's place. Her home was inviting, clean and stylish. She has everything you would need for a beach vacation, including chairs and a beach umbrella. Communicating with her was a breeze and she was very responsive. And the description and photos of her place are spot on. What you see is what you get, and it is beautiful. My husband and I had a wonderful, relaxing vacation here."
2018-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful place with an Exceptional view from the balcony.
2018-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This home was lovely! The view is fantastic and the beach is only a few steps outside your door. Theresa was a marvelous host and the only thing we wanted for was more time!
2018-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a wonderful stay at Theresa's place in Hilton Head! You couldn't ask for a more spectacular view. The condo had everything you need, including a large binder of local attractions and things to do that we found very helpful. We would definitely recommend!"
2018-08-01,5,Stayed about a week,Beautiful small condo. Recently updated and very clean. Theresa had helpful guides throughout the home. Views were beautiful. Well worth the money
2018-08-01,5,Stayed about a week,Terry's condo is absolutely beautiful and the views are breathtaking. We loved the easy access of the beach just steps away. The place is sparkling clean and everything you need is provided. We loved the binders full of local recommendations! Terry is a wonderful host and quickly responds to any questions. We are already looking forward to our next trip back!
2018-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place exceeded our expectations. Beautiful view, beautiful decorations, fully stocked with everything you would need on a vacation, good price, wonderful beach and pool...we don’t have anything negative to say at all"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Amazing stay! It was just as described, right on the beach with a beautiful view of the dunes and beach from the patio. The condo was wonderfully cozy, but very modern. Mike communicated well and was quick to respond to any texts. This was my first time using an AirBnb so I was apprehensive, but this experience has exceeded my expectations!! My family and I will definitely be back and I totally recommend using Mike! Thanks again Mike!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Loved the condo and the ocean view! I actually appreciated the privacy that the sand dune offered from the beach visitors. The condo was very quiet at night despite being on the ground floor and was fully equipped with everything you’d need and more. Very clean, easy to find, nicely decorated and well thought-out. Would happily stay again!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful 1st fl condo on the beach w/ balcony facing the dunes & beach /ocean. You literally walk down a few stairs and take a short sand & deck path to the beach. PRISTINE. They ask you to help keep it that way, and you get it! It's lovely for 2 people. We will definitely stay here again. It was perfect and exactly our ideal location and vibe. Its like renting from friends...you want be asked back! Be sure to pack beach towels- it's the only thing you'd want but they don't provide. But I will gladly bring my own towels if I can just stay here!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Mike’s place (AR107) is ideally situated for easy load-in/out and just steps from the beach access point and 50 paces from the ocean. The view from the balcony is truly an ocean view. No joke. The condo has everything you need for an amazing stay. I really appreciated the beach chairs, beach umbrella and cooler Mike provided. Front office staff were knowledgeable and friendly. Made check-in a breeze.
A+ experience."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"For gorgeous immediate beach access and close-by resort amenities, this place can’t be beat. It’s simple but very nice, and you’re on a beautiful view of the water. Standard airbnb guest requirements (run dishwasher, take out trash, etc.). Only downsides: the bed squeaks, and check-in/check-out are 4pm/10am but they clearly use this time to make the place super clean. The beach chairs and umbrella provided are so convenient too!"
2024-06-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Gorgeous view and convenient to the beach!
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This condo was a great place! It has an unobstructed view of the ocean and we enjoyed sitting on the outdoor deck. The unit is nicely furnished and clean. Would certainly stay here again.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We enjoyed this location on the beach. The condo had everything we needed for our stay and was very quiet.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"it was just my husband and I and this place was perfect. Oceanfront and easy walkways to the beach. The airbnb was very well stocked with all the amenities one would need to cook, minus food. Bathroom was well stocked as well. Highly recommend staying here. Not far to grocery stores and restaurants. Great location. The host, Mike, was very responsive in my texts."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What a beautiful property! The sunrises were breathtaking and sitting on the balcony with a beverage was so relaxing. The kitchen was very well stocked with all the necessary kitchen ware and a nice variety of spices to use. The bed was very comfortable with nice quality linens.
Would definitely book again and recommend this condo!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The condo looked exactly like the photos. No surprises or let downs! One of the cleanest airbnbs I’ve stayed in and this is coming from a cleaner! Highly recommend this unit! There was a review about the noises with the bedroom being at the entrance—All noises were stopped by 9PM every night we were there. It was an extremely quiet and peaceful resort. I’m a very picky sleeper and had no issues with the noise at all. The bed was extremely comfortable and we woke up rested every morning. Book this place! I promise it will not disappoint!
2024-04-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Great location, however the overall cost is too much for a short stay. After all the fees and taxes the price was crazy. We didn’t have good weather so it was good that the resort offered things to do other than the beach. The photos posted makes it seem like you can see the beach from the balcony but it’s not the best view, all you can see is a dune. The room is on the first floor near the exit (parking lot) so you get a lot of the noise when someone is coming past your room. When you “check in” make sure you go to the front desk before you drive to the security booth to get your pass, they’ll make you turn around."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Worked out great for our visit. Beautiful sunrises over the dunes and beach.
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Extremely clean and what a view! Plus, ocean access is literally steps away.
We loved being on the quieter end of the island."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great, cozy stay! 75 steps from boardwalk to beach! It is a nice bike ride to the downtown areas. May the wind be at your back. Would stay again! Mike was super responsive and kind."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed about a week,Everything went smoothly. Place was exactly as pictures show. Didn't have any issues and the few questions we had were answered very quickly. Would definitely stay again.
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great little place with BEST VIEW EVER!!!
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was a wonderful place for a getaway. Quiet, peaceful, safe. Beautiful view - watched sunrises and the moon rise, too. Just steps to a beautiful beach. The employees in the resort are friendly. Place is beautifully decorated, clean and convenient. Perfect for two."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed one night,Amazing ocean front property!! Beautifully decorated and just steps away from the ocean! Also very close to all restaurants and things to do! Mike was a great communicator and we will definitely stay here again in future!
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Second time staying here and it was great again.
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Unit was as described. Good central location on HHI. Owners have thought of everything when it comes to amenities in the unit. Extremely efficient use of comfy space with newer furnishings. Owners were very proactive with communications. Resort beachfront bar not open in Feb and main pool not heated, but we did use pickleball courts."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Everything was top notch.
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Been to Hilton head several times previously, but this was definitely the location we would go back to. Not a huge space, but very well laid-out, tons of storage, kitchen contained absolutely anything we needed. We rode bikes from there, walked on the beach, played pickle ball for the first time (on-site) and loved it. quiet, truly oceanfront condo, but close to anything you would want to do."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful place! Pristine condo beautifully decorated. Will be back!!!
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,My girlfriend and I had a great time during our stay. We traveled to Savannah and relaxed on the beach. The location was beautiful and the place was clean only thing we would suggest is washing new towels a couple of times to remove any loose lint prior to putting them out to guest. We had the issue of the lint sticking to us after our shower or washing our faces. But other than that it was fantastic!
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Mike was very quick with any messages I sent. The condo was beautiful and I felt very secure. Very easy to access the condo via the key pad. Every consumable we needed was provided and then some. The sunrises were gorgeous. Despite the freezing cold outside, we were quite comfortable. Usually we don’t like the beds in places we rent, but this bed was nice. We liked the Keurig so much, we ordered one just like it for our home. We didn’t want to leave. Thankful for the pleasant weekend."
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,My husband and I really enjoyed our stay. The condo had everything we needed and everything was well placed which made for a very homey feel. Mike responded quickly to any correspondence between us. We would definitely stay here again
2024-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"Amazing condo, close enough to the water to hear the waves crash! Happened to book on a day when it was super foggy so couldn’t enjoy the view, however Mike’s condo more than made up for it. SPOTLESS with every thing you can think of already provided for you as a little bonus. Me and my girlfriend loved it."
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great spot for a weekend getaway.
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The condo was great! Very well decorated and organized. We had everything and more that we needed to make a meal and especially appreciated all of the options for making coffee. The resort property is beautifully maintained and there was plenty of parking close to the condo with easy beach access. It is in a wonderful location to enjoy all that Hilton Head has to offer. Mike was a very responsive host. We would highly recommend as a couples getaway!!!
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Wonderful place to visit, absolutely gorgeous view of the ocean. Very clean, close to alot of shops and restaurants. Had no issues checking in or out. I would have loved to stay forever!!!"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This has to be the best Air BnB we’ve stayed at. The condo was immaculate and comfortable. The view was stunning! Everything you could need or think of was present in the condo. Even an electric kettle!!
There were 2 large smart TVs, a comfy couch, well stocked kitchen and a breathtaking sunrise on the deck each morning.
The hosts were great communicators and everything was easy! Will definitely stay again!!!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,Awesome
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Just what we were looking for in an off season getaway. This space was very clean and matched the description perfectly!! Would gladly stay again if we ever return to Hilton Head!
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Thanks , a nice remodel of this unit. Great ocean view"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Our stay at this condo was perfect. Everything was as stated in the advertisement. It is a beautiful condo, very clean and had everything we needed. It’s a great location as well. Lots of restaurants and activities close by. The sunrises in the morning were spectacular. The hosts had very clear instructions, helpful tips and wonderful suggestions. I would highly recommend this home, location and host. Thank you so much for a wonderful experience!!!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great condo with a beautiful view of the ocean . So close we could hear the waves! Just a few steps to a great walking or biking beach. Easy check in and out. Fully equipped kitchenette. Great shower and a very comfortable bed. Parking was so convenient to unit. Thank you Cindy and Bob for providing us with a wonderful vacation experience ! Also your golf recommendations were extremely helpful ⛳️😊
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This was our second year and we will be back !!
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We had a relaxing vacation thanks to a great place to stay!
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"Location location location. You can't stay much closer to the beach than this. Space is at a premium here and this unit covers all the bases in a compact footprint. The popular beach here on Hilton Head is soft and pleasant to walk on. This makes for a comfortable and kid friendly beach experience.
This resort is also popular and the wooden construction tends to convey noise from other occupants a bit more than I would like. Some folk are just noisy. We didn't try out any of the restaurants in the resort but I expect they are all of good quality.
Most of what you're paying for with this unit is the premium location. if you want to have this view and have this kind of access to the beach at Hilton Head this is probably one of the best deals you'll find. If the location isn't your primary concern, this stay might not be the right bang for buck for you."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had the perfect couples getaway! We loved the condo, location and view. Wish we could of stayed longer!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Perfect get away. Steps from the beach , modern updated unit, very quiet and private."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great stay with my son! The apartment is fully stocked with essentials and games. (Do make sure to bring water to drink and make coffee.)
The place is Oceanfront on a 1st floor with a great balcony, downside is, I could not see the actual ocean because of the dunes and grass. Sitting outside and listening to the waves at night was relaxing. The Beach is a short walk across the dunes and the complex has a restaurant, bar and pool.
Highly recommend this gem!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Cindy, Bob and Mike’s condo was the perfect setting for our first family vacation with our infant daughter! The views from the balcony were amazing, and the beach was really just a few steps away. It was so peaceful spending our mornings and evenings on the balcony. We enjoyed the beach and the local breweries and restaurants during the day. Would highly recommend this condo!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We stayed here for a short honeymoon. The place looks just like the pictures and is exactly as described. The lawn chairs and beach accessories were a huge help, so we didn't have to bring our own in our travels. The bars and restaurants inside the resort were nice and the food was good too! Very clean home. We hope to get back soon!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed about a week,"This is a wonderful location. The living space was spacious, updated, very clean and well-stocked with many essentials. Beach view, access and location were ideal. our travel time from the HHI airport was minimal. Communication and directions from our hosts were clear throughout our stay. We hope to return here someday soon!!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Everything was great and just as it looked in the photos. Cindy, Bob and Mike were responsive and laid out everything we needed for our stay. The beach chairs and sand toys were a hit with my daughter. We had a blast and will certainly stay again in the future."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The stay was great! The location was good and easy to get to the rest of the island. It was nice that they already had several of the beach necessities available there. I’d recommend a stay with them and would book with them again!
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great location in the resort, plenty of parking and easy access to the beach from the unit."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We loved our stay! The place is beautiful and clean and the beach is literal steps away. Great views and so nice to have the beach equipment available for use. Really proactive with sharing info and helpful with recommendations. Would definitely stay again in a future visit.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Wonderful place to stay, we definitely come back again!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful beachside location was perfect for my long weekend—nothing like opening the patio door to listen to the ocean and watch the sunrise! It was also helpful to have chairs and beach-ready basics and avoid coordinating other rental supplies. The proactive communication and details made me feel comfortable and confident throughout, I would love to come back again."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Clean, Well Supplied and Beautiful View!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,Amazing stay. Clean place. Awesome hosts. We will be coming back!
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great location, private beach area, and relaxing"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Fantastic place. Great location, had everything we need. Hosts were great to work with also. Will return in the future!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great condo right on the beach. Has everything you need for a beach getaway. Direct oceanfront balcony perfect for late nights. Condo is well stocked with all the amenities. Hosts are very responsive. Important things:
Walk to beach: about 1 minute at most.
4 Beach chairs
Neighborhood: Quiet, Safe. Drive to most restaurants.
Decent size for 2 people. Can fit 2 small kids too. After that it’s a bit tight.
We really enjoyed our stay!"
2023-07-01,4,Stayed about a week,Beautifully designed condo. Very clean and the owners were very responsive. Well stocked with all your cooking needs. Would recommend for a couple.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,Just few steps to beach . Clean and nice condo
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful condo right behind the dunes with easy beach access from this first-floor unit. Two pools for off-beach swimming. Very bike-friendly area, we brought our own but rentals easily available. Clean and and beautiful condo with great communication from the hosts."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,Beautiful views! Very close to the beach! We had a wonderful time!
2023-07-01,5,Stayed about a week,"The pictures were exactly what you get. Beautiful view. Exceptionally clean. Provided fully stocked kitchen and spices. Any time you text the hosts through the Airbnb app they reply very quickly. So kind of them to provide beach chairs, umbrella and small cooler."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed about a week,This place was amazing. I loved how close we were to the beach. The beach was amazing too. You could ride your bike right in the sand. Every morning we put on our sneakers and headed straight to the shore. Smooth surface and a beautiful breeze! The unit was complete with everything you needed. The bed was so comfortable I slept like a baby. I would 100% return to Hilton Head and this property. Thank you for a great experience!
2023-06-01,5,Stayed about a week,This place was great! Everything was super clean and newly updated. The view was great with lots to do on the resort!
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Wonderful place to enjoy Hilton Head! Gorgeous ocean view from the room, can hear waves from balcony, short walk to beach. Super clean, great updates! We did not need to contact owner during our stay but any questions prior to our arrival were responded to quickly. Fantastic experience, not one complaint, would absolutely stay here in the future!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Perfect beach getaway! Only steps away from the beach. The pictures do not do this place justice, we can’t wait to return!
I left my wedding ring in the room and the hosts immediately responded and informed me it was found!!!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This was the perfect serene vacation for the two of us. This location was amazing with easiest beach access plus amenities to have everything you needed to enjoy long days on the beach. Not to mention the access to pickle ball and a great community to enjoy challenging some locals at a few games for a couple hours each day. Some great local food recommendations but not too much that we were able to explore on our own and found some awesome places to eat along the way. Perfect getaway spot!
2023-06-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Great location with easy access via boardwalk to the beach. Wish the balcony was a bit bigger but that’s not a big deal. Well stocked with kitchen supplies. Would definitely stay again but would wish for warmer pools but that is only Mother Nature’s job.
All in all a great spot. Did not try the restaurants on site so cannot comment on that. Great communication with the owners, would highly recommend."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Five star! Accurate description, beautiful view, terrific location. You can hear the waves from the room and the beach is less than a 3 minute walk away. Hosts were very proactive, descriptive, and helpful. Anything you can think of, they’ve already thought of! One of my top Airbnb experiences, we will DEFINITELY be back again!"
2023-05-01,4,Stayed about a week,"Great location. Clear and detailed instructions. Very clean and accommodating. Direct access to the beach; the big pool isn’t too far to walk. Space is small but well organized so if you are neat and use the space wisely (unpack) you shouldn't have an issue relaxing and enjoying your stay. The unit opens into the bedroom so that you must carry all beach/pool gear through the entire space to reach the balcony. Use the outdoor showers/faucets as instructed before going back inside. This helps but you'll want to sweep at least twice a day.
Thermostat is a bit high maintenance. My son was unexpectedly able to join us for one night. Though I'd thought I'd read there is free additional parking on site, we were told he’d have to pay $275 or be towed. My husband was unceremoniously told there is no fishing allowed on the property even though, according to signage, it’s allowed at the pond near the gym. Not ideal for late sleepers but who wants to stay inside at the beach?!
Would stay again!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great location for a couple - very well organized and also stocked really well!
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We loved this place! Super clean and comfortable. Great location. We’ll be back!
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Very nice place to stay. Great view, nice accommodations"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Fantastic! We will be back!
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Right on the ocean and just steps to the beach. They had everything you would want, beach chairs, umbrellas, etc.. kitchen is very well stocked, too. Huge comfortable bed"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The space was ideal for the 3 of us (myself, husband and teenage daughter) It’s super fresh, clean and tastefully decorated. I was impressed with how well stocked it was with dishes, kitchen utensils and just about every small appliance you could ever need, linens too. Had a little hiccup with the internet but Mike responded quickly and the issue was resolved instantly. I would be very happy to stay there again in the future"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Super clean and updated. Ocean view, resort was great and family friendly. Would highly recommend."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed about a week,"The unit was very nice and while I knew it wasn't big, it was even smaller than I'd expected. Understand my wife and I were traveling with our 16 year old son. You enter the unit from the bedroom which we took and he slept on the pullout in the living room area. That area is compact enough that the bed takes up the whole room and literally blocks the slider and is almost on top of the kitchen to boot. So if you are ok being cozy, this place checks all the other boxes! The place was very clean, super organized and there were many starting supplies from the moment we entered the unit. The view was great and you cannot beat the proximity to the beach. That made it very easy to run back and forth from the beach to the unit to make lunch, use the bathroom, etc. Also it is very easy to get from the parking on either side of the building to this first floor unit, so getting our luggage or any other supplies into the condo was a snap. Anyway, we'd stay again for sure!"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"Cindy, Bob & Mike were excellent hosts! The place was beautiful, comfortable, clean and welcoming. The directions to get to the location, plus house rules and check in & out were very detailed and perfect. The communication was top notch!"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,Perfect spot for a quick family getaway. Right on the ocean with beachfront views - close to local restaurants (even some on the resort) and literally steps away from the private beach.
2023-03-01,5,Stayed about a week,"First time visit to Hilton Head !
Could not have picked a better place to experience the atmosphere of Hilton Head. Location is steps from the ocean and great beaches !
Amazing visit and stay !!"

2023-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Great place and location for our small family. We felt that we had everything we needed in the condo, but it was close enough to run out to eat or grab groceries. View and quick walk to the beach was a HUGE bonus. We hope to come back in the future!"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed one night,This place and the host are top notch. I actually thought I had already given this review but decided if not then I definitely want to. Great people and great place!!!!
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I was looking for a quiet place to get away on my own, and this was definitely it! The condo was clean, nicely furnished and decorated. The kitchen had plenty of supplies to make cooking easy. The beach boardwalk access was right outside the condo. Check in was easy, parking was plenty, and they even messaged me that it was cleaned and ready if I wanted to go in a few hours early. Mike was very responsive and friendly to any of my questions. I would definitely go back."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed about a week,"What a great place to relax! We spent a lot of time reading on the balcony, enjoying the sound of the waves and soaking in the sun. The beach is steps away. The condo was very comfortable - the perfect size for two people - and super quiet. Comfy bed and good sized bureau for clothes. The kitchen was very well equipped, although truthfully, we ate out every night. It was nice having a laundry facilities in the building. We had a small glitch with the living room TV, but Mike responded right away with instructions for resetting the cable feed. All in all, a great place to stay."
2023-02-01,5,Stayed over a week,We enjoyed our 2 week stay very much. Everything was as detailed in the description and pictures. Mike was very responsive to our questions and requests. Would absolutely stay there again!

2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We thoroughly enjoyed our stay. They informed us that there was an issue with a leaky faucet due to the unusually cold weather. There was constant communication regarding the repair and they understood the inconvenience and told us to have a dinner on them. Great hosts - would highly recommend.
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"the place was everything we hoped for. we where pleased. Only because it was so awkward, the security literally ran straight into my teen, as if to provoke my son into a situation. thankfully my son stepped away and politely said, excuse me. the gard said nothing and when Iasked if there was some problem. the man just walked to the cart and stared at me. I asked if everything was okay.... 5 times and the security gard just started, said nothing only thingI wasn't pleased with."
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Although short, this trip was very enjoyable. Place was clean and stocked with everything we need. Love the beach access. Will definitely visit again."
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What a perfect anniversary trip! We enjoyed a relaxing and peaceful beach weekend. The view of the sunrise from the unit is breathtaking. The unit is steps from the beach. The condo was very modern, clean, and comfortable. Everything we needed was included…comfy large bed, large tvs, coffee makers, even spices for cooking.
We didn’t want to leave and can’t wait to come back again!"
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Perfect place to stay right on the ocean. This area was quiet with security, so we always felt safe. The size of the condo was just right for my husband and I, and we really enjoyed the deck/patio space to sit and listen to the waves. We also enjoyed that there was a bar/restaurant right on the property to walk to when we didn't feel like driving any further for the day."
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great place, clean, modern with all the amenities you need and an incredible view of the ocean. Got up every morning to watch the sunrise. Communication was super friendly and responsive. Will definitely stay here again!"

2022-10-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"This unit is much smaller than it appears in the pictures. It was clean, good location, furnishings were nice. Not a comfortable bed( extra extra firm) and pillows flat. Couch is uncomfortable. Okay for two people for a short visit. A bit over priced for overall value. It’s above average from other places we have stayed."
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Perfect location!
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Worth of 5 stars in every way. We really appreciate the condo. The location was perfect and everything was In awesome condition.
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Had a truly nice time at Cindy and Bob's condo, just a great location and view of the beach and ocean from the condo, meaning just steps from the beach and ocean, which was so convenient, plus the pools! The condo itself is beautiful, fully updated with everything you could possibly need, immaculate on arrival, just so relaxing and pretty. FIVE stars for communication, 100% on top of things and responsive. Definitely hope to stay again, HH is such a fun island:) Thank you Cindy and Bob for a great stay!"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed over a week,"This condo's location next to the beach and in a lovely resort offers lovely views of the ocean from the balcony. The unit itself is compact and extremely well appointed with everything you possible can need on your stay. The owners have done a marvelous of of updating the unit and providing high quality cooking equipment and other supplies. The king size bed was super comfortable too. During our stay hurricane Ian passed near us and the owners were exceptional in their communications with us which alleviated our fears. In fact, Mike and Cindy were outstanding in their communications from beginning of the reservation to our departure. They are great hosts and we would recommend them and the condo highly."
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful, clean condo steps from the beach. So easy to check in/out. Great communication with the owners! So easy to rent bikes, 2 pools with beach bar, beautiful beach!!"
2022-09-01,5,Stayed about a week,"The condo was everything my wife and I were looking for. It was very clean, and well stocked with all the creature comforts of home. You have a great view of the ocean right from your patio and you can listen to the waves crash into the beach as you are enjoying your morning coffee or afternoon libations.
The condo is stocked with all the necessary beach supplies (chairs, umbrella, cooler, and boogie boards). The condo has two pools. There is a small one the other side of the building, and then the main pool is near the front entrance. There is a fully stocked bar that also serves food next to the pool. They serve great drinks.
The pictures in the ad are spot on and exactly represents what the condo looks like. It was big enough for my wife and I, but it would be a little crowded with more than three persons. Communication with Mike was very easy and he always got back to us in a very short time. If you are looking for a relaxing, stress free vacation on the beach, look no further. I highly recommend booking with Cindy, Bob, and Mike. My wife and I will certainly return."
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Clean, modern with great beach accessibility. Well appointed and great beach supplies. Resort area offers pools, restaurants, bikes and courts which makes for an easy vacation. Restaurants and shopping near. Unit was also very quiet and has a private balcony where we saw beautiful sunrises and sunsets."
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great location right next to boardwalk to beach with great view and relaxing balcony to listen to the waves at night. Very clean and updated unit. Very responsive hosts. Would stay again.
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We could not have asked for a more relaxing and comfortable stay! The unit was very thoughtfully stocked with anything one would need for a beach stay. My coffee lover sister was thrilled with the several brewing options. Very clean and organized.
Definitely on our “comeback “ list."
2022-08-01,5,Stayed about a week,We LOVED our stay! A very nice place with an excellent location. No complaints! The check in and out was so easy.
2022-08-01,5,Stayed over a week,"Everything here is just as described in the listing. The horizon view of the ocean was nice while eating breakfast out on the balcony. The unit is literally a few steps away from the boardwalk that leads out onto the beach. Everything we needed was provided, especially in the kitchen, so while there are lots of nice restaurants, we were able to cook our own meals as well. One thing I really liked was the fact that the front windows are covered at this unit. Other units have a wide window in the middle of the front room and one of those vertical skinny windows next to the door. Unfortunately, the way these resort rooms are, the bedroom is that front room next to the door. I see other units in this resort complaining that there's way too much light due to the lighting, but not ours! We had a nice, pitch-black bedroom, and for that I was grateful.
The provided beach chairs, umbrella, umbrella anchors, etc allowed us to have a great time on the beach. They provided many amenities, so we had things like K-cup makers, toaster, many pots and pans, tupperware, tons of cooking utensils. Paper towels, toilet paper, basic toiletries, all provided. We stayed for two weeks so we went through the initial load and bought our own refills but if you're only staying the weekend it should be more than you need.
This made for a great honeymoon and we're grateful to our hosts for a good stay."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,We loved our stay here at this beautiful condo on Hilton Head Island! Definitely a memorable trip!
2022-07-01,5,Stayed about a week,"The place was perfect. View of the ocean from the room, short walk to the beach or pool, easy access to so many amenities on the island. It was exactly as advertised, spotlessly clean and well appointed (including the memory foam mattress). Will 1000% recommend it to anyone."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Cindy and Bob and Mikes place was perfect! Their instructions and communication were spot on. Everything was exactly how they said it would be. There were 4 beach chairs, 2 boogie boards, and a couple of umbrellas. We really didn’t even need to bring much so I definitely overpacked. The kitchen even had containers and sandwich bags and foil and some extra spices which was very helpful. There were 2 pools, one which was smaller but within walking distance and less crowded so it was perfect for us since I had an infant with me. The beach was right across and your on the bottom floor so it was very convenient. I will say the place was smaller than I expected but that may have been me overlooking the pictures and details. It was perfect for my family of 4 with a 6 year old and infant. We just brought an air mattress for the 6 year old and set it up in the bedroom so she wouldn’t have to sleep with us and we could stay up later in the living area. If you need anything or have questions, Cindy and Bob and Mike were very easy to get in touch with and were happy to help. Overall, we had a fantastic vacation and would definitely come back!!"

2022-03-01,5,Stayed over a week,"The perfect beach condo that offers beautiful updated decor with all the needed conveniences. Enjoy views of the ocean from the patio, located within a short walking distance to sandy beaches."
2022-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We have stayed in AirBnBs throughout Europe and North America for the past six years (precluding Covid), and by far, this AirBnB surpassed my expectations. I am always on guard to walk in and prepared to go shopping for this or that kitchen utensil... but not here! This comfortable, cozy, and extremely awesome ""home away from home"" had everything I needed for everything we wanted to do. All we had to do was relax, enjoy the beautiful, beachfront patio with its amazing sunrises, and listen to the ocean soothe us throughout the day. At night, we gravitated to the most comfortable king-size bed we have had the pleasure to meet! Five Stars and returning for another round, someday very soon!!"

We will definitely be back!"

This was just as nice as our accommodations last summer- clean, beautifully decorated, and well-stocked with anything you may need for an enjoyable vacation. I don’t have a single negative thing to say. Other Airbnb owners need to take note- THIS is how a unit should be. We will be back."

2021-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Are the pictures and description of this unit accurate? Yes, of course they are. But they cannot even begin to capture how FANTASTIC this rental is! From the proximity to the beach (oh my goodness, so close), to the view and sound of the waves from the balcony, to the comfort of the bed, the homey living area, the beach chairs being comfortable (and available for use!), the variety of coffee makers, and even small touches like an extra fan in the closet (great for sleeping!), to labeled kitchen cabinets, to bumpers to protect the walls from cabinets.... Cindy, Bob and Mike have literally thought of it all! If you have a small party or are planning a couple’s getaway, this is DEFINITELY your place!!!! We reeeealllly hope to stay here again! Thank you!!!"
2021-04-01,5,Stayed about a week,"This condo was just as the pictures showed on the listing, it is lovely and stylish! I loved all of the decor and it was very clean. At night, the building was very quiet and if you had the doorwall open, you could hear the ocean. My only suggestion is that you bring your TV app's login information (e.g. Netflix, Hulu, etc.) with you. The TV's are great, but it was tricky finding a way to view, without my logins, which were at home. The condo unit is small, but perfect for 2 people! My husband and I loved it for the week we were there."
2021-03-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Great rental! Beautiful view from a balcony that’s just a stones throw from the beach.
Place came stocked with lots of beach amenities that made our stay more comfortable and enjoyable. Highly recommend!"
2021-03-01,5,Stayed about a week,Place was great. So nice to be right one the water. Just as described.
2021-03-01,5,Stayed about a week,Great condo right on the beach! We enjoyed our morning coffee on the porch watching the sunrise every morning. It was beautifully decorated and the place has lots of amenities. We would definitely love to stay again because you can’t beat the location of being so close (basically on) the beach.
2021-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Location can’t be beat. Furniture was very comfortable. Kitchen well equipped. It was exactly as pictured and described in the listing. I would stay there again without hesitation.
2021-03-01,5,Stayed about a week,This stay truly exceeded our expectations. A huge part of this was the responsiveness of the hosts and the many thoughtful touches. Everything about this property was as represented or better and that’s just great. They really get it and earned the 5 star ratings. You won’t be disappointed.
2021-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This place is awesome! There is a tea kettle and labels. loved it.
2021-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"A great location for a couple. Walk the beach, enjoy an intimate updated indoor setting while exploring HHI."
2021-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,10/10 recommend! Perfect view and location. Could stay there forever! Couldn’t have asked for a better stay
2021-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,"You just cannot beat the sunrises and coffee on the deck. First trip with a 6month old, off season & mid pandemic was made great by the well appointed unit literally steps from the beach. The pictures do not do the unit justice. The kitchen had everything we needed to make every meal. The pack and play and high chair that were provided were prefect, we barely had to bring anything! We didn’t use the beach stuff but the unit again has everything you need. The hosts were quick with communication when we needed something and everything was superbly labeled."
2021-01-01,5,Stayed about a week,"We were more than happy with our stay at this beautiful condo! Every thing was spotless with all new appliances and two large flat screen TVs. The beachfront location is so peaceful and close enough to the ocean that you can actually hear the waves. The sunrises were fantastic and you can be on the beach in one minute. Can’t wait to go back.
Thanks Cindy & Bob & Mike!"
2021-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place and view of sunrise was spectacular. Beautiful new decor. Can see the dunes and ocean. Truly a two minute walk to the wide beach. Can easily walk or ride a bike on the beach. Perfect for two. If you need a little more history take a day trip to Beaufort or Bluffton.
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Staying at Karen’s place was wonderful. Her home is beautiful, well stocked with toiletries and everything you need for the beach. The walk to the beach is even closer than it looks! The bikes provided made it easy to bike everywhere. We biked to restaurants, Whole Foods, mini golf, and just around for exercise. Once inside there is a binder with recommendations and clear instructions. We had the pleasure of meeting Karen and she is very sweet and was always readily available when needed! Next time we are in HHI, we will be looking to book here again!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Karen’s place is wonderful! All of her instructions and guidance were clear and helpful, easy to follow. Check-in was easy and the space is clean and stock with everything you need for your time at the beach! The furniture is comfortable and the bed is very comfortable. Kitchen is well stocked. Access to the beach is just around the corner through a coded gate and this section of beach is much less crowded than the public beach areas on either side. The neighbors are very friendly! Easy access to local restaurants and stores. Will definitely stay with Karen again if we’re able to find dates available for booking!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We had a great stay at this airbnb! We had a wedding nearby at the Westin and port royal racquet club. This was a wonderful location and walkable to wedding events. The Airbnb was spotless and the host was very responsive. We really appreciated the complimentary coffee/tea and creamers! Would definitely stay again.
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a wonderful time at Karen’s place! The apartment was spacious, comfortable clean, and had everything we needed.

Sooo close to the beach..we went every day!! Would highly recommend staying here if you want a relaxing, convenient and cozy stay!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Karen was extremely hospital and the place was great. A perfect weekend for us. The place had everything you needed for a beach get away. It was private and also an easy walk to the beach. We most definitely enjoyed our stay and would book again!

2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We have stayed at Karen’s place multiple times now, and it has always been a phenomenal experience. The place itself is always very clean and homey, and it is in a prime location close to the beach as well as many shops and restaurants. Also, Karen is always incredibly responsive and helpful. We will continue staying with Karen for as long as we vacation in Hilton Head, and we recommend her AirBnB without reservation!"

Great location, just 2min walking to private beach (not busy, away from hotel crowd) & large restaurant options within 10min drive on island. Got all equipment for good biking,
Karen was a very supportive host with local recommendations, excellent communication.
Hope we can come again."

2024-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"Karen was an amazing host! Let us check in early and stay a little late, and even found a watch we left behind and will ship it to us!
She was so welcoming and had lots of recommendations! The Airbnb was adorable, probably one of the best places we have been to. We loved using the bikes to ride around the neighborhood and even out to the beach, and we were able to cook dinner and breakfast back at the house. We loved the space, so beautiful yet private, and would love to stay even longer next time!"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Karen's one-bedroom apartment, attached to her home, with a separate entrance, is wonderful. I especially liked walking around her neighborhood, in addition to the beach. Inside, she has paid very close attention to all of the details that provide useful information as well as peace of mind. If I were returning to Hilton Head, would want to come back to this listing."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Karens place was amazing...she paid so much attention to detail. She had everything well planned out. I was unable to communicate with her because i could not log into Airbnb from my phone...Sorry Karen. Thank you for everything. My sister lives in Hilton Head and if we need a place to stay again we will definitely book your place. Absolutely beautiful. We have an airbnb down in Sarasota so we would love to have you come down anytime.
Barb Torrance"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Had everything we needed for a weekend getaway. Clean, convenient location, and the perfect size for 2. Karen was very responsive. Highly recommend!"

2023-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"We loved Karen’s beautiful and cozy home for our night in Hilton Head. Very close to downtown for shops and restaurants, and a beautiful short walk to the beach. The house was very comfortable and stocked with anything you could need during your stay. Would loved to have stayed longer. Highly recommended!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Karen’s place was close to the beach but not in a touristy area. I kept pointing things out to my daughter that excited me and was unable to point out anything that I was disappointed with. I met Karen in the yard when she was doing yard work and she was extremely friendly and easy to talk to. Clean, well decorated, and comfortable. Couldn’t have asked for more."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I decided to go on my first (very needed) solo mini vacation. This place was so comfy, very clean, had extras, and was so nice.

2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We had a wonderful stay at Karen’s house. The place was impeccably maintained. We thoroughly enjoyed all of the amenities provided. The location is private and beautiful and so close to the private beach. Five star accommodations for sure. We can’t wait to return!
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"My husband and I wanted to visit Savannah for a quick weekend birthday getaway, and friends suggested staying in Beaufort, which isn't such a busy town. Found this place and went for it! It was SO relaxing! It was just the 2 of us, so plenty of space! Downtown Savannah and Hilton Head was beautiful, plenty of restaurants, stores, good fishing, wonderful wetlands area nearby we walked through, friendly area! Around an 45 minute' drive to Savannah, which was great! Then came back to this place at night and relaxed! Cupboards were plenty stocked and the home was extremely CLEAN! When communicating with Karen via Air BNB, we ""clicked"" instantly--even though it wasn't face to face! Was hoping we could meet her, but didn't work out :(. We WILL keep this place on our list to stay again, AND let others know about it as well! Book it--you WON'T be disappointed 10/10!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"Perhaps the nicest Airbnb at which I’ve stayed so far. Karen’s place is a jewel—lovely in every way that’s described in the listing, and more. Karen was super accommodating and responsive. I wouldn’t hesitate to recommend Karen’s place to anyone and would love to stay there again."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Another excellent stay at Karen’s! This place has everything we need to have a relaxing beach vacation. We enjoyed taking the backpack chairs and walking to the beach to see the sunrise each morning. Very comfortable and spotless accommodations.

2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Karen’s place is wonderful! The home is spotless and very homey. She was great at communication and prompt with all her responses. The neighborhood beach is easily accessible and just a short walk away. I would definitely recommend and stay here again in a heartbeat!
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"So happy with our stay in this AirBnb. Karen was wonderful and we truly felt at home the entire stay! We couldn’t believe how spotless the home was. Karen, thank you for providing and clean, convenient, and peaceful home away from home for Labor Day weekend."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We had a great time at Karen’s place. The private gate to the beach was convenient. Folly field beach was not crowded at the time so the vibe was very peaceful. The house was very clean and loaded with all necessary amenities :) highly recommended
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,Everything was great!
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful, clean space with easy access to a wonderful beach. Karen thought of everything and made us feel right at home. Great location! Hoping to return soon!"

2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"A wonderful little gem on Hilton head, perfectly secluded, yet only a short walk to the beach. Karen has taken great care to provide everything you might need in a comfortable atmosphere. She is very responsive and really cares about her guests! This is what airbnb was designed to be. Look no further!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Our vacation at Karen's property was Wonderful! Karen thought of every detail to make our stay fun, relaxing, and comfortable. It was like a home away from home! The apartment is tastefully decorated and the added amenties of bikes, beach chairs and umbellas was a really a blessing to us. We had a great time at the beach and biking through the quiet neighborhood. We liked that the property was private and well lighted when we came in from late dinners. We felt safe at this property. When there was an issue with the ROKU/TV, Karen responded prompty and resovled the problem. We had a chance to meet Karen and she is very plesant and down to earth. I understand why she is a SUPER HOST! We would definitely stay there again.
Regina and Donnie"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"There was nothing I needed to request from the host as everything I would need was available from shampoo to dryer sheets. I reported a minor issue and Karen was quick to address and rectify the issue. I could not have been a more relaxing get away. Beach within 2 blocks and everything I would need at the beach was available from beach towels to chairs to cooler. Great restaurants and shopping within a few miles. Amazingly, luxurious and comfortable linens. Will definitely stay again when in the area."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The apartment was great! Short walk to the beach! Easy check in, and the accommodations were everything we needed for our vacation!"

2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,Everything was perfect. Would definitely stay again.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Karen is a super host for a reason - the absolute best stay we’ve had at an AirBnb. The walk to the beach is an easy 5 min walk to an area that isn’t as crowded as other parts of the beach and the house is located in an area that feels secluded from the rest of the island. The unit was spotless from top to bottom and Karen provided many recommendations on the island from food to activities. I could go on and on, but I’ll leave it at that and say if she has vacancy for the dates you’re looking at a stay on HHI, book it with Karen, you won’t regret it!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We loved this stay! My wife and I drove in from IL and felt right at home. Beautiful location and wonderful amenities we will be sure to return again soon!
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had the best time at Karen’s place. Communication is clear and responsive. When you check in there is a notebook with answers to every question you may have, but she is still available if anything is needed.
She has thought of every detail—toiletries, a couple of bottled waters, cream and sugar for coffee, coffee pods. It is nicer than the pictures show. The linens and furnishings are high quality and CLEAN. The apartment is in a very safe area with a short walk to the beach. The beach chairs and bikes that were provided made this a perfect stay. We will definitely book here again!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Wonderful stay. The house was beautiful and spotless. The location was great - loved how 2 bikes were available to use at our leisure, as the island is very easy to get around on bike. Thanks for a great stay!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,This was a perfect place for a couple to unwind and enjoy a beach walk after a great meal. I would definitely book again.
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"There is a reason why I am a “repeat” to Karen and Fred’s fabulous place! Not only is it an absolutely fantastic location (5 minute walk to the beach), it is beautifully appointed and the entire living area is pristine! Karen is always available when/if you need anything. Look no further for the best stay on HHI!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"The space had everything you could need. It was the best blend of hotel and home I've experienced. All the amenities you expect in a hotel (folding luggage rack) plus all the creature comforts and specific items you would find in someones home(cotton swabs, cooler backpack etc..) In addition everything was very clean and top quality. The location was a very short walk from beach access."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"What a fantastic place in a gorgeous location. 5 min walk to the stunning beach, in a peaceful neighbourhood.
The accommodation was immaculate and Karen's communication was spot on. She's a great host and should be proud of her awesome home.
My only regret is we didn't stay longer.
I would definitely love to return."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,Karen's place was great. Exactly as listed. We unfortunately only had a short stay but the place would have been great for a longer stay. Seemed very well stocked and literally spotless. Short walk to beach. Quiet neighborhood.

2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The apartment exceeded our expectations. It was on a very quiet street, just minutes from the beautiful serene beach. The linens and towels provided were luxurious. Lots of extras were found, showing such thoughtfulness in making this place feel like home. Hilton head island itself is so full of trees, shrubs, and flowers that you immediately feel at peace. We’d love to return again soon."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We totally loved our stay at Karen's. The unit is super clean, spacious, quiet, and very well-appointed. We really appreciated all the extra amenities that are provided - in particular, the large variety of hygiene supplies, the beach gear and the bicycles. The bike trail is easily accessible, running right through the neighborhood, which we really enjoyed. Karen was great with communication - before, during and after our stay. Check-in was also very easy and flexible, which worked well for us since we had a late arrival and did not need to rush or worry. We have stayed in quite a number of Airbnb rentals and this ranks up there as one of our best!"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My wife and I have stayed at Karen's place several times, and it's always been a phenomenal experience. We've vacationed at a couple of other places over the past few years, but none of those places have truly met our standards. We always find our way back to Karen's place, and we hope to continue vacationing at her place in the future!"

2022-06-01,5,Stayed one night,As a seasoned Airbnber I feel qualified to say Karen’s Airbnb is a gem. The location is absolutely wonderful being a short stroll to the beach. The leafy natural neighborhood is beautiful! My BFF and I had a magical stay on HHI !
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was the perfect place for my wife & me on our first trip to HHI. We loved having the private neighborhood entrance to the beach - It always seemed less crowded in that area than down near the resorts. The location was convenient for us to drive to explore different parts of the island. The apartment is extremely comfortable & Karen has thought of everything you could need. We used several of the beach accessories she had available, including the beach chairs & umbrellas. It was really nice having a full kitchen & a washer & dryer available. Highly recommend for a quiet, comfortable stay."
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We had a wonderful experience visiting here. Everything was extremely clean and organized. Perfect location that was close to the beach but very peaceful and quiet. Definitely recommend!

2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is the kind of AirBnB that you want to come back to. So perfectly located 1 min walk from a quiet beach. The apartment was clean, with thoughtful touches and information from our gracious hosts, who clearly go above and beyond a regular AirBnB. We rode the bikes all around, used the beach gear, walked via beach to the nearby resort for lunch/coffee. It was a 5 min drive to great restaurants, grocery, coffee, even mini golf. We had the best time!"
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The apartment is the best and Karen is a dream to communicate with! I would give six stars if I could.

2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We decided last minute to come spend a few days on Hilton Head Island and am glad we stayed here! The apartment was clean and had everything we needed from kitchen items to beach items. The walk to the residential beach was nice and close but was a little challenging while carrying everything. I would recommend bringing a little wagon or dolly if you have one to make that walk easier. The beach itself was lovely and not crowded at all. I wish we had stayed longer and will definitely consider staying again on our next trip to Hilton Head!
2021-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"If you have the opportunity to choose this location you'll be raving about the luxury! Every detail of the stay is as advertised and more.

2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Amazing place for one or two people! Everything listed was accurate and comfortable! Really well stock of everything you need and more on a coastal break. Karen even had things that I forgot to bring myself. I also love the bikes, especially for those that may not want to walk the 5 minutes to the beach on a quiet safe neighborhood. Road the bike two miles up the beach to the rocks, and they were great photo opportunity, as well, as fishing for those that desire. During the summer there will be mosquitos, so be prepared. :) Hilton Head Island is a beautiful island, but more amazing that Karen's place was perfect for it. It was away from the crowds but not far from the beach at all. Will definitely stay here again!"

I wanted a place that was very clean, short walking distance to the beach, close to everything, and with a full kitchen to cook some meals - This hit all of those points! You’re a 7min walk to private beach access (much less crowded than the public beach areas). She has thought of everything that you will need for the beach (chairs, umbrella, towels, coolers, tote bag) so all you need to bring is sunscreen and some drinks. We were very comfortable there all week and felt right at home."

This place exceeded all of our expectations and Greg was an awesome host. We plan to be back in the summer!
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We stayed for two nights to attend a wedding. Greg’s place was perfect for our trip. Was very clean and had a spectacular view of the Harbour Town lighthouse. The location is perfect and walkable to restaurants and shops nearby in the village. The interior is well appointed with everything you may need and was comfortable for my wife and me. I played Harbour Town golf links during our stay and it was around 100 yards from the front door! Greg was extremely responsive and it was apparent he wanted us to be as comfortable as possible even asking after our first night if we needed anything. Would stay again!
Thanks to them!!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Greg’s place was beautiful—sparkling clean with charming views of Harbour Town and the lighthouse.

2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Excellent location overlooking yatch basin and lighthouse in Harbor Town. Extremely clean and laid out unit with nice amenities.
Wonderful hosts that communicate timely and answer any questions you may have. You’re making a mistake is your don’t choose this unit with all it offers!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The area and view can’t be beat. Lovely small unit.
Their is a pod coffee maker which wasn’t as listed, so we had to go outside the gates to get coffee pods. I left the extra pods there for next guest. Probably should have a few there until guests have a chance to go to store.
Recommend if you need smaller space, studio efficiency or lock out.
Many Thanks"

2023-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,This condo is a piece of Harbor Town paradise! Absolutely stunning views and a wonderful place to stay - even better in person! We traveled with our 4 month old baby and there was plenty of room for a pack and play. We loved popping out of the condo right into the harbor to enjoy live music and food. Greg was extremely personable and thoughtful in all of his communication! We hope to stay here again soon!!!
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Had the opportunity to meet Greg as he was on location when we arrived a bit early. He is a great guy and everything was perfect. Highly recommend. The location is incredible.

Restaurants nearby were great! Greg was very responsive to messages and everything was exactly as pictured and described. We would definitely stay here again!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We went for our honeymoon! This condo has the best view in Hilton head. Greg was an amazing host. Somehow the pictures don’t even do the view justice. We WILL be renting from Greg again in the future.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We had a great weekend celebrating my husband's birthday! it was a perfect getaway by boat for us.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This property location is idyllic. Greg’s communication was right on point. The condo is well laid out to maximize the space. Amazing views and everything you need in walking distance. I highly recommend this property and will definitely return again.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Greg's condo was perfect for us to meet our daughter's soon to be in laws who had their boat at the Marina. We could wave to her from the little balcony!. Everything was as described and super for us. I'd highly recommend staying here.

2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Everything as advertised. Views were great, location is great, communication was spot on.
Highly recommend"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My wife and I hadn't been to Hilton Head, specifically Harbour Town, more specifically Cutter Ct, since 1987 so the opportunity to relive some wonderful long-ago memories proved priceless. The location is convenient and the view speaks for itself. You're in Harbour Town 24x7 when you stay here... not just visiting Harbour Town. Perfect for 2 people, the villa takes advantage of it's orientation with terrific sunset views that not only look gorgeous over the Calibogue Sound, but brighten up the inside."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had an incredible time at Greg’s beautiful getaway - everything is walkable or bike-able which made for absolute convenience and ease the whole stay. Plenty of shops, restaurants (some that even accommodated my shellfish & fish allergy), live music and of course, the views…we can’t say enough about the view. My husband and I would happily come back to this little gem!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful location! Made it easy to enjoy the best parts of Hilton Head!
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Thank you, Greg, appreciate all your help. Will definitely be back again to the same condo."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was an excellent place to stay/live, it was just like being at home. The view of the harbor town lighthouse was beautiful in the morning and in the evening. This will be the first place I will look for on my next trip to Harbour Town, when it’s a trip for two. Greg gave detailed instructions to the location, gaining access inside, and the location of everything I needed within the unit. While out of Greg’s control, I was unable this trip to purchase a week parking pass and I had to pay for a daily parking pass each day, with cash. This is a prime location for a couple or a family with two children."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This condo was perfect! Right in the heart of Harbor Towne with beautiful views of the marina and sunsets! It was so fun to walk down to the pier and watch the dolphins in the morning and everything was within walking distance! Loved sitting out in the balcony and enjoying the view. The balcony was very tiny but still amazing! Would love to come back again!
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Greg exceeded all my expectations! 5-star service from the beginning until the end. I highly suggest this amazing place. I am looking forward to my next stay.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful condo - amazing views!

2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Perfect for a romantic getaway weekend. Location was perfect.
2023-05-01,5,Stayed about a week,Greg was a fantastic host. Responded quickly to our questions. Installed a handicapped shower head and seat for my wife without us asking. Beautiful view.
2023-05-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"This location could not be more perfect. Greg was super responsive and super accommodating, even allowing a late checkout. I’d note that we were able to access the beach club by car as long as you are dining at Coast. We did not need to use the trolley system which seemed like a hassle. I imagine you need to use that or bike when it gets busier later in the summer. Bikes rent for about $30+ per day and it felt too long to bike down there.
The balcony is great for a view but I could not stick the table up while also sitting comfortably. It is a very tight space in the balcony. My other issue of note would just be that the ice machine never froze any ice.
Greg provided toiletries and helpful instructions."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Honestly the best host I have rented from. Place was amazing , perfect location. Will be staying again"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We really enjoyed staying in this condo. It is a perfect size for two people. The view of the harbor and lighthouse from the balcony sliding door is awesome. The location is also very convenient for walking to anything in harbor town. We would definitely stay here again.
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Greg is a fantastic guy and the condo was absolutely wonderful! My wife and I hope to make this a stop on our calender more often!
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We couldn’t have asked for a better place to stay. Great restaurants, shopping, and golf within walking distance. We parked and didn’t use the car again until it was time to leave. Greg was great to work with. Super responsive and accommodating!"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We treasure our memories here! You will too.
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We loved our stay here. Our host was very responsive and friendly. The view from the balcony is so beautiful at the marina and I love how they made the most of the space with the chairs and balcony table. We made breakfast in the suite daily and it was very easy. The bed is very comfortable. Harbour town was our favorite with live music almost nightly and Greg’s place is perfect for two!
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Greg was an excellent host. The unit was clean and the housekeeping team followed up to make sure we had everything we needed. Absolutely great location in Harbour Town with sunsets directly over the famous lighthouse and lot's of walkable shops and restaurants for all ages. Our dolphin tour launched right out of the harbour too. The famous Harbour Town Golf Course is directly across the street. Plenty to do...golf, tennis, pool, etc. My family had a great time. Thanks Greg!"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,My wife and I had a great stay. Looking out at the iconic lighthouse is a great perk. Hope to come back soon!!

2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a wonderful stay in a perfect condo. It was clean, modern and very comfortable. The view was amazing and there were many restaurant options all within walking distance. Shopping was readily available in the area. The location had nearby walking paths and plenty to do just a short distance away. The condo had all amenities needed to eat in or out. The owners were extremely proactive with check in and recommendations. The process was very easy. Check out was easy. We would definitely return if we visit Hilton Head again.
Thank you Greg!"

2024-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,Suzanne was wonderful. Beautiful location. Our family had a lovely time!
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This condo was just like the pictures and everything felt new and fresh. Suzanne sent an email a few days before check-in with instructions and a link to a Digital Guidebook which gave lots of information about their place and, also, the island. The Guidebook even gave detailed instructions with pictures about how to operate eachTV in the condo. This was a big help. My 90 plus year old Mother loved sitting on the balcony watching activity at the pool and ocean views. We would definitely stay here again."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Wonderful place in great location to beach, pool, grocery stores, and restaurants."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,We had an absolute blast. This is a fantastic spot right by the pool and in the heart of Hilton Head with an easy drive everywhere. Suzanne was a great host and was very responsive. Highly recommend!
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"What an absolute treat it was to stay here. The views were spectacular, the (newly renovated) pool was fantastic, and the wider community was a joy to explore. We could not have been more pleased with the rental.
We have four kids from teens down to age 7 and there was so much to enjoy. It was incredibly family friendly- the kids loved playing/walking on the beach, swimming endlessly in the pool, riding bikes for miles and miles, and walking up to the general store. It was safe and easy for the kids to go off on their own to get to the store for snacks/meals.
We would love to have the chance to return. The rental made for such an easy and relaxing vacation. Would recommend to any other family looking for a fun time on Hilton Head."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed about a week,Suzanne and Rhett have an absolutely beautiful location that is beautifully decorated and made us feel welcome from the moment we walked in they were a very accommodating with us being allowed to check in a day early which extended our vacation and we were very grateful for that we had an amazing time in this beautiful location they did a great job of decorating and providing us with everything we needed for an amazing week
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"LOCATION, LOCATION, LOCATION! A very short walk to the beautiful beach. Although the new pool was not open at the time of our visit, it will be so nice to have this huge, family-friendly pool right outside your unit.
We thoroughly enjoyed our stay and look forward to returning to Hilton Head soon!"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We had a great stay!
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Suzanne's place was perfectly located steps away from the beach. It had everything we needed and the beds were very comfortable. They were also very responsive when we needed anything, they also very flexible and allowed late checkout when we needed to store luggage for a few hours. Only complaint we had was the pool was getting reonavated so we were woken up every morning to the sound of saws and construction but that was out of their control. I am sure when the pool is done it will be great."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,Lovely place! Great condo in an excellent location. Parking sucks but that’s the only downfall. Can’t imagine the parking in the prime season. We will definitely be back. Loved it.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,First trip to Hilton Head! Suzanne’s place was in perfect location and had plenty of space.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Stayed here for a family beach vacation and the place was great. The property is located right on the beach and has a nice outdoor pool. The best amenity though turned out to be the clubhouse, which has a gym and an indoor pool with hot tub and sauna. We had a couple of days of chilly beach weather and the indoor pool saved the day.
The unit itself was nice. Both bedrooms have clear views of the pool and beach. Both bedrooms also have outdoor balconies. They are perfectly positioned to see the sun rise. All appliances and televisions in working order.
Would highly recommend staying here."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,We had a wonderful stay and look forward to returning in the future.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Suzanne’s condo was an AMAZING stay for my family. First off, the condo’s location is prime beach front access. We loved being on the first floor, with an easy elevator ride or a quick flight of stairs to access it. We had wonderful ocean and pool views. We were always able to find parking directly underneath our unit which was easy access for us. The condo’s layout was perfect for two couples and an infant. We were on separate ends which allowed for privacy but then when we wanted to meet in the living room, was so cozy. The kitchen and living room was the perfect space for all of us to hang out. The condo was extremely clean, comfy beds, and exactly as photos show. The location of the condo is also a great location to visit north or south of the island. I highly recommend Suzanne’s condo if you are looking for a visit to Hilton Head Island! She was fast to respond, provided so much information for our stay, and accommodated us so well. Thank you again! We will be back!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was our first trip to Hilton Head and we absolutely loved it! Beautiful resort and condo! We booked Suzanne’s Airbnb because of the great views overlooking the pool and ocean. It did not disappoint! We enjoyed the sunrises & sunsets right from the balcony or with a short walk to the beach! The condo was clean and nicely updated. Great location! We were able to visit Old Town Bluffton, Daufuskie Island and Savannah during our stay. Tons of restaurants in the area and plenty to do! Suzanne was very responsive from start to finish! The “Guidebook” link was a big help….very professional! We will definitely be back!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a wonderful stay at the Villamare! Suzanne’s unit was perfect. It was bright and beautiful ocean views. The furnishings were all updated and the place was spotless. All of the tvs and AC worked perfectly - no issues at all. I also loved having three balconies - plenty of space for everyone to spread out and enjoy the wonderful views. Being on the first floor was great with small kids so they could be easily seen in the pool at all times. Suzanne was a great host - super responsive and everything was just as advertised. Location was perfect - right near Alexander’s, the general store and the Outfitters…. Not to mention ocean front! Thanks Suzanne!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Fantastic location and stay, Suzanne’s place is a true diamond!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We really enjoyed our stay at this condo! It was very clean with new bedding, pillows, and furniture. The balcony overlooks the pool so it was nice having a close view of the pool, especially with kids. The owners provided great recommendations and instructions during our stay. The condo is very convenient to nearby restaurants, grocery stores and shopping. I would highly recommend this condo for families with children."
