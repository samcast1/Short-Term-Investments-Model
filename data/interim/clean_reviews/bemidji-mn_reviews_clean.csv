So many windows and land and geese and thoughtfully appointed. If you like baths, the tub was perfection. Matt and Heather were quick to reply when we had a question. We had a tough weekend tending to some family matters, which made coming “home” to this little peace of heaven even sweeter. Heather told us there were toys in the ottoman which was a wonderful find for my 2 year old granddaughter. She was also kept busy climbing up and down the bunk beds. She and I curled up for naps and bedtime in the bottom bunk. Thank you for providing such a warm and convenient place for us."

Carla was an amazing host - she was proactive with communication/instructions and incredibly kind and welcoming. The breakfast basket was such a wonderful extra touch, especially if you enjoy starting your days early with a busy schedule to take advantage of the area!
The location was perfect - quiet, serene, and absolutely beautiful - all while being just a short drive to Bemidji and lots of other places to explore in the area!
The suite itself was cozy, cute, and perfectly clean. The outside area and extra amenities were fantastic. We used the hot tub every night (cleanest hot tub ever!) and spent lots of time on the dock/lake.
We really felt at home here and were sad we didn’t book a longer stay - we will absolutely be coming back! Thank you for everything Carla!"

2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Carla's place is Quiet and very scenic! the wildlife around the home was everywhere. we saw everything from Deer and turkeys to Flying Squirrels while we sat in her beautiful hot tub!

2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We have stayed several nights at Carla's place, and will absolutely do so again, as this is easily my favorite Airbnb venue. It is cozy, quiet, secluded and private, but most of all, Carla's place is the most beautiful Northwoods setting you can imagine. It is nestled in a grove of huge Norway Pine overlooking a beautiful lake, and if that were not enough, the deer that greeted us each night as well as the endless variety of birds to watch at the feeders while we were sitting in the luxurious hot tub make this a destination site if you are headed for the area."
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Place was awesome, very clean and neat, had everything we needed. Would go back tomorrow no questions asked"

2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Highly recommend. This was my second stay at this property, and I know I'll be back. It's extremely comfortable, quiet, and relaxing. The host is incredibly thoughtful, which you'll find evidenced in the details of how the apartment is outfitted and how easy it is to interact with her. I sometimes feel like AirBnB offerings overpromise and underdeliver. Carla's place is EXACTLY the opposite, more than you'd expect."

2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This place is amazing. If you are looking for piece and quiet with a lake property twist this place is for you. Great little retreat. Both units are very unique and cozy. It is definitely a very chill atmosphere.

2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Relaxing, private, and close to many amenities in Bemidji. We used the hot tub multiple times and would recommend bringing flip flops. Would return in winter and would like to try a summer or fall visit!"
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Everything was great, just as advertised."
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Carla was wonderful. Very welcoming and hospitable. She had a really awesome breakfast basket of goodies for us. There were spa slippers for us to use and chocolates on the nightstand in the bedroom. It's little things like this that make all the difference. The hot tub was awesome. The whole place was spotless. Carla was there whenever we needed something or had a question. The view is breathtaking. Enjoyed watching the squirrels and a small deer even came up to eat the food that fell from the bird feeder. 5 star for sure.
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Wonderful place to stay. My boyfriend and I went away to recharge and this was just the place. Romantic and peaceful. Hot tub was an amazing amenity in the winter weather. Definitely would go there again. Host was very nice and gave good directions to get to her place (google maps is very in accurate)
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place is just as described— A little bit of heaven. My husband and I came for a quick getaway and mini-moon. The hot tub and lake was exactly what we were looking for. The unit itself was super cozy, great layout, and had thoughtful amenities. The breakfast basket of goodies was especially nice.
The hot tub was perfectly clean and comfortable with plenty of towels. The bed was really comfortable, there were plenty of blankets and pillows, we slept so well! The living room was cozy with seating for probably 3 people and an electric fireplace that we used tor mostly ambiance but some heat after hot tub. The unit had a small kitchen/dining area and a really large bathroom. There were a couple games provided, we enjoyed the deck of cards and did not utilize the smart TV.
We saw some wildlife (deer, turkey) and Carla’s orange tabby cat Gizmo came to say hi each night while we were in the hot tub. He loved getting some pets. So cute.
Some notes if you come in the winter. The heat makes some odd noises from the kitchen area but nothing too distracting. And the temperature (set to 70) is not adjustable but the unit has windows that easy open.
Overall we loved our stay and Carla was a gracious and friendly hostess. I hope we can come back again sometime."
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Amazing! Carla was super nice once we arrived. Prior to our weekend she contacted me, gave easy directions and responded quickly. It was smaller than we thought but still perfect. The hot tub on a chilly night was great! The view is amazing, with a large window in the front it’s easy to relax inside and watch the lake."
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place is breathtakingly beautiful. I was able to stay in the cabin with a friend over the summer and booked the hot tub for a romantic weekend in the snow. This did not disappoint. Carla is available if needed for anything and the snacks are off the hook. The place is clean, comfortable and cozy. I would highly recommend you give it a try."
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This spot is great in every way. Carla was a great host; communicative, generous, available, and knowledgable. The location is great with lots of options for hiking and trails in under an hour's drive- also very close (about 10-15 minutes drive) to shops and restaurants in Bemidji! Although, you really can spend most of your time here with all the amenities offered. My husband and I enjoyed birdwatching on the deck while drinking our morning coffee and our evenings drinking wine and stargazing from the hot tub. 10/10 would recommend as a perfect couples getaway."
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place is very quiet and cozy and superbly decorated and spotless. Beautiful location and scenery. Many activities are offered for outside the cabin and inside.

2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Carla is a great host. The cabin is immaculate inside and out. Easy access. Hot tub right outside the door amidst the pines was wonderful! The big deck in the front is a perfect spot for morning yoga, to sit in the sun, play games, and watch sunsets. The pictures don’t do this hideaway justice. It’s nicer than what you see online. We recommend this little bit of heaven to others and we hope to come back again."
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Exactly as described! Peaceful, clean, all the amenities listed. Hot tub was our highlight! Although the dock & lake were a very close second! Fun pan fishing, catch and release (brought our own gear). Carla was a kind and friendly host but also left us alone to do our thing. She has fur babies we loved interacting with but if that's not your thing you can leave them be, too. Great stay. Recommend. Note the double bed might be small for larger people."

She was very kind and made us feel welcome and comfortable! I would definitely recommend this place and would stay here again!"
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Enjoy the hot tub it’s worth every minute of your evening. Carla was great and very helpful for food suggestions. The lake was so quiet and serene. We did see some pretty big fish right off the dock. Definitely would recommend this property!!
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Thank you for a wonderful week long vacation! The cabin was quite comfortable. The location was absolutely beautiful.

2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,By far one of the most scenic and private locations in pure secluded lake and forest setting. We definitely will be staying every time we visit the Bemidji area!
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,My friend & I spent a great weekend staying here with beautiful views and lots to do without ever leaving the property.

2021-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had an absolutely fantastic weekend! Carla is a great host! The perfect balance of friendly and accommodating to make it a special experience, but let us have our privacy and space to ourselves. Strongly recommend staying here!"
2021-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Such a cute, quiet, and north woods oasis. Perfect for a romantic getaway, or just to unplug for a day or two. Hot tub was the best part! Everything was very clean, and host was gracious with a breakfast basket and quick communication. Definitely would stay here again!"
2021-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,a beautiful view and peaceful getaway from the cities! close to Bemidji but far enough out for lowkey recharge vacation time!
2021-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Our weekend at Carla's was absolutely amazing. It was exactly what we needed. Very private. Secluded up in the big pines.
2020-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Phenomenal stay! Wonderful private getaway with my wife. Spectacular views of the lake. Made a little skating rink on the frozen lake. Relaxing and high quality hot tub. Very comfortable bed and excellent customer care by Carla. The place is incredible! I cannot recommend it enough!
2020-12-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"A cozy little nook amongst the pine trees. Our first night we got lost after driving through a post blizzard snowy day, Carla helped us navigate to her little hide-a-way in the woods. She was really patient and even stayed on the phone with me to make sure I got to her. After we arrived the hot tub was all set and we enjoyed a soak under the stars. Carla gave us lots of privacy and I felt like we basically had the place to ourselves, yet she was quick to communicate with any questions I had. The place itself is nicely located for some up north adventures, close to Bemidji and Lake Itasca. The kitchen was just enough to do some quick meals and Carla was sweet enough to leave a giant basket of goodies for us in the morning. I wish I had one more day."
2020-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Wonderful stay in the Bemidji area! Beautiful scenery and serene atmosphere
2020-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great place- hope tp be going back!
2020-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My husband and I stayed at Carla’s amazing little slice of heaven and thoroughly enjoyed our visit. Everything was perfect—from the peaceful lake view flanked by gorgeous redwoods to the spacious, luxurious, squeaky clean hot tub to the friendly and handsome kitties who also seemed to enjoy our company as much as we did theirs (outside, not in the unit). Carla was lovely and helpful, providing restaurant recommendations and suggesting we enjoy the beautiful fall weather with a trip to nearby Itasca State Park, home to the headwaters of the Mississippi River. We literally just left and can’t wait to return."
2020-10-01,2.0,Stayed a few nights,"I believed I’d be staying in a house by myself, not a small area off the main house that the host lives in. Photos made it look like it was the house and porch area that would be available, but that wasn’t the case. Tiny tv that didn’t work unless it was tinkered with. Kitchen with tiny fridge that wasn’t on when we got there. No oven. A tiny table to eat at. Twin size bed, very uncomfortable for myself and my girlfriend to sleep on. The only good thing about the place was the view of the lake, and the hot tub, although the hot tub was overlooked by what appeared to be the hosts living room(?) so that was awkward.
Way overpriced for what was really only the hot tub that we enjoyed. We left after less than 24 hours of being there cuz there was nothing to do except drink and use the hot tub. We had the place for 2 nights."
2020-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Carla's home is tucked away on a beautiful lake. It is close to several beautiful parks and the hot tub was a wonderful addition! We would definitely stay here again!
2020-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My partner and I were looking for a spot for a little weekend get away and Carla’s place was absolutely perfect. Wonderful view of the lake and such a peaceful setting. We loved the hot tub, fire pit and canoe which were all included with our stay. One of our favorite things was hearing the wind blow through the tall tree tops. It was also nice to have access to a grill and charcoal. Carla had everything we could possibly need available to us and it was so sweet that she had a welcome basket with snacks waiting for us on our arrival. Carla was very friendly and greeted us when we got there as well as showed us around the property. The bed was comfortable and the space was great for two people. Perfect place for a relaxing weekend in the woods!"
2020-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Carla was a great host. The place was very clean, the hot tub was relaxing. The lake was beautiful to canoe on, but we forgot our fishing rods, don't make the same mistake 🙂."
2020-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Sparkling lake views...sparkling clean...loved the hot tub right outside our door!! Carla was great in sharing a bit of history with us and recommended Itasca State part...which was full of fall foliage beauty...!! We had everything we needed to enjoy a relaxing quiet getaway....
2020-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Carla was a wonderful host and the space was gorgeous! The ability to use the hot tub and the lake view made this a great place to relax.
2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,It was beautiful. Great space for a weekend away! Close to a few local attractions but a great place to just stay and enjoy the scenery and natural beauty. We loved it. Definitely would recommend this location!
2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We can't say enough great things about Carla's place. It was a perfect little hideaway for us and we really enjoyed our time. The lakeview is beautiful and we had full access to the deck overlooking the water. We also enjoyed taking a canoe out on the lake and stargazing from the dock at night. The hot tub was very nice and so clean with so many jets- we really enjoyed relaxing in this. Carla was so thoughtful with providing a breakfast basket and a bottle of wine when we arrived. She knew we were celebrating our anniversary, and we were pleasantly surprised. We can't think of anything we would have changed about our stay and definitely recommend to a couple looking for a sweet and clean place to stay."
2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"A perfect private getaway. Carla was very responsive to our requests. The variety of breakfast foods was wonderful. The facilities offered were awesome, from the private hot tub to dock. We had a wonderful time."
2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was a beautiful place to stay! The lake view, trees, flowers, and hummingbirds were lovely and relaxing. We really enjoyed the hot tub with the beautiful view! This was probably the best part. Carla is friendly, helpful, and welcoming, and she has a beautiful lake retreat!"
2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Carla's place is a wonderful getaway! We loved how private it feels, and still she's right there and responsive if you need anything. We will definitely be back to take in the peaceful lake property and unwind again. Whether it's a swim in the lake or a dip in the hot tub, don't forget your swimwear!"
2020-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Carla‘s place was just beautiful with the pines and the lake. We saw Loons and Eagles! Hummingbirds were everywhere. A little bit of heaven, indeed! When we arrived, we were given scones, a food basket, and a surprise bottle of wine for our 40th anniversary! Carla‘s place was just perfect for a couple, and we had a very restful and relaxing stay."
2020-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"A Little Bit of Heaven was was a charming suite in the woods overlooking Grant Lake. Carla was a gracious hostess and made sure we had everything we needed including a welcome breakfast/snack basket, linens, kitchenette, microwave, TV, etc. The suite was very clean and well-kept. A hot tub, canoe fire pit and charcoal grill were also available for use. We enjoyed a relaxing stay at the suite and would recommend it."
2020-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"True to the listing, Carla’s Airbnb was truly a slice of heaven! The suite provided more than enough room for my partner and I and amenities aplenty. Highlights included a thoughtful welcome basket (with snacks and coffee), a microwave, a mini fridge, a small range with ample cookware and utensils, a huge bathroom, a canoe, and exclusive access to a hot tub overlooking Grant Lake. The nearby park includes a small sandy beach and is an easy canoe, drive, or walk from Carla’s property. Carla was very communicative and accommodating to all our needs. We definitely plan on returning here again someday! Thank you, Carla, for being such a wonderful host!"
2020-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,What a lovely little oasis!!
2020-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Carla, goes above and beyond to provide the best possible experience. It was a little bit pricey, but absolutely worth it. If you plan to come make sure to stay for a couple of days to take advantage of the experience. A little bit of heaven is an accurate name!"
2020-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Carla was a phenomenal host and very accommodating during our stay. Her property offers great amenities for creating great vacation memories like a private dock, cute deck, hot tub and canoe. It’s so close to the beach, bar and liquor store so you don’t have to travel far to have fun. The room was cozy and decorated beautifully with a very spacious bathroom. Overall we had a great time and will remember it the next time we come to the bemidji area."

2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"great place! clean, peaceful and relaxing. I would love to stay here during the summer and fall!"
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We are coming back in February for 5 days. This option is much better than a hotel as you have a full kitchen, washer and dryer and separate rooms. The only thing I would say is that the bathrooms had a few dead bugs in them. Other than that, everything was clean. The owners got back to us in a timely manner. I would like more direction on check out requirements. There was not much flexibility on check out, but we made it work. The master bedroom was very warm all of the time and we couldn’t figure out why. All-in-all, this is a great option for a place to stay in the winter. 15 minutes to town and cozy!"
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We were very happy with our stay here. We came in for a wrestling tournament, and with a large family, hotels are a pain. Breezy Hills was running an excellent rate for the winter and we jumped on the opportunity. The condo was just like advertised. Our stay was very cozy and we had no issues finding the place or checking in and out. Everything we could have needed was right there waiting. Our family took the hosts advice on places to eat and were not disappointed with any of their recommendations. We would definitely come back to stay here again."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We had a last minute change in plans and they accommodated us right away. It was a clean, beautiful place - we will be back, especially during boat season. The place is right on the lake!"

2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Awesome
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Clean and cozy in a great location! It was wonderful to be right on the water. In the summer time it would be perfect, especially with the deck and BBQ. The place was very clean and tidy, with a comfortable bed and linens."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Breezy Hill was a very comfortable place to stay. Being right on Lake Bemidji was wonderful. Lake life is great!!
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great place! Looks just like the pictures and was clean and comfortable. The views were amazing. Easy location near lots of things to do in Bemidji. The hosts had a book of recommendations on things to do, which was also helpful. Hope to stay here again!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We had a great stay during our time at Breezy Hills. The location was great and accessing the trail was just a walk down the driveway! We saw so much wildlife on the water and on the trail and it felt so tucked away even though you are only a few minutes from town. Everything was very clean and was well kept and cozy.
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The place was exactly what the photos showed, nice rooms and beds, great kitchen, great view of the lake and nice and private."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is a very quiet and beautiful location, sunset views are amazing. Private deck with gas grill where you can enjoy the view. Very comfortable beds and well-stocked kitchen. The e-bikes were so much fun, too!"

2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"Quick to respond, always friendly and easy to communicate with, and good attention to extras all show the Breezy Hills hosts really care that guests enjoy their stay. We’ve stayed here once before and would happily return!"

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place right on the lake and right by the Paul Bunyan bike trail. Easy parking and a garage for our bikes.
2023-07-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Surfaces seemed clean, but not detailed clean. Cobwebs hanging from ceiling. Dust along ledges, woodwork, corners, etc.
Was expecting the kitchen to be more stocked with coffee and spices. There were 3 Kerig pods of regular coffee and 15 decaf pods for 4 adults for a 4 night stay. It isn’t a big deal to bring your own coffee, but the add said fully stocked with coffee and tea, so that was expected. Sugar was stocked, but no creamer. Fully stocked spices ended up being salt, pepper, and oregano.
I would stay again, I was just expecting a bit more with the details provided. Size, location, amenities were all lovely."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We enjoyed the beautiful view of the sunset on the lake with the convenience of walking to the pier and from our view indoors with ample windows and sunlight. This is a beautiful place to relax and close to the trails to explore around the lake.
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We had another great stay at this well-appointed condo! I appreciate so many amenities—coffee, tea, washer/dryer, and dock. We look forward to staying again in the future. Thanks for your speedy responses and ease of contact!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We had a large group that rented 3 of the 4 condos for a celebration of life for our grandmother who recently passed. Breezy Hills was so accommodating and kind to our entire family. The condos are clean with many modern amenities and the view from the large deck is breathtaking. We couldn’t be happier and would HIGHLY recommend them to anyone. Thanks!
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great location on the lake! We would definitely stay here again when in the area!
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We enjoyed our stay at the Breezy Hill Family's place, which is definitely a beautiful home. The location is great, with easy access to the lake and the trail. The house is clean and cozy, and the hosts are responsive to questions."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I visit my family in Bemidji every other weekend or so and usually get a hotel room. But it was a couple family members birthdays so I thought about this AirBnb. And it did not disappoint. Everyone loved it and enjoyed it all. Once the weather is nice and warmer, would love to come back to this place again.
Thank You!"
2023-04-01,5.0,Group trip,"I have used AIRBNB throughout the USA, this is one of nicest I have used. The apartment was top notch and the lake view and location were great. Having the Greenway to cycle into town for groceries or meal--very nice."

There is plenty of parking and more than one outdoor space to enjoy the amazing views. Communication with the hosts was quick, friendly and easy. All of this made us feel like our experience was important to the hosts. We will definitely return!"

We absolutely loved seeing the lake every day, sitting on the deck reading, And watching the sunset down at the dock."

2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Was the perfect spot to spend some time with my son before dropping him at camp. The owners clearly take pride in the property and we slipped into “lake time” immediately. Incredibly comfortable and would recommend to anyone.

I have stayed at around 100 airbnbs over the years for work and vacation. This is honestly my favorite place I have ever stayed. Beautifully cozy with a lot of light. The place is beautifully decorated. The sunsets were my favorite part. The breezy Hills family that runs this unit were great. I had a few conversations with them. They are kind hearted Salt of the earth people that genuinely cared that I had a good stay. Thank you 🙏"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Thanks for a wonderful stay!
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great place, great people."
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Spacious unit. Well worth the price. Responsive and helpful hosts.
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,Very charming and affordable. Quaint little basement room with everything you need. Very responsive to any questions or issues. Would recommend
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I had a great stay, it was perfect for my needs. There's a wonderful paved walking trail around the lake located across the street. It was a nice quiet neighborhood. I would definitely stay here again."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Perfect location for stay in Bemidji. Close to everything. Listing as pictured and described on site and instructions with photos made check in a breeze. Hosts are friendly and available if you have questions.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I worked in various lakes around the Bemidji area for the week, and Josefina's home was in an excellent location. She and Mike were quick to respond to my questions before my stay. As I was scuba diving in lakes, I needed to use their hose each day after work to rinse all my gear. They were accommodating and helpful and put up with my gear hanging around their back railings to their door. They were friendly and welcoming but also respected my privacy. The room (I was in Moose) was as described - very spacious where I could exercise in the mornings, and quiet and comfortable where I could make dinner and relax in the evenings. Their house is also in a beautiful location within walking distance to some great restaurants! When I return to Bemidji for next season, I hope one of their rooms will be available."
2023-07-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Overall a great experience. It was a little unclear which door to use; but Mike was able to help us. It is the screen door that has stairs going down to the basement door.
The bathrooms were outside the rooms, so to get to them you had to go through the shared laundry room (shared with homeowner and other rented room). It wasn’t a problem, it’s just not the best set up if you want a private stay.
The hosts were great though, and very helpful. It was a great price for what it was, and we are satisfied."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Mike and Jo’s place is always clean, comfortable and most importantly conveniently located. We can walk downtown within minutes and the beautiful surroundings of the neighborhood and lake can’t be beat. We definitely recommend!"
2023-07-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"friendly, convenient for my stay for work. if needing to sleep for night shift, not ideal but it was the weekend. heard too much loud noise from the children playing"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Excellent value, it was just as it was described. Jo and Mike were quick to respond to any questions. Definitely would stay again."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place is reasonably priced, excellent location and fine for a couple nights. It is in the basement, so you will have stairs, and the bathroom is a couple steps across the laundry area, not inside the room. And the host kindly sent me back a book I forgot to pack. THANKS!"
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"We did a short term stay while working on a contract in Bemidji. We love how convenient the location was and how easy it was to check to in. Josefina was very communicative and always responsive. This airbnb was exactly what we needed and exactly as described. We were here for work and just needed a private place to come to sleep, eat, shower, and do laundry. This was all of that. Thank you for a fabulous stay!"
2022-10-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Jo’s place was exactly what i needed for a getaway weekend! It was clean, warm, and perfectly located"
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Cute, spacious, clean unit! And so well located. I highly recommend."
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Josefina’s place was great and the location on the waterfront was lovely. The location was perfect and very walkable to downtown, the university and Paul Bunion & Babe. The studio was comfortable and was as described."
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This Airbnb was exactly as stated. Great location, extremely clean and was just what we were looking for. Had no problems with anything it all went very smoothly and a great stay. Would recommend this place to anyone and everyone."
2022-02-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"First of all let me just say that the room was very welcoming. They had a tray with a small vase of flowers and a couple of chocolates which was a very nice touch. Everything was very clean and kitchen had everything I needed, we weren't doing much if any cooking though but I didn't think I would have wanted anything other than what they already had. The only downside to it is that I would say they slightly downplay how much noise transfers downstairs. I didn't have a problem with it most of the time but there were definitely a few times where I would say that it was actually loud. Mainly in the morning where it sounded like the kids were just getting up. But even so it's not like noise went on for a long time or anything. I would say maybe 15 minutes or so. So as long as you don't think that you would mind that I can't think of a reason you wouldn't stay here."
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Cozy little ground level place where we have stayed before. Thank you for your hospitality!
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,Excellent. All around great deal.
2021-11-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Nice private and comfortable room. Very clean.
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"Property faces the lake and provides a wonderful view of the sunrises. Lakeside Walking path is just across the street to go north to the university or Diamond Park, or the other direction provides a beautiful walk around the south end of the lake to the Arena through the awesome park. The Air B&B provides a safe and spacious place to relax and prepare your own simple meals ( micro, toaster oven and hot Plate available). Hosts are very accommodating."
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Josephine was an excellent host! My partner Garrett stayed here while working a job and couldn’t stop raving about how nice the place was and how great the hosts were!
2021-09-01,4.0,Stayed about a week,"My husband and I were coming to Bemidji for my son’s wedding. We decided to try an Airbnb for the first time, instead of the hotel where we typically stay. We booked a week stay (Tues-Tues) at the Moose for a fair price. Jo was kind and quick to get back to me when I messaged her a couple times with questions. The basement room is spacious and worked for our needs. We knew we would be busy with wedding prep, family, etc. and that we wouldn’t be spending much time in the room anyway. Sleep and shower was about it. House rules state quiet time is from 9pm to 7am as they have small children. You can definitely hear more than “some transfer noise” per the description. You will hear the piano playing, kids running around, stomping, people talking etc. On Sunday night it was the worst. At 10:30pm someone was moving something heavy upstairs right above the bed where we were trying to sleep. If you’re a light sleeper or are looking for peace and quiet, this may not be the best place for you. We were gone past 10:00pm for 3 of the days so I can’t speak on them as it was wedding set up (Thursday), grooms dinner (Friday), and the wedding and reception (Saturday). In the mornings we were also jarred awake before 7am by kids or some other random noise. No complaints on the accommodations or the hosts themselves, just the level of noise."
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great place to stay right near downtown Bemidji--walking distance to all the main restaurants/shops etc. and has everything you need. Bed was comfy (slept great) and everything was clean. Some noise could be heard starting around 8am but it was no problem at all and I was up by that time anyway. The one thing I would mention is that the bathroom is separate from the ""suite"" (so you do have to exit the room and walk a few steps to get to the bathroom) and within the bathroom itself, the space getting in/out of the shower is a little cramped (no problem for me, but could be a concern for larger guests). Would have no problem staying again if I'm in the area."
2021-09-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Centrally located to explore the area. Host communicates well on what to expect.
2021-09-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Was perfectly a nice location and the room was what would be expected a great stay for the price. It was late when we arrived and the lighting was a little lacking as we didn’t know where we were going.
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This Airbnb met all our expectations and fulfilled all of our needs. The room was very spacious and comfortable. It was quiet and clean.
We did look at other Airbnbs in the area, but they were far out of town and would have required a lot more driving for us. This one was conveniently located just a short walk from the downtown area. That was exactly what we needed."
2021-08-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"The location is great right next to the lake and a very easy walk to Downton Bemidji. Transportation (outside of walking) if you don't rent a car is quite challenging. The amenities themselves meet the needs of a traveler. The apt was spacious and clean and I appreciated the extra bedding. The bathroom was tidy. As the ad states, above noises can be heard from the main floor but it's usually quiet from 8pm-7am. This is a good spot for accomodations and the location is prime."
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Good location near BSU and Lake Bemidji. Spacious and clean!
2021-08-01,4.0,Stayed one night,The room was clean and comfortable.

You can see the lake from the window and there is a bike path right out the front door. It is within walking distance of downtown as well."
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This is a super nice place to stay! Great host ... can't say enough about her! And super location in this area. The Lake walk in breathtaking. Extremely comfortable bed with very nice touches. We hope to find a reason to stay again.
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was our second time staying at Josefina's place and it was just as comfy as the first time. My partner and I visit Bemidji (our hometown) at least once a year to participate in the local art fair- conveniently located within walking distance of this Airbnb. You'll also find it's just a quick walk to downtown, Paul & Babe, and a lovely stroll along Lake Bemidji, which we took advantage of every evening. Jo's place is clean, simple, and cozy; and her family is welcoming and respectful of your space while also being very accommodating to any needs or questions you might have. Excellent hosts and location."
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,great place to stay. great location and Josefina was very quick to respond and helpful

2020-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Great space, great host. We’d stay here again!"
2020-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I don't have too much to add compared to many of the other reviews for this space, but this was a great, valuable place to stay after being out to explore the area during the days. Jo was very communicative and a great host to work with!"
2020-08-01,4.0,Stayed over a week,"The room is very spacious, and bed is comfortable. The kitchen can do breakfast but I felt a bit limited to make full meals, (no stove) so we ate out a lot. There is a mini fridge and freezer available in the room to use, along with a toaster, microwave, induction plate, coffee maker, and water boiler. Laundry is just outside the room, as is the bathroom. The area is really nice, you can walk to a nearby park or to down town Bemidji to shop or eat out!"
2020-07-01,4.0,Stayed over a week,Jo is super nice and easy to communicate with if you have any questions. The bedroom/kitchenette room is also very comfortable!
2020-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great place! Thoughtful and responsive hosts!
2020-02-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Nice place in a good location. If the other room is being occupied there is not a lot of room for parking.
2020-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was our first time using airbnb and I was worried about how it worked, but Josefina had very easy to follow instructions. Her house is right on the lake and in town and a great place to stay!"
2020-02-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Extremely clean and wonderful for the value! You will hear the family upstairs... tantrums, piano playing, stomping, crying and all. Glad we had headphones to try to sleep in a bit. But overall good location and very clean"
2020-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Another Great Stay at Her Place! Awesome as Usual
2020-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The check in process was so easy. The room was perfect and had a kitchen area. We had access to the laundry and had a private bathroom. The room was spacious and the area was perfect for our trip. So much cheaper than a hotel and just as accommodating. We will be back!
2020-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The Moose Room at Josefine's Airbnb is the perfect stay! Cute, cozy and well funished, this spacious room has everything you need to enjoy your stay. The kitchenette, living area and private bathroom were excellent features to this room. Josefina is very kind and helpful. Great central location to everything downtown Bemidji and Bemidji Lake. Highly recommend and would stay again!"
2020-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,I always enjoy staying with Mike and Jo. Look forward to the next visit.
2020-01-01,4.0,Stayed one night,Basic basement suite - large and open.
2020-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Great stay! Saw the northern lights, really cozy place right on the shore of Lake Bemidji. Great for a run in the morning, I really liked the coffee house recommendations in the guest book."
2019-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Spacious and clean, great location. Will definitely stay here again when I’m in Bemidji."

I loved the location in Bemidji. Close to downtown, BSU, and Paul&Babe.
The host are very welcoming and friendly. Super!"
2019-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This was a great place to stay! A very large room with couches and a kitchenette. Easy access to a walk on the lake, downtown, and some restaurants."
2019-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Within walking distance of downtown for unique shopping, restaurants, museums, landmarks, and library."
2019-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The location was idea for my visit to Bemidji. I am very familiar with the city and was pleased to find something across the road from the lake, and within a few blocks to campus and downtown. The Moose Unit is a nice studio apartment. It was spacious, clean, and had everything I needed for a short stay. I was surprised to find a tv with Roku access as a tv was not listed as being in the unit. The bathroom location was a bit inconvenient, but not a deal breaker for me. Her description of the unit was accurate. Check-in with the lockbox was easy and off-street parking was appreciated.
I would recommend this as a place to stay. I will definitely check the availability at 717 Lake Bed N More the next time I need lodging in Bemidji."
2019-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,I have stayed here multiple times. I have not been disappointed. The location is great for my needs.

2019-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Booked this AirBnB for its location (next to the Paul Bunyan Trail and downtown) and the value--it delivered what was advertised. Clean basement space, comfortable bed, ease to get places in Bemidji without a car. Please note that the bathroom is not connected to your space, and that you need to go through a common area that adjoins the playroom, laundry room and additional living space. Hosts were very accommodating in providing a garage spot to store our bikes during the stormy overnight."
2019-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"While a bit rustic, this is a very comfortable space and especially conveniently located for a vacation in Bemidji."
2019-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great place. It was very neat and well organized. They had a variety of options for beverages. Very convenient as far location goes in Bemidji. Overall superhosts.
2019-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,I have stayed here multiple times now and am never disappointed. The fact that I keep coming back says it all.
2019-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great location to downtown Bemidji and has lovely scenic views all around.
2019-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This establishment exceeds standard expectations.
2019-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"All around excellent!
I love the freedom to spread out in my room when I travel, and this room was incredibly spacious, cozy, and charming. The location is also ideal--very close to downtown and the University. Tons of dining options within a short walking distance. Very lovely hosts.
I will definitely stay here again! Highly recommended."
2019-08-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"Location, location, location! Easy walk to Bar 209 along the lakefront; great neighborhood of classic architecture. The use of the washer/dryer was much appreciated. Overall, an affordable choice for above average accommodations."
2019-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Clean, quiet and great location. Hosts add nice touches in the space that makes the stay very enjoyable. I stay here for work trips and highly recommend it."

2019-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Josefina's place is in a great location. Right at downtown Bemidji, in walking distance to the lakefront and other attractions.

2019-07-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"Great host. Great location, but unfortunately only stayed for one night. I'll come back if I have the chance."
2019-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"A very nice suite, conveniently located to downtown restaurants and local resources."
2019-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was my first Airbnb stay, the whole process was new to me, but Josefina and Mike made it easy and welcoming. I was in town to participate at a local art festival and was thrilled to find their home was walking distance to the park- it really gave me a lot of peace of mind. The space was very comfortable and clean. They mention children in the listing, but I honestly didn't hear any noises the whole time we were there, not even from the other unit next to ours. I also thought I had overlooked the bathroom situation when booking- the basement where our Moose unit is located is next to another rental unit- but each one has their own private bathroom, which was important needing to get ready in the mornings for the art fair. Overall- it was a perfect place to stay for our weekend in Bemidji- we'd recommend it and look to stay there again in the future."
2019-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,I have stayed here on several trips and will come back again. 5 star visit.

2018-11-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,I’ve always enjoyed staying at this location and look forward to visiting again.
2018-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great suite!
2018-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"What a perfectly situated spot is Jo and Mike's. Downtown/central Bemidji at your feet in one direction, the lake and its walk/bike trail literally across the street on the other side. Spotted a huge bald eagle perched and scouring the lake for fish the first time I walked out the door.
I can't add anything to the listing because they cover everything 100% accurately. I did appreciate Jo's welcome and being shown around, though their self-check in instruction guide in the app is step-by-step and comprehensive."
2018-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Clean, well furnished space. The private bathroom and private entrance were great! Very close to downtown, we loved being right on the lake walk. Thank you for a great stay - would recommend to anyone staying in the area!

2018-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great location, lovely space. Very accommodating couple."
2018-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Pleasant stay.
2018-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We had a wonderful stay at Mike & Josefina’s place. Everything was exactly as mentioned and Mike’s hospitality when we arrived was great! I appreciated having the kitchen items around to enjoy my tea. Thank you for making our first Airbnb stay a fantastic one!
2018-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"First off, the bed is amazingly comfortable! The space is private and well appointed. Kitchen has coffee maker with coffee, tea pot with tea, toaster, and microwave. Note that there is no TV, but the WiFi is strong and reliable. Shared bathroom with another suite. Not an issue as I was the only one there. Mike and Josefina were wonderful and responsive hosts and made my stay a pleasant one. Just an FYI, Mike and Josefina have small children. It did not bother me in the least to hear them upstairs and made me feel quite at home. Easy to find and I recommend it for anyone who is looking for a comfortable and affordable stay in Bemidji."
2018-09-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"Very close to BSU. Nice, clean place to stay. The bed is comfy too! There was some noticeable noise from upstairs, not anything more than a family doing their daily routine. Which also means it was quiet by 9pm. I would stay here again."
2018-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The house is much more cozy than I thought and the surroundings are beautiful.Although I only stayed for one night, the host gave me a lot of travel tips nearby, thank you very much, I will stay again if I have the opportunity."
2018-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The clean room and kitchenette are fully equipped, just a few minutes walk from Bermigi Lake, one of the things was great."
2018-09-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,We had a comfortable stay at Jo's place. Quiet at night. Everything as pictured. Other guests were there but we saw them once. It's great to take a walk on the lake shore! Many fine restaurants close by.
2018-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Clean room, kitchenette & bathroom. Very accommodating hosts!"
2018-09-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great location, worth the extra bucks to be so close to campus and downtown. We drove in at night and it was a little bit hard to find the house in the dark since the neighborhood is pretty residential but Jo’s directions were clear and easy to follow. The host came down to make sure we had the correct WiFi information and knew where extra towels could be found when we arrived as well."
2018-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"What a great location - front yard overlooks Lk Bemidji!! And a really spacious apt, equipped kitchen. Good WiFi. Mike greeted me in person and was very gracious helping me in. I hope someday I can come back and stay longer."
2018-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The time I spent staying here was wonderful. Hospitality was great, I enjoyed talking with the host and her family. Room has a lot of space which is what I needed, a lot of thoughtful touches in the room, bedding and supplies. Really convenient environment, kitchen and bathroom are right there. CLEAN room and COMFORTABLE bed. Another thing I loved about staying here is how close it is to downtown, BSU campus and the lake, literally steps away. Host was knowledgeable and generous to share tips on visiting around. Highly recommend this place to stay!"
2018-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Cute space in a great location. Didn’t get to meet Jo as she was away, but everything was well described so self-service was easy. And getting to do my laundry was fantastic! Would readily stay again."
2018-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Hosts are great and friendly note; don't plan on sleeping in on the weekends if your a lite sleeper. You will hear kids running around above you. Didn't bother me but it might bother some folks.
2018-09-01,3.0,Stayed one night,Great location on the lake.
2018-08-01,4.0,Stayed one night,Good place for location and value
2018-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Great location! So close to downtown shopping Paul Bunyan and Babe and eating locations. Skip your diet and treat yourself to a River Spoon ice cream. Why not make it a double in a waffle cone? Right across the street from Paul. The lake is only a short distance from the house and the walking trail is well kept.
The studio room is perfect for even a lunch ne’er stay. Mike was so helpful and made sure we had everything we needed. I wish we could’ve taken advantage of the Chinese breakfast they offered but we had other plans."
2018-08-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,Josefina is a great host.
2018-05-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"After nights of being in motels near roads, and where workers get up super early, it was nice to wake up in a quiet neighborhood. You can wake up and go for a walk along the lake and to the downtown area. We were just there basically to get a good night rest before a long drive. So didn’t have any time to interact with the hosts, but Josephine’s husband was very nice when he let us in and showed us the space."
2018-04-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,We love the fact that it was right on Bemidji Lake! The views were beautiful! We were able to walk a short distance to a couple of nice restaurants. It was very quiet and we were able to get good rest.
2018-03-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"Josefina is a great host. Nice quiet, clean space with a very comfortable bed."
2018-03-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"I loved the location was within walking distance to downtown Bemidji. I enjoy the art gallery two blocks away. The basement room was spacious with no TV, however, great WiFi access. Everything was clean. The access to the bathroom is out side of the room. The hosts were able to text me quickly the answers to the questions I asked. I found the room to be a good value."
2018-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This is a cozy place in a great location and is very reasonably priced. We have stayed here before and will likely visit again.
2018-03-01,3.0,Stayed one night,"If you want a quiet restful night close to town, this is a great choice. Centrally located, in a large white historic home along the lake."
2018-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I stayed in the ""Moose"" room. But the coffee provided was from Caribou! Spacious basement room. Comfortable bed and fast wi-fi. Small bathroom. Great value in basic accommodation."
2018-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"My stay was short but just right to get a good night's sleep last minute.
The home is right on the lake and within walking distance of downtown Bemidji.
This is a gem and a great value. The space has everything you need minus a TV..But you don't travel to use a TV anyway. Great communication and easy check-in. I look forward to staying here again when in town! Book your stay Today! 😉"
2018-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Nice place quiet
2018-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Super cute house right on the lake. I'm sure it's beautiful in summer. We were only in town for one night to catch a BSU hockey game, and the room was perfect for our needs - clean, quiet and private. Would definitely stay again."
2017-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Affordable and excellent location.
2017-10-01,4.0,Stayed one night,Everything was as advertised.
2017-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This place is nice and really affordable. It’s close to the lake and downtown as well. Would stay at this place again
2017-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Jo's place was great. She and her husband are very accommodating hosts.
2017-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Josefina and Micheal were wonderful host. Thank you again.
2017-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay. Josefina was very welcoming.
2017-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Accurate and pleasant. Highly recommended.
2017-08-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"A great location right on the lake, an easy walk to downtown Bemidji, and a local park that happened to be hosting a big Dragon Boat Festival.
Josefina and her husband were very helpful and friendly, obviously taking pride in the service they offer, voluntarily refunding us part of our stay because the air mattress they provided for our daughter ended up having a bad leak in it."
2017-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"A very spacious room with just the right breakfast items for me and a very comfortable bed. The location is excellent - walking distance to the heart of downtown, right next to the lake and close to the main park. I took in the Dragon Boat Races and Corn Hole competition before dining at Fozzie's BBQ. A very good eatery with dirt cheap drinks and super-friendly owner and staff."
2017-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great stay! Very comfortable and spacious room. Perfect kitchenette and couch area - definitely would book this stay again. Thanks Jo!
2017-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Lovely room with kitchenette, and a shared bathroom. The place is spacious and beautiful and location is great. Really enjoyed walking around the lake area and town. I would definitely stay here again if I come back to Bemidji."
2017-07-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"Great value for lots of space in a quiet neighborhood. Cool basement on a hot summer day. As it is a shared house you will hear the family move around upstairs, but it didn't bother us at all. Flexible and welcoming host."
2017-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Great location!!!!!! The park, the lake, Paul and Blue, eateries, coffee houses, etc. Park the car and leave it parked.
As described... The accommodations were wonderful, studio-like atmosphere with plenty of room.
You won't be disappointed..."
2017-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Very pleased with the room provided! Very close to Paul and Babe the Big Blue Ox!
2017-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This is the second time in a month that myself and family have stayed in Josefina's home,
We stayed in two different rooms, the room this time is in the basement so stays nice and cool on the warmer days. It is very spacious, she has created a studio apartment feel, a bit more modern than her upstairs room that we stayed in last time, but I love both for different reasons. She is very willing to communicate I was new to Airbnb, she answered all of my inquiries promptly.
Love the location walking distance to downtown Bemidji, and basically right on the lake."
2017-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The host was very helpful and accommodating. The room is very large; the bed is very comfortable and there is a lovely kitchenette. The room is in the basement but the decorations and special touches the host has added to the room make it a very warm and welcoming place to stay.
2017-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Josefina and her family are friendly, accommodating and communicative host. They stocked the fridge with breakfast food and plenty of tea and coffee options. The space is clean and the bed is very comfortable. The room is just as described, spacious enough to even host friends over. I love having everything all in one big room. The studio room and bathroom are very private. Their location can't be beaten, and I had one of the nicest morning walk along the lake. As an added bonus, even though it was a hot summer day, as hot as Bemidji can possibly get, this room in the basement is very cool! I also opt for the Chinese breakfast option, being a Chinese myself, her food reminded me of home and my mom's cooking. It sure could be a fun cultural experience for anyone, as well as a delicious and healthy home made meal."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Very comfortable and relaxing stay with a homey feel and welcoming hostess. We were away during the days doing some hiking and sightseeing, but it would have been great to have another night there to enjoy the property more fully. We also really appreciated access to laundry facilities. Would stay here again if returning to Bemidji!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place to get away! It fit our needs perfectly! Great host communication 😊
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Abbi was the perfect hostess. She is delightfuland responsive! The setting for her BnB was beautiful and tranquil. It would be a good place to just go and kick back for a week or two. The bed was comfortable and we had everything we needed.
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We were there such a short time.
2024-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We loved our stay at Abbie’s beautiful home and would definitely stay again!
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Abbi was great and we enjoyed our stay.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Wonderful quiet and comfortable space for our weekend stay while helping elder parents with accessibility tasks. Wished we could have spent more time by the river! Next time hopefully. Thanks for helping us have an afford place where we could retreat during our stay.
2024-03-01,4.0,Stayed one night,Very nice and responsive host!
2024-03-01,2.0,Stayed one night,"We did not feel entirely comfortable upon entry. We were surprised at the political and religious imagery in the stairwell, which was not pictured in the listing. I knew from photos that there would be some, but I could not have anticipated the extent. Of course, the host is welcome to decorate their home however they wish! But if I’d known I would not have chosen this Airbnb. I’m only including this in my review so that others are aware before booking. I would have felt entirely uncomfortable and perhaps unsafe walking into this space if visibly queer or a person of color. Additionally, we had no way to close off or lock the basement. The bathroom door lock was also not functional. The bedroom door locked but otherwise there was no way to ensure privacy. The host was friendly and the unit was clean! I only think the political and religious aspects should be clearly pictured in the listing so that guests can assess whether they’re comfortable with this BEFORE booking."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Abbi’s place was just as described. Great location out in the country next to the river. She was a very responsive host.
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Abbi was a wonderful host for my stay in Bemidji.
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This was the first time I had used Airbnb and Abbi set the bar high for the next time I use it.
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I had a lovely stay at Abbi's. I was looking for a peaceful, private place to crash for a couple of nights, and it was just that. She had very detailed, proactive instructions. There was a common room with fridge and microwave, and even a ping pong table available! Everything was very clean. And great price and value!"
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great communication! Very comfy space!! Perfect for a weekend stay in Bemidji!!!

2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Abbi’s place is exactly what my wife and I want in an Airbnb! It was super clean, had clear instructions, was very peacefully, and even had the friendliest dog!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Both the place and the host were great. Abbi was always very responsive. Enjoyed watching the river flow past in the early mornings or evenings. Very peaceful. Perfect spot for our trip to MN to visit family.
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Lovely space off the beaten path. Lake views, dirt road and sounds of the woods. I loved landing there. Abbi is great and Kidji the dog is amazing. Highly recommend this place.
Thanks Abbi."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"what a fabulous location!
Abbi was always responsive.
you have a ton of space in her basement. backyard being on the Mississippi River is awesome. it is about 10-12 minutes drive away from most Bmidji, but absolutely worth it for the seclusion and the view.
I worked remotely for a days and the internet was great."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This is a great place to stay in the area! We settled here after traveling from Medora, ND. It was so roomy and very comfortable. Abbi’s place was perfect for us to begin our trip south on the Great River Road."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Had a short, but comfortable & restful stay at Abbi’s. She was attentive to my needs and helpful local recommendations."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great place to spend a night on my roadtrip! Abbi was super helpful in showing me around the place!
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We greatly enjoyed staying with Abbi. The place was more than we had envisioned - a great bonus was the friendliness of the host! Abbi is extremely caring and friendly. She does everything in her power to ensure that her guests are feeling great in her home and that they lack nothing. It was a pleasure to stay at her place. We had everything we needed. We enjoyed the rustic and the quietness of the place. Being the 4th of July, we had wanted something somewhat secluded and this was the place. Still, very close to the city - only a couple miles away - but far enough to get the quietness we had wanted. The dog was extremely friendly and our son was overjoyed to see it! Overall, a wonderful experience - if our paths would take us again to Bemidji, we would love to stay at Abbi's place again! Thank you, Abbi! Till we see each other again!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Abbi’s place was perfect. She was very responsive and friendly, and gave me directions to sights I requested. The bed was very comfortable and the lower level of the home was private and quiet. I would love to stay again."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I was in the Bemidji area for 5 days doing scuba diving work for the county in different lakes each day. I could not have picked a better place to stay during my time there! Abbi's lovely home was so peaceful and comfortable - she thinks of everything. Abbi's communication was top notch and it was apparent she has concern for her guests and wants them to feel comfortable. I loved the coziness of the ""TV room"" as well as the big open room where I was able to do Zoom workout classes. The kitchenette area had enough dishes and bits and pieces for me to make food every day. Abbi was also immensely accommodating with me and all my crazy scuba gear! I will be returning to the area again this summer, and likely annually for the same work - I hope to stay at Abbi's again if it's open! (Special shout out to Kitchi the pup - such a sweetie!)"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,fabulous host!! Even the doggie was so friendly. very private and pieceful. the added touches of being a proud American citizen and the blessings of the lord was absolutely perfect. she also had fresh flowers in the bedroom smelled so refreshing!! look forward to staying with her once again!!

2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Wonderful, stay, very quiet and lots of room. Good communication with host very nice place with fun play area under the steps. My kids would’ve enjoyed when they were younger. We had a very short stay but we’re very happy with the accommodations. Loved your coffee bar set up wish we would’ve had more time to enjoy the river and your beautiful landscaping. Thanks again."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I enjoyed my stay at Abbi’s place. Beautiful and quiet setting- loved just standing by the river to take in the peaceful surroundings. Their dog was super sweet and friendly too- I wished I’d had time to play with him! A clean, charming basement suite which was a restful place to stay while attending a conference in the area. Overall would definitely recommend!"
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We really enjoyed meeting the host. She was very friendly and gave us good suggestions where to visit and what to see. We especially liked all the little details in the house, historical pieces of furniture, art, posters and such. For our son there was a play area and Roku TV. The backyard is right on the river, I had great time birdwatching."
2023-04-01,4.0,Stayed over a week,"As a whole, the stay went very smoothly, and I truly had privacy in the basement of the home and had minimal interaction with the owner and her family. She was readily available when communicating with her and the space was in great shape. Definitely worth the price."
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Abby was very pleasant, greeted me and visited with me. I highly recommend that if you just need a calming place with friendly people you have it here. I'd come back for sure."

2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,My suite was exactly as described. I would definitely stay with Abbi the next time that I'm in Bemidji. It was very accessible to the Sanford Center & downtown restaurants. I recommend the Minnesota Nice Cafe.

2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,I stayed at Abbys place many times in the last few months while in Bemidji for work. She offers an excellent price and the place is true to the pictures and explanation given in the listing. I am sure I will stay again soon:) thank you Abby! I always appreciate your warm hospitality!
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Abbi is a very friendly and welcoming hostess who responds quickly to any communication. Her basement accommodation is spacious and has many creative touches. At the northern most point of the Mississippi river, her home is in a scenic and very quiet area. I would highly recommend her facility to anyone looking for a quiet stay in a lovely setting."
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Always a great stay!
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Abby is always kind to me to makes me feel welcomed.
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Abbi's place was perfect for our stay. It was about 5 miles from DT Bemidji, on the eastside of the lake, but it was easy to navigate even with a recent snow storm. The entry is private with a digital lock and the space downstairs was just as described. We had fun playing ping pong in our free time! They have a very friendly dog and we are dog people, so we loved it. The dog stayed outside and greeted us often. Big bark, but sweet as can be :)
Abbi is a very friend and helpful host. My daughter left a ring and Abbi was nice enough to mail it to us after finding it!!!
We will certainly stay with Abbi again when we visit Bemidji!"

2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Abbi always makes my stays easy and comfortable!
2022-10-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,"My stay was fine overall. The house is a couple miles down a dirt/gravel road, which wasn’t mentioned in the description. The basement is spacious, but the upstairs footsteps are loud in the bedroom. They seemed to honor their quiet times, which was nice. Overall a good enough value."
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Always a great, easy stay!"
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The space was a nice place to stay during our one night in town. Everything was clean and as advertised.
However, if I had know the stairwell leading into the basement was a giant American flag and with photocopies of the US constitution on the wall, I wouldn't have booked the room. There's also a golden retriever on the property. While the owner gave us the heads up it was going to be out when we arrived and was friendly, it absolutely didn't act or sound friendly. I don't recommend arriving at night. Would have been nice if they'd sealed the garage dog door."
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Spacious, lovely basement space, replete with ping pong table. Lots of amenities and consideration were evident. It was a bit further from Bemiji than anticipated, but that may have been our GPS routing. Wonderful Airbnb."
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Beautiful spacious accommodation’s in a lovely setting.
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Always a great stay!

2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Abbi’s place & hospitality were great. I enjoyed my stay and felt welcomed. Abbi was easy to communicate with, and the place was clean & comfortable. Will continue to book with Abbi when I come to Bemidji for work:)"
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,lovely spot right on the mississippi river. went for a beautiful paddle and enjoyed abbi and the cute doggos company! great value and a nice spot to enjoy the northwoods
2022-07-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Abbi was very nice and accommodating. The location was great and parking is available. They have a sweet dog that greets you near the premises. The place you stay is in the basement and it is clean and had a modern feel mixed with the rural hardwood feel of the property. One of the beds had sheets that smelled a bit stale or as if someone slept in them recently. But it wasn’t an issue we just used their available washer and dryer to solve the issue. No problem. The house is very quiet. Abbi is great!
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,What a wonderful gem! Abbi is a warm and generous hostess and added beautiful personal touches to our lodging. We felt at home and enjoyed the beautiful scenery of the river and yard as well as Abbi's piano playing. Thank you Abbi!

2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Abbi’s space was very quiet, clean, comfortable and spacious, exactly as described. My aunt stayed in the bedroom, and said the bed was very comfortable. She loved the fresh flowers that Abbi set out. I slept on a pull out mattress, also very comfy. The basement is cool - great for sleeping. There is a space heater available if needed. Being right on the Mississippi River offered a new perspective of this great river. Thank you Abbi for the stay!"
2022-06-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Abbi was very kind. Also I really love their family dog! Such a cute pooch.
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Perfect experience. Abbi is responsive, the rooms are comfortable. Abbi has nice instructions posted. We stayed one night and really appreciated the value."

2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Abby’s beautiful peaceful apartment was exactly what I needed for the four days I was in the area! Very nicely finished and convenient. Surrounded by the cozy charm that this sweet lady has created. She offered the perfect balance of privacy and availability as a hostess! I would book her place again!
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,This is a very beautiful place to stay! Great beds and pillows. Condo was well stocked with kitchen necessities to make cooking more convenient. They also have decent shampoo/conditioner and body wash. Incredible deck and view of lake Bemidji. About a 15 minute drive to anything in town. We had a very comfortable stay! Would easily recommend to family and friends!
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"condo was exactly what they said it would be. clean, great lake, dock amazing, chair on end of dock amazing!! the biggest deck I've ever seen for a 4 shared condo unit. all around good good good!!"

2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"What a beautiful location, overlooking the lake and nature. Cozy and comfortable and minutes away from town. A value price for this location!"
2024-02-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"The place was quiet and what we needed for the time we were there.
Cons:
The carpets need to be cleaned...there were several stains on it, along with the two chairs and couch in the living room and it appeared to looked dirty. A few of the towels for the bathroom were dirty and or stained, but the one had a blood spot on it...I would suggest getting colored towels instead. The master bathroom shower is small, so a shower nozzle that could detach would be nice. Installing deadbolts on the units would be a nice added security at night, instead of just the lock system...anyone that knows the code can just use it and walk in. The fridge made an awful sound when it would kick on to cool.
Pros:
The beds were nice and comfy, the decorations are very cute and the overall stay was nice and it would be great in the summer!"
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Amazing stay! Looking forward to booking this in the future again ￼!

2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a lovely stay at Breezy Hills over Thanksgiving. A cozy and peaceful home in a scenic setting, we felt truly comfortable. An underrated feature is the thermostat in every room for individualized climate control, especially nice in the chilly Northern Minnesota November. Thank you for a great stay!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Great place, we loved staying right next to the bike trail!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This location was absolutely perfect! The apartment was also spotless and super clean. There were great amenities and it helped to have the full kitchen and space. You could tell there was so much thought and care put into the details too. The view and watching sunrise/sunset from the docks and deck were also fantastic. We will try to return another time of year to enjoy a slightly warmer season too. Many thanks to the Breezy Hills Family for their hospitality!
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We appreciated the space, location and setting. The conditioned water was fantastic and something you don’t get many places. Thank you kindly for being responsive to our messages!!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Wonderful hosts! When I arrived, I noticed a book of recommendations and places to check out in the Bemidji area. Responsive hosts and the environment was clean."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great location on the lake! The huge deck overlooking the lake was a perfect place to watch the Northern Lights, too! Would be a good place to come back to and spend more time. We were only in town for two nights this time and had a busy schedule with family. This was a retreat to recharge each evening."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I had a great three night stay here; I was traveling for work and wanted to enjoy the natural area more than a hotel would provide and I was not disappointed! The grounds and easy access to the lake and the Paul Bunyan trail was fantastic! I loved sitting on the dock or large shared porch to watch the sunset, which was stunning each night. The rental was clean and comfortable and so close to downtown. The bed in the master is also super comfy! I would stay here again!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Great place for a family vacation! The views are stunning and cannot be beat. It was close to town while still feeling like we had privacy and could relax.

2023-02-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"We enjoyed our stay. The sunsets were beautiful. Great location for snowmobiling right off the Paul Bunyan trail was a huge plus! The only down fall were the beds. We found them to be very hard and uncomfortable.
Overall we had a great time!"
2022-12-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"Had a great stay, bud sadly picked the coldest days of the year for our time there. Hey, you can’t control weather, right? Some small issues getting into the unit, however, the staff was very responsive in getting things sorted out. I would definitely recommend this unit to others and would be happy to stay there again, perhaps when it’s a little warmer. All and all, it was a great experience."

2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Book this place and you will have no regrets. Our stay was magical. The sunsets are amazing (as good as Hawaii). The condo is spacious with great outdoor amenities. This was the highlight of our vacation. The hosts respond quickly to any needs. The guest book is full of good information. We tried the Green Mill restaurant and it was amazing! Next time we hope to stay longer and hit all the recommended restaurants. PS be sure to enjoy the chairs at the end of the dock especially for a sunset or two.
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We enjoyed this lovely condo. Clean, easy access and beautiful setting"
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We had a great stay here. The unit was very clean and on a great location on the lake. Easy access to anything in Bemidji, but a feeling of being removed from it. Brothers are very prompt in responding if you need anything. Definitely would stay here again if in Bemidji area."
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The condo is very nice, in an absolutely prime location. The sunset on the lake was amazing, and we could watch it from either the large deck overlooking the lake, or from the deck of the unit, or even from the couch in the living room. The unit is very clean, the interior design is clever and relaxing. Mississippi River exits the lake 200 feet from the condo, and I had an awesome experience going down there using one of the kayaks on the premises. Paul Bunyan trail is basically in the front yard. Grocery stores are fairly close.
The hosts are very responsive. We needed some extra blankets and the host dropped them at the unit promptly. will definitely try and book this unit again next time we are in Bemidji."
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I enjoyed the kayaks they keep on the property, a nice bonus to my stay!"

2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had an excellent stay over the long 4th of July weekend! The location seriously cannot be beat for lakeside views and your classic Minnesota weekend Up North.
The lake is about 3 feet deep for a long way past the pier and mostly sand, so it's perfect for swimming, tubing, and kayaking (and they have kayaks you can use). The yard is nice and open with a couple of spots to hang the hammock as well as play lawn games. There are also a couple of bonfire spots, plenty of firewood, and lots of outdoor lounging options.
Even over the holiday, the lake and neighborhood were a lot calmer and quieter than I expected. The fireworks were great and you have a great view from the pier. This condo is one of four with a shared entrance lobby, but you still have lots of privacy and you can't hear much from the other units. The other guests were considerate and fun to chat with.
The condo seems recently remodeled and in really nice shape. The decor was updated and cozy. The beds are GREAT, which was a huge plus. Since it's a newer rental, there were a few kitchen things missing, but the hosts were very responsive and brought over a ton of stuff the next morning. They checked in to make sure things were going well, and are very eager to ensure your stay is top-notch!
We had a blast and would definitely stay here again."
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This was truly an amazing stay. I have stayed at other places in Bemidji and this place is the best. Way better than a resort or hotell.

literally on the water and on the PB trail."

2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"Wonderfull house literally feet from the beach.

I would recommend this place for couples as well as families that are looking for the perfect northern getaway!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Group trip,"Such a beautiful home on the lake! We spent a long weekend here enjoying time with lifelong friends playing canasta, going to a football game & enjoying the outdoors.

2023-09-01,5.0,Group trip,"This was such a great spot! The kitchen was equipped with all necessities, there was a lot of space for hanging out in multiple spots, and it was beautiful spot right on the lake! We will definitely be looking for another time to visit. Thank you!"

She has a basket of local treats for you to try, many cozy blankets, a fireplace, and a fun children’s room with a reading nook with books and bunk beds that I know my granddaughters would love! This being Christmas, there were even a few decorations out, something I appreciated. I imagine summer would be fun too, with a sandy beach and fire pit.
Ellen was super responsive and helpful, and even let us stay a bit later on checkout day. I would definitely stay again!"

2024-05-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"The house is absolutely adorable and cozy, and the outdoor space is simply stunning and incredibly serene. It's just around 11 minutes from downtown, making it convenient for dining out or shopping. The thoughtful gesture of providing stocked breakfast supplies made me feel immediately at home, and not having to rush into town for groceries on the first night was a huge relief. Everything was impeccably clean, and the main bedroom had ample space for my pup's dog beds and having access to a washer and dryer was an added bonus. I highly recommend this little gem!"

2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"If you’re looking for a quaint, cottage-like, place to relax, this is your place. Along, with the great location, this place is very clean and up to date. I was originally born and raised in Bemidji/Bagley area and we come up a few times of year to visit our family & friends. I’ve always stayed at the Hampton, Rutgers or my Grandparents’ cabins on Gull Lake but I’m so happy I gave this place a try!! I loved the peace and quiet, nature (lots of crows, squirrels and deer) the most! The hosts are very quick to reply to any messages and were great about helping with any needs. Also, loved the extra touch, with extra kitchen necessities, like milk, eggs & butter. The beds were simple and comfortable. I have a bad back and woke up every morning, pain free! If you want clean and smelly-free house, this is perfect! All around I rate this place 5 stars! I’m very particular and can be picky on where my family stays but no worries here! As long as the price is right and stays affordable; we’ll for sure be back!!"

2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Our stay in Bemidji at Austin & Adele's listing was EXCELLENT - way beyond our expectations. It's spacious, comfy, decorated very nice and their additional extra's included were amazing. Ease of check-in and communications was very good. Plenty of parking and it would be great for a family with the firepit and outdoor picnic area. We enjoyed watching the deer in the yard as we were relaxing on the couch watching TV. We stayed two nights and enjoyed the surrounding local sights and restaurants. The distance from downtown was not a problem. I'd give more than 5 stars if that was an option!! Highly recommended."

The beds were comfortable and provided a good nights rest and Austin and Adele even provide phone chargers on the bedside table. That might not seem like a big deal but when you are tired and ready for bed and realize the charger is in the car it is very much appreciated. They have really thought out what amenites a traveler will need or want. The provided breakfest foods were a nice thoughtful touch. So if you are on the fence just book this property, you won't regret it."

2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This house was a wonderful place to stay. It’s clean and modern and very nicely decorated. There was plenty of closet space and storage in the bedrooms. The beds and bedding were comfortable. The kitchen was well stocked. It was nice to have internet and a Roku. The water odor was unpleasant and we used the bottled water that was provided by the hosts. We’re aware that they’re working on this issue. As far as location goes, it was close to the lakes where we were fishing and was an easy drive into Bemidji. There was road construction and detours nearby that were somewhat inconvenient but certainly not a deal breaker. We will definitely return to this Airbnd."

Plenty of room to park a boat or trailer, and the circle drive makes it an easy in and out with one. Super clean, and decorated perfectly. Austin and Adele have truly gone the extra mile, adding extra touches to make sure you are as comfortable as possible... breakfast items, a well equipped kitchen, games, lots of local area info... you name it, they've covered it!

A very pleasant, quiet place. Amazing view of the stars from the deck, and listened to coyotes yelp and howl at night. Great place, great stay."

2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This was such an awesome stay. We came up to do some outdoor exploring during this particularly warm winter; however, as luck would have it, it was very cold during the weekend of our stay. I messaged Jamie to see if there was any way that we could get in earlier and within minutes she responded that she would try her hardest to get us in earlier.

2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"One of the most relaxing rejuvenating and cathartic experiences I’ve had in years, and I loved the privacy and tiny home inclusiveness)))!!!
I suffer greatly from depersonalization if not very careful where I am literally trapped in my head and lose executive function over/basic satisfaction with my body experience. It is literally torture and brutal especially being as sensitive to external stimuli and drama as I can be
Experiences like this within reason give me the platform to organize my mind together on my own accord and reassess where my heart and healing is at instead of torturous and hellishly overly being taken over by the reactions of other and my insecurities)) So Medicinal) 🏠💖🫀❤️‍🩹"

It was a quick drive into Bemidji to eat and to walk on the bike trails when we were done fishing for the day. The house was clean and comfortable. We really appreciated the central air after being in the hot sun all day.
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Very cute and well-kept house just outside of Bemidji. Country feel but very close to town. Great communication from Grace and accommodating on a requested early check-in. My only constructive feedback is that the kitchen was a little sparse. Very few dishes, bowls, etc, no creamer or sweetener for coffee. Not expected, but have seen that in several Airbnb properties we’ve stayed at, have come to very much appreciate the added touches!"
2022-07-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Gabriel's house is nicely remodeled, freshly painted and furnished, and sparkling clean. Self check-in was easy and convenient.

2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Lovely, quiet home with quick, easy access to Bemidji. Gabriel's house is in a very peaceful location, and I had a very restful sleep. I really appreciated the large deck which extended off the living room. It made for a very pleasant evening, after a long day on the road, to sit outside with a coffee and watch the sunset and sky turn to twilight. I wouldn't hesitate to stay here again."

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"It was SO nice to stay at a secluded, quiet place. I had informed Jill that we would likely arrive after dark so she left the outside light on, and we appreciated the sensor light on the garage. Everything was clean and comfy! We never did figure out the TVs/Amazon Prime videos (maybe because we don't have Prime?) but we weren't there enough to worry about it. :)"

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Jill was a fantastic hostess. She communicated regularly and responded quickly when we had questions. We found the local signage and our map program didn't quite agree so that was a little tricky at first, but Jill had sent a text message with clearer instructions prior to our arrival so we had no trouble locating the cottage at all. It was comfortable, and clean. Jill even went out of her way to provide some marshmallow roasting sticks so we could make s'mores around the fire pit one night. Only regret is that we couldn't stay longer. We would love to go back again."

Beds are solid and comfortable. Kitchen had great cupboard space for our food and goods and generous amount of baking dishes, utensils and supplies. Floors are not level which was fine for our young family but it would be tricky for elderly or those who have balance struggles. Worked from the cottage one day and wifi worked great! Cable was a great bonus too! Loved cooking on the gas stove! Be patient, responses take longer than an hour.We'll definitely stay again!"

The house was clean, comfortable, and just as described in the listing. We had two littles staying with us, and it was so much easier to have them play and take naps in the house, as opposed to us renting multiple hotel rooms. The house had a pool table, Wii, and other games, providing plenty of entertainment during our down time. I would definitely recommend this rental during your next trip to Bemidji!"
2024-01-01,5.0,Group trip,"Lovely place with big private back yard.

2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We came to Bemidji for the Bantam B1 State tournament. Our banquet was at the Sanford Center, Les’s than a mile away.
I rented this perfect place to host team dinners. It worked out splendidly. The boys were able to eat and relax in the basement. We could not have asked for a better arrangement.
Jonathan and David communicated well with immediate responses.
I only wish it had been a little warmer and less snow so that we could have enjoyed the back yard. 🙂
The beds are so incredibly soft. There are fans in the rooms, which in my opinion are a must!
I would and likely will stay here again. Just might make the summer time trek."

House was big enough for 5 guys to spread out play some pool , or just relax a bit up or down stairs and watch some tv and veg. The price point was definitely cheaper than renting a couple of hotel rooms and a much more relaxing environment . I would rent again anytime I'm in the area . Great job guys and best of luck in the future."
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Great getaway, very comfortable home in a safe neighborhood."
2023-01-01,5.0,Group trip,"David and Jonathan's house met all of our expectations, we were very happy with it and would definitely stay there again. The house was well appointed and very clean. Two things to note, this house is not located in downtown Bemidji, it is located on the north side of the lake in an area called Nymore, near the BSU hockey arena. This is certainly not a problem, just a comment to know you would probably not want to walk to downtown or the BSU campus. Secondly, if you go in the winter, the downstairs bedroom with the bunkbeds is very chilly, I would recommend they provide a small plug in heater for this particular room (or bring your own if driving). Overall we had an excellent stay!"
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,We only stayed two nights but it was an excellent stay. Very quiet area and felt right at home. Would highly recommend to anyone looking to stay in the area.

2022-08-01,5.0,Group trip,"This house provided a great opportunity for three generations of our family to stay under one roof while in town for a wedding. The beds were super comfy and the kitchen had everything you would need for basic cooking including a good assortment of spices and basic baking supplies. Though we didn’t use them, the basement rooms are quite a bit cooler than the upstairs in the summer and anyone sleeping down there might want warmer than the usual summer PJs."

2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We stayed at the property for a weekend in mid April. Location for us what spot on as it was close to town and our family. It was also close to the local dog park and Lake Bemidji trails. The layout was ideal for our family to gather. The house was very clean and comfortable. Couch in the living room was spacious and comfortable. The beds were great too. The downstairs pool table and games were a huge hit for our niece and nephew. The kitchen is well stocked with plenty of room for cooking. The fact that the property is dog friendly with a fenced in back yard was a huge bonus (thank you!). We also could use the attached garage which came in very handy as it snowed while we were visiting. Communication with David and Jonathan was great. They were very fast to respond, friendly and helpful. Thank you-we hope to be back again!"

They were quick to get back with any questions!"
2021-12-01,5.0,Group trip,"This was a clean, spacious place for us to spend our holidays with our family in. Jonathan and David were very quick to respond to the few questions we had.
Our family loved the basement area with the pool table and large tv. The beds were comfortable and everything was as advertised or better. We have stayed in most hotels in Bemidji and this home was easily as comfortable and by far more friendly to our wallet. The 5 bedrooms easily fit my party of 6. We hope to stay here again."

2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We had a gymnastics competition to attend. Staying at Miles & Brenda’s home was just like “home!” It was easy to find - a wonderful location! There was a close grocery store and dollar general for anything that we needed. The home was so cozy with the fireplace, definitely my girl’s’ favorite part! We didn’t get to enjoy the river “much” as it was bitter cold out. However, the big windows/patio doors was a great way for us to enjoy the view!! It truly was a perfect place to “rest” in the midst of running for sports! Look forward to booking again! Thank You!!!"
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Miles & Brenda’s home is wonderful!! It is a beautiful place to stay and very comfortable. They welcomed my family and gave us great information when we arrived. Also, they communicated well throughout the whole experience. I would love to stay again some day!"

Thank you to our hosts for making our stay easy and enjoyable!

2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"What a great house in a great location. Miles and Brenda are so sweet, very friendly, and added so many thoughtful touches too. We needed a relaxing and comfortable space for our group and this was perfect. We will definitely be staying here again when in the Bemidji area. Everything about this place was relaxing and comfortable and Miles and Brenda couldn’t be any better hosts- they are a gem of a couple! Thank you for a fantastic weekend."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Our stay at Miles and Brenda’s was short and sweet. The home was well equipped with things you’d need. They even had kids toys, games and coloring supplies, a baby gate and booster chair for eating. My only recommendation would be a longer curtain on the window in the bunk-bed room for privacy reasons. Thank you!"

2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Great stay! Perfect for our weekend visit to Bemidji!!
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"The house was great! Very comfortable. We stayed over Christmas and New Year, and I was very pleased to see it was lightly decorated for the holidays. The remote controlled gas fireplace was icing on the cake!
During our stay, we saw a Bald Eagle in a tree on the bank of the river, and deer walked right by our windows. It was a beautiful winter wonderland.
I will say, as lovely as it was with snow on the ground, I can only imagine how absolutely incredible this place must be during warmer months when the river is accessible. We would love to come back during that time of year, because I imagine it would be a completely different experience.
Our hosts were very responsive, especially considering the time of year. We didn’t need a thing during our stay (8 days), as they had already stocked the house will everything we needed (including some snacks!), but the communication we did have was very friendly.
Miles and Brenda are excellent hosts and I wouldn’t hesitate to recommend them."

2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We had a wonderful time at Miles and Brenda’s home! It was clean and so comfortable! They had everything you you could want plus they had some extras that were a sweet nice touch! We were there for a wedding so we didn’t get to really take advantage of everything but two of people in our group beat the rain and went kayaking! Great place and we plan to rent it for a week next year to really enjoy it!

House was extremely clean and comfortable. Check in and out was a breeze. Miles and Brenda are amazing hosts and we could not have had a better experience."
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Miles and Brenda's river hideaway was a great place to experience Bemidji Minnesota and the headwaters of the Mississippi! We had our kids and they loved kayaking up the river, catching some frogs in the amazing yard and river edge, and swinging on the swingset. The house was great also, comfy and stocked with everything we needed and plenty of space. We played some games out on the deck.

2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"If we return to Bemidji we will rent it again and we will tell everyone we know they want to rent it as well if they go to Bemidji. We have rented several vacation homes this is the first time the owners have shown us around. The home was well taken care of, stocked, comfortable, and clean. Our favorite house feature was the wrap-around deck. We spent time there every morning and evening. We loved to have campfires nightly, the wood was provided by the owners. Our favorite property feature was the kayaks which we used every day. We liked the large yard and how private it was and yet it was less than ten minutes to shopping and restaurants. We really enjoyed our stay, it was a great relaxing vacation."
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This was a great place to stay at. We loved having use of the kayaks and canoes. The place was very nice and clean, and the location on the Mississippi river with access to nearby lakes was great! Miles and Brenda were very vice and responded quickly to a request we had while we were staying there. The price was also very good for the number of people it sleeps and the quality of the rental. I would very highly recommend this place to others."

2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"The house and surrounding area was absolutely gorgeous. It was very peaceful and very private. we loved the coziness of the house. The view out all of the windows and the deck are priceless and the wildlife is amazing. The gas fireplace was a plus as it was an extremely cold weekend. Miles greeted us and made us feel very welcome. They go out of their way to make their guest feel at home. We had an infant with us and they pointed out that there was a baby gate if needed, a pack and play and even toys. They had specific treats left for us and specialty coffees. The kitchen is fully stocked for cooking. We feel like they go above beyond making their guests feel comfortable and at home. This river retreat is a wonderful escape. we highly recommend it"
2021-12-01,5.0,Group trip,We really enjoyed our stay! The home was cutely decorated for Christmas which was a nice touch. The view out the backyard was beautiful and we even saw some deer!

2021-11-01,5.0,Group trip,Wonderful out of the way lake home. Surrounded by nature and just a few minutes to downtown Bemidji. Very roomy and comfortable for our family of 5. Miles & Brenda were easy to communicate with. Can't wait to visit again during the summer months and be able to kayak right off the dock.
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"What a great spot on the river! The house was very clean & nicely kept! We only wish the weather was a little warmer, we would have ventured out on the river with the kayaks provided. You might consider bringing your fishing gear, I caught a nice northern off the dock. The river runs between lakes too so access is awesome!"
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We had a wonderful stay! This was our favorite rental to date. Beautiful home and location and extremely hospitable hosts! Thank you so much for having us.

2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We stopped in Bemidji for a couple of days on a cross country trip and found this wonderful house. What a find! It is beautifully situated, clean, well appointed and spacious. Our hosts couldn't have been friendlier or more helpful. We saw either an otter or beaver swim by us as we were sitting on the dock around sunset! This is a rare gem of a house. Highly recommended.
Also of note is Bemidji's many miles of bike trails, one of the main things that drew us to the area."
,,,Spend the few extra dollars! Don’t stay here.
,,,We were unable to gain access to home with unclear instruction or directions to the which room was ours.
,,,"In the middle of our 10 day trip around Northern MN we decided to stay at state parks (with no running water or refrigeration) EXCEPT for this Airbnb to wash up and reset for the final leg of our tour. However, it ended up to be a terrible experience for the following reasons:
- The bathtub was painted and actively peeling, which meant we could not give our kids a bath safety. (And felt uneasily taking a shower with paint chips in our feet)
- There is a ~1 ""step"" up into the house and kitchen. Which posed a falling risk for our 1 year old (or anyone with mobility differences)
-The 2nd bedroom does not have a door and is right off the living room (via a stairwell), so it is bright and ""loud"" if you are talking when others are trying to sleep there.
- There are multiple places in the house that are a ""work in progress"". They are not painted or trim is missing.
- The child plug are missing in many outlets
- The location of the house is a bit tricky to find (and Google Maps doesn't get you there), so it would have been helpful to have the host preemptively send some information about finding it easier.
- The toilet seat that was replaced right before we arrived was not installed correctly, so we had to do it ourselves.
- The host said she would met us to ""check us in"" only to leave us waiting on the front deck and then text and say the door was open and the keys were inside.
- The host randomly stopped by to tell us to leave the keys on the table as we were trying to pack up our car and kids at check out time.
- When contacted by myself and Airbnb about our displeasure with our stay, Jill said she would ""take our complaints to heart and that they know it is not the perfect place for a family with small children"". However, this was never talked about in the listing.
- The host did not respond to Airbnb Support when trying to resolve these issues a second time through the Airbnb Resolution Center.
So, be warned! The house is not suitable for anyone children or mobility differences and wants to take a shower/bath. The host is not effective at communicating."
