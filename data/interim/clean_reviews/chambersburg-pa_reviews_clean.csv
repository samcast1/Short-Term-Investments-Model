2024-06-01,5,Group trip,Great place! Was perfect for our family and we were all very comfortable!
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Jay was very gracious about our check out. We had a hiker need to go to the ER and were even later than the missed deadline for checking out. I cannot thank Jay enough for being understanding of my miscue and the even further our extenuating circumstances. Thank you again Jay.

2023-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,Jay’s house was so perfect for our family. Very clean and cozy. Felt at home. The kitchen was amazing. Beds where comfortable too! We definitely would come back. Thank you so much for sharing your home with us.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,Jay's home in Chambersburg was lovely. We were in town for the Biglerville National Apple Festival. The home was spacious and clean. My nieces thoroughly enjoyed playing the piano. Would definitely stay again if I am ever in town!
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"We were very happy with our stay at the house. It was just as described and more, the kitchen would exceed anyone's expectations. It was wonderful to be able to make our own meals with the vast space and absolutely everything needed at hand's reach. We loved the privacy and easy access to our activities. The house is very comfortable, clean and feels like home, in a quiet neighborhood. The host kind and helpful. We would certainly book again. Thank you"
2023-09-01,5,Group trip,"My friends and I very much enjoyed our stay here! The living room is very nice to hang out in, the kitchen is very spacious, and the beds are comfortable. It truly felt like a home. There was nothing that we needed or wished we had that wasn't there. Jay was flexible and always quick to respond to questions, and gave detailed instructions of finding the place and other local highlights of the area. We appreciated our stay and would be happy to stay here again!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Welcoming atmosphere! The place was excellent, would recommend to anyone looking for a great place to stay! Recommendations for places to eat and things to do were helpful."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We all enjoyed our stay & were more than pleased with everything there. Being able to have a full kitchen to make some of our meals helped us with the cost of vacation & there was more than enough stocked. The home was very clean & comfortable. I’m always concerned with the mattress as I have back issues but no problem. We all slept very well. We were within a half hour of Gettysburg & had our privacy in the quiet, country setting. I would use Jay’s place again & highly recommend him to anyone!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,This home is very nice and spacious as well as very clean. It's out in the country but only minutes to lots of restaurants and shopping in downtown Chambersburg. Check out was super easy which makes this a real plus.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful place! Hosts were also very responsive and friendly. Would recommend this place to anyone.
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very clean. Wonderful beds. Nice trees in back. Private area.

2023-03-01,5,Group trip,This was a very lovely home. country feel not to far from anything. you can tell by the Garland and butterflys (in the bathroom ) alot of care goes into this home I WILL come back . very comfortable
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The flat was very clean, inviting, and had a ""felt like home"" vibe while we stayed 2 nights. Their instructions on how to get in and how to checkout were very understandable and sent in a timely manner. We had one little issue that they solved right away (ran out of TP lol) and were very helpful with all my questions up until and during our stay! As this being our first Airbnb experience, I'm glad we made the right choice going with them. Highly recommend them, and will definitely book again with them if needed. 😊"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,Such a great place! Highly recommend for the area. Very friendly and responsive. Would stay again.
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,Fantastic location and super clean.
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,Mane is a wonderful super host! The place had everything you need to enjoy. Great location!
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Clean, great location!"
2024-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Enjoyed our stay in this thoughtfully appointed apartment with a great location. Though you are right downtown, the apartment was amazingly quiet and parking was never a problem. Really appreciated the provided coffee (including sugar/sweetener and creamers). Plenty of outlets and lamps with USB ports, so that no one had to fight over charging devices and they were convenient to the beds. Would definitely stay here again on another trip to Chambersburg!"
2024-03-01,5,Group trip,"Mane was the perfect place for our girls weekend getaway! Clean, spacious, and walkable to many shops and great restaurants. Mane hosts were very friendly and responsive and made it so easy to feel right at home!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Nice space. Things in the area close relatively early. I.was in town for a conference so not a problem.
2024-01-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Such a cool place to stay! Great location, very clean and welcoming. Had everything we needed for a quick weekend getaway, but we could have stayed so much longer if it weren’t for work… ugh.
We will definitely be back to Chambersburg in the future, and this will definitely be top of our list when picking places."
2024-01-01,5,Group trip,"Beautiful apartment, easy instructions, no problems. Perfect vacation. Thanks, Mane!"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,We are definitely coming back here the next time we need a place in Chambersburg. Place was perfect for our needs and Mane was super responsive. The place looks like the pictures and was clean. I loved the walkability of the location.
2023-12-01,5,Stayed over a week,Great location. Great place to stay.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Location was great and the place was very nice.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay if you want a charming downtown Chambersburg experience! Highly recommend!
2023-09-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Wonderful stay, was on a work trip for a week and a half. Great location downtown, farmers market in the back Saturdays. Our fire alarm went off at 3 am one time, but thats the only eventful thing that happened. Would recommend."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,i loved it here !
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,The flat was absolutely beautiful inside. We came for a sports event for my daughter and this place was a perfect home away from home. The kitchen was my favorite part as we were able to cook ourselves a nice meal instead of going out to eat. Host was great! Highly recommend!
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"A caveat, although the place and location are great.
The smoke detector went off while we were making toast with the broiler in the oven. (There is no toaster) There was very little smoke but it still set it off. No one we called knew how to turn it off! Finally our son figured out the box in the hall with some advice from the manager, but only because he has electrical experience was he able to turn it off.
Still, it was a great place and owners very prompt with replies. The farmers market on Saturdays is right outside back door."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful Place. One of the nicest we've stayed in. You will enjoy your stay!
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"The 5 stars says it all. Great apartment, great location, everything was smooth from start to finish. My kids loved the bunk beds! One word of caution though to future guests using that room - there is an Exit sign that glows bright red, so anyone sleeping in that room had better bring a sleep mask (or enjoy the red glow)! But yes the place was pristine, would stay again."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Very nice home for location, design and comfort. Would defiantly recommend"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed over a week,I spent one month in Mane’s apartment and have not encountered any problem. It felt like home. Everything was very clean and beautifully arranged. The host was very helpful and was responding to my all my questions very quickly. Location is 10/10. The only problem I had was the sound of the central heater but I got used to it after some time. A lot of nice shops and restaurants around. Overall I had a very good experience and definitely recommend this place :)
2023-04-01,3,Stayed one night,Mane's Aibnb was so homey and inviting. This was truly a great space with easy access to downtown. Mane is very responsive and a great host!
2023-03-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"We had a great stay in this cute walk-up. Hosts were responsive and apartment was easy to access. There is free parking behind the apartment, which you can access by walking out the back door of the apartment and walking down a somewhat unstable wooden fire escape steps. There is also meter parking in front. Place was clean, sunlit, and comfortable. I was a little surprised to find that there is not a separate bed in the bedroom with the bunk bed, as the drawings for Bedroom 2 indicate a single bed and there is no photo of the third bed in that room. It is in fact a trundle bed that then occupies all the floor space in the bedroom - not bad, just different than indicated. The apartment is located adjacent to several restaurants and coffee shops, making it a practical and charming location. All in all, a nice place with fair pricing. Would recommend!"
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a fabulous stay at Manes! She was super kind and proactive. The place looked immaculate! When we had trouble trying to get Roku to work Mane was personable and so helpful to help get it to work. We had no complaints, just a fabulous time! I would 100% recommend this air b&b to anyone right away! 👌☺️"
2023-02-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Great location, walking distance to much of Chambersburg."
2023-01-01,5,Stayed one night,Fantastic stay! When we visited the town was still decorated for Christmas and it was stunning!!! Loved the flat we had and the convenance of all the restraints and entertainment.
2023-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,Cool little town and apartment. Great location with some coffee shops and places to eat and drink nearby. Apartment had a modern style that was super comfortable.
2022-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Perfect as always! Loved the Christmas decor. Really made the space.
2022-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great apartment and we were super sorry it was only for one night! Easy access, lots of space and fantastic location (great coffee bar right downstairs, as well as falefel shop, yum!!!) Appreciated the high quality shampoo/conditioner in the shower. Look forward to the opportunity to return!"
2022-09-01,5,Group trip,The place was very clean.
2022-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great place. So convenient and quiet yet right in downtown Chambersburg. Love the convenience to restaurants and shops. Host was accessible , available and quick to respond. Flat was beautifully decorated and spotless. An A-1 space! Would highly recommend!"

2022-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,We had a wonderful stay! The place was clean and beautiful. Our twins loved the bunk room and trundle bed. Great communication with host and easy check in.

2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful and convenient spot. Well appointed and clean. A great place to unwind at the end of the day.
2022-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"Hands down my favorite Airbnb that I have ever stayed in! Incredibly clean, a well-stocked kitchen, and a great location! Already planning a trip back to stay here again!"
2022-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Mane was a wonderful host! We had some logistical issues that she was able to accommodate - it was great to be able to communicate with her! The place was very clean, updated, and in a beautiful location. Close to coffee shop, local stores, and a beautiful park behind the place. I’d absolutely recommend!"
2022-08-01,5,Stayed one night,Lovely stay!
2022-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Great place to stay with a family! There’s even a pack n play if needed. The accommodations are clean and in a great location.
Parking wasn’t an issue and the coffee shop and brewery (liquid art) are fantastic. We’d stay again!"

2022-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"What a beautiful space to spend in downtown Chambersburg. Beds were comfortable, showers were hot and your steps away from coffee shops and shopping. Very convenient! We had trouble finding a parking spot since the main roads were blocked for Old Market Day. Mane was quick to respond to help us find a place to park. Definitely would stay here again!"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Wonderful, clean, super modern apartment in the center of town. Walking distance to lots of great food. Freshly renovated and nicely decorated. Hosts were super responsive to any questions and we loved our stay!"

2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"A beautiful and quiet place to rest, always a pleasure to stay with Jay"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"A perfect place for a quick overnight stay. Close to Shippensburg University was key! Thanks, will remember this one in the future!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The place was extremely private and quiet. Very clean and modern, and a fantastic value. Overall it was a fantastic stay that my girlfriend and I will remember if we return, thanks Jay!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very cozy and clean! Thank you for such a nice stay (:
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"What I appreciated the most about Jay's place was the relaxation element. Between the comfortable accommodations, the plentiful and thoughtful amenities, and especially the kitchenette area, I was wanting for nothing. Having a room separate from the bedroom is great if someone needs to sleep while the other person doesn't."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Excellent place, quiet and clean. I recommend it 100%"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,.
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great, see you just like last time! It was clean, quiet, I felt like home, and I didn’t feel like we had to walk on eggshells. You’ll always have our business when we come in town. Thanks again. ￼"
2024-03-01,4,Stayed one night,"The apartment is small but clean. Could use some sprucing up, but nice enough for the price."
2024-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"I had a little trouble finding the place but Jay was very responsive.
I do recommend you read the instructions he gives to find the place before you arrive (which I did not do, hence the trouble I had).
It was a super quiet place and very restful. I'll stay there again next time I'm going that way."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"Peaceful area, definitely booking again next time I’m passing by"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed one night,We would stay here again. Very quiet and cozy.
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,yes
2023-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"Jay gives very clear instructions, easy to get in and out. Highly recommend if you need a cozy, clean place to stay. Thanks so much!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"Jay was a wonderful host and a great communicator. It was a pleasant place to stay during my time in town. Great recommendations and located in a nice, excluded area!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Will be going back for sure, very peaceful. Love being there."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I've stayed at Jay's several times. Never had a bad experience. His place is clean, quiet, and comfortable. It has all the amenities necessary for a restful and comfortable lodging, whether for work (my situation) or travel. Jay communicates quickly and clearly, and check-in is easy. I highly recommend it."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Nice stay, very comfy. The extra snacks were the perfect addition for my 3 year old!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I stayed at Jay’s place for 5 nights as I was in town for training. This place was perfect for me. It was quiet and peaceful, the bed was comfortable and the shower was decent. For me, it was better than staying at a hotel . I am thankful my wife found this gem of a place."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"Very communicative and responsive and flexible. Peaceful, quiet location."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"5 stars all the way!!!!!! Be sure to follow Jay's direction very carefully!
Had a blessed stay!! Great Host. ! Thanks, Bill"
2023-08-01,4,Stayed one night,"My wife and I had a quick over night stay at this location. Overall it went well, however if you arrive to the location at night (while the sun is down) you will need to call to get directions which the host Jay is ready and available to make your stay comfortable. Last I believe the place should have a tv to make it more comfortable."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,Second time staying here and very happy with the stay. Perfect place to stop on our way to Ohio. Thank you!
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,Passing through the town on a long drive - was a great stay to get some shut eye!
2023-07-01,3,Stayed a few nights,We thought it was very accessible and there was a lot of peace and quiet.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"I had to go to Chambersburg on a two-day business trip. I drove three hours to get there and went straight to work. I was on my feet all day in a hot, dirty, loud warehouse for my research.
It took me a bit to find Jay's place until I realized his directions were from the direction of Chambersburg. I had arrived from the opposite direction. His warning not to use the paved driveway, but the gravel one next door, was my clue.
Jay's place was an oasis of cool, comfortable peace where—after a luxurious shower—I was able to slow down and relax.
My only suggestion would be to post instructions on the wall of the galley kitchen on how to use the Kuerig for the few of us who have never owned one. It took me a few tries to get the proper sequence down. Having water bottles in the fridge was a nice touch.
I need to make another trip out to finish my research and I will definitely try to stay at Jay's!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Always a great stay at Jay’s. Beautiful surroundings, peaceful and safe. Great home, clean and spacious for price."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We travel to Chambersburg to visit my mother a couple of times each year. This will be our first choice from now on.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"very nice place, easy to find close to the things i needed. would stay again!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Stayed here for a week. Wonderful, peaceful location. Close to shops and restaurants but far from hustle bustle. My stay was comfortable.
It may be helpful to arrive well before the sunset because it may be hard to find the place. Request the host to provide the GPS coordinates which will bring you right up to the rental. Directions were good too.
Bugs are an issue as mentioned. Keep the doors closed all the time. A bug swatter may be necessary.
Kitchenette is small and does not have any utensils or stove top to cook meals. There is no washbasin in the kitchen. Microwave utensils were also only a few. Plan accordingly if you plan to cook. Microwave, Keurig, Toaster were there and worked fine.
Window AC is in the living room. When I visited, outside temperature maximum was around 85 F. The AC could cool the bedroom ok but not really cool. Not sure if the bedroom can be cooled when the temperature is very high.
Internet was fast and reliable. Gravel drive way parking was convenient."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Jay is a gracious host and his place is spacious and cozy! We have stayed there before - this was our second time! Will definitely come back again if we are in the area!
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great place to stay again! Ate breakfast at Hickory Ridge Restaurant twice for breakfast and it was excellent food, service, and price!!!"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,A great place to stay. I hope to stay at 1 of Jay's places next year.
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay! Very quiet!
2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,Very nice for the price.
2023-01-01,5,Stayed one night,This place was spotlessly clean! The bed was very comfortable. We enjoyed the quiet place to relax.
2022-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great place, highly recommend"
2022-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"Jay had excellent communication, complete with pictures of how to find it. Despite that, it was hard for me, who is directionally impaired, to find it at night. There is absolutely nothing he could have done to make it more clear. He gave me pictures and even an overhead map. It had been a long day with a delayed flight. It was such a great thing to find I was staying in a nice secluded place with such a welcoming atmosphere and cozy bed. Everything was nice and clean. I highly recommend Jay's place."
2022-12-01,5,Stayed one night,Jay spot is perfect for a quick landing
2022-12-01,5,Stayed one night,it was perfect for our overnight stay as we were passing by.

Just what we needed"
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very comfortable and relaxing place. Cleanliness was also great! Thanks Jay!
2022-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,Great stay. Very clean and about 40 minutes from Gettysburg. Easy drive.
2022-11-01,3,Stayed a few nights,"My siblings and I overall enjoyed our stay here. But we were disappointed that the place was not exactly as advertised in the pictures. The pictures advertise two couches, when we arrived, there was only one. We had planned to sleep on the two couches and bed. It was also disappointing that our flight was delayed and we were not able to stay at the Airbnb the first night, and the host showed no interest in even a partial refund. Other than that though, the place was clean and cozy. It was a lovely, inexpensive place to stay for a weekend trip. The host is very responsive and helpful with directions."
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Everything was great - communication, check-in, clean, as advertised, and location. I will stay again, and recommend."
2022-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Very, very clean! It’s a basic place, no frills but it was just what we needed when we were passing through. I was afraid I would get lost getting there, but Jay gave great directions! It was convenient to be able to adjust the thermostat too. Great stay"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Jay's place was clean and conveniently located. I recommend.
2022-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"Another wonderful stay. Peaceful, private surroundings. Beautiful accommodations, comfortable bed for a guaranteed peaceful sleep."
2022-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"If you need a cute clean affordable place to stay during your central PA travels, check this place out!"
2022-09-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Yet again another great stay and flexible check in and out!
2022-09-01,2,Stayed a few nights,"Jay did a great job accommodating and working with me pre-booking and during my first 24 hours of stay. However, there were too many bugs that found their way into the home. Crickets and caterpillars mainly. Every time the door would open they would run in and even if none came through when getting in and out of the home they found a way in while I was away. There was a caterpillar on the roof and bathroom, crickets that came from the kitchenette area, and one in the drain of the shower. Constantly having to turn and kill bugs during my stay. When communicating with Jay his response didn't help resolve or seek to resolve the problem of whether he could control it or not. Wouldn't stay here again"
2022-09-01,5,Stayed one night,Such an adorable place to stay! Very spacious. Definitely has a home like atmosphere!

2022-08-01,4,Stayed one night,"This charming little nook is surprisingly close to town yet secluded, quiet and clean. A great respite for the weary traveler."
2022-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"Space was as advertised! It's a little tricky to get there, but Jay gives good instructions. WiFi is available but was a bit spotty on one of our computers. Living room ceiling gives off a bit of an office vibe with office ceiling tiles and fluorescent lights, but bed was comfy and the space was what we needed on short notice.
Very good host, and a high-quality stay for value-minded travelers."
2022-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"Jay's little place was just as promised quiet, clean and comfortable yet close to town. The air conditioning was especially appreciated after a long, hot drive. I would definitely stay again."

The apartment was fine for our needs. It’s not special and though it is clean it has some rough edges here and there. The lighting in the main area is very bright and there’s no way to turn it down so it’s either too bright or completely dark.
The bed is comfortable enough and it was a convenient stop for us."

He allowed us to bring our air fryer to make some food, although we forgot to bring it anyway lol. He is very fast at communicating with you, and recommended a place for breakfast which I believe has the ultimate best sausage gravy ever ever ever !!! The space was very quiet and comfortable. I brought a small fan with me and That helped me sleep better. Awesome awesome place !!"

2021-06-01,4,Stayed one night,"Easy on-off of 81 if you're heading up or down the highway. It's self check-in which is nice and fairly private. There are some restaurants around if you need to grab something.

2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Stayed here during a work trip. Jay provided excellent directions and a map, as the house is tucked away. It was so much closer to town than I expected and there is a Dollar General right down the street as well. Parking was right outside. There was a little welcome gift, which was much appreciated. Super clean and lots of soft cozy blankets too!
The fridge didn’t seem to be hooked up to water, so be sure to bring some along."

The ""kitchen"" has everything we needed, including microwave, extra linens, silverware and dishes, except a sink. We carefully used the bathroom sink when we needed to wash up from a meal. The living area was comfortable, and my son slept on the couch and said it was great. The bed in the bedroom was super comfy as well. Very happy!"

2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Very quiet area, clean and organized!"
2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This find is in plain sight but tucked away. If you book, you’ll get precise directions to ensure you do not get lost. It was enjoyable to see the cozy side of Chambersburg instead of the chain restaurant business side of things."
2021-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Nice, cozy place to crash for a night. I didn't realize that it doesn't have a kitchen, a little inconvenient for us considering I needed to prepare food for my toddler. But other than that, a good place to rest. Jay also gave good instruction to the place, and there's some treats to welcome us."

Best for two people!
Host was responsive and provided me with a fan upon request!"
2020-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I rented this place first is its good price and it is close to Gettysburg, also I wanted some fresh air in Pennsylvania's countryside. The location is just outside of Chambersburg and convenient to shopping and everything you may need. The house is clean as described as in Airbnb ad. Jay is super nice. I needed a small desk table so I can work with my laptop. Jay found one and immediately put it ouside of the house.
I went to Keystone Urgent Care nearby and did a COVID_19 test so my family members won't worry about my trip. The staff there are very nice and the test result cm two days later right before I was heading home.
I went to Gettysburg from this rental (about 45 minutes driving). As a fellow Pennsylvanian, I have never been in Gettysburg before where one of the most events in U.S. history happened. During this difficult time, my visit to Gettysburg taught me a lot. I hope our country is united and stands strong forever."
2020-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great place to stay everytime. A nice, clean space with nice touches that make you feel at home. This is my go-to place when I'm in town for work! Jay responds in a timely manner, is very kind and makes sure you have everything you need."

2020-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Very cute space! It was very clean, spacious, had nice touches that made you feel at home. Private entrance, code entry, self check-in.

Thermostat for the baseboard heat in bathroom, bedroom and living space. I would definitely stay here again!!"

2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,I love staying at Sharon‘s place! The history of the cabin combined with the beautiful updates made for a wonderful stay.

We will definitely be staying here again!"

It was very clean, comfortable and authentic feeling. Waking up to the sound of the babbling creek was a peaceful and pleasant bonus. Sharon was an excellent host with her proactive communication. She made sure that we were comfortable and that everything was perfect. Highly recommend Sharon and her place to anyone and everyone!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is a lovely place to stay if you find yourself in the area. The hosts thought of everything! Every detail is covered - the listing is exactly as advertised and with the amenities listed (plus some additional special touches).
The town does tend to shut down a little early so plan accordingly. We were able to enjoy a later dinner at Bistro 71 (very short walk) without reservations we managed to sneak into a spot at the bar. We also had a visit to the GearHouse brewery which is nearby.
The cabin is about a 30 or 40 minute easy drive into Gettysburg if you want to hop over for some history or cute shops.
We were so very pleased with our choice and could not speak highly enough of the convenience of everything! Wonderful experience! Will definitely recommend it to others!"

2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Sharon’s listing was fabulous! It was cleaned and cozy when we arrived from Charlotte! The location was awesome, I was able to walk and meet old friends at different downtown establishments without a problem. I loved hearing the creek at night, it made it so easy to fall asleep! Will definitely rent again if available when we return to Chambersburg. Thanks Sharon!!!"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"A wonderful location in a wonderful town! Sharon was super helpful, even at the last minute booking I had! One of my favorite locations I’ve stayed in!"

2023-11-01,5,Stayed about a week,Very unique location and well kept townhome. Close to everything downtown and easy to get to. Old style residents with current amenities and great remodeling work. one of a kind deck in middle of small town as if living in your own little city park.

2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This little cottage right on the creek in Chambersburg was the perfect setting for a stay while being a bridesmaid in a wedding. The running water sound outside was so peaceful. I just wanted to sit on the little deck all day and listen to the water. The place was updated, clean, and so cozy. Sharon was super proactive with helpful check-in instructions that made the place so easy to find. Loved my STAY!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We loved our stay. It was very clean. The space in the bathroom was great. A really fun place to stay. We hope to come back.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,Very unique and well done interior and gorgeous exterior. Scenic walk is literally a few feet away.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"A beautiful place to stay in Chambersburg. It felt like a home away from home, with a beautiful patio overlooking the creek. Comfortable bed and space. Even though it’s right next to the road, it still felt very quiet and private. Very walkable to many great places in the town."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed about a week,"I stayed here a week while I did some work in PA, this place is amazing. My favorite thing was the view from the bedroom patio, the creek made this place feel so peaceful. Felt very comfortable at my stay. Highly recommend booking this Airbnb."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Creekside in Chambersburg was an oasis inside an urban setting. Downtown Chambersburg is is just short block away where you will find wonderful restaurants (Falafel Shack...homemade pita and hummus, terrific salads and don't forget Demin Coffee and Olympic Candy Kitchen). But if you even decide to never leave the Airbnb...you won't be disappointed!!! Right outside the front door you are welcomed with cascading waterfalls. The unit is two stories and you can step outside the bedroom onto the balcony/deck under a tree canopy to drink your morning coffee. Inside you will find everything you need for a night or longer get away. A fully equipped kitchen if you want to prepare your own meals, a cozy sitting area with a flat screen TV. Beautifully appointed antiques and artwork on the walls. Upstairs is the bedroom with comfortable bedding and crisp white linens. The bathroom has a luxurious marble shower. You will feel like you are in a five star resort!!! Looking forward to returning."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Sharon’s place and service was impeccable, we loved every second of our stay. The creek and water was so peaceful. We also found a hidden gift card Sharon hid for fun!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"My wife and I have been going to Chambersburg 3-4 times a year since 2014 and we have never experienced it the way we did when staying at King Street. The first thing we noticed upon arrival was the sound of the Conococheague Creek which presented a calming presence. The home, itself, is nestled in history as it sits on the same land Fort Chambersburg once did prior to its burning. Plaques and monuments surrounded us engulfing us in the Civil War history that is rich in Chambersburg. The walking distance to a myriad of attractions forced us to explore a town we typically drive through and the local establishments, specifically Brussels Cafe, with their charm are very welcoming. The hosts we phenomenal and very communicative. I am glad to say we've have found our ""home away from home."""
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,lovely quaint cottage in Chambersburg within walking distance to many restaurants.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This place is a hidden gem tucked in along a beautiful creek which offers a peaceful retreat right in town. So many places to walk to and steps from the rail trail. It really is the best of both worlds. The cottage was spotless and well maintained. My husband and I stayed over my birthday and were greeted by a sweet note and a beautiful bouquet of flowers. We highly recommend staying here.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed over a week,"I stayed in this spectacular, historic house just off Main St in Chambersburg for 2 weeks. There was not one single thing I needed that wasn’t already in the house. It is small, cozy, charming and stocked with everything you need. Perfect location for walking along bike trail or to various restaurants in downtown Chambersburg. Beautiful deck (with an outdoor recliner chair!) overlooking a creek. This place could not be more prefect. I can’t think of an AirBnB that I have enjoyed more."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Stayed for the weekend and it was absolutely wonderful! The pictures truly didn’t do the place justice. There is a river outside of the place that sounds like a waterfall and plenty of outdoor seating at the place to enjoy the sound. The house was clean and fully stocked with any essentials that might be needed. The host was absolutely wonderful and we were greeted with a note and some macaroons. There was also a book of recommendations for things to do in the area which was extremely helpful. The area is super cute and has a nice small town feel. It was really nice having all the local coffee shops within walking distance as well. Everything just felt very homey and had a peaceful cabin feel to it right in the middle of town!
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Sharon and Kevin were amazing hosts! Creekside on King is in the PERFECT location for a stay in Chambersburg!
Their beautiful home is surrounded by nature but right in the middle of town. The upper deck had an amazing view of the creek and we loved being able to step outside to the sound of the water streaming over the rocks! A quick walk to great local shopping, restaurants, and cafes. Saturday morning the local farmers market was just outside of the property, which was a great surprise!
Creekside on King was more than just a place to stay - it was an incredible experience! The hosts haven’t overlooked a single detail. Our stay was full of little surprises and we can’t wait to stay again!
Overall, my best Airbnb experience ever!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We couldn't have been happier with our stay. It was the perfect peaceful hideaway to celebrate our 14th anniversary for a couple of nights (along with our 5 mo old twins!). A restful setting for being in town, with walking trails, small falls & a water wheel nearby. There's plenty of restaurants & cute shops close - our vehicle stayed parked the whole time as we walked everywhere we wanted to go!
We loved the rushing, falling stream flowing just feet from the front door, and eating out on the upstairs deck that overlooks the creek.
The house was beautiful, and so very clean (that means a lot to us - I'm a bit meticulous when it comes to cleaning, and most places we stay I notice some dirt..but not here! :)
We hadn't noticed from the listing that there's a spiral stairs to the bedroom. It wasn't an issue, but some may appreciate knowing that. The outside stairs made bringing our luggage in easy.
Thanks so much, Kevin & Sharon for creating this beautiful retreat, and sharing it with us!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"While private, Creekside was also close to town. We especially liked the Falafel Shack--which is not a shack! My partner runs every morning, and enjoyed running the creek trail as well as around Wilson College."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"An exceptional AirBnB experience! Outstanding care and consideration for guests: clear instructions and quick communication, pristine cleaning, lovely accommodation, greeted with a handwritten note. Impeccable craftsmanship and design went into the cabin and it is a stunningly beautiful and cozy place to spend the night. I cannot say enough good things. This is one of the best Airbnb experiences we have had and look forward to returning. Many thanks to and much appreciation for Sharon and Kevin."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My husband and I stay at airbnb's often when travelling. Sharon's space was one of the best we have ever stayed at! It was spotless, tastefully and comfortably decorated and well appointed. Parking was close and entry into the home was very easy. Sharon thought of everything that a traveler might need/want. We were greeted with a lovely card and cookies, and there was water in the fridge. We loved the historic building and listening to the creek outside. Many restaurants and shops were within walking distance. We also appreciated the recommendations for local attractions. We hope to visit again sometime!"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Sharon is a wonderful host and she goes above and beyond to make her guests feel welcome and taken care of. Creekside is a great spot, with beautiful surroundings, lovely cafes within walking distance, and it’s easy to get to. I would recommend this place to anyone visiting Chambersburg."

The town was so quaint and had such a small town feel. We had a great, relaxing stay and we hope to be back soon!"
2022-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"Loved the place and the location. It was beautiful and had brand new items. I could walk to the local restaurants, stores and brewery. The bed was super comfy. Linens were top notch and kitchen had everything.
I will be back with my hubby. Would love to see a single pull out on the first floor so we could bring our son but other than that this was one of the best air b n b’s I’ve stayed in.
I highly recommend."
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I can't express how perfect this place was us for the Christmas holidays! it was an excellent location downtown and walking distance to all the restaurants.

Definitely and excellent host and highly recommended!"
2024-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was the perfect venue for my daughter’s baby shower. Even though it’s relatively close to our home, it provided a little getaway and a great place for our out-of-town guests to stay. The event room had plenty of seating and the kitchen was amazing! Heidi was a very accommodating and very responsive! If you’re considering a small to medium sized event, this is a perfect place!"

2024-02-01,5,Group trip,"I Just want to start off by saying how absolutely beautiful this farmhouse is. It exceeded all of our expectations. The location was perfect for our small, intimate wedding. The house was super clean and the decor was adorable. Heidi was super helpful when we had questions and was a wonderful host! Can not recommend this place enough!"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We enjoyed our stay at Heidi's house! The location is great for feeling like you are out in the country while still being close to town. The bedrooms are spacious and the beds are comfortable. The large event space was perfect for playing board games. Heidi was very helpful and responsive to any questions that we had. We would stay here again!

We are a scrapbooking group
Perfect spacious"
2024-01-01,5,Group trip,"The Homestead is hands down the most beautiful property I’ve been to and stayed at. Talk about modern meets historical. This farm house has so much charm and character. Not to mention it was the perfect spot to host a surprise birthday party for my boyfriend. I feel truly lucky to have found Heidi’s place as it was close to friends and family and was set up perfectly to host our gathering. Heidi was so responsive and accommodating which lifted a weight off of my stressed shoulders. I would highly recommend booking for your next family gathering, vacation or whatever your needs may be!"
2023-12-01,5,Group trip,The Homestead provided comfortable accommodations and a great space for our family holiday gathering. The meeting room is a perfect space for meals and playing games. We enjoyed our stay and the amenities provided.
2023-12-01,5,Group trip,"What a lovely, cozy (yet spacious) location! It was perfect for our weekend creativity retreat. We enjoyed the privacy and peacefulness of the agricultural community and the house was warm and welcoming. We truly felt right at home when we arrived. The beds are very comfortable and the multiple baths made it even more accessible as a host site. The attached spacious meeting room was exactly what we needed to spread out and work on our art projects.
The kitchen is well equipped and the thermostat kept at a very comfy temp. The house is clean and clutter-free and beautifully decorated.
Heidi is an amazing host. She is extremely proactive and communicative. As an example, we had trouble operating the dishwasher and messaged her. She instantly responded and asked if she could stop by after work to make sure everything was ok. After a quick pop in, everything was working perfectly.
We will definitely stay here again. Highly recommend."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Beautiful spot in the countryside, hosted Thanksgiving here, and had more than enough room for a large group."

2023-10-01,5,Group trip,"Beautiful setting, peaceful. Roomy house."
2023-10-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"The Homestead House is located in a peaceful neighborhood, close to I-81 & Chambersburg. Heidi is an exceptional host- kind & responsive. The office is private & comfortable with excellent WiFi. There is plentiful hot water & good water pressure. We only used 3 of the 4 bedrooms. The downstairs bed & upstairs king beds were very comfortable. One queen bed upstairs was quite soft not as comfortable. This is an historic farmhouse with all the charm, character, & quirks that go with it – Helpful hints: Information about the house & area is posted on the side of the fridge; the downstairs toilet may need to be watched to be sure it flushes completely; the single bed listed is in the queen bedroom upstairs in the “pull out” chair. This is a huge house. It looked like the substitute house cleaner may have missed cleaning a few areas prior to our visit. Our family was grateful to be able to use Heidi’s Homestead House for a gathering place after my Father-in-law’s funeral. Thank you!"
2023-10-01,5,Group trip,"This was our second time staying here and it didn’t disappoint either time.
The large party room was a lovely place to hold our daughters baby shower with Heidi’s approval. Everyone commented on what a beautiful home it is. We will definitely stay here again when we have a need to be in the area visiting our daughter."
2023-10-01,5,Group trip,Very nice place! We loved our stay.
2023-10-01,5,Group trip,"Beautiful home! We loved the decor. It was very comfortable and relaxing. The kitchen had everything that we needed. Lovely setting in the country. Too bad that it was rainy while we were there or we would have enjoyed spending time on the patio and in the yard.
This would be a great spot for a family, family reunion or girls' getaway. We used it for a leaders' retreat for our ministry. The large meeting room was perfect for us -- roomy but not huge or cold like most places are. We were able to learn and relax.
Heidi was great to work with. She responded to my questions very quickly."
2023-09-01,5,Group trip,Heidi’s place was beautiful and perfect for the morning of my wedding! She was so kind and flexible with us for check in/check out. Highly recommend!
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Heidi is an excellent host who went far above and beyond any expectation’s. She is very accommodating and was available anytime for any question’s or needs that we had.
I would most definitely recommend her place to anyone looking for a nice place to get away to while it is still close to anything you may need/want.
The house and property is very picturesque and made for a perfect location for my daughter’s wedding!"
2023-09-01,5,Group trip,Heidi is a very GRACIOUS HOST and I will DEFINITELY rent her FARM again
2023-09-01,5,Group trip,My wife and I have been renting houses for about 4 years now but their usually in Philadelphia and for this to be the First time we have rented in Chambersburg were we live (which it was not far from were we live) it was Awesome the house was beautiful and so was the surroundings(it even had a beautiful barn beside it) we rented it for our Grandson's 8th Birthday for him and his friends had a ball we loved it so much that we're trying to come back Thank you so much Ms Heidi

2023-07-01,5,Group trip,"Heidi’s farmhouse is stunning! I used her home as a wedding weekend stay for my bridesmaids and I to get ready at on the morning of my wedding. The beautiful den and large gathering room made for beautiful photo-op areas. The location is peaceful and quiet, and an easy 10 min drive into Chambersburg. Heidi was super helpful and responded quickly to all of my questions! Definitely recommend staying here!"
2023-06-01,5,Group trip,"Our family of 9 had a wonderful stay at Heidi’s place while in the area for my sons wedding. We had plenty of space, everyone slept comfortably and it was a peaceful place to come home to each evening. The feature that clinched our original booking was the amazing dining room that has 4 king farm tables seating 8- 10 people each. Family meals together is important to me and this arrangement was even better than what I have at home. I will also add that in a last minute decision my husband and I wanted to host our out of town guests for breakfast on our last day. With Heidi’s permission we hosted around 24 people for a wonderful brunch with ample space. Each of our guests were “wowed” by the space and seating in the great room. I would without hesitation use this air bnb again because of the space as well as Heidi’s exceptional demeanor."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,Heidi was very responsive and her farmhouse was splendid ... spacious and comfortable ...
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"We really enjoyed our stay at Heidi’s place. It was so relaxing and welcoming. Great accommodations in a comfortable and clean setting. Heidi was awesome to work with. She was prompt, helpful and so kind. I would highly recommend!!!"
2023-06-01,5,Group trip,I would highly recommend staying. The place is immaculate and so easy to find. I love the farmhouse feel.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,This place was great for our large family. We are a family of 6 plus traveling with grandparents to a local graduation. It was great to all stay in one place without having to get 3 hotel rooms! So much space! The decor was great and beds and linens were so soft. We wish we could have stayed longer. We will be staying again next time we are in visiting.
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We had an amazing time. Really special weekend and Heidi's place was a huge component. She was super quick to respond to anything we needed and a really wonderful host. Would def come back!
2023-05-01,5,Group trip,Heidi's place was perfect for our stay. The farm house is very spacious and feels like home. The large dining space was great and we enjoyed the fire pit for an evening fire.
2023-05-01,5,Group trip,Our out of town wedding guests for our son’s wedding really enjoyed their stay. All said they would enjoy coming back for an extended stay in the future. Heidi was very responsive and we really appreciated her flexibility with check in time.

2023-05-01,5,Group trip,Great space for a get-together! 😊
2023-05-01,5,Group trip,Travelling through the area with a group of 8. Heidi’s place is just a short drive of I81 making it super convenient for an overnight. Lots of room and comfy beds. Great stay.
2023-05-01,5,Group trip,"Beautiful pastoral setting for this well-appointed and well-maintained country farmhouse. Spacious and well stocked kitchen, great dining area and very comfortable living room. We were super impressed at how clean everything was. Would highly recommend this property for anyone wanting a country getaway and would definitely stay at this property again. Thank you, Heidi!"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Our stay at the farmhouse was comfortable, exactly as pictured, and suited all of our needs perfectly. This was a great place for some of our family to stay for the weekend."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,great communication with host and home was exactly as pics and description stated.
2023-04-01,5,Group trip,Heidi was a great host! She was very responsive to our needs and rented to us on short notice. Pictures of the property are very accurate. My family and I were traveling through the area on our way south for vacation and the property was conveniently located right off of I-81. Property was perfect for a larger family. Thank you Heidi!
2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"We used this house for my sister-in-law’s bridal shower and it was absolutely perfect! A complete steal if you ask me. So much cheaper than any venue you’ll find. The “event space” was the perfect amount of room. We had 24 ladies and it didn’t feel cramped at all. The natural lighting from all the windows was beautiful. The kitchen was fully stocked with everything we needed. The house smelled so good the second we walked in. It was so spacious and beautiful. We wish we could’ve stayed longer! Heidi was so helpful and accommodating with the time frame we needed the house for. Heidi also has great taste in furniture and decor. Trendy, rustic, boho farm vibes. We loved it!"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Heidi's home was beautifully decorated and very comfortable. The unique historic touches were so nice. It was a spacious home with good lighting, comfortable beds and bedding, a beautiful kitchen and plenty of area to eat. It was perfect for our group. If we make it back to Chambersburg, we would love to stay there again. Heidi was a wonderful host! She responded quickly and was very helpful. She recommended Mr. Ed's Candy Shop and Elephant Museum. We stopped there and it was well worth it. An interesting place with good candy, fudge, and Ed's amazing elephant collection! The kids loved it. Thanks for making our stay so pleasant, Heidi!"
2023-03-01,5,Group trip,We love the gorgeous house. It’s super clean and big. Highly recommended.!
2023-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,Great classic PA farm house. Great for our family get together. Huge dinning room for meals and games.
2023-03-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Very nice and clean house, it has everything you need for a long stay.
Perfect communication with Heidi."
2023-02-01,5,Group trip,Heidi was a great host and the property was beautiful and clean. It was very spacious with good WiFi. 10/10 would book again!
2023-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"I don’t want to say too much because I’d like this place to remain a secret. It was a perfect weekend in this beautiful farmhouse. There was a very well-stocked kitchen, comfortable beds, charming decor and ample parking. We held a small gathering for a friend’s 60th birthday. Our sister-in-law is using the property for her out-of-town guests for her son’s wedding in May. It really is the most perfect location/house/host. Thank you for everything! We will be back."
2023-01-01,5,Group trip,This place was beautiful and very modern with a hint of farmhouse! Plenty of space on the inside and outside. My friends and I really enjoyed this place. I would definitely stay again.
2023-01-01,5,Group trip,"The place was very well maintained, we could clearly see that the owner prepared and maintained the place very well. The place was clean and we felt like home. We will definitely stay again when we visit the Liberty Mountain."
2023-01-01,5,Group trip,Super peaceful and quiet. Lots of room to spread out and relax. Great for a multiple couple gaming getaway! Second stay here and will be back again!
2023-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This place is absolutely wonderful! They thought of everything. They were very responsive, accomodating and helpful. We would definitely start here again."
2022-12-01,3,Group trip,"Heidi responded quickly to any issues that developed. We received fair financial compensation (one free night) for issues including a furnace problem. The home is roomy and comfortable. There are issues to note when considering a stay. The kitchen had not been cleaned well (dust covering the knives and knife block, a coffee pot which had not been cleaned after last use, for example). None of the second-floor doors lock, including the bathroom. The listing states that there are five beds. In the “Where you’ll sleep” section, bedroom 4 lists a queen bed and a single bed. The photo shows this also. The single bed/mattress was nowhere to be found. One of our group members had canceled, otherwise, we would have needed that bed."
2022-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This airbnb was ideal for our family Christmas get together. The large open area had table seating for everyone. The beds were comfortable for the guests that stayed overnight.
Heidi was wonderful to work with."
2022-12-01,5,Group trip,"Heidi’s house is charming…a lovely place to relax and rejuvenate. I’m local, so I might just rent it for a day— go over and read a book all by myself🤣😂."
2022-12-01,4,Stayed with kids,Place was as described for the most part. Great place for our big family as we attended an event in Chambersburg. Heidi was very helpful and had good communication. The only complaint would be that the fridge was dirty and had some left overs/used food.
2022-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"Don’t hesitate this is a great place! I hosted my birthday party here with 15 people and it was a great place which my friends and I absolutely loved! We drove to the house around 9:00 pm and honestly at night the place place outside looks so creepy and we were all really scared because the house ate every spread apart. We used flashlights to see where to go in the front of the house and we were a little hesitant but as soon as we opened the door we were so glad. The place was clean and looked fancy and it looked very different from what we expected. The rooms are big, and my fav area was definitely the dining room that had 4 big tables that my fitness and I spent the most time at. It’s a really big area. Heidi was a really great host she responded fairly quickly and wanted to make sure we had a good time. I think the only down side of this place is the bedroom locks don’t work so you just have to close the door which was a little inconvenient for us and another thing is it o my has 2 bathroom so if you’re hosting large group of people you should take that into consideration. But overall my friends now praise me for getting this place we absolutely loved it and had a great time. Another bonus point for us was, we live in city area so in the morning the sunrise was absolutely gorgeous. We all had a chance to sit outside and enjoy the fresh air while enjoying to beautiful view. I would definitely book this air bnb again."
2022-11-01,5,Group trip,"Very nice house and easy, pleasant location. Great place to get away to."
2022-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Beautiful, old farmhouse with fascinating older and modern touches. We appreciated very much that we were able to have enough hot water and pressure to have 2 people showering in the full bathrooms while running laundry, which is rare! The outside lighting is minimal and it was initially difficult for us to find the key box when we came in late. Outside of that, the beds were super comfortable with plenty of room for our large family, the towels plenty, everything we needed in the kitchen was supplied, and the setting was gorgeous!"
2022-10-01,5,Group trip,"This was such a great find! Heidi was very responsive to my questions in advance and check in/out was so easy. Heidi had all kinds of little extra touches that made the stay really nice like extra towels and lotions in the bathrooms, plenty of utensils and cookware in the kitchen, and lots of different places to sit and unwind. The party room and outside space was such a great feature as well, we had beautiful weather so we took advantage of the grill and the fire pit. Modern appliances and fixtures in a historic home along with comfy beds and convenient to both Chambersburg and Shippensburg - definitely recommend."
2022-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"Loved staying at this beautiful homestead! I had my bridal shower here and now, just threw my mom an awesome baby shower. The dining room makes for great little events. Love the cozy farm feeling. Definitely a great place to get away to."
2022-10-01,5,Group trip,My new favorite house! So spacious with an amazing bonus banquet room. The beds were very comfortable and the scenery was so serene. Every detail was thought of to make the property so homey. I can’t wait to go back.
2022-10-01,5,Stayed about a week,The stay was great.Very large dining room for families to get together. We used it for a small wedding and it worked out great. Heidi could not have been any more helpful.
2022-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Our stay was short, as we're road tripping. The house was charming, with a dining room that's more like a small ballroom. 9 of us fit comfortably. Coffee was provided and much appreciated. Heidi's communication was great and made the whole stay effortless. The location was great as well, we found a cool little brunch apot downtown on our way."
2022-08-01,5,Group trip,Amazing
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We were in town for my grandfather’s 90th birthday party at Caledonia, and Heidi’s place was absolutely perfect. The kitchen was well stocked, the beds were so soft and comfortable, and the large dining room was an incredible bonus. We’d all love to come back!"
2022-07-01,5,Group trip,"Beautiful Farm House!! Great Space!! We stayed here the night before and after our wedding with our wedding party and it was perfect!! Lots of room to spread out, huge kitchen and gathering area and lots of room in general. The beds were super comfortable and the host was amazing! I’m going to have to figure out another family get together just for a reason to do this again!"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We had a wonderful stay! The beds were clean and comfortable. Just a warning though, this is a very old farmstead, with all the charms of an old home including with 6 foot doorways. So watch your head! There was plenty of room to host events in dining area. My 4 kids had a blast running circles in the house. The location was perfect for a short drive into chambersburg where you could find everything you need. Gettysburg was not far away either, and it was a perfect home base for our stay. The host was super friendly and very willing to help in anyway.
If walls could talk I am sure this quaint old beauty would have some stories to tell."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We stayed here on our way to Hershey, PA for 1 night and wished we could have stayed longer! The property was beautiful both inside and out. After a long road trip from FL it was nice for all 7 of us to be able to spread out and relax. The beds were comfortable and the bathrooms were well stocked and very nice. Overall it was a great place to stay. It was nice to see Heidi working on the property as we pulled away the next morning and were able to give a wave. Hopefully we will be back again sometime!"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed one night,The house is a great place to stay. Good location. Quiet. Lots of room.
2022-07-01,5,Group trip,This place was great for hosting the baby shower! Having the function room right off the kitchen while allowing for 8 of us to stay there was exactly what we needed. Overall the place was clean and well represented by the listing and pictures. The location was close to a major plasa so we were able to quickly acquire everything we needed for our function. Heidi was responsive and supportive of our needs and requests.
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,absolutely loved this house was worth every penny Definitely will be back
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Fantastic!! This house was so adorable and in such a quiet and serene setting. Tons of old-farmhouse character, but updated and comfortable. Beds were very comfortable! Tons of towels and blankets. Extra fans for sound and to help move around the cool air from the wall air conditioning units. Bathrooms fully equipped with towels, toilet paper, tissues, soap...even shampoo/conditioner/body wash/lotions, etc. Check in/out was VERY easy. Heidi was excellent and super responsive. Dining room was HUGE! Seating right off of the kitchen and living space. Tons of room for family/friends to enjoy meals, games, or chatting. A few games provided in the tv stand. Will ABSOLUTELY be renting this house again.....I just need to make up a reason to do so! :)"
2022-07-01,5,Group trip,We rented the house for a family get together for 4th of July. Heidi allowed us to set off fireworks. The family had a great time and we set off a lot of fireworks! It was an amazing and relaxing family getaway. We will definitely be back!
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The house was very clean, truly a great place to stay at! Many things to do and not a far drive to enjoy them. Heidi was very easy to communicate with and we are looking forward to doing another stay!"
2022-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,Thank you!
2022-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"What a delightful place to stay! It is really old, so keep that in mind, but we absolutely loved it! Tons of room, beautiful location, and attentive friendly host! Thank you, Heidi!"
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Nice place.
2022-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,Super host! Great place to stay between north carolina and new jersey!
2022-06-01,5,Group trip,"I used this homestead to host my annual sister's gathering. It was perfect! We used the large dining area for eating, table games, and crafts. Heidi was great to communicate with and her farm home was neat, clean, and relaxing. All of us were a grateful bunch to have stayed at Heidi's airBNB."
2022-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,We loved the Homestead. Very spacious and comfortable.
2022-06-01,3,Group trip,"Thank you for hosting my siblings and me this week. The farmhouse was comfortable enough.
Cleanliness is disappointing. There was mouse poop all over the place, including the kitchen counters.
Supplies were very low.
We had to buy more tiolet paper.
There were laundry facilities with zero laundry soap.
There were not enough plates, bowls, and silverware.
Communication was adequate.
It would be helpful to have check in and check out procedures posted at the house.
After booking and going into poultry flu breakout, we were not notified of not receiving complimentary dozen eggs.
It would helpful to have a list of good to know. Example is that a box fan is available if needed.
Our experience was doable, but it didn't meet all expectations ."
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay
2022-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,"A lovely home with old farmhouse charm, yet every modern convenience you need. Very functional kitchen with amazing dining room space. Far enough out of twin to feel country, yet close enough to what you need. We wish we had stayed longer!"
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Our stay was pretty brief since we were attending commencement exercises at Dickinson College. Love the open kitchen design and the meeting room which has wonderful morning sun. The beds were comfortable and plenty of towels and thoughtful touches of stocked shampoo and paper products. Remote feel but not far from the city center. Very bucolic and quiet.
2022-05-01,5,Group trip,Loved our stay at the Homestead! The house was just the right mix of rustic charm and comfort. We were in Chambersburg for Wilson College graduation and Heidi’s place had the perfect spot to host a dinner for 30. Location was beautiful and so peaceful while still just being minutes away from everything. Would definitely stay here again!
2022-05-01,4,Stayed with kids,"Heidi was very quick to answer any questions we had before our stay. There were 6 of us and a baby and we all had room to spread out and be quite comfortable. The kitchen is amazing, full of old farmhouse charm. You may or may not receive eggs for your stay as noted in the description. This is not a terrible thing as we all brought something to share with each other in the morning. The downstairs toilet needs babysitting when flushing, I don't recommend going #2 in that toilet. The showers were hot and clean. The beds are ultra comfortable. There are some games in the living room if you feel like some late night entertainment. We would stay here again."
2022-05-01,5,Group trip,"Huge old fantasticly restored farmhouse with plenty of space to spread out and relax. Beds and sofas were super comfortable!!! Tons of table space to play games/eat/host an event. You are in a beautiful, quite, farm neighborhood, but super close to the interstate. It was perfect for a 3 couple gaming getaway weekend(could have comfortably handled a 4th couple)
Would be perfect for family or friend's get together!"
2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Vary great place to stay, I had a wonderful time here."

2022-04-01,5,Group trip,Heidi was most accommodating for our family group of siblings returning to our home area for a family wedding. The house met our needs well and we enjoyed the bonus of observing the unique character of an older house that had been modernized.
2022-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,Amazing little farmhouse! Super cute and very spacious! Would 100% stay here again for our next trip to Gettysburg. Owners were responsive and incredibly accommodating. 10/10!

2022-03-01,5,Group trip,This is a beautiful home that was perfect for a bridal shower!

2021-10-01,5,Group trip,"Heidi's place was great for a group of friends traveling together -- lots of space to hang out together both indoors and out, plenty of rooms, and many charming updates and thoughtful touches throughout. She was friendly and responsive."
2021-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"Heidi’s place was absolutely gorgeous. Sparking clean, beds were so comfortable, a lot of attention to detail, cozy and great location. We enjoyed the eggs she left for us. We cannot wait to go back again when we can stay longer!! Do not hesitate. Book this place. You will love it!!!"
2021-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We really enjoyed our stay, thank you!"
2021-09-01,5,Group trip,"We absolutely loved staying here! We were in town for our daughters wedding and we had both sets of grandparents with us too. We had plenty of space to have our kids and their significant others over for dinner. Plus, we never felt crowded when we had a few moments of down time. There were separate niches to read, chat, or work. The house is well set up and the decorating is super cute! We’d highly recommend staying here!! Thank you Heidi! You were wonderful to work with!"
2021-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Very charming and spacious home, perfect for our family of 5. The house was well appointed, beds were comfortable, communication with host was excellent.
The large room with four tables was fun to eat in and got great morning light. The house was close to the road, but it’s a quiet road with only a few Amish passing by on their bikes.
Lots of nearby restaurant options and a great stopping point on our way down south. Would highly recommend and hope to have a chance to stay again."
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Heidi was a great Host and fast to respond with any questions. We loved the house so much we didn't want to leave! House was extremely clean, had everything we needed and was very comfortable!"
2021-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"We were so blown away by the beautiful and comfortable accommodations and the attention to detail! The area is very friendly, and the house is a short drive to shops/a grocery store despite feeling blissfully out-of-the-way. There was a storm the first night we stayed and the views of the sunset after were breathtaking. I would definitely recommend this place, and hope to have an opportunity to stay here again someday!"
2021-09-01,5,Group trip,We loved our stay! It was perfect for our weekend of playing music and the acoustics were awesome. The home was larger than expected and was more than enough space for our group of seven. A variety of fun hiking trails are nearby. We can't wait to come back. The responses were quick from Heidi when we needed help. Jason was very friendly when he came by and told us about the house and area. Highly recommend!!
2021-07-01,5,Group trip,"This was the perfect house for what we needed. You are in the middle of the country but only 10-15 from Chambersburg, the interstate and everything else. Heidi was an amazing host, so quick to communicate. When we asked about some extra tables, she was there in 15 minutes to fulfill the request. Talk about service!! The house was nice and cool, even on the hottest of days (I was actually glad I'd packed a sweatshirt!!). The rooms were well-sized and the beds were comfortable. The bathrooms were well-stocked. The extra room (the one with the tables) is perfect for hobby get togethers (quilting, scrapbooking, board games, etc). It definitely exceeded our expectations. So glad we booked it!!"
2021-07-01,5,Group trip,"Anyone looking for a place to stay in the Chambersburg area I can't say enough nice things about this beautiful home. We were in the area for our daughters wedding and had a diverse group stay together in this lovely home. We were all very comfortable and had more than enough space that we were not tripping over each other.
We hosted a small gathering of the bride and grooms friends after the wedding reception at Adams County Winery and they really enjoyed playing corn hole in the very spacious outdoor area at the home. I wish I would have known about it sooner because the great room was larger than the reception area and would have made a beautiful setting for the wedding.
We can't thank Heidi enough for having such a beautiful home for us to use for a few days."
2021-07-01,5,Group trip,The house was plenty capable of handling the 9 of us that stayed there for a bachelor party. It had a ton of yard space and was easy to get to. I would absolutely recommend Heidi’s place to anyone. Heidi was extremely hospitable with the complimentary syrup and eggs and very easy to reach when I had questions about checking out. Thank you for playing a role in the success of our bachelor party.
2021-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Very tastefully redone old farmhouse. Exceptionally clean with what appeared to be new bath towels which was an extra nice touch. The bathrooms included higher quality, herbal shampoo, conditioner, body washes, and a few other amenities that were an unexpected personal pleasantry. The beds were very comfortable and the house actually seemed to sleep more than advertised. All of the rooms were decorated thoughtfully including the extra seating areas. Air conditioning was freezing cold. Plenty of room in the kitchen and TONS of space in the large newly added bonus room. Ample parking, lots of yard for the children to run and play ball. Feels very country but only about 10 minutes from anything you might need.. Wonderful experience at a value price. Highly recommended."
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Lovely and lovingly restored farmhouse with nice views of the countryside. Heidi was kind and quick to reply, and even offered us free entry to the county fair! The house is very spacious, perfectly clean, and well-stocked. Great kitchen for cooking, comfortable furniture and beds—everything you could hope for in an airbnb."
2021-07-01,5,Group trip,"An amazingly beautiful and comfortable ""Homestead"" farmhouse made modern. It served our group of 4 professionals well for an annual planning retreat."
2021-07-01,5,Group trip,My bridesmaids and I stayed here the night before my wedding. Then we got ready there the next day. We enjoyed every minute of our stay and the host was awesome!
2021-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Stop looking for any other house to rent. This place is awesome and your host is incredible. Beautiful location, immaculate house."
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Already shared information.
2021-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Absolutely wonderful stay with stunning views!
This house had it all. It was spacious and we were able to spread out or gather together throughout our stay. The dining room with two long farm tables accommodated our big breakfasts as well as evening card games. We made sure to bring pancake mix to enjoy the local maple syrup and there is no shortage of mixing bowls, measuring cups, utensils, pots/pans for cooking. I used the office to book Gettysburg tour tickets with my laptop (super fast wifi) and maybe also to clean up my inbox during some downtime! The family room has two comfy couches and the kids used the smart tv to access their netflix. The main level has a spacious bedroom and full bath as well. The upper level has three bedrooms and another full bath; towels are plentiful and shampoo/conditioner/body wash is available, as is plant-derived hand cream, lotion, etc which I really appreciated. Extra blankets were placed in each room as well. The back patio has a grill and seating for four, although we found ourselves congregating on the front porch most days and nights. Kids loved catching lightning bugs each evening. Prior to our departure, we used the washer/dryer to lighten the burden of returning home and I am so thankful this home has that amenity and there were a few laundry pods as well which I was grateful for since I neglected to bring some with me! You are about four minutes from I-81 as well a McDonalds/gas station/dollar general, so easy to grab a few necessities or jaunt one exit up for suburban restaurants. I really enjoyed this renovated farmhouse and the peaceful weekend it afforded us with my parents."
2021-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The Homestead is a beautiful home and was the perfect place for 7 of us to stay and also host a family reunion for 30 people. The location is terrific-wonderful rural setting, but not far to stores and restaurants. Heidi was very helpful throughout the process of booking and all through the stay. VERY fast response times to questions. The home is very well outfitted with everything we needed for meal prep. Nice sized bedrooms and bathrooms. It was nice to have a main floor bedroom for folks who don’t do stairs well. The dining room has several tables and plenty of chairs. Our whole family (30 of us) could eat and visit very comfortably. Highly recommend this property!"
2021-06-01,5,Group trip,"Beautiful home and great space for comfort and events! I highly recommend it, and will be referring friends. Can’t wait to go back next year."
2021-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,Really cool space !!!
2021-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"My family stayed here for a month when we moved to the area. The house was spacious, comfortable, and had everything we needed. Heidi was super friendly and responsive, but also respected our privacy. It's a good location with easy access to 81. Overall, it was a great experience!"
2021-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,We really loved it. It was everything explained in the details and some. I love how modern it was but still had all the farmhouse feel to it. It felt like home.
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,Kendra’s place was exceptional. Decorated beautifully and a very cozy feel. The bed was so comfortable! Definitely would recommend.
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"This was a fun experience and the place is as lovely as it appears. Bed was comfortable, local restaurants fantastic. Decent amount of stairs, and parking was a bit stressful for me. Wifi was manageable with some host assistance, but I wouldn’t rely on it for work."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Such an amazing place, the apartment was spotless and extremely cozy! Parking was super east and convenient and there's lots to do surrounding this place. highly recommend to anyone."

2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Kendra's place is lovely with all of the amenities one could want. She has clearly put her designer's mind and eye to creating an inviting space right in downtown Chambersburg. She is warm and welcoming. Make sure to visit her fabulous shop just downstairs as well as her online store, particularly if the Airbnb's furnishings and decor appeal to you."
2024-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"I had a last minute stay for one night, the location was great and the room was beautiful and cozy!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This is one of the best Airbnb’s I’ve ever stayed in. Fabulously furnished (Kendra has a real eye for design and function) and had every amenity we needed. We run an Airbnb in Vermont that I have a lot of pride in for how much care we put into the place - and Kendra’s care for her reminded me of that. It meant a lot. Also THE LOCATION! Walking distance from all the amazing restaurants and darling shops. I felt so happy being here. Stay here!
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"Cozy, comfortable and clean. We had one of the best sleeps in a long time, super comfortable bed and quality linens. Well decorated and just a relaxing vibe throughout the apartment. I wish I could have stayed longer."

2024-02-01,5,Stayed one night,Everything was beautifully decorated it was clean and very comfortable!
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The apartment was beautiful! The place looked just like the photos. I had to message the host on where to park. She responded right away and gave clear instructions. The only concerning thing was the door locks. The door and the locks were loose and would open by itself if the door wasn’t locked. All in all, it was worth the stay."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed one night,The cutest BNB right in the heart of Town. Definitely would stay again.
2024-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"Clean, comfortable and beautifully designed."

2024-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"My wife and I just needed a weekend getaway and this place was perfect. The brick under plaster aesthetic, the plants and greenery, the decor, everything was perfect. The apartment smelled great, everything was clean, great selection of teas and coffees. The weather was cold and windy but inside we were warm and cozy. We will definitely book again!"

2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Kendra’s place is beautifully designed and decorated. Kitchen had everything. Love the reusable products. Coffee and tea were a nice touch.
The only negative is no designated parking, but the library across the street was ok.
I would recommend Kendra’s place if you are visiting Chambersburg or surrounding area."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"Had a lovely overnight stay here. The place was clean and spacious and included all of the accommodations that we needed.

(Side plug for Bistro 71, the restaurant next door... the food is excellent!)"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Kendra's place was beautiful and comfortable with everything we needed. We enjoyed our stay very much! She decorated it creatively and makes great use of the space. The location is perfect for walking and finding shops and restaurants nearby. The one trade-off is that the street has alot of traffic (and sometimes firetrucks/police cars), so I highly recommend that you plan to use white noise in the apartment."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Wonderful place!
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"This was our first Airbnb experience and we felt lucky to have happened upon Kendra’s place. It was both unique and cozy. Kendra also owns the well curated retail shop next door, where we had the pleasure of meeting her. Thank you for your wonderful restaurant recommendation, The Falafel Shack, and a lovely stay."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful space, great location! Fabulously furnished and decorated. Adorable town. Bistro 71, restaurant down the street, was delicious. Also, Lotus Bowls was delicious too."

2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"A beautiful apartment, exactly as described! Chambersburg is a typical small PA town, mixed use old apartments and very walkable. Great restaurant one block away. Loved it and would come back. The style factor is off the charts!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This stay was great. It was convenient to be able to walk to restaurants and other shopping venues. The room was unique, comfortable, clean and well maintained. We had a great time and would not hesitate to come back and stay again. Kendra is extremely responsive and very helpful. If you want a comfortable and relaxing room with the ability to go for a walk to shop, eat and drink, explore the downtown area... this is a place to check out. Thanks Kendra."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"Kendra’s place is absolutely beautiful. It felt like staying in a high-end boutique hotel. The place is stocked with all of the key amenities, plus some extra touches - like lavender essential oil to help you sleep. We only stayed for a quick one-night stopover, but I would definitely stay longer if I had the occasion."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"REmix REtreat was EXactly what we needed. In fact, from the moment we laid down on the bed when we first arrived we debated extending our stay an extra night!! The REtreat is incredibly warm and welcoming. Kendra has an incredible gift for styling a smaller space in such a way that accentuates all the unique and wonderful attributes you may not realize exist. Situated right on Main St Chambersburg, there are several restaurants, cafes and other venues within walking distance. Upon reading reviews of Kendra’s REtreat, we opted to eat at Bistro 71 — and we, like others who stayed with Kendra, we’re impressed with the quality of food and hospitality of the staff. We would absolutely love to stay at Kendra’s REtreat again and recommend it to anyone looking for stress free, RElaxing escape from everyday life!! ☺️"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,Lovely place to stay. Very beautifully furnished and very clean. Looked Exactly like the pictures!
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I can’t say enough about this place. The design and layout is excellent. Old mixing with new is done so well. Kendra was super responsive. And don’t let the concern of staying downtown stop you from staying at Kendra’s place. Safety and was quiet at night. Also, I recommend grabbing dinner at bistro 71 which is less than a block away. Since we have family in the area, we will be back. 1000 times better than a hotel.
PS she also found my Kindle when cleaning and is sending it back to me. xo."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"absolutely beautiful airbnb, right in the heart of downtown. Place is amazing inside, pictures don't do it justice!"

2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,I loved the decor! Kendra responded quickly to any questions!
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"What a gem. Kendra's REmix REtreat is probably an extension of REmix Design, her interior design store downstairs -- beautifully decorated and super cozy. It was almost a model room. What a difference interior design makes. Literally every thing -- from mirror in the bathroom to kitchen sink, bed frame and bathroom floor, was well appointed.
The apartment is located at the prettiest corner of the town. Unfortunately, all shops and restaurants were closed during holiday weekend, but I went to Giant nearby and fixed a quick meal, which was perfectly fine. The kitchen is equipped with disposal. I'm impressed."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,Beautiful apartment in adorable town.
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Nice clean place just as described

Kendra was an awesome host and would always respond back to any questions I had so quickly. We would definitely stay here again."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"What a cute little place, that was beautifully decorated. Kendra offered lots of amenities and fun little details that made the stay enjoyable. Comfortable bed and smart tv access. Overall a pleasant stay! Be sure to check out her shop below!"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great place, great stay. I highly recommend. You won’t be disappointed!"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The studio was cozy and beautifully decorated! Relaxing and great calming energy. Our hostess left us a yummy treat to have with morning coffee!! She left very detailed instructions about the apartment, how to get in, where to park and how easily she could be reached if needed. It was located in a historical area within walking distance of several cute shops, coffee shops, restaurants and historical buildings. Gettysburg was a quick 30 min drive away. We HIGHLY recommend this place to stay when planning a visit!!!"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful and comfy
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very nice and clean space. Comfortable bed and great location.
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Kendra’s place was absolutely what we’d hoped for and needed for a well deserved getaway from the everyday. Beautifully appointed, with LOTS of special touches, and Kendra could not have been more communicative or helpful. Amenities were top-notch, locally sourced, and we loved the linens and big, thirsty towels. This host and accommodation could not be better. We stayed for five days and had more than enough to last. So grateful we found it! We’ll be back. Kudos to ReMix!"
2023-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"The studio apartment was beautifully decorated, with plenty of plants. Very clean and environmentally-conscious. Lots of handmade and/or artisan decor, cleaning products, etc. The location was fabulous. Plenty of stores, restaurants, and other attractions within easy walking distance. My only recommendation is that if you’re a sensitive sleeper, make sure to bring a sleeping mask and ear plugs or a device that plays white noise. Since the apartment is right on the main drag, light filters through the curtains all night and the sirens are quite loud when they are deployed."
2022-12-01,5,Stayed one night,Beautiful retreat! We had everything we could want or need was provided! So comfortable and welcoming! Wonderful! Thank you!
2022-12-01,5,Stayed one night,Easy to locate!! Parking recommendations from the host were close to the place. Anything you may need was all close by. Very comfortable and clean!!

Kendra even provided pastries from a local bakery! Because we stayed over the weekend, parking was easy and free. Stay was within walking distance to multiple restaurants, coffee shops, and adorable stores. Would stay here again!"
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,perfect stay. Beautiful renovation. couldn't have asked for a better stay. thank you.
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My wife & I were looking to get out of DC for the weekend and could not have picked a better spot. Kendra did a great job leaving clear/concise directions for checking in. Not only did we enjoy the central location, but the apartment itself was fantastic. Clean, we’ll-furnished, and wonderfully designed. Would recommend this rental in a heartbeat."
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The space was creatively laid out, conveniently located and very comfortable. Kendra was very responsive to the minor issue that came up."
2022-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"Beautiful apartment, great location."
2022-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"We had a great stay! The space was very clean and comfortable. It was beautifully furnished and thoughtfully decorated. And the location was very convenient--right on Main Street. The only down side was that being an old building and on a main street meant it could be a little loud (fire trucks at night, loud passers-by on the street outside, etc.) But otherwise lovely."
2022-10-01,5,Stayed one night,We loved our overnight at the Remix apartment. It’s relaxing and perfectly creatively decorated. I loved all the local Cburg items. Highly recommend!
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Kendra’s rental was warm and welcoming, makes me feel very at home. This was my second stay at her rental and I’m looking forward to returning!"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Kendra's place is absolutely beautiful. Decorated with her aesthetic, it could be in the pages of a magazine. A great use of space. It smelled good, too! The whole place was comfortable and had everything we could desire. There was coffee, tea, creamer, and two of the most delicious pastries from a local bakery. Kendra is lovely and her shop downstairs is full of beautifully curated pieces (many of which are on display in the apartment). This place is such a surprise find in this area. It could easily be competitive in a major city. A great value!"
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Kendra’s rental is incredibly comfortable and conveniently located. She has thought of so many accommodations for her guests and had sweets from a local bakery waiting for me upon my arrival! It be rental is the perfect size and has absolutely everything you would need for your stay. I cannot wait to return to her space :)
2022-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"If one is looking for a gorgeous place in or around Chambersburg, then this is the place. So convenient to shops and restaurants. So well equipped and furnished, too. We'd happily stay here again and again."
2022-09-01,5,Stayed one night,2nd floor studio that is as nice as they come for the price. Kendra is a professional host and you will be appreciative of all she provides. Bistro 71 restaurant and bar is 1/2 block away. Food was excellent. Locals who were at the bar felt it was the best in Chambersburg.
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The Retreat looks even better in person! I love the color choices and the overall vibe of this place! The linens were soft and the bed was comfortable (I like a really soft bed, but this bed was fine for me). The parking suggested is super close, but there are signs that say 'No Overnight Parking'. Apparently, this sign is just a suggestion and not a command since several cars park there overnight without an issue."
2022-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great, clean place exactly as described. Kendra is an excellent host and the communication was also great. Would definitely book again!"
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Enjoyed spending the weekend here!
2022-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,Place was very cute and well decorated. Super cozy and welcoming for me and my family. Would definitely recommend and stay again.
2022-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"I absolutely loved staying here and was sad when I had to leave! Loved how the space was furnished and all the extra touches she added to the space. I was also very thankful for the extra treats that were left for me to enjoy from local businesses!
The apartment was very peaceful and I slept great. Not a whole lot of noise coming from the street. Can’t wait to stay again!"
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Had a lovely stay at Kendra’s pad. Room #3 had a large comfortable bed, boho decor, lush plants, and lovely handmade macrame art touches. It’s super clean, chic, and convenient. Book it.
My opinion of the place in context to the area, however, is that Chambersburg Airbnbs can be a bit pricey given that travel/tourism demand there is so low. Only going about once a year, but would go back more often if costs went down—it’s such a great 1-2 day staycation for the DMV. The businesses have high quality crafts, locally sourced foods on their menus, great drinks, the borough has lots of history, and is a great place to stay for a hiking or star-gazing trip into the mountains. Maybe if more folks new that, Chambersburg wouldn’t suffer so many empty storefronts, but enjoy the kind of influx of weekenders that Waynesboro or Gettysburg gets. Bar 71 is still the only “fine dining” spot in the area and has great drinks. The owner either hasn’t or hardly changed the price of spirits for one of the most extensive bourbon/whiskey menus I’ve seen in a long time. They even still have micro-greens as garnishes, which most restaurants have completely 86’d to cut costs. Alex running the Belgian Cafe is a dope human being. The Falafel Shack is still one of the best eats in the town. Denim Coffee still does better coffee than most hipster places anywhere else, but not frufru coffee, just what you need in an espresso house. The chocolatiers at Olympia Candy Kitchen make amazing truffles. And may the Nerdvana Outpost forever last, that hilarious and genuine hidden gem for comics, collectibles and games. Wish more places were open during the week. Be aware that quite a few places only operate Friday to Sunday. Knowing all that, I am still glad Kendra is opening her place to Airbnb guests, and I hope she does well."
2022-08-01,5,Stayed one night,We loved everything about this place. It was easy and smooth checking in and out. It has everything you'd need for a stay. We'll definitely be back and planning to stay longer too!

2022-08-01,5,Stayed one night,Wonderful place - so trendy and perfect location! Clean and quaint! Thank you Kendra! Go check out her shop downstairs - seriously my jam!
2022-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"The decor, inspired by Kendra's boutique downstairs is urban and chic,(not what you might expect in Chambersburg) yet still very inviting and comfortable. The host was especially accommodating of my last-minute needs and arrival and parking were as easy pie.
The location is ideal, if you are in town on business at the government center or to play in Chambersburg for one of its many delightful downtown events, the apartment is just up from the center square and off the noisy main truck thoroughfare, and surrounded by a bountiful bevy of culinary options and great mom & pop shops. (Recommend the Historic Texas Lunch for a good country breakfast and Bistro 71 for something a little classier for dinner.)
Do make sure that you visit the shop downstairs and learn more about Kandra's unique and inspiring designs."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is a beautiful, thoughtful, efficient space in an architecturally interesting building in a lovely area of downtown. Close to many restaurants, coffee shops and walking/running path.
The space has everything one needs with thought about the environment and clean living. The bed and linens are cozy and kitchen well provisioned. We would highly recommend this place and hope to stay again!"

It is situated in relatively calm location within Chambersburg downtown with walking distance to some of the good Breakfast/Brunch places, breweries and restaurants. Kendra is a great host. It was very easy to communicate with her. The apartment was super clean and decorated just as the pictures show. The decor is done by herself and don't miss to check out REmix Design downstairs as well as the places recommended by her on the listing. Thanks again for the pastries and tea/coffee. We would definitely stay again if we are exploring the Chambersburg or areas nearby."

2024-05-01,5,Stayed one night,An absolutely wonderful stay. The backyard has a creek that runs behind it. There is a screen slider and door that opens up to the back porch. My boyfriend and I brought desert back and sat out back enjoying the view and lovely sounds of the water and birds. Such a peaceful retreat. The area is populated enough that there are many excellent restaurant options and surrounding areas for hiking and activities. The place was cozy and perfect for our needs.

2024-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"This suite is beautiful, immaculately clean and so comfortable - in fact, it is the most thoughtfully appointed Airbnb I've ever stayed in. Robin is a wonderful host, and the quiet spot above the creek is relaxing, with a nice deck and yard. But then there's pretty much anything you need in terms of restaurants, stores, etc. within 3 miles. A special place, highly recommend."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Robin provided a few extra special touches to accommodate my little retreat. When she said the space was peaceful, I had no idea to what extent. The bed linens were extra cozy and she thought of every little extra one may require including a foldable work desk, additional blankets, a space heater, extra chairs for the deck, coffee, teas, snacks, and wine. I quickly felt at home and could not wait to sit out on the back deck and take in the view, even in the rain. This was the perfect mommy getaway and I am so grateful."

The porch overlooking the stream was a highlight, a serene spot to unwind and immerse oneself in the ambient sounds of flowing water and whispering winds. Here, I found solace and a connection with nature that’s unrivalled.
Inside, the place was the epitome of cleanliness, every corner spotless and every detail meticulously attended to. The quietude was profound, with only the gentle hum of the stream penetrating the silence, making it a sanctuary for peace seekers.
I couldn’t have asked for a more rejuvenating experience and would highly recommend this haven to anyone looking to escape the hustle and bustle and find solace in nature’s embrace."

The suite was beautifully appointed (wainscoting, stone, hardwood floors) & it was IMMACULATE!! The host (Robin) has thought of everything (from the beverage/breakfast/snack station to the camp chairs and mosquito repellant for the creekside deck) & we loved her informative/instructional notes (no guessing how to use the different locks, etc)!
I/we will 1000% stay there again when enroute through PA!!!! Robin's creekside retreat would also be a great for a local just looking for a night of R&R!!
ATTN car enthusiasts> Wide, completely independent parking spot for your beloved vehicle & just steps away from the entrance door!!
ATTN history/architecture enthusiasts> As we drove out/through downtown Chambersburg - it looks like a quaint & historic town - we would have liked to have done a little sightseeing/meandering - hopefully next time!!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I was in Chambersburg for three days on business. At the end of each day of grueling work, I came back to Robin's place exhausted and spent.
Everything was so peaceful and serene. I have back issues and was anxious about the mattress; I needn't have worried. It was so comfortable, I'm actively in the process of buying the same kind!!!
Everything was labeled and her instructions left on the bed were very clear.
If I find myself back in Chambersburg, I will try to schedule another stay at Robin's Charming Creekside Retreat!"

My wife lived in their rental for a number of years in the 80's. They offered to give her and her family a tour of the whole house. It was really emotional for my wife and her family; they didn't have to go out of their way like that... but they did, and we will be forever grateful. The apartment was very clean, well stocked and we had no complaints. We loved our stay. Thank you."

Not much difference save for the walls and doors provide no sound buffer at all. We were overall extremely satisfied with our stay, water and some snacks were provided by the host, the furniture was very comfortable, extra blankets around the home, and even laundry facilities and detergent/ dryer sheets were all provided and that was a very nice surprise when we got in."

The onlyyyy negatives (which are super minor!) were that the back rooms were pretty chilly, and the cell service/WiFi throughout Chambersburg is pretty spotty. Streaming at the house was interrupted frequently.
We would absolutely love to stay again!"

We highly recommend this stay if you are travelling through this region."
2024-01-01,5,Group trip,"We couldn’t have been happier with our stay. Check in was easy with Jessica’s directions. The place felt like home with the little extra touches she provided, like snacks, bottled water, k cups, lots of towels & she even thought about q-tips. We have family in the area so we look forward to booking this home again in the future. The only drawback for us is the No Pets policy so when we bring them along we may have to find another place, hopefully we can find another one as great as this home."

The beds were comfy and the water was hot!"

We cleaned and dried the clothes from the journey here. It's only a few minutes' drive from her home to supermarkets such as Target and Giant, and my son even had his hair cut nearby. I spent a beautiful and quiet night in Jessica's house. This is really great. Additionally, Jessica's response is very fast, and our problem will be quickly resolved. She is friendly and generous.

Incredibly affordable for the stellar accommodations, I would absolutely recommend Jessica’s place for family/friend trips. Also, given the amount of driving we were doing, it was a great respite spot to recharge, hang out and relax.

Our son (and us of course lol) Absolutely LOVED how big the place was and the two living rooms he could run back and forth through and around the kitchen wall into the livingrooms. perfect"

2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,More than adequate for the price of stay.. 🤙🏻🤙🏻
2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,It was a great stay!
2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"Comfortable and clean, would stay again!"
2023-04-01,4,Stayed with kids,"Little hard to find at first but it was also at night. Cozy, child friendly atmosphere!"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,Jessica’s place is very quite and peaceful we really enjoyed the house and sitting outside on the patio and the location is close to everything. The yard was really nice the kids could play football out there. The house was very clean and stocked with everything. Jessica was very quick to respond and very attentive great host. We will definitely be back to stay when we are in the area again.
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Jessica’s place was spacious and clean. We were pleasantly surprised to find plenty of bottled water, breakfast items, and fresh eggs from her chickens! It’s nothing fancy, but she has done a nice job updating and decorating an older, basic space. It was a good place to stay for our family of 6."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We had a bit of trouble recognizing the place from the street, but the place itself was great! We enjoyed the breakfast items and drinks."
2023-04-01,5,Group trip,fantastic place! host was very quick to respond and the place was spotless. the water in the fridge and the breakfast food were a nice touch. great value for what we paid. thanks Jessica!

2023-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Amazing host! When we arrived she had fresh farm chicken eggs in the fridge, a variety of breakfast snacks and fresh fruit & bottles of water. The home was clean and welcoming."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Clean, private house, Jessica was quick to respond, would stay again."
2023-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"It was well worth the price. Kitchen was stocked and had light fare for morning breakfast. Water available and coffee, what a nice surprise. Toiletry items were available and plenty of towels and such. Nice spacious rooms."
2023-02-01,3,Stayed with kids,"I think Jessica has done a good job making this Airbnb feel as comfortable as possible - some nice touches like water in the fridge and snacks on the counter, nice decorations, etc. However the house itself is only a few feet from a seemingly abandoned, very run down trailer park that made us not feel the safest. I couldn’t honestly give it a 5 compared to some of the other airbnbs I have stayed in, but I appreciated what Jessica has done with the place and the flexibility she gave us in changing the dates (originally booked over Christmas and then our family got Covid and couldn’t make the trip). I would recommend maybe putting up a privacy fence, upgrading the towels and linens to all match, and a few coats of paint and I think this would be a great place to stay."
2023-02-01,5,Stayed over a week,Jessica is a great host. First night there it was very cold and the best had been left off. She drove up at 10:30pm to bring us space heaters. I also lost the key which I offered to replace but instead she installed a digital lock so that wouldn’t be an issue in the future. The place is nice and clean it has a nice large kitchen and a nice large master bath. I would gladly stay here again if I’m back in the area for work.
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Nice and cozy
2023-01-01,5,Stayed one night,We had a wonderful stay in her place and would love to come back if ever we crossed PA again. Jessica’s place is supreme and lit! The place and the service is worth more than the price. My friends are all pleased. Thank you
2023-01-01,4,Stayed over a week,Great hosts. Very accommodating.
2023-01-01,3,Stayed about a week,"Overall good place to stay. Jessica provided water bottles which was great and also lots of coffee pods.
However there is a trailer right next to the house and did not make me feel safe. That is Ofcourse not Jessica s fault. Bedrooms were clean but bathroom tub was dirty and had hair. I did not use it."
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Jessica was very responsive and her place was clean! I might stay again sometime as we frequently visit family that live in the area! 🙂

2022-11-01,4,Stayed a few nights,There was cold water bottles in the fridge and a tray of snacks waiting on the counter. This was a pleasant surprise. We prepared all of our meals in house. The house was clean and we felt at home during our stay.
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Nice little place in Chambersburg. Good space in the house and cute little amenities offered. The perfect place for us to elope in the area and have a nice place to relax.
2022-10-01,5,Stayed about a week,A great location to come back to after a long day of sightseeing!
2022-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Jessica is a fantastic host! The property was well supplied and furnished. The property was also centrally located to both the town center and rural areas. Additionally, the property was well cleaned, and we enjoyed our stay. We have family in the area and are likely to come back to this place for future visits!
Be advised that this place is well hidden when arriving, but I find this to be a good thing personally."
2022-10-01,3,Stayed with kids,Spacious place.
2022-10-01,4,Stayed one night,Spacious house with plenty of parking. Comfortable lodging and great communication with Jessica. Close to several places to get dinner.
2022-10-01,5,Stayed one night,Excellent value!
2022-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"Jessica's place is very clean, large, comfortable, and the kitchen has everything you need to prepare meals. Private off street parking just steps from the door make loading a breeze. Communication was prompt and clear. Thank you again for a very hospitable stay."
2022-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,Good as always
2022-09-01,4,Stayed one night,"Easy to find , clean, quite large. Nice snacks and cold water provided, very much appreciated."
2022-09-01,5,Group trip,"We had a great experience at Jessica's place! For being along a fairly main road it really wasn't loud at all. The place was cute and comfy and the decor made it feel very homey. There wasn't much that we felt like we needed that wasn't there. This is a great value and I would definitely come back again or recommend to others! Also, I reached out to Jessica with a question a week or two before our stay, and she promptly responded and was very helpful! Thanks for a wonderful stay!"
2022-09-01,5,Stayed one night,Very cozy and homey. plenty of space with a lot of room and exceptionally clean. only drawback is you can hear a lot of traffic.
2022-09-01,3,Stayed one night,"After a long day traveling we arrived to a lockbox that wouldn't work after multiple tries, and soon it was dark while we waited for the host to arrive and unlock the door. No outside light was left on for us, and we had no idea what time, due to traffic problems. Inside is spacious with 2 livings, 2 bathrooms and 3 bedrooms, but... the master bathroom was not clean and the shower curtain and rod were on the floor. The bed in that room was comfortable but not big enough for 2 adults. The second bathroom had no shower mat. We are allergic to scented items, and requested fragrance-free house and linens, which did not happen. In fact, I had to clean the excess fabric softener out of the washer before we could use it, and empty the dryer which was full of laundry. I also cleaned the master bathroom, and ran the dishwasher in order to have breakfast dishes to use. By that time it was rather late and we were very tired, yet needed to take care of some things on WIFI, which is very basic and extremely slow. If you're looking for a place to sleep and not much more, this might be fine. Overall, it's true that you get what you pay for, unfortunately. The plus side were little extras like Qtips and cotton balls in the bathroom, and coffee and bottle water in the kitchen."
2022-09-01,5,Group trip,"Nice cozy house. Right off the road for easy access to the surrounding area.
Jessica was super responsive if I had any questions. Would definitely recommend!"
2022-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This was a great stay for our family with 4 kids. They all loved the place and dubbed it ""The Cozy Cottage."" Everything was clean, and well kept, and checkin/checkoutwas easy and straightforward. Messages sent to the host were returned nearly immediately, not that we had any problems at all. Highly recommend and would jump at the chance to stay again."
2022-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"independent house, spacious, clean. I wish I could stay for a longer time."
2022-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,Nice place to stay. It's on a busy road but far enough back that it is very quiet.
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was a fantastic home for us between Richmond, VA and Watkins Glen, NY race weekends! Jessica was very positive and responsive, the home is roomy and comfortably laid out for privacy and is well furnished and stocked/supplied. We found the local history of Chambersburg and Gettysburg to be a wonderful and inspiring experience. This is a bargain!"
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"4 of us stayed and had more than enough room.
We were able to just relax in comfort in the grand living room.
Having 2 bathroom made in easy to get ready quickly
The off. Street parking was great for 2 or more cars
Enjoyed our stay and will use Jessica again."
2022-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"Quiet, clean, convenient and comfortable! Just what we were looking for. Beds were really comfortable and it was nice to have bottles of water and coffee for us. Spotlessly clean! Thank you for a great stay, Jessica!"

2022-06-01,5,Stayed about a week,Felt like my own home for the time I was here. My sister who came with me even started referring to it as “home.” Just a lovely house to call home for the time we had there.
2022-06-01,3,Stayed with kids,"Very Clean property; all basics provided except bath and dishwasher soap. Fairly close to a Target and grocery store. A little difficult to locate in the dark - it’s at the end of a long driveway and has no windows facing the driveway, so it almost looks like a garage. The entrance is around the side. It does have 2 living areas and split bedrooms, so it is really good for a family."
2022-06-01,5,Stayed one night,Wonderful place to stay just what we needed!
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"A great location if you want to go hiking in a few of the state parks. Also relatively close to restaurants. Lots of room! We were just 2 people but there are 3 bedrooms, 2 bathrooms, and 2 family rooms! The master bed was very comfortable. Nice new carpeting!"

2022-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"We really enjoyed our stay at Jessica‘s home. It was clean, The beds were comfortable and the kitchen was well equipped. It was in a very convenient location, minutes from the highway and right down the street from Wilson college. It was so nice to sit on the deck with a cocktail after a long day of driving and It was a bargain to get a three bedroom home at a very fair price. I would definitely recommend staying here if you are in the area."

The home is furnished and decorated nicely with many brand new items from appliances to carpet. The beds are comfortable and the needed supplies are available. They have provided two TV's, but one is probably an 18"" screen and the other no more than 28"". It's about 30 minutes from the Gettysburg battlefield site. We would stay here again if we were coming through town."

2023-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The home was beautiful, clean, and easy to find. The host was very nice, and answered any questions I had in a very quick time. No ridiculous instructions for cleaning before check-out. Our first time staying at an Airbnb, and it was a very pleasant experience."

2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,Sabrina's home was just as described. Her home was clean and spotless. Our family four had plenty of space to spread and enjoy our downtime when we were not out exploring. Sabrina's home was close to many local attractions. We enjoyed our stay and look forward to returning next September.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed about a week,"We enjoyed our visit to the area, and the house was the perfect place to come back to for relaxation. I would recommend this location and if we are ever back in the area we would definitely book again."

2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We enjoyed our stay at Sabrina’s. My favorite things about this AirBnB was the fully stocked kitchen. It made cooking meals so much easier and I loved the dining and site seeing recommendations left on the dry sink. Sabrina really thinks of everything to make your stay comfortable. Plenty of blankets, pillows, wash clothes and towels etc. I never felt like I needed anything extra during our stay. We would choose to come back here again. Thank you Sabrina!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The house was very clean and very cozy. Host was quick to respond when we contacted them.

2023-04-01,5,Stayed over a week,"This house was especially clean and very comfortable for us. It is located very near Penn National and South Mountain Golf courses. For bicyclers in good shape or with e-bikes, the road the house is on is busier than expected. However, a quarter mile away is access to a large development for riding which also connects to roads around Penn National and Mount Alto that worked well for riding. The Cumberland Valley Rail Trail is less than a half hour away which begins in Shippensburg plus there are country roads with respectful drivers in that area. Gettysburg is about a half hour away and Michaux State Forest is very close with access to the Appalachian Trail and a Trail Museum. Over all we had a wonderful time and this is a great place to stay! Many thanks to you, Sabrina, and to your family!"
2023-01-01,4,Stayed about a week,This place was a nice home away from home for my husband and son while working out of town for 10 days. They were very pleased with the condition of the home and the amenities offered (e.g. washer and dryer). The only complaint my husband had was that the bed he slept in was horrible. He said he didn't sleep well as it hurt his back. He recommends replacing it with a more supportive mattress.
2022-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This house was perfect for my wife and me and our two kids (5 and 3). We spent Christmas with my in-laws who live in the area. The house was spotlessly clean, and contained everything we needed to make it a good stay for the time we were there. We chose to use the pull out bed in the sun room and that worked very well for us. Even though the weather outside was very cold, we opened the door and the window to the sunroom and it warmed up very quickly. The house had a lot of extras like toys, puzzles, games, and a Sling subscription. The host was extremely accommodating and responsive. We had to change the days of our stay at the last minute because of the weather, and they gave us no trouble at all. We plan to stay here again next time we are in the area."
2022-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,Everything was great!
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This Airbnb is super clean and conveniently located! Close to Chambersburg and a short drive to Gettysburg.

2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Lovely home, very clean, best value in the area with relatively easy access to grocery store and Gettysburg/chambersburg historic sites (which were our major interests in the area).

I felt like I was at home. We were in town for a Carlisle car show (an easy 40 minute drive away), and we loved the option of using the garage. Truck and trailer fit easily into the driveway. A very, very nice home and Sabrina was an amazing host, well done!"

From the spacious rooms and beautiful decor, we could not have asked for a better weekend! The hosts were easy to communicate with and ensured that we had what we needed during our visit. Would highly recommend this home if you are looking for a place to stay in the area!"
2024-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,"So refreshing to stay somewhere you could tell shortcuts weren't taken during the obvious renovation. It's a beautiful, spacious house with thoughtful design.
Everything was high-quality and didn't feel like it was going to fall apart when you touched it.
The house was large enough to accommodate our large mashup of guests (2 kids, 2 babies and 7 adults!) comfortably.
Unfortunately we weren't able to get to enjoy the backyard due to the rain, but hopefully the next guest will enjoy the firewood we left in the pit!
Most normal supplies were provided (more than ""one to get you started"" we've seen in other rentals) which was so nice.
A laundry basket, box of tissues and a few dish towels for the kitchen would have been really handy but otherwise we didn't really lack anything.
Mane and Josh were helpful prior to our stay and Mane was responsive when we had a quick question.
Hands down would fully recommend staying here!"
2024-05-01,5,Group trip,Beautiful place and very nice people 10 out 10
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"An absolute gem of a home! From the moment we stepped through the door, we were enveloped in comfort and style. The tasteful decor, comfortable beds, and soft linens made us feel like we were staying in a luxury hotel. With plenty of room to spread out, the whole family could relax and unwind. The fully stocked kitchen was a dream and the pristine bathrooms were like stepping into a spa. We couldn't have asked for a better place to stay. 10/10 would recommend!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,Wonderful home to stay in.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Convenient location. Close to shops and restaurants.
2024-03-01,5,Group trip,"Came to town for a professional conference. This house is amazing! Tastefully designed, clean, spacious, lots of spaces for when folks needed peace and quiet, and the most beautiful dining room to enjoy a meal together! Hosts responded very quickly to our questions, there is plenty of parking, and check out was easy.
Just a note: kitchen does not have a toaster, in case that’s important to folks."

2024-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,One of the best Airbnb stays I've had.
2024-01-01,5,Group trip,"This was a great stay! I cannot recommend this place enough. Our total group was 10 people and everyone slept comfortably. Tons of parking too which made life so much easier. Nearby to quite a lot, so overall this was just a great airbnb"

2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"We enjoyed our brief stay here. It is very spacious and we liked the bedroom being separate from the living room for TV watching. Because of traffic issues and arriving later than expected we only had time to make a meal, shower and sleep. The shower was nice and the bathroom is huge! This would be a nice space for a few days stay. There are children there so there was some noise from upstairs but not excessive. And as far as communication, there was the initial message with instructions only. I did send a message saying we checked out and there was no response and I guess there didn't need to be but other hosts have always responded. Check out instructions were very simple, only put towels in hamper, don't strip bed and leave key on table. The home is about 7 miles from I-81."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,Amazing host. Amazing hospitality. Amazing home. Highly recommend. Will definitely be returning.
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"One of the CLEANEST, cutest, coziest AIRBNBs I've ever rented. I wish I hadn't been basically renting it to sleep :) It really is a sweet little home away from home. All you need are your food, shower items, and hairdryer, and you're set! Decorated beautifully with lots of outlets and lighting (even the outside light works!). Away from town in a peaceful countryside, just beautiful! I've never stayed in a basement apartment, but the noise from upstairs was minimal. The single drawback is how loud the water softener charger is that comes on randomly, just my luck it came on at 2am. It is very loud, woke me from a sound sleep and I had a white noise app running. And it went on for a loooong time."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Stephanie has an amazing place! I wouldn’t hesitate to book here again.
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Beautiful place, out in the country and very peaceful, but still convenient to I-81. Everything was perfect, would stay here again for sure!"

2024-02-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This place is larger than the apartment I am on my way to visit in New York. It is so well equipped, a person could move in and stay for a month without needing anything more than groceries. I awoke to 5 inches of heavy wet snow, and Brian was already plowing the driveway so I could get out. This is my idea of what Airbnb was meant to be."

One thing that stood out, was every time I needed something, and I looked where I thought it should be, it was always right there. The house logistically made sense.
Stephanie was a great host and very responsive.
I would love to go back for another workcation and recommend this place for out-of-town visitors."

2023-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We stayed at Stephanie's on the way to family and liked her place so much, we stayed again on the way home. We've told our family about this great place. Besides Stephanie thinking of everything we needed for our stay, the beautiful setting is worth seeing - the rolling fields, and the long horizon. Our city dog was so happy to run in the wide-open spaces. It's a little out of town, but it's so worth the short ride. Also, we twice got takeout from Tacos Los Primos in Chambersburg. It's not fine dining, but wow, was the food fantastic!!!"
