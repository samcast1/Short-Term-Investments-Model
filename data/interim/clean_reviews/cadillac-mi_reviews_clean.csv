2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Kelli's place is located just minute drive from Caberfae, if you planning a ski weekend it's a great place. The home was clean organized and cozy. My group of friends and myself al greatly enjoyed staying there and plan on coming back."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The chalet was PERFECT for our family of 4 for our ski weekend at Caberfae. Only 2 minute drive to the slopes! The house was so cozy and there was plenty of room. Kelli paid attention to detail with anything we could have forgotten by providing snacks, toys for kids, DVDs, toiletries! Everything was very well labeled. The wood burning fireplace was cozy after a day of skiing. Our kids also loved running around in the spacious backyard. We definitely will return and stay at the Chalet!"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Very nice little place close to the ski hill. The host is a rockstar, everything is labeled and spelled out for you. Would definitely recommend."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"First time using, couldn’t ask for a better experience. Kellie was amazing and helpful. Would recommend and will be booking again."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had to cancel our U.P. ski trip due to lack of snow, so we did a lower Michigan tour of ski areas that make snow, ending with the last few days at Caberfae Peaks. The proximity to Caberfae was perfect. The house was everything it was described to be and more. Check in and check out were very easy. Everything was extremely clean. The working fireplace was an incredible addition of ambiance to our ski trip. There were also helpful instructions posted around the house for how to operate various appliances (including the fireplace), and it was clear a lot of thought was put into the little things that helped make the stay enjoyable, from oatmeal and light snacks on the buffet, to ground coffee with your choice if drip coffee maker or french press, and numerous types of glasses, bowls, plates, utensils, kitchen appliances, and more. I could go on but it was clear Kelli has put a lot of thought an effort into making our stay perfect!"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Kelli was an awesome host and very responsive. She has thought of everything! She has written instructions for anything you might need. The house was very clean! We have stayed at a lot of Air BNBs and this is one of the best so far. Kelli has all the kitchen items you may need. She has coffee, hot cocoa and snacks, should you need any. There's tons of puffy towels, hand towels and wash clothes. She's even left a bin of toiletries that her guests may be missing! There's a washer and dryer in the basement, as well."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,Great place to stay. So close to caberfae. Kelli was a great host
2024-01-01,5,Group trip,"The location, accomodations and wonderful host combined to allow our family to create an awseome weekend together to ski at Caberfae. We really appreciated the host's prompt communications, all of the special ""touches"" and amenities within the chalet and the close proximity to access skiing. The host was very kind to communicate with me that I accidently left a few of my own kitchen items behind and was willing to ensure I was reunited with them. Kelli is a very kind and gracious host! I would rebook with them again, recommend it to others and that others that book to stay at their chalet will have a very positive experience!"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Beautiful and so comfortable! Great place to stay!

2023-11-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Four Seasons Chalet is near many hiking paths , lakes and rivers. This is our second time staying in Caberfae at the chalet. We were able to go on beautiful hikes this time. The Chalet has everything you need to enjoy your stay in comfort. Kelli and Derek are great host and respond quickly to any questions you have."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Kelli and Derek’s place is simply amazing! Tremendous amenities, thoughtful touches and full of opportunity for making memories. Highly recommend for nature enthusiasts who love adventuring in the forest on foot, bike or skis. ☺️"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"The chalet is in a perfect location for easy access to explore the National Forest. Kelli and Derek provided detailed instructions and labels for checking-in and everything around the place to make it easy to get settled in and comfortable. We were extremely impressed and pleasantly surprised with all of the personal touches and attention to details for us but also our fur babies. While we didn’t have a chance to take advantage, we loved having the option to have a fire in the fireplace, a campfire or use the grills."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Kelli provided a very efficent and relaxing stay. Of the 10+ years we have been coming north for the salmon run, this cabin was our best pick so far. About 28 minutes from Tippy dam. The home was full stocked and extremely pet friendly. You can also count on Kelli to be very communicative and quick to respond. We recommend this home and host, 100%."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great stay at Kelli’s place. She was quick to answer any questions I had.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Kelli was extremely helpful. The chalet was very clean and well stocked…everything you could need was available and extremely organized.

2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful, clean cabin! We liked all the games and that we could have a bonfire. Kelli was very nice and responsive when needed. Will be staying here again next time we visit!"
2023-07-01,5,Group trip,Our family enjoyed the chalet. Walking the area was a nice start to our day. We made dinners there and had everything we needed to cook. We also enjoyed the fire pit outside one evening and made s’mores. Sleeping Bear is an easy day trip from here.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,This cabin was amazing. The host has thought of everything from charging stations to dog dishes! You literally only need to bring your own food and clothes! The place was spotless and all rooms had a fan! The two upstairs bedrooms BOTH have an AC unit which made for a very pleasant sleep during the 90 degree days we had. They include firewood for the fire pit and/or fireplace. There is also pillows galore which made my family happy! We love extra pillows! I highly recommend staying here! We will definitely be back!
2023-06-01,5,Group trip,"cute, cozy, stay. great amenities and walkable woods nearby. quite town not too far from michigan, close by lakes and hiking. plus the ski hill in the right season. The chalet has plenty of space and a great little yard with a firepit."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We had a wonderful stay! The house was exactly as described and had everything we needed.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We loved our stay here! The place came with several “extra” items. We got in late so it was very nice to have a few snack items available to us as we settled in. The bathroom was also stocked with any extras we may have left behind. The one downfall was having to turn on the well pump. The breaker was located in the basement. The basement was clean and it was easy to access. Had it been for just my parents staying there, they would not have been able to navigate the stairs to locate the breaker. We are fortunate they were not alone! Overall a great place to stay and very nicely kept. We may be back!"
2023-05-01,5,Group trip,Kelli’s place was amazing. We stayed there to go to a wedding at caberfae (very close). The place was perfect for the 5 of us and had the best amenities I’ve seen at an Airbnb. I highly recommend staying here and hope to come back during the winter. Book now!
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Our second time staying at Kelli's place, just as enjoyable as the first time!"
2023-03-01,5,Group trip,Great place and real close to Caberfae! We could see the house lights from the top of the Mountain! Thank you!
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Absolutely perfect! We hope to come back soon!
2023-02-01,5,Group trip,"Kelli was very accommodating and responsive throughout the entire stay. There were clear instructions throughout the house, which made everything very easy to use. My friends and I thoroughly enjoyed our stay here and loved how close it was to Caberfae. We would definitely stay here again!"
2023-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,"5 star experience. the owners have put tons of thought and care into making our stay wonderful. lots of little touches. coffee bar, snacks, cozy throws, fireplace ready to burn(just awesome on the stormy night we had), the binder has excellent food suggestions and clear tips and tricks for the stay.
clean, very well maintained, and close to Caberfae! would definitely recommend and use again!"
2023-02-01,5,Group trip,Great place to stay for a ski weekend!

2023-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,Very Clean
2023-01-01,5,Group trip,"Had everything we could need. Lots of nice details, great for skiing."
2023-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This is the second time we have stayed at this chalet. It is the perfect place for us. My husband, daughter, and I stayed there for 2 nights. The area is very peaceful and Caberfae was in sight. You can see the peaks lit up at night.
My daughter enjoyed the toys, coloring books, games, and movies. I loved how everything is labeled, which makes it easy for us to know which switch turns on what, etc. Check-in and checkout was a breeze.
They have thought of everything and have a step stoop for Kids in the bathroom for the sink, miscellaneous toiletries in case you forget something at home, and firewood. We appreciated the shared condiment tray in the refrigerator.
Oh, and thr chalet is super clean, too! We plan to be back for sure! Thanks Kelli!"
2022-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This is a lovely and extremely well equipped stay. Many amenities including snacks, coffee, and games. And pet friendly for our furry family member! We enjoyed the fireplace with ample firewood included. The kitchen was well equipped with utensils, pots, pans, everything we could think of. Everything was perfectly clean. We had plenty of room for our family of 5. Last thing, and it might seem a little odd to mention, the tap water was the best we've had, it tasted so fresh! Thank you so much for the terrific stay!"
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Four Season chalet is in a beautiful area in Caberfae. The lodge and ski lodge is minutes away from the home. You can see the ski hills from their front windows. Very peaceful area to stay in. Highly recommended staying here. They provide plenty of amenities for you to enjoy your stay. Loved the natural fireplace!
2022-11-01,5,Group trip,Fantastic place.. great owner.. we left an item behind and Kelli was willing to mail to us.. will be back
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Loved the cabin it was incredibly clean and very homie.
2022-08-01,3,Stayed with kids,"Kelli is a great communicator, and quick to respond with any (and all!) questions. Her place looks very similar to the photos shown. Unfortunately, we didn’t realize her place doesn’t have central air conditioning (our mistake) but not having window AC units in every bedroom made sleeping a bit challenging if you’re used to sleeping in cooler temps. Also- the cleaning fee is the most expensive I’ve seen at an AirBnB rental ($175)! What made it a tougher pill to swallow is that in the “check out directions”, we were told to do all dishes and take out the trash (which we did). All the fees nearly doubled the price of our stay. In my opinion, the place is nice but not worth over $400/night."
2022-08-01,5,Stayed over a week,"The property is a few miles from Caberfae ski resort. Fairly basic, but we had everything we needed during an extended stay. Washer/ dryer in the basement and a/c units on first and second floor were a big plus. The area felt somewhat remote during the summer, but always safe! 40 min from Lake Michigan. During our stay in the summer we visited the upper peninsula, mackinac island, traverse city, petosky, Frankfort, sleeping bear dunes, etc.
The bathroom has been nicely remodeled and there are lots of hooks in bathroom, entry and even in upstairs bedroom which I really appreciate. Also a few USB outlets! The property was very clean and there were sufficient toiletries and supplies for our small family for almost 6 weeks.
The host was great- very accommodating and checked in with us to make sure we had everything we needed. There was a wasp nest and they had it scheduled to be removed within an hour of being notified of it. I have no doubt that they would promptly handle any other more critical issues at the property!
Well equipped with games and other forms of family fun."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,Very comfortable stay to be close to our family reunion. Well equipped and the protein/nut bars were a nice bonus.
2022-07-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Great accommodations, host, & communication. Good value. Very quiet & laid back area."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,A great forest getaway. Six guests and some furry friends were comfortable for the entirety of a long weekend. Minutes from Cadillac and Manistee make for nice day trips. We will definitely consider the Chalet for future visits to Up North Michigan!
2022-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This is one of the best Airbnbs we have stayed at. We have family in the Caberfae neighborhood and we're thrilled when we learned this chalet was up as an Airbnb. We stayed there for 5 nights and 6 days. The chalet is cozy and well appointed. We were impressed with all of the little details and notes.
The towels in the bathroom are super fluffy and smelled really good. I enjoyed sitting on the cute deck while drinking my morning coffee. We made a couple trips into Cadillac and rented a pontoon boat and went around Lake Cadillac. We also stopped at some stores in downtown Cadillac and were thoroughly surprised and happy to see there was a Farmers Market on Friday and a small splash pad for my daughter to run through. The temperatures were high 80s/low 90s and the window ac units helped make things more comfortable, although we loved having the windows open to feel the breeze and hear the birds and trees.
We give it 5 stars and will be coming back in the future."
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Absolutely well planned in advance for making guests comfortable and feeling at home. From kitchen to bedrooms to laundry room, everything was ready for our most enjoyable stay. I was truely amazed at the thought that must have been put in to making this vacation, guest house, a pleasant stay. If I didn't live a thousand miles away, I would stay there every chance I had too get away. I would absolutely recommend the stay here too all my friends and family. Thanks so much for the stay in hospitality."
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The chalet was very clean & the Kelli had provided everything we needed. We really appreciated the instructions she provided both before we arrived & in the chalet & we liked how well things were labeled in the chalet. It made staying there very easy & comfortable. The chalet is very pet friendly & located in a nice neighborhood for walking with our dog.
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Perfect location, great amenities, and a very comfortable stay!"
2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place for a ski weekend. Place is very clean and so much more updated than pictures show. We really enjoyed ourselves in our tiny “up north” getaway.
2022-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Located less than a mile from Caberfae, this is a great place to stay for a ski weekend. Very clean throughout, including sparkling tile in the shower and a clean kitchen with all needed items (we notice these things!). We were particularly delighted by the space in the basement for staging ski gear, and really appreciated the community snow plowing (whoever does this for y'all, they're awesome!) -- the driveway and neighborhood roads were routinely plowed, so happy not to have had to shovel! Charming, comfortable cozy space, nice smart tv (we streamed the winter olympics in the late evening), comfortable beds, and enough space to spread out 2 families. Bonus pet friendly! so nice to bring our little snow loving cockapoo along. The view from the front window of the ski slopes lit up at night while enjoying the fireplace was great too. Easy check in, very responsive hosts."
2022-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,1 of the best air bnb’s we’ve been too! The house is will exceed your expectations and the owners are extremely helpful! My friends and I couldn’t have been happier about our stay!
2022-01-01,5,Group trip,Kelli was an amazing host! Her chalet is super clean and the beds are so comfy. She is very responsive and our group can’t wait to book her next time for our annual ski trip!
2022-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Excellent property near Caberfae and Mackenzie skiing. Hosts were very helpful. The property is in immaculate condition.
2022-01-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This chalet has all the amenities you need for a perfect up north getaway. It was very clean upon arrival. Would definitely recommend, 5 stars."
2021-12-01,5,Group trip,Great place to stay! Highly recommend!
2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This property is as cute as they come. Nestled at the base of Caberfae Ski Resort, in the Center of the Manistee National Forest. Fishing, Hunting, Kayaking, Hiking, Snowmobiling, it's all here. The accommodations are new, clean and comfortable. Our host Kelli was very friendly and quik to respond to all our needs. In the top 1% for Airbnb's. If you are looking to stay in the Beautiful Michigan Northeast, look no farther. Chalet at Caberfae is the place. We will definitely be back!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Thanks again, Melanie! your place was great and you were a pleasure to work with !"
2024-06-01,5,Group trip,"Our stay was really welcoming and comfortable! We had a issue with the plumbing regarding the sink and one of the bathrooms, and they came in less then 10 minutes and got it all fixed up and were very kind and apologetic. Definitely really kind people and beautiful spacious home, we thoroughly enjoyed our stay!"
2024-05-01,5,Group trip,"I cant express how wonder our company stay was.
The house is very cute, spacious, and very clean. We definitely will be staying again in the future. :)"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,Enjoyed our stay. Exactly what we were looking for during a weekend away with our young child. Would definitely stay again. Thank you.
2024-04-01,5,Group trip,We will for sure stay here again. When we come to visit my brother. I have made you my favorite on airbnb!!!
2024-03-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"We were looking for a quiet, restful place while visiting family in Cadillac. This house provided that for us. Nicer than staying in a hotel. While definitely an older farmhouse, it was clean with a comfortable bed, and a well appointed kitchen."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"we had a great stay. house isn't far from town, or Cabrafae. quiet location."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This location was perfect for an extended family gathering. We all arrived at the same time from different locations and relaxed together for the weekend. The house is perfect for a multifamily stay. Warm and welcoming. The pizza recommendation was perfect. We enjoyed playing games and watching deer in the field through the living room windows. The house was very, very, clean upon arrival and the host let us know when it was ready. The kitchen had plenty of cooking items and lots of seasonings/spices. We have no suggestions for improvement."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We loved the house. Plenty of room, clean, nice quiet location; about 20 minutes from Caberfae but it is a pretty drive, and it didn't feel that long. Host was responsive to any/all questions. We are already planning to book next year:)"
2024-02-01,5,Group trip,"We were there for a quick weekend for a ski trip in the area. The place was very accommodating and had everything you would need! We had a hiccup with the plumbing the second night and were not able to use restrooms but David was very responsive and made things right without a question. If we are ever back in the area we would have no issue booking this again! It was clean, warm and peaceful."
2024-02-01,4,Stayed with kids,"Very comfortable beds, coach, and pillows. Lots of spices and variety of cooking items. Alot of renovations and still a few more to go, but didn't affect quality of stay. Annoying that there's no place to put luggage or dressers. Heat made clicking sound when cane on. It didnt bother me, but bothered small kids with me."
2024-01-01,5,Group trip,it was great 20 mins from the mountain ready to get food clean great house
2024-01-01,5,Group trip,"This place was SPOTLESS when we arrived. The bed sheets and blankets/comforters smells like fresh laundry (as they should, but these were perfect). Tons of space. We had ten people and we fit very comfortably, especially in the huge living room or dining room. All amenities were there. Laundry room. Great communication with the host. I think we found our annual spot while skiing at Caberfae. It is a 15-20 min drive to the ski hill but not a big deal."
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This house was beautiful. It reminded me of my houses in the country. I loved it and it was very clean and perfect thank you I will be back
2024-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This home was perfect for our family of 5. Plenty of space to spread out. Kitchen was very well stocked. Beds were comfortable. Very nice decor including the Christmas decorations- it made it all feel very cozy and festive for our NYE stay. The location was great - it was in a peaceful and quiet setting, yet only 23 minutes to Caberfae for skiing, and only 8 minutes from great restaurants and stores, etc. We would definitely stay here again!"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Wow! This was the perfect place for my family to stay while they were in town to visit us. Our house was just too small. The place was so welcoming and everything was prepared for their stay beautifully. We loved the home. Enough spaces for kids to play. It really could host up to 10 people easily.
The welcome basket was a nice touch!"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I had prompt response times with any questions I had. Very accommodating host!
2023-12-01,5,Group trip,"We had a great stay, very clean and attentive accommodating host!"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,David responded to messages within five minutes. He was very helpful and suggested a local pizza place that was delicious. The home was clean and fresh. I made a big meal for friends and the kitchen had everything I needed for cooking. Great place to stay!
2023-11-01,5,Group trip,"I very recommended, nice house"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,Thanks for a great stay.
2023-11-01,5,Group trip,Awesome stay! House was great and I’m a great location. 10/10!
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This place was amazing for us. We had a wedding at Cabrafae Peaks it was a short drive. We did eat at a local restaurant down the road which was also amazing. The weather did not cooperated with us and we would have sat around the fire pit however we played cards and watched movies during our down time. The place was super clean and the beds were very comfortable. If you’re in this area this is the place to go. Your hosts were very quick on their responses at all times.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful place , quite at night close to everything we wanted to do . Had a great time , very relaxing."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The Creek View Farmhouse was exactly as described. It was spacious, spotlessly clean, the beds were super comfortable and the linens were extra soft. We found everything we needed in the kitchen and did not want for anything. We tried a couple recommendations from the house manual and found them to be great! David's communication was timely and thorough. Would definitely recommend for a large or small group."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great home. finding a four bedroom house with a good deal of living space was fantastic. Immaculate, as described and fantastic communication."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Everything was exactly as advertised. Great experience.
2023-09-01,5,Group trip,"Very accommodating and we felt right at home. Our stay was short, but I would recommend this location for any traveler."
2023-08-01,5,Group trip,My family and I were all extremely happy with our stay. Beautiful house that felt like home. Very well stocked kitchen and cozy beds! David was very quick to respond and helpful. We had an action packed few days and we’re so grateful for the flexibility with a later checkout. My family loves to stay in the area and everyone said they’d gladly book the house again. You can tell this is a well loved home.
2023-08-01,5,Group trip,Wonderful home.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,This was our second time staying at David’s place. Just like last time everything was wonderful. The house was very clean and spacious. The location is great. We will definitely stay here again next time we come to Cadillac.
2023-08-01,5,Group trip,David's place was excellent! My group and I were staying here for a wedding weekend and it served as a great home base. The house was bigger than I expected and had everything that we needed. I'll definitely stay here if I'm in the area again!
2023-08-01,5,Group trip,"We were highly impressed with our stay! The home was beautifully decorated, has a cozy seating area around a firepit outside, it had everything needed & more. They have carefully thought through every detail! We may never stay at a hotel again! Thank you for providing such a charming home & enjoyable stay!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was our first AirBNB experience. We could not be happier with our choice to stay at Davids home. The home was much larger then we thought. Spacious, clean. Close enough to Traverse City for a day trip. Very quiet. We would definitely rent from him again ."
2023-08-01,5,Group trip,"Great host, I highly recommend this stay. The house was very cozy and clean."
2023-07-01,5,Group trip,"It was a cute house, with lots of extra things to help us have a good weekend."

2023-05-01,5,Group trip,Comfortable beds and couch. Spacious old farmhouse with modern decor touches. Great parking for trailer and truck.
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,great location
2023-04-01,5,Group trip,We had a great stay! The house was clean. Everything was exactly as described!
2023-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,We had a great stay with my husband's family here! Plenty of room for 7 adults and 2 children. Very homey feel with everything we needed and a beautiful outdoor space for the kids to play. Enjoyed the reasonable drive to Caberfae for skiing as well. Hosts were very responsive and quickly came over when we locked ourselves back. Would highly recommend!
2023-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Very nice home.
Had everything we could think of. Fully stocked kitchen. Plenty of room for the adults and kids to spread out & feel at home."
2023-02-01,4,Stayed with kids,House was clean and it had all the space we needed. We went to Caberfae and it was only 25 minutes away. We ate in Cadillac which was 10 minutes away. Location was convenient.
2023-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,This was the perfect place for our family to stay during a ski vacation. The house was well-stocked with anything we could need and we had space to dry ski gear at night and cook breakfast in the morning. The home was clean and comfortable. There was a snowstorm during the second night we stayed and the driveway was plowed early in the morning so we had no trouble getting out.
2023-02-01,5,Group trip,"I rented David’s house for the weekend to go skiing at Caberfae. The house was 25 minutes away from the ski resort! Some of us went skiing, while others stayed back and explored the surrounding area. There were some cute shops downtown and a couple bars we went into. Everyone we met was very nice! The house was very clean and well kept and plenty of room/beds for everyone to have their own space."
2023-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Had a great time with our family. Plenty of room and loved the separate bedrooms upstairs for our kiddos. Close to town and just a short drive to Caberfae. Perfect place for our family getaway as we were looking to relax and play games and enjoy some quality family time. Had everything that we needed in the kitchen, we ate all of our meals in. A close distance to Cadillac Pathway Trails which we highly recommend as well. Thanks for providing a great place for us to stay David! Becky was also so easy to communicate with and provided a clean home for us to relax in."
2023-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,David made the process easy and painless. Great place for a ski weekend with kids :)
2023-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Enjoyed the stay at David’s Creekview Farmhouse. 23 minutes to Caberfae, really close to both east and west Cadillac. Will definitely be back!"
2022-12-01,5,Group trip,"We went to Caberfae to ski and stayed at David’s place. Great house, clean, pretty decorations, and nicely priced. Super warm at night even it’s 0F outside. David is also helpful with rescheduling."
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"David’s place was incredibly clean, and nicely decorated. It provided a nice hub for our family during a funeral in town. I would recommend David’s place to anyone who is in Cadillac."
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,great place to get away in the country but also minutes away from everything you need! Definitely would come back
2022-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We loved this house! It was cozy, clean and beautiful! It’s located close to town so we were close to shopping and 20 mins from Cabrefae (which was great). There happen to be an act of God that put a kink in the weekend but David and Becky were awesome and went out of their way to put us back on track. If we are ever back in the area this place is at the top of our list!"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,Amazing home! Everythingwas perfect from the moment we checker in til the time we checked out. Had that old farm house feel with plenty room for a large family. Will absolutely book again!
2022-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,We loved staying in this lovely farmhouse! The owners had a well-stocked kitchen as well as convenience items in the restrooms. We enjoyed the comfy beds and cozy living room. It was perfect for our family of grown children with a little one.
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This home was one of the best Airbnb stays I’ve had. The home was very clean, and the homeowners went above and beyond with communication. I received a text from the owner telling me all about things to do in the area, places to eat, and local favorites. That was a nice touch. It’s important to add that the homeowners definitely didn’t spare on the small things- they had the fridge stocked with condiments, there were seasonings, lots of plates, cups, etc. Each shower had shampoo, conditioner, face wash, etc. They included charcoal for the charcoal grill. My friends and I showed up just a few minutes before check in and we had the pleasure of meeting one of the correspondents for the home (we frightened her as she was finishing up cleaning), she gave us some history on the home, and also let us know that she lived one home over- which wasn’t intrusive at all, there was still quite a bit of distance in between each house- and to PLEASE let her know if we needed anything. The beds were comfortable, and as stated before, everything was extremely clean from the bedding to the floors. 10 people comfortably stayed in the home, and we would all do it again. Not a single complaint. I’ve read through some of the other reviews for the home, just note that everything mentioned in the reviews that wasn’t up to par has been changed. Thank you for making our weekend trip stellar!"
2022-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We rented David's house while we were in Michigan for our son's wedding. We were so blessed by the fact that this place fit every need we had so that our whole family could stay together....children, spouses and grandchildren. It was very clean and comfortable. There is very much attention paid to detail and it made our stay perfect!"
2022-09-01,5,Group trip,"Went for a golf trip for 8 of us. This house accommodated everyone and is spacious. Very clean. It’s def a farmhouse which is nice because it’s not too far from anything but still far enough away to just sit back and relax around the fire pit and not have to worry about neighbors. Owners have good communication. The beds were comfortable as well. The A/C units in the rooms worked great, especially if you shut the doors. Fun time and I would go back to this house again."
2022-09-01,5,Group trip,Thanks for sharing your house! Very cozy and comfortable.
2022-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,Thank you:)
2022-08-01,5,Group trip,"We had a wonderful stay at this place. We were in Cadillac for a wedding and this was a great place for family to be together. Everything was as advertised. Even some of the negatives in previous reviews have been addressed (new concrete patio, mattress toppers, etc). This is an old farmhouse that has been updated and they are continuing to make changes and updates. But we found it to be just what we needed.
The kitchen was more than well stocked - thank you for that. We only had one issue with the outlets in some bedrooms not working. It was immediately addressed and Becky came over to flip the breaker for us. It is a known issue they are working on so don’t let that deter your from booking.
There was ample parking since we were a full house. The LR is quite large with a large couch to accommodate lots of people and 2 extra leather recliners. The table holds 8 but there were extra chairs to squeeze in a few more people.
Thank you for the wonderful stay and the welcome basket (local wine, chocolates, and cheez its). I don’t know that our travels will ever bring us back to Cadillac but we would definitely stay here again."
2022-08-01,3,Group trip,"Large house, great for family gatherings. Large kitchen, well stocked with everything you may need. The home was clean, bedding and towels were good quality."
2022-08-01,4,Stayed with kids,"The house was very clean and spacious. It’s in a quiet area but still close to town. Check in was easy. There were plenty of towels. The bathrooms even had some Q-tips, cotton balls, and sanitary products. The only negative was not all the electrical outlets worked and there were quite a few extension cords. It didn’t really affect our stay though. We enjoyed the house and would rent again."
2022-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,We had a fabulous stay! The layout of the house was spacious and each room was so comfortable and well equipped. We were there on hot days but the AC units kept everyone cool. The kitchen was well stocked and the play structure outside was fun for our kids. We would definitely stay here again!
2022-06-01,4,Stayed with kids,Our family stayed 2 nights. There is a lovely beach at Lake Mitchell just down the road. We chose the home for its proximity to the Sleeping Bears dunes (1hour away) and cost. The house was spacious and clean. One drawback was the very low water pressure.
2022-06-01,5,Group trip,The house was beautiful on the inside. It had everything we needed to cook in the kitchen and there were very kid friendly (we didn’t bring kids but there were child sized spoons and extra bibs). The house was very clean and cool when we arrived on a very hot day. Check in and out was very easy. I would definitely stay there again!
2022-06-01,5,Group trip,Very clean. Furniture was comfortable. Easy access to several areas but also in a quiet area.
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Nice old farmhouse. Had a great stay. Would come back. Thanks
2022-06-01,3,Stayed with kids,"This property is an aged farmhouse with modern features that is great for families. The home is near the commercial side of town however it sits on the outskirts so it's sits on an expansive parcel of land with neighbors about a half mile away. the home itself is beautifully decorated with a mixture of old-school class that makes you think of a different time, and the comforts of a modern kitchen and bathroom. The hosts put a lot of love and thought into this home so I wish I could give it 5 stars; the cons of this property were just too many to ignore.
Backyard Porch Area-the deck is literally falling apart and sinking in. So much so that myself and other members of the family all stood in separate corners for fear that the center would cave if we sat on the patio furniture. It was so sunken in that the support of the deck reminds me of a funnel. The small swing set in the back is a death trap. I figured since they said it was for small children we'd be good-nope! My toddler put her Minnie mouse and other stuffed disney character in the swing and pushed them. The swing isn't even cemented or staked down so when she pushed the swing the entire set lifted off the ground with the momentum. As a parent just because you have use at your own risk in the guidebook does not mean that I should be exposed to such unsafe contraptions- knowing it was strategically marketed towards families who would want to use it.
The bathroom: No hot water the entire trip. I'm talking frigid temperatures
Master Bedroom: TV does not work at all because it's an Anon brand TV (cheapest Walmart offers) -luckily the living TV made up for this. However with a big family multiple screens are a must.
All in all we made memories and we loved on one another. The goals of the trip were achieved however I would not have been willing to pay so much for such major fails throughout the home. Hopefully they can make the necessary corrections."
2022-05-01,4,Group trip,nice place
2022-05-01,4,Stayed with kids,"A very nice place to stay. Close to Cadillac and close to Mesick, the reason for our stay. We had a nice camp fire and plenty of room for all 10 of us. I liked having a dishwasher in the kitchen as it made meal clean up so much easier for us. I would rent this house again."
2022-04-01,4,Stayed with kids,"This place was perfect for our large family. There was plenty of room for our children to run around and play inside, the weather turned for the worst while we were there but it was totally fine because of the spaces in the house that the kids could run around and play in."
2022-03-01,5,Group trip,"Highly recommend this lovely home! Excellent host. We came into town for a group birthday party and ski trip and loved having this home to come back to. We all found it clean, cozy, yet lots of space to spread out. We plan to come back and stay here again during the summer & next ski season! Thanks for a memorable experience!"
2022-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,Had an amazing stay! We used this as a home base for our bridal party to get ready and there was plenty of space for hairdressers and makeup artists. We each were even able to have our own bedrooms to sleep in which was perfect!
2022-02-01,4,Stayed with kids,"Lots of room in this big house! You can expect plenty of space, multiple areas to snuggle up and watch TV, get cozy, and listen to your kids try to play the piano. Well stocked kitchen with spices, condiments, and cookware. Two full bathrooms, nice deep bathtub was enjoyable to relax! Clean, organized, with items easy and intuitive to find.
The house is about 20 minutes to Caberfae Peak and only about 5 minutes to Cadillac where there are great restaurants. Washer and dryer available. Ceiling fan in the 'king size' room. Nice lamps all around the house to have on and not return to a pitch black house at night. Easy entry, check in, and great communication.
Overall a great stay if you're in the area to ski. Great value for how much space you get!"
2022-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,Great place to say for a weekend of skiing.
2022-02-01,5,Group trip,Great place to stay!
2022-01-01,5,Group trip,"Well appointed updated farm house a few minutes from town or the lakes. Twenty to twenty-five to Caberfae on snowy roads.
We enjoyed our stay. Both nights were single digit temperatures with snow fall but inside was warm and quiet."
2022-01-01,4,Group trip,"This was the perfect location for our ski trip to Caberfae. The house had everything we needed in the kitchen to make it easy to cook meals and eat together around the dining room table. The only down side was the beds were not very comfortable and we had some trouble sleeping. Between that and the noises made throughout the night from the heating system, it wasn’t the best sleep we’ve ever had. However, it was exactly what we needed for a friends trip away."
2022-01-01,5,Group trip,Great space especially good for families traveling with children. Very spacious. Kitchen was fully equipped but might wanna pack a few seasonings of your own. Me and my family thoroughly enjoyed this home.
2022-01-01,5,Group trip,My friends and I stayed at David's home for a Ski/snowboarding trip at the near by Caberfae Peaks. It was only a 25 min car ride to the slopes and conveniently 5/10 min away from downtown Cadillac. They have a fully stocked kitchen for all of your cooking desires. It was very roomy for the 10 of us. There was extra shampoo/body wash in the showers in the event that one forgets theirs at home. Would recommend this home to those looking to stay around Cadillac.
2021-12-01,4,Stayed with kids,"Lots of space! That was the biggest thing for our family of 7. Loved the spacious living room with seating for all (seating options were all low just to note if you have elderly folks like we did, was very hard for them to get out of chair of sofa). Big dining room table was perfect for our family and loved the extra table in kitchen too!
If renting in the winter recommend arriving early, turn the heat on, and then go explore in town. Was 54 degrees in house when arrived (about 35 outside that day) and took almost 4 hours to get up to 68.
Very quiet location to celebrate Christmas with our family and watch the snow fall!
Think the home will likely just get better as all the interior projects/updates are complete!
Note: being can opener and cooking spray if you plan on cooking!"
2021-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,Lovely home! The house was spacious and clean! The host made the home feel very welcoming. Wifi and options to sign into your television subscriptions were great! House warmed up nicely in the winter weather! Plenty of room for our group of 10.
2021-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,Loved our stay here!
2021-11-01,4,Stayed with kids,"Conveniently located to town, very clean and accommodated our group of 8 easily. Overall good stay but condition of home is not exactly as pictures show. As others mentioned, it was in a somewhat unfinished or improperly finished state (missing outlet covers, non working second shower, sink hot/cold was opposite of what it should be). Otherwise, overall stay worked for our blended family staying in town for a hockey tournament."
2021-10-01,5,Group trip,Great rental.
2021-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We enjoyed our stay here. It was clean and welcoming. Kitchen was well sticked with utensils, pots and pans. We used the fire pit for the cool evenings."
2021-10-01,3,Stayed a few nights,"This unit has a nice location and is close to a variety of things to do and see in the Cadillac area. It was also very clean and spacious. Unfortunately, the pictures were slightly deceiving as both inside and outside the home there appear to be some unfinished projects. This home appears to be a work in progress and has a few updates that could be done."
2021-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"It was a wonderful place to stay! Super clean and has so many little extra things provided like nice hand soaps, kid supplies, and much more!"
2021-09-01,4,Stayed with kids,Our stay here was great! The house has nice new flooring and other updates but also some of the quirks of an older home. It has lots of space and was very comfortable for family. The beds were really comfy!
2021-08-01,5,Group trip,"Roomy home, clean and hosts are very responsive to any needs. Close proximity to many amenities but tucked away from city life."
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great location for our stay, nicely appointed house with plenty of room."
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Cozy house that had everything we needed. The house has a nice washer and dryer and is close to Pleasant Lake.
2021-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,We love the place. It was clean and they have playground for the kids. We all had good experience. Easy to communicate with the host. We will surely come back. 😁
2021-08-01,4,Stayed with kids,"House was clean, large and comfy. One bed was slightly old, we rolled into each in the middle but overall a convenient place to hit up dunes, traverse city and torch lake"
2021-06-01,5,Group trip,"The place was very clean, well stocked, and they were great about communication. We enjoyed our stay with our sons very much. Wished it hadn’t rained so much but can’t control the weather!"
2021-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,peace full place to stay I will rate 5stars
2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Nice spacious House, plenty of room to spread out, comfortable sleeping"
2021-06-01,5,Group trip,"A very nice house. Spacious, clean, and had a good level of privacy for 8 guests. Would go again!"
2021-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,"it's nice, cozy farmhouse style property..near to some awsome locations"
2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This stay was for a work trip and the spaced and value worked out very well for the 5 of us. Great communication from host.
2021-05-01,4,Stayed with kids,"The inside of this house was amazing - clean, spacious, and well-stocked for all of our needs. Having a washer/dryer and high chair were huge perks for us. It was a VERY WARM weekend for mid-May, and David worked quickly to have someone come to the house and install the window A/C units to make our stay more comfortable. I'm so thankful for this. The yard wasn't great with longer grass that led to bugs, but we did spend a lot of time away from the house so it worked out ok for us. Overall we had a great experience and would recommend this place to others."
2021-05-01,4,Stayed with kids,Semi updated farmhouse. Inside is nicely done. Perfect stay for our needs.
2021-05-01,5,Group trip,"My husband and I brought our moms to stay here for Mother’s Day. They absolutely loved the home and it was perfect for our stay. Such a beautiful farmhouse with all the amenities you need, and very clean! Host was kind and responsive. We will definitely use this property again in the future."
2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Awesome place to stay! Super welcoming with wine, chips and chocolate! Spent all night having a fire and listening to the crickets"
2021-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The house was very spacious and the interior was absolutely beautiful! There was plenty of space for multiple people and the beds were very comfortable. Home was spotless and the host even left a goodie basket and a bottle of wine for us! There is also a washer and dryer at the house which is very helpful. Host(s) responded quickly to all our questions as well. We would definitely stay again, highly recommend!"
2021-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Very nice and quiet spot, everything was to a nice standard with the home"
2021-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,Beautiful home!
2021-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Amazing spot. Great hosts. Well cared for property.
2021-03-01,4,Group trip,"Nice place to stay at, quick response
time, and very clean."
2021-02-01,5,Group trip,"Such a cute and stylish home, very comfortable and feels very homey!"
2021-01-01,5,Group trip,David was very accommodating and the farmhouse was clean and much larger than expected. We would definitely stay here again if we are in the area.
2021-01-01,5,Group trip,"Thanks so much for letting us stay! We had a leak in the kitchen sink but our hosts were quick to respond with help and got it fixed almost as soon as it started. We loved your home, honestly much bigger than we were expecting from pictures! We had a really fun time skiing at Caberfae and Crystal Mountain. Thank you for sharing your home!"
2021-01-01,5,Group trip,"David’s place is a very neat home! It has everything that you will need for a weekend vacation. If you’re looking for a cozy home to escape the city, David’s home is a perfect choice for you!"
2021-01-01,5,Group trip,My housemates and I made plans to ski and snowboard at Caberfae and ended up booking David’s place. It’s about 25 minutes from Caberfae but well worth the drive. The kitchen had everything you needed to make great meals. We used the grill outside for pork chops our second night and used the fire pit for a bonfire. The stars are really clear out there and made for some great stargazing. If we go back to caberfae any time soon we’ll definitely be back at David’s!
2021-01-01,5,Group trip,"The place is outstanding, exactly what the pictures show and everything in the house is very neat and organized. Very good with communicating and it helped a lot, very high possibility to return."
2021-01-01,5,Group trip,We stayed here to enjoy some skiing at Caberfae. The resort was 15 minutes away and the cabin was the perfect size for our group. TONS of kitchen supplies and a huge living room were also great touches. Would definitely stay again.
2020-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We had a great stay at David's place! We loved how clean and spacious the house was, and the bedrooms worked out great for our family of 5 (2 adults, 3 young kids). The upstairs bathroom shares a door with the bunk bed room (where the kids were sleeping). The house does need some updates here and there (ceiling, old chairs, etc), but that did not affect our stay at all. We really appreciated the blackout curtains in the bedrooms, and also David's quick response time to our questions. An added unexpected bonus was the Christmas tree in the living room!"
2020-12-01,5,Group trip,"Clean and charming, with a fully stocked kitchen and comfortable rooms. Our kids loved the swingset and the bunkbeds. Wi-Fi worked well and we were able to work remotely without any problems. David was responsive and checked in with us. A great stay."
2020-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Overall, a great place to stay. Very clean and large spacious area. Easy access to things in the area."
2020-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,Super clean and beautiful place
2020-10-01,5,Group trip,"Overall excellent experience! Excellent location, close to everything you may need, yet feels like you're far in the country. Love the large windows from the living room, the soft beds, and the fully stocked kitchen! Thank you for hosting us David and Becky!"
2020-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,My family and I were looking for peace and quiet and we found it. Lovely home equipped with everything we needed. I definitely recommend this home for a relaxing getaway! Can't wait to visit again.
2020-08-01,5,Stayed about a week,"What a wonderful stay! Every step of the way was smooth-communicating about the reservation, check-in, and special touches in the house. I like to cook for my dad when I’m in town and brought some things with me I thought I’d need. Next time I’ll leave most of it home. The kitchen has everything I needed, even a well-stocked spice cabinet. I always bring cream of tartar with me for a pie I make for my dad and I even found that in the cupboard!! The home has many more beds than I used but for the price I couldn’t pass it up. When I bring more family with me in years to come we’ll all be comfortable. It’s a quaint farmhouse with enough upgrades to feel a little luxurious. I had a couple of questions (the answers to which I later found in plain sight in the house) and I had a reply within a few minutes. I grew up in Cadillac so I didn’t need the info about local activities. But reading everything on the home description and what they had in the home manual I can tell you they have it ALL covered. Visiting during COVID-19 I know they went to extra effort to clean everything but you can tell the standards are high no matter what. I’m a little picky about such things and immediately felt comfortable with the cleanliness level. I hope many others will enjoy this AIRBNB experience, but I will cross my fingers this property is a available for ME every time I travel home to Cadillac! Honestly I have flexibility so will likely match my calendar to this home’s availability. Thanks again to David and Becky! We will definitely “meet” again."
2020-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This was a great house! The rooms are great with sweet touches in every room. I’ve never stayed at an Airbnb with so many thoughtful amenities! Everywhere you looked was something handy. The kitchen won the prize though! If you’re looking for a house where you can actually use the kitchen, this is the house! Everything was there and new. Appliances, cookware, utensils, dishes you name it! I always bring essentials from my own kitchen and I didn’t have to unpack them. Loved the kitchen and the big family dining table, perfect vacation spot for my family!"
2020-08-01,5,Group trip,We loved our stay!!! the place was spacious enough for 5 of us with room for even more to stay and super clean! We loved being able to get away and spend time together. We could also see cranes and some other birds each morning from the living room window which was amazing!
2020-08-01,5,Group trip,"This spacious farmhouse home was perfect for our weekend getaway with friends.
We enjoyed eating all together in the dinning area and outside on the patio. The rooms and bathroom were very nice and clean. Ruko TV and large sectional made lounging out in the living room very comfortable for the entire group.
The house came with plenty of chairs for the bonfire (bring your own wood).
Overall fantastic stay, would recommend for families or large groups! I definitely would stay again."
2020-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The farmhouse was great for our secluded family vacation! Plenty of space for the kids to run around on the property. Close enough to town if we needed anything, and not far from local lakes, or a drive to Lake Michigan."
2020-06-01,5,Group trip,"Nice big old farmhouse in close proximity to Cadillac, with some fresh renovation. Great for a group of friends kayaking the pine river."
2020-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We loved our stay here. Great value! Spacious rooms and we were felt at home and welcomed!
Best communication I've had with airbnb travel!"
2020-06-01,5,Group trip,"David was extremely helpful with local tips. The house extremely clean and every room had a tray of water with glasses as well, a very nice and welcoming touch! It was exactly as advertised. We had an amazing stay. Would come back for sure!"
2020-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Loved the large dining room table. Also, Becky was quick to respond to our needs."
2020-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Very clean, host is very responsive to questions, and the house is beautiful. Very affordable and good location, not too far away from town."
2020-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,This sweet farmhouse is the bees knees! It was sparkly clean. Decorated beautifully. And the response time was great. We didn’t have AC units in the house but the co host came over promptly and helped installed one in the warmer living room. Lots of towels. The beds are comfy. And the bottle of wine is a perfect touch for us parents. Close to town. We also did a Walmart pick up order the night before we got there so we just went to pick it up and not have to worry about going shopping. The play set was perfect for my girls. I will 100% be back in the future! Thank you so much for opening your sweet home to our family!
2020-03-01,5,Group trip,Best airbnb I’ve ever stayed at!
2020-02-01,5,Group trip,Lovely home with lots of space! I’d highly recommend to stay here if you plan on being in the area. Very accommodating hosts!
2020-02-01,4,Group trip,great communication.
2020-02-01,5,Group trip,This is a great place for a large group. Kitchen has about anything you need to cook with. Plenty of room for the group to spread out. David and crew are quick to respond to your needs and questions.
2020-01-01,5,Group trip,Great place to stay to ski at Caberfae. Owner was quick to respond and easy to work with.
2020-01-01,5,Group trip,Great location with great amenities. Comfy beds and lots of little touches! Clean and adorable spaces...lots of room!!
2020-01-01,5,Group trip,"Great place to stay , me and my friends loved it! Great place to stay if you want to ski for the weekend and there is plenty around you!"
2019-12-01,3,Group trip,"The stay in Cadillac went very well, and was a seamless check-in/check-out process. It was perfectly priced and thought that it met all of the things we needed throughout our trip. The host was also very respectful and lenient with helping to make our vacation a pleasant one. The previous reviews may not have been as accurate as I had expected. The reviews raved about a farmhouse-style house which I am not sure is very accurate. The craftsmanship throughout the house was quite poor as it was difficult to shut most doors and was hard to get the bathroom doors to lock. It seemed like the house was bought and quickly made into a Airbnb skipping some of the attention to detail that you would have in your own house. Overall, it did what we needed it to do, and nothing more. Thus, the three star review."
2019-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Farmhouse layout -large rooms that are perfect for bigger families or groups of friends. Everything was VERY clean! I am sensitive to scents, but the air fresheners placed around the house (in the sockets) were very pleasant. The upstairs bathroom is huge - and I noticed there was a baby bathtub available if needed. Many updates to the old house have been done - floors, carpeting, upstairs bathroom, windows on the first floor, trim, paint - and still preserving the farmhouse charm! New appliances in the kitchen and many small appliances (coffee maker, crockpot, food processor, etc) help with meal prep and cleanup! The beds are all very comfortable, and the sectional in the living room is so comfy several of us fell asleep on it after a day skiing at Caberfae. Highly recommended!"
2019-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This is a spacious home, perfect for a family, and is very clean. The hospitable touches make it seem as though you’re arriving at a resort, but with all the comforts of home. My family and I would definitely return!"
2019-11-01,4,Group trip,Cute place. Would stay again!
2019-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The house was very clean and smelled really good! One of the top 3 Airbnb’s we have ever stayed at. The host is amazing, responds within minutes and was extremely accommodating to everything we needed. Cabinets had spices, and the fridge was stocked with sauces. Would definitely recommend this place and will surely return!"
2019-10-01,5,Group trip,Cool living room to relax in
2019-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"When you have four young kids, staying at a hotel is pretty much a no-go (we learned this the hard way last year) — ever since, we've been using Airbnb. When we needed to travel to Cadillac, MI for our daughter's dance performance, David's place looked like the perfect dwelling for our family to call home for a couple of days. It's an amazing farmhouse that exudes charm, and our kids absolutely loved it (my wife and I did too!). The extra touches were nice, and saying it is kid friendly is an understatement. I highly recommend staying here whether you're travelling with your own tribe, or are just looking for a cool place to stay in the area."
2019-09-01,5,Group trip,"Great location, only ten minutes from everything that you would need. The house was very clean and well maintained"
2019-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Nice house with lots of rooms!! Great Place for family vacation!!

2019-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This was perfect for us! We loved the inside and the way it was decorated and farm house but modern and the kitchen was fully stocked with more than you can imagine! We had bonfires every night and there was a gift basket for us, and everything we needed!"
2019-08-01,5,Group trip,So welcoming and beautiful! Best Air bnb I have ever stayed at. Lovely host also!
2019-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Awesome place... great host, everything was really good. When we had an issue with the internet the response was really quick.
My daughter, my wife and I spent a great time in this house.
Thank you"
2019-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is, hands down, the BEST Airbnb in the Cadillac area!
The house: This is a true farmhouse style house, and everything from the finishes to the decor reflects that. It’s an older renovated home, but it still has so much of its original charm. The hosts really thought of everything, including toiletries (that you may or may not need), beach towels, and even a cabinet full of spices and seasonings (if you plan on cooking at the house)! It was absolutely spotless and smelled AMAZING as soon as we walked in the door. The shower had good water pressure and the water was nice and hot. There is also a swing set in the backyard and plenty of yard to run in if you’re coming to town with kids.
The location: The house is located in a quiet area just outside of town (it’s about a 5-7 mins drive into downtown Cadillac). It’s just up the street from a lake with a small beach for swimming, and the area is dark enough for some great stargazing on a clear night!
The hosts: They were so great! They made sure we had everything we needed, and were super easy to contact in case anything went wrong (which it didn’t). David even checked in about halfway through our stay to make sure we were comfortable.
Overall, this is one of the best Airbnb’s I’ve stayed in. My husband and I come up to this area every summer, and we will definitely be booking this place from here on out!"
2019-08-01,4,Group trip,"Nice older house, very roomy, only one downside was no laundry room. There is a laundromat in town that is accessible."
2019-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Super cute farmhouse! Spacious, very clean, partially renovated, but thoughtfully done! Very homey and hospitable atmosphere. Left a welcome gift, lots of bedrooms and beds, extra towels and a cute tray on each bed. Really comfy living room. Room a/c in living room and 2 of the 4 bedrooms, but even thought it was like 90 when we arrived, the house was cool. Great kitchen stocked with dishes and pans, etc. Fire pit and small deck was nicely decorated with chairs, etc, even though time didn’t allow us to use. Would definitely return, close to Crystal Mountain and an hour from Sleeping Bear Dunes, which is why we came."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This cabin was perfect for 2! Located on Lake Mitchell and close to food and entertainment. Host was responsive, friendly, and helpful! Cozy for a weekend intimate getaway!!! Wonderful little tiny home ❤️"

2024-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This was a lovely getaway! The entire place is even more beautiful than the pictures show. Everything was so spotless and beautifully decorated for Christmas, up to the smallest detail in each room. We loved relaxing by the fire in the upscale yet cozy living room and enjoying the sound of the lake from the balconies. (They also had such a nice selection of board games and art supplies that my children really appreciated!). We loved the darling library in one of the children’s rooms that had great books for all ages. All the cooking supplies we needed were provided and the beds were all super comfortable. Waking up to a beautiful view of the lake from the master bedroom was a lovely treat. The home was only about 20 minutes from Caberfae Peaks and 8 minutes from a cute restaurant, The Timbers, where we ate one night. Additionally, the host was so so kind, informative, responsive and welcoming. Overall it was an amazing stay and we hope to come back soon!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place for a girls' weekend! Bigger than expected with everything we needed. Comfy beds and couch. Great outdoor space. Would definitely stay again!

2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Extremely comfortable place! All necessities provided! Very comfortable ! Loved the lake view!
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great little place right on the water! We stayed here for a quick weekend snowmobile trip.. we were able to ride to the trail but it’s a bit of a haul. The second day we trailered to trailhead and feel that was the better choice. I plan to bring the family back and stay here this summer with our boat to utilize the lake and all this place has to offer!!! We loved it..
James and Catrina were very responsive and even let us know it was ready for an early check in…"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Always love this place. Winter had arrived with a vengeance and I had freshly plowed drive and shoveled walk every day.

2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My brothers and I went up for Caberfae Peaks and stayed at The Pleasent Cottage for a few days and it was a lovely time. It had a nice warm, cozy feel while still being an open layout. Great big couch and tv to end the nights with. May not seem like a big deal but sound machines in the bedrooms was a nice touch. Being right on the lake was great. Would be fun to go back for a summer weekend and relax on the porch, grill, take the little boat out, etc. Catrina and James were quick to respond and were very courteous. Thank you thank you!"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We loved our stay at this little lake home. It was super quiet off a small drive but easily accessible and within 10 minutes of groceries stores and restaurants. James and Catrina had the place very clean and tidy and decorated with seasonal decor. It was perfect for a weekend away with friends. If we’re ever back in the area during the summer it would be our first choice. The lake view was gorgeous.
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Love this place. It is my go to booking in Cadillac when available. You won’t be disappointed
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,Myself and my family came up for Thanksgiving to see other family. It was a great place to stay and very enjoyable. Beds were very comfortable and I will definitely be getting hold of the host next time we come up to stay.

2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Wonderful place!
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"A great house on the lake. Unfortunately, the weather didn't cooperate (windy & cold), so we were unable to enjoy the deck and backyard fire pit. But great fall foliage views across the lake. Did get to use the nice gas grill as the deck is covered. The house was very spacious and relaxing. The kitchen was well stocked with plenty of counter space. It was the perfect location for our day trip up the coast to Traverse City and down to ride the awesome sand dunes with Sunbuggies at Silver Lake SP. Don't miss this adventure!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Our new favorite place in Cadillac! The cottage was well maintained and clean. Beautiful lake views from sunrise to sunset.

2023-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,Perfect place for a small group that still feels spacious on a beautiful and peaceful lake. It was nice and clean and close to many amenities in Cadillac. Huge plus that the beds were clean and very comfortable ! We would love to come back soon!

2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"peaceful backyard, comfy couch. my daughter loved playing on the beach and in the water. fairly close to restaurants and what not."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Very clean and cozy house that was well equipped for what our needs were.

We are definitely looking to book again next August!"

2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,A lovely and relaxing stay! A absolutely beautiful view of the lake and sunset and a comfy and roomy cottage. Quiet neighborhood and close to groceries and not far from several areas to hike and visit. It was just the break we needed. Thank you so much! 5.0!
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Super location with great views. Very relaxing. First time back to Cadillac for Kathy since 2016. We lived in the area for 16 years and will definitely try to use this place in the future.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"James and Catrina are wonderful hosts and their cottage is all that I hoped for. Very clean. Comfy bed. Nice towels and linens. Very comfortable and inviting place, inside and out. I would definitely like to stay here again!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"A perfect place to relax and recharge. Beautiful lakefront setting. The cottage was perfect! Uncluttered and Very Clean, we had everything we needed, with special, thoughtful touches throughout! We spent an anniversary weekend enjoying kayaking on the lake fishing. The fishing was really good. Then we relaxed by the fire pit in the evenings! This is close to town when groceries etc are needed. We reached out with a question re the TV and James and Catrina responded within minutes! They are very kind and helpful! This is a place we plan to return to and cannot recommend enough!!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,"James and Catrina have a lovely cottage. Comfortable beds, cozy living room, and very clean. Our family enjoyed our stay and hope to visit again."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,James and Catrina made our first Airbnb stay worth every penny! We were nervous and had lots of questions. They immediately put our mind at ease and continued to make sure we were satisfied throughout our stay. The cottage surpassed our expectations! They even provided a stack of games for the rainy days. We will be back!
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Our family had a wonderful stay. The house was so cozy and peaceful and our little one loved playing in the sand. Even with a full day of rain, we could enjoy the view from the covered porch and played board games found in the closet. Would definitely love to stay again!"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed over a week,"Peaceful and quiet area. The home was clean and comfortable! James and Catrina were very personable and kind. Definitely will recommend to friends and family in the future. Close enough to town for a short commute, yet far enough away to have some fresh air and peace and quiet!"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This little house did ot disappoint! Super convenient location, clean and super cute. The house was well stocked. Very comfortable - we LOVED the big sectional for lounging! James and Catrina had everything ready and told us everything we needed to know. Would absolutely recommend."

2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was our second time staying here, and it was lovely! Beautiful house, settings, and comfortable all the way around! James and Catrina make you feel right at home, and we will definitely be back!"
2023-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This is a fantastic Air BnB!! It was easy to locate and we were able to park right by the door which made unloading in the snow and negative temps a breeze. We walked into a very clean and very cozy home. It had all we needed. Although we didn't do many meals at the house, it had what we needed for easy meals. They had a Keurig and a regular coffee maker with coffee for both which was really nice. It was warm and cozy for playing games and watching movies after being gone all day. It is conveniently located to get into Cadiallac and around Cadillac quickly and efficiently. We needed to reach the hosts our first morning there and they were very responsive! My only complaint would be the heater in the living room. It worked wonderfully but is pretty loud when it runs. Definitely not a deal breaker and certainly not a big enough deal to give it less than 5 stars! We will absolutely rent this place again next time we are in Cadillac."
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Absolutely beautiful place to get away for the weekend. Me and my buddy spent a weekend up here ice fishing. Although the ice fishing was not the best at the end of day we were able to come back to a place that felt like home. Overall this place was awesome. Would definitely recommend to family and friends.
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"As soon as we walked in the door I fell in love with this lake cottage! So fresh and clean! We were looking for a place in Cadillac so we could ice fish! It was a perfect location for fishing. The view is beautiful, the Palm Tree light in front was adorable! Comfy king size bed, shower was awesome and the sectional couch perfect! Great host and plan to come back!"
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful quiet getaway! Great hosts and we will definitely be back soon😁👍 Only 20 minutes from Caberfae peaks!!
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"My partner and I were very pleased with our stay. It was a huge perk to find a place to accommodate our furry ones. The dogs and I loved the property. We enjoyed nice walks on the trails, the openness of the land. It was very private and peaceful. The house was clean, and Russell was responsive for any needs that arose. Will stay again."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Russell was great and the place was very clean! Would definitely go back
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Enjoyed our stay very much. Very clean, cozy and comfortable. Russell provided some snacks and treats and coffee that were unexpected but appreciated. Nice private and peaceful setting . If we want to visit the area again we would certainly come back here."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"So clean, so comfortable, and in a beautiful, peaceful setting!!! We enjoyed our stay very much!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I would recommend taking a trip to Cadillac, Michigan just to stay at Whispering Pines Retreat. 100/10.
I stayed at Whispering Pines for two nights and was blown away by how nice it was. I was just looking for a place to stay and rest during my bike trip, so I didn’t have high expectations, but my experience was so amazing that I may have to come back to Cadillac just to stay here again.
I was fortunate enough to stay during a weekend that Russell was there. He is very kind and has an extraordinary gift of hospitality. While being a friendly conversationalist, he still gave me plenty of space and privacy to myself - it was the perfect balance. Russell was born to be an Airbnb host. He is super welcoming, approachable, and fun to talk with.
The property itself was very nice. The rooms were clean and comfortable, and the trails in the back were incredible. I went in the fall and the colors were just turning. It was really easy to relax and spend a day here and I’d love tocome back."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This location is amazing. It’s on a very large property with trails (although we did not get a chance to walk them), yet still a short drive from the “city” feel with some really great restaurants. All things we wanted to go do/see were within an hours drive. This was a really wonderful and peaceful place to stay."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Russell was a great host and accommodated Everything that we needed . We would definitely stay here again the place was awesome, clean, and.
Very serene"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Russell’s place is very comfortable and peaceful. He is available but yet offers privacy. He thinks of the extra little things that helped us to feel at home, be relaxed and be able to get rested. We enjoyed the front porch swing, the surrounding woods and his beautiful flower bed"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Had a great stay, very quiet property close to Cadillac. Clean, as described and Russell was very accommodating. Listing probably actually undersells the outdoor areas, was better than expected. Would stay again!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Russell E.Smith is a soul who gives acts of random kindness in a balanced way .
He gives you a wonderful gift of conversation ,of being heard and understood. I spoke that he has the voice of a narrator,one that is strong and soft at the same time.Ladies,that means pleasing on the ears😉
I have experienced several vacation retreats,yet Russell's, is the best yet.
So if you wish to heal,to destress and unwind with nature ,then The Whispering Pines Retreat is the place to book .
You may sit ,as I did ,on the front porch or at the picnic table and capture some incredible moments of nature.
I saw a family of cranes,I saw several deer that he has within his forest,turkey,rabbits,
robins, and the majestic Eagle.
Across from the forest is a rock wall made by Russell,it marks the beginning of many beautiful trails within the forest.Such beauty!
I hope to return soon .
For me ,it felt like I had been there before, and it was hard to leave ."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Russell's place was absolutely perfect for what I was looking for. I booked it for a friend of mine and found just how nice it was myself! Would definitely recommend this place to anyone looking for a quiet spot to rest and relax. He was a great host!
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Peaceful, simple, quiet place and clean"

2024-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We loved our stay. Such a beautiful, clean, and comfy space with all the amenities that you would need for some time away. Loved all the windows, the secluded area, and the little trail outside of the chalet. We would love to come back and stay here again in the future!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This is a perfect spot if you have a reactive dog you are traveling with as it's very secluded besides the other airBNB that was close by, but there was still plenty of privacy and the extra land with walking trails/snowmobile trails was perfect with the dog."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We had an amazing stay at The Chalet! Jim was extremely helpful and proactive.
The Chalet itself was cozy and clean and was stocked with just about everything you could think of!
The surrounding property was beautiful and very secluded. We took multiple walks around the property with our dogs and had fires inside and out.
The location Is convenient and has anything you'd need around.
The wifi was a bit slow, so no remote working but you can understand why!
I would absolutely recommend The Chalet to friends & family!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Extremely nice host! Very wonderful place to stay, highly recommend."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,Cozy home in a secluded environment. Great place for a weekend away!

The cabin was very clean, comfortable, and accommodating. We would definitely recommend this place to anyone looking to get away and enjoy everything this beautiful area has to offer."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"My best friend and I stayed here over the weekend and had a really nice relaxing time. My dog came with us and she loved the outdoor space to run and play fetch. The beds were cozy and we loved the big windows with all the natural light. The bathrooms were great and we enjoyed curling up on the couch, watching movies, with the fireplace on. Jim was very responsive if I sent him a message and even followed up with me via a phone call to make sure everything was ok. Check in was super easy. My best friend and I plan to come back with other friends/our boyfriends/etc."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,Everything we needed when we arrived.

2024-01-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Absolutely beautiful location. The chalet is warm, welcoming, and full of amenities to make you feel at home. Very dog friendly and lots of land for them to run around on. The host is great, leaves very clear and concise instructions. I really appreciate his organization! We will definitely be back."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,Great place and as advertised. The only drawback would be if you need much wifi bandwidth the verizon cell wifi service is very slow. Didn’t much impact our stay.
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,The Chalet was very nice. Was a Great place to stay and have Thanksgiving with the family.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We had a wonderful stay! We enjoyed walking through the trails with our dogs on the property. Had a fire in the fire pit.

Everything was very clean and Jim was a great communicator with checking in. Our dogs really loved running around outside in the yard and walking around the paths on the property. Highly recommend if you're looking for a place in the quiet outdoors but close enough to the city for shopping/food! Just to note, if your dogs are reactive/non-friendly with other dogs, we found that the neighbor dogs were often wandering on the property and hanging around the deck/house. We just made sure to always keep an eye out when with them to avoid any issues. The neighbor dogs were very friendly to us!"

2022-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Beautiful house and property. The trails throughout the property are awesome with a mix of woods and open field. We also had s’mores by the campfire every night! Inside, the house is nicely decorated and the kids loved the lofted bedroom!

We were having a really tough time finding a place to stay along the drive between Sleeping Bear Dunes and Detroit that would both fit our large family and accept our dog, and this rental exactly fit the bill.

We’re likely to stay here again!
2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Jim's chalet is a peaceful up north getaway. It is a beautiful piece of property surrounded by woods.
2022-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This place is perfect, easy to find, spacious inside and out, private and not too far from necessities. Communication before the stay was timely and pertinent. Written details provided about the house went above and beyond what I'm used to seeing as far as how to work amenities like the fireplace, heating system and entertainment. We had everything we needed for a cozy couple nights, and while an ice storm coated everything on our final morning, a container of ice melt was sitting next to the door for use on the steps and path to the car. We will definitely book again!"

The home was super clean and well appointed with the extras you don't usually see in other AirBnBs like q-tips, make up wipes, seasonings in the kitchen - a nice touch. The property is vast and great for long dog walks. We enjoyed a nice fire in the fireplace and cooked dinner one night. Close enough to Cadillac but far enough to enjoy the serenity. Not far from Traverse City. Jim was super responsive and accommodating to our requests."
2022-03-01,5,Group trip,Great place!! Highly recommend!
2022-03-01,5,Group trip,"10/10 would stay again. Good spot, clean, as advertised."

Jim made great recommendations for recreation and places to eat. His instructors and communication were clear and he was always available. He made it possible for us to add a day to our trip on late notice. We hope to return and do some snowmobiling or fat-tire biking next time. It is a 💯 for an #upnorth experience!"

2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We enjoyed the chalet which had a comfortable bed and recliner, as well a comfy love seat and couch complete with blankets. The location worked well for us to bicycle the White Pine trail which starts in Cadillac near the lake. We also found a path to walk Lake Mitchell near the Depot Restaurant, as well as a nature trail through the forrest and wetlands in Mitchell State Park. The chalet is a 10 minute drive north of Cadillac, and about an hour from Traverse City and Sleeping Bear Dunes. We enjoyed the craft beer and appetizers at Clam Lake Brew Pub."
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Jim was a great host! Everything in the cottage was perfect. Trails were awesome! It was a very relaxing week!
2021-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"Comfy, cozy, and the perfect get away.
The photos don’t do it justice, but it’s absolutely adorable, the grounds are breath taking, and the star gazing is breath taking. Be sure to pick up groceries to enjoy the beautiful kitchen, and definitely follow the directions/tips from the hosts.
I would absolutely love to have the opportunity to stay again!!!"
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Very nice place. Clean for sure. Had everything we needed and more. Very happy with this place. Only negative side is you pay fees for cleaning and you are asked to strip beds, start laundry, vacuum. Maybe that is normal never having used an air b&b"
2021-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,Very clean and relaxing. Enjoyed our stay and the host was awesome.
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Amazing getaway! The house was close enough to downtown Cadillac to do things there but far enough away that it felt remote. The trails behind the property are very well maintained and perfect for hikes. The host was really responsive and touched base throughout our trip to answer any questions. Would absolutely recommend this stay to anyone in the area!
2021-09-01,5,Group trip,"Beautiful place, it’s great for off road riding, walking with nature and the stars are such a sight to see! Fun place for the family to just get away and relax !

2021-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Host was beyond helpful. Instructions were easy to follow. House was very clean and decor was nice. Access to comforts of home such as dishes and such made it very comfortable. Everything was available that we needed. Enjoyed the fire pit which was stocked very well with wood.
The house was very hot even using ceiling fans, fans supplied and opening windows. It's my understanding the host will be installing air conditioning which would make it much more comfortable in the summer months.
Would recommend to my family and friends for sure!
Thank you for the relaxing stay."
2021-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,House was perfect for our family. Jim was extremely helpful and responded almost immediately when we had questions. The house was well stocked with everything we needed (and more). We will definitely return!! Great location!!
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This Chalet offers a chance to get away from the hectic lifestyle and enjoy the quiet of the backwoods.

2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We loved our stay here! The house is comfortable and has a very well stocked kitchen. The trails behind the house are amazing, as is the fire pit and the front porch. Communication with the host was quick and helpful. If you are looking for peace and quiet this is the place for you! We will be back for sure!"
2021-07-01,5,Group trip,"Jim was generous with the firewood. Thank you! When we arrived the fire-pit was waiting for us.

Everything is clean and cozy."
2021-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,This place is wonderful! Jim is really responsive and very cool. The location is close to markets for groceries and restaurants for fun.

2021-04-01,5,Stayed one night,Great job hosting — key was a little hard to find but other than that great experience
2021-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"This was our first venture out for the past year. The property looked secluded which is what we were looking for. Jim was very responsive in answering our multiple questions. When we arrived we were not disappointed. The property is set back and felt very private. The cabin was very welcoming with thoughtful notes and was cleaned thoroughly. Jim provided very detailed instructions regarding the trails. We took our atv all the way to Manistee forest, it was not only fun but beautiful. At night we enjoyed the bonfire and the amazing stars. The scenery was breath taking. Although it was a short trip we are looking forward to booking again this summer."
2021-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"Truly a fantastic experience. Love the location. Trails for snowmobiling and 4 wheeling were outstanding. The Chalet was so cozy and comfortable we felt like home. The next step for us is to buy one exactly like Jim's.

2021-02-01,5,Group trip,What a fantastic place to stay! I wanted to find a place my wife and I could get away for a night for Valentine's Day. A quick drive over to Caberfae and we spent some time skiing and came back to the cabin and made a cozy fire. The property was amazing and the cabin was wonderful. I can tell a lot of effort was put in to making us welcome. We will definitely be back.
2021-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Jim was a great host! He was very helpful with tips on where to go and what to do.
The house and property are amazing! Our group will definitely stay again."
2021-02-01,5,Group trip,"Absolutely fantastic up north weekend away destination! The house was beautiful, warm and comforting, clean and on beautiful property. Jim was amazing at communication. He provided great and quick responses before we arrived and we had all of the directions to the home so there was no questions or guessing once we got there. Even his directions to get to the home and for the property trails were spot on. The property is amazing; I personally snow shoed and it was beautiful. He made sure the driveway was cleared (lots of snow the night before we arrived!). We spent most of our time at Caberfae which was about 25ish minutes away.
The inside of the house has a very open concept which was nice for a group of friends hanging out. The house was well stocked (they even had kitchen spices, oils, etc). They had a lot of little touches that made the home feel so welcoming (cute coffee bar, extra toiletries for if you forgot something, hand warms). Everything was clean and well organized. Beds were comfortable with plenty of blankets and pillows. Fireplace worked great and was so relaxing.
We look forward to booking another trip to this great home. Highly recommended."

2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I had just stayed with a couple friends of mine. We are a small group of college kids wanting to do something for our Spring Break.
Claire and Ethan’s place is the perfect distance from Caberfae Peaks (which we spent most of our day at) and the town which had considerably good food. We went to: Clam Lake Beer Co, 13th Street Market, and Timbers. The drive to Sleeping Beer Dunes was good as well, I recommend it if you like to hike. Sunsets at the lake are amazing as well.
Claire and Ethan were very responsive and gave clear instructions and answers to any questions. The place is super clean, has all the amenities you would ever need, and has a comfortable vibe to it. I HIGHLY recommend coming here if you want to get a small trip in."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Was a nice little place and was secluded just outside of town
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Overall, Claire and Ethan’s place was amazing for our group! It was close to everything. Their cottage was cozy and had all that we needed! I would recommend their cottage if you want a nice getaway! :)"

2023-09-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"If you are looking for a quiet place to stay in the Cadillac area, this is a great spot. It is close to DT and the lake. The string lights in the yard and electric fireplace in the living room really pull together this location. The outdoor space is very nice with the fire pit. There is an extensive checkout list where you will be asked to do laundry, dishes, and take the trash out on top of the cleaning fee."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Loved staying in Claire and Ethan’s beautiful little cottage. Lots of bed space and the couch is very spacious and comfortable as well. The backyard was wonderful for late night fires and just to sit out, very private and lit up wonderfully. The area was also beautiful, lots of restaurants, trails, and lake activities to do. Personally liked the Mitchell State Park trails the best. Would definitely stay here again, tucked away in a nice quiet neighborhood too."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"super clean, so much included for the price, great for my group of friends for a weekend trip!!"
2023-08-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"It was a very nice place to stay, Very Clean and convient and was perfect for what I was looking for. My only thing was I rented it for 6 nights with full intentions of staying there for 6 nights. Got there Tuesday night and on Wednsday my wife called me and was on her way to Emergency with my dog. Turned out he had Phnemonia and was admitted in to the Hospital. Needless to stay I packed up and headed home asap. I messaged Claire and Ethan that I had to leave but I may be back. On Thursday it was evident I could not return as my dog was Critical so I messaged again that I could not return. Now they were not obligated to give me any refund but the Courtesy thing would have been to offer a partial refund,
For that reason I would not give it 100% shame it did not work out but sometimes it would be nice to see someone just do the right thing just because they can."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,We enjoyed our stay. Good set-up and had all the things we needed.

2023-06-01,3,Stayed with kids,"The location was great. Super quiet and so nice. My family and I were there for almost two weeks, and felt very comfortable even though the cottage is quite small. The backyard is super nice if you have kids, and the street is walkable/bike rideably safe. Be aware, this cottage is damp and does have a detectable mildew smell in the bedrooms, hallway and bathroom, if you are sensitive to those smells. Other than that, no complaints. Beautiful area to spend a number of days."

I hope to be back up here very soon!
Such a WONDERFUL HOST!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"The owners were so responsive and friendly. Cute little cabin and nice neighbors. We loved that there were big trees and a large porch. We mistakenly thought it was right on the water, but it was about 5 cabins down—still totally walkable, even for our 5 year old. Water was nice and shallow. Well-stocked cabin and we loved that there were dishes and cooking stuff for everything we needed. Bring firewood, so you can enjoy the pit!"

2023-05-01,4,Stayed a few nights,We enjoyed our stay at Aunt Tina's cabin. It was a great home away from home. Our son was ecstatic about the walkable distance to the lake so he could fish. Very minor issues with non-working coffee maker...but there was also a Keurig so we had our coffee. The water pipes seemed to sing us songs but everything worked well. Overall it was a fabulous stay and we will definitely book Aunt Tina's again in the future!

Super cozy, nicely decorated and appointed, and Tina is a great communicator."
2021-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Cute cozy house close to Lake Mitchell. Very clean and well stocked. Tina is a good host. Lots of snow while we were there. Streets were plowed even though this is on a side street. Very quiet with lots of trees.
2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Wonderful cabin and hostess! The cabin is cozy and contains all the items needed to make for a relaxing vacation. A very well stocked kitchen, large beds with firm (no sagging) mattresses and tons of large soft towels. The home is near Lake Mitchell and in a few seconds you can sit on the dock and enjoy the water and wild fowl. Shopping in Cadillac is a snap and the location lends itself to a quick drive to Traverse City. We visited in late Fall and look forward to returning in summer to take advantage of the lake, bike trails and local attractions. I have no reservations recommending Aunt Tinas cabin and plan to stay again in the future."
2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We enjoyed the cabin. It was quiet and peaceful. It’s a ten minute drive to downtown Cadillac which is nice.

2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,An amazing cottage that is pet friendly and nearby Cadillac. My wife and I rode our bikes to and from town a few times to check out Long Road Distillers' new Cadillac tasting room as well as Clam Lake Beer Company's pizza and beer. The cottage is on a road that is semi-residential and part of a hiking/biking path that circles both Lake Mitchell and Lake Cadillac which again makes it great for low-key cycling. My wife and I and our pups will definitely consider staying here again when visiting family.

2021-09-01,4,Stayed with kids,"Very cute and comfortable. We traveled with our elementary-aged kids and they especially loved a foosball table in the cabin. Most everything we needed was included (bring beach towels). Couch and beds were comfortable which is very important! The cabin is small but cozy and laid out well.
Location was very convenient. Fire pit was nice. The grill was full of water so I wouldn't plan to use that.
The cabin is situated in a court with other houses/cabins, and at the end of the court is a dock and the lake. Really nice if you want to bring your own kayaks/canoe. It is not *on* the water, so if you want a deck to look out at the lake this isn't it."
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This place was perfect for our small family! We really liked that we could bring our 2 dogs with us. It was small and quaint.

2020-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Beautiful place! Great views, nicely located by Caberfae (20 minutes) and the right amount of space. We have 2 kids, 2 dogs and 2 adults and it was perfect for a little vacation to ski and relax as a family. Bring your amazon fire stick to watch movies on their smart TV and cuddle up by the fire. The kids loved sharing the king size bed and the whole place was beautifully decorated and clean. The hosts were wonderful at communicating and we felt at right at home.

2020-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great experience staying in a cozy and super-clean cabin! It's very apparent that the cabin is newly remodeled as everything seems brand-new. The layout is very comfortable and surprisingly spacious, too. We arrived during a snowstorm that dropped 6"" but never felt cramped at all while hanging out indoors for several days. The beds are comfortable and the kitchen has every implement you can think of! We celebrated Thanksgiving dinner with our kids and had a wonderful time dining and playing board games afterwards. Highly recommended!"

2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,Perfect cottage. Brenda was awesome to communicate with. Very relaxing and quiet even with other cottages near by. So close to anything you need but still feels like you're away from the world. Lots of essentials available in the house and clean up was easy. had a great time and better memories.

2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Brenda is absolutely amazing! Such a great host - extremely responsive and accommodating always. The place looks and feels exactly like the photos portray it. One thing to make special mention of as I don't think you can tell completely in the photos - is that the beach itself is extremely pristine and well maintained. There is no muck whatsoever and you can walk pretty far out before the water even starts to hit your waste. This made it absolutely perfect for our two 3 and 5 year old boys. We could relax on the beach while they played in the water and not have to worry about much at all. They absolutely loved it and our 3 year old actually cried when we pulled back into the driveway of our actual house at the end of the vacation (saying ""but I want to go back to the vacation house!!!""). So, five stars all around and really, we just can't say enough about Brenda as a host. She was so great and this vacation was absolutely perfect."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,Brenda was wonderful. We had a couple questions and she got back to me asap. The house was beautiful and we were really able to feel right at home. We will definitely be back.

We have property about 15 minutes away, great place to come back to relax after a long day of working at our property. We decided to go up a day early and asked Claire and Ethan if the house was available to add an additional night, they responded right away and even offered the additional night for a discounted rate. Thank you!!! Kitchen was well stocked and the bottled water and treats were a nice touch when we arrived. Only thing I have is we felt awkward taking a shower in the master bathroom as there is no curtain in there. Otherwise the stay was perfect and would defiantly recommend for a peaceful, relaxing getaway. Out of town just enough to get away but close enough to run to town if you forgot anything."

2023-02-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"We've stayed in Cadillac before and love the area. The area was quite and peacful. The house was warm, comfortable and had plenty of room for the four of us. The kitchen was great and everything was super clean. It was nice to have decent Internet access. We loved the heated bathroom and kitchen flooring. Close to downtown and grocery stores. Close to the Cadillac pathway for snowshoeing and snow biking."
2023-02-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Was a perfect setting as my husband was working in the area and I was working from Claire and Ethan's place. The internet was rocking. I don't think I've had such great internet working remotely. It was even better than was stated! The place was super clean too. The only issue we had was there had recently been some bad weather and the driveway and part of the sidewalk were super icy. We were a little worried about that coming and going but were able to navigate it. Beautiful trees surrounding the house and a quick 2-minute walk to the public access would be fantastic in the summer.

2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,A great place to stay for a Crystal Mountain ski weekend!
2023-01-01,4,Stayed with kids,"I stayed here with my husband and 3 kids over New Years. It is a great location, 20 min drive to Caberfae for skiing. The house is in a nice, quiet neighborhood. The place is clean, with lots of room. The beds were comfortable and the bedrooms and bathrooms were large. The kitchen is stocked with everything you need.
The only reason I give this 4 instead of 5 stars is the fact that the house smelled a little musty like the heat vents haven’t been run in a while. The air in the house was really dry and we finally looked a little harder the last day and realized that the air was set to circulate in the house every 30 min. Once we shut that off it got a lot better.
The other thing is that the oven had a gassy smell when turned on that was a little concerning at first. My husband is pretty handy and looked at everything and it seemed to be safe and working fine and the smell went away after if was running for a minute."
2022-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Claire and Eathan’s place is absolutely beautiful. Claire was fast with a response with local attractions recommendations, and when we had to leave early to due to a storm she was more than accommodating. We can’t wait to come back."

We loved this cottage. It was perfect for our family weekend getaway. Claire and Ethan were super hosts. They were quick to respond to every message we sent. The cottage was clean and comfortable. It was like home away from home. We would recommend staying here to anyone. It was close to restaurants and stores, yet still nestled away from the busyness of city life. Everything you need is within 3 miles of the cottage.
Next time we come to Cadillac, we will try to stay here. You won’t be disappointed, we weren’t. 😊🍁"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,Place was beautiful and above and beyond for cleanliness! Definitely a hidden gem!

Unlike the homes on the bigger lakes, it’s north of the city’s light pollution and away from the traffic noise of the busier roads. Walk over to the beach for stargazing, or sit quietly outside to listen to the songs of loons, owls and frogs.
Clare and Ethan are wonderful hosts and incredibly prompt in responding to questions.
The house was wonderfully clean, the beds were comfortable and the towels were nice. I would definitely stay here again!"

2024-04-01,5,Group trip,Great place for our girls weekend!
2024-03-01,5,Group trip,Great location just a few minutes from downtown Cadillac. Wish we could have been here during a season to enjoy the lake. Loved the all season sunroom. Nice table to play cards/games. Beds were comfy but it is an older cottage with wood floors so floors creak and sounds travel (be prepared for this with white noise or ear plugs if you are a light sleeper.) Shower in main full bath is pretty tiny but master is normal size. Kitchen had everything we needed. Ninja coffee pot and Brita water pitcher make awesome coffee. Host super flexible-offered early checkin (which we couldnt use) and was able to give us a little later checkout since they had room in the schedule to do so. I also love that there wasn't a laundry list of chores to do upon leaving the house! Would stay here again!

They stayed in the ""bunk room"" and enjoyed kayaking every day on the lake. The space was very spacious and had plenty of seating for my large family. There were various board games that the kids could enjoy as well. We felt right at home from the time we walked in. Lovely home in a quiet neighborhood, was absolutely perfect."
2023-10-01,5,Group trip,"Beth and Keegan were phenomenal hosts! Our original air bnb was cancelled last minute and we were so lucky they had availability to fit our group of 10! The house was well set up and the first floor was open concept so we had plenty of space to play games and hang out. There were three bedrooms and a loft so everyone had their own space. Beth and Keegan let us check in early since we had guests coming in from out of town which was much appreciated.

The canal on the back of the property has woods rather than houses on the other side. This gives the back deck and view from the dining table a ""nature preserve"" feel. The home was clean and comfortable and had everything I needed for my stay."
2023-03-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"place was great, but the side door does not close. do not try to ever use it, you'll have to take the door hinges off to slide it back into place?. that was really weird. if there was a sign or something stating this we simply never would have opened the door. great other than that"

2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"If you want a Little place on the canal and kinda private for the area, this is the place. It has a larger lot than those on the lakeside so you're not so close to the neigh or yet you'restill on the water. Fished right in the backyard!

2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a wonderful time at Leann’s place. It was pleasantly well stocked with so many of the extras - condiments, salt/pepper, disposable plates, and even some canned goods. She had campfire wood all ready for us. My family enjoyed taking out the two single person kayaks. There are also two inflatable double person kayaks to use and several life jacket for the short trip on the canal to reach Lake Mitchell. We look forward to returning. Leann had great communication and was so helpful both prior to the visit and if we had any questions."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This was our first experience with airbnb and it was fantastic. The home delivered exactly as promised in the pictures and the description provided by the hostess. There is something extra special about returning to a home (instead of a hotel) after a day out on the lake and the beaches...something that made us feel warmer inside. And all the hard work that Leeann has put into making this house a home is responsible for those feelings.
The inlet to the lake is simply delightful--very calm, and no mosquitos! Twice in the mornings, while munching local donuts we saw a blue heron across the water stalking his own breakfast.
The house is as neat as a pin, with every convenience for a summer stay, from central air to a hot shower. Our boys thoroughly enjoyed the kayaks as well. Leeann was a tremendous hostess. If this is a typical experience, we definitely will be using airbnb in the future!"
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great location and the cottage is very cute! Updated interior and very nice, large yard on the channel."

2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,lovely little cottage with a beautiful view. Great location. Leeann is more than accommodating. spend waster weekend with my family there and we most definitely didn't want to leave by the end of our stay. we will be returning over the sumer months
2024-06-01,5,Group trip,Very nice and peaceful place to stay. The rooms are very clean and organized. The host also prepared variety of snacks that were very helpful for calming down kids.
2024-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"This was the perfect place to stay. Close to everything we were in town for, close to restaurants but far enough away it was quiet."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,This was a great place. We will most likely use this place again next time we need to stay in Cadillac over night during the winter months. Place was very spacious and comfortable. We stayed here with another family of 3 and might invite another family next time. There was one room we did not even use.
2024-02-01,5,Group trip,Amazing stay!! We will definitely be back!
2024-01-01,5,Group trip,Great place to stay!
2024-01-01,5,Stayed with a pet,This was a church basement however it was amazing they thought of everything. Other than walking down a few stairs there is nothing church basement about it. Photos are accurate this was an amazing space to spend time with family. Plenty of room for everyone.
2023-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"We loved this location! This was a quick girl's trip, and it was perfect. We each had our own beautifully decorated room, a huge comfy couch in the living room with a large tv, and a wide-open kitchen with a bar to sit at. We were all able to socialize around the kitchen counter comfortably. However, the best part was waking up to the beautiful horses next door. They are out in the pasture at sunrise. We made our coffee and sat outside to enjoy it. This place is beautiful inside and out and super clean which is a must for me! We can’t wait to come back in the summer and enjoy the outside more.
The only thing that we would recommend if you book is to bring your own coffee and creamer if you are a snob like me and don't drink regular store brand coffee or powdered cream. Other than that, lots of extras like bottled water, some boxed food and candy."
2024-02-01,5,Group trip,Great place to stay.
2024-01-01,4,Group trip,"Great location,right on lake Mitchell. House was warm and inviting. Stephanie was very responsive and helpful. Will be back hopefully next time we will have more ice to go ice fishing"
2023-12-01,5,Group trip,The home was wonderful. Very spacious and clean! Would definitely visit again in the future…
2023-11-01,5,Group trip,We had an outstanding family gathering at this very nice unique family-style home with an awesome view of Lake Mitchell. This home was a perfect fit for us.
2023-10-01,5,Group trip,"Great house for a larger group as the living areas are large, big table so you can all sit around together and beautiful big windows to view the lake. Kitchen is very big as well. Communication was very good as well. Very easy to find the home and location was great."
2023-10-01,5,Group trip,"We enjoyed our stay , had beautiful weather to enjoy the lake view. Love the Cadillac area."
2023-09-01,5,Group trip,"I've been to many airbnbs and this one was the most welcoming. Just something about the vibe of the home was so cozy and peaceful. Also one of the most stocked homes I've stayed at. Everything you could think of was in the kitchen cabinets to the bathroom cabinet to the hallway cabinets. Matthew was very quick to respond to any questions/concerns I had. The family loved the home, inside and out. Maybe the only concern they had was just the old furniture (couches and mattresses). But that wasn't a big enough concern for us not to be back!"
2023-09-01,5,Group trip,"Wonderful stay - we will definitely be back. Beautiful location, quiet and had everything we needed for our stay."
2023-08-01,5,Group trip,Large open floor plan that was conducive for our family and guest. Minor updates needed but overall the home was perfect for the stay in Cadillac and the water just added an addition perk
2023-08-01,5,Group trip,"This was such an enjoyable stay. The hosts were responsive and helpful, and the location was fantastic. We will be back!"
2023-07-01,4,Stayed with kids,Roomy. Need to repair windows so you can open all the way. Blinds in bedrooms need replacing. My family enjoyed our stay.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We spent a week at Idlewind with various of our 6 kids and 15 grandkids joining us periodically throughout the week. It was wonderful for littles -- very shallow and easy lake to play in! Didn't catch many fish, but had a great time trying! Great interactions with the hosts, and even the neighbor was friendly and offered any assistance we might need! The kids played a zillion lawn games and put a lot of miles on our kayaks and Stephannie's paddle boards. In spite of the rain and cooler temps (especially appreciated by the Arizona branch!), we had a fabulous vacation for all."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We had a wonderful time on the lake, the house had everything we ever needed and more. It was cozy, comfortable, and roomy with many games/books/puzzles. The seating was large enough for family/friends dinner, we also enjoyed meals outdoors by the water. The water was shallow and warm, kids were in and out all the time. We appreciate hospitality and great communication before and during our stay. We also went fishing a lot on our boat and had great luck with picture-worthy fish. The downtown area was nice too and we were surprised to feel in town while in the middle of nature. The weather changed a lot for us on the lake too, from windy cold to super hot - so be ready to adapt quickly. Bonfire nights were fun and the lake is very quiet. Thanks to Stephanie and Matt for sharing their wonderful home with us."
2023-06-01,4,Stayed with kids,"Overall the stay was great! The outside of the house needs a lot of maintenance and cleaning. The screen door on the side of the house needs to be fix, we couldn’t keep the door open for air flow because the screen was broken. The inside was clean and just as described. Lake Mitchell is beautiful and great for swimming!"
2023-05-01,5,Group trip,Great place to stay with a lot of things to do close by. I would definitely recommend.
2023-04-01,4,Group trip,Absolutely wonderful view. Such a unique nostalgic home. Loved the original woodwork and loving touches that made our experience delightful. We found the beds so comfortable and appreciated all the thoughtful accommodations. Our stay with seven sisters was very nice.
2023-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,Great location on the lake.
2023-02-01,5,Group trip,"Stephanie’s place on Lake Mitchell was fantastic. Great location, place was clean, and Stephanie was a very responsive and helpful host. Would definitely stay again!"
2023-01-01,5,Stayed about a week,Great place and host! We will stay again forsure.
2023-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,This was our second stay at this lovely home. It is perfect for our multiage family of 3 generations! There are so many sleeping options and more than ample space to spread out for various activities. A favorite spot was at the large round table in the game room that overlooks the lake! We had 2 large jigsaw puzzles going and were entertained by watching the ice fishing action. The kitchen is awesome band we’ll-equipped with everything we needed. Great bath/shower and very comfortable beds! This won’t be our last time staying at this gorgeous property!
2023-01-01,5,Group trip,We stayed with 7 of us and had a lot of room plus room for more. The whole house was stocked with all the things you need. It was nice having everything you need in the house without needing to go buy everything. Great place to stay with some cool local bars and coffee shops.
2022-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The lake house is one of our favorite places to visit. It is perfect for all family types, we have a family of 8 and it accommodated us perfectly. Plenty of space for everyone to sleep, sit, and eat. The location is perfect, just minutes from the Cadillac West area with bowling, shopping, dining, and skiing. Downtown Cadillac is 10 minutes away with several shops, restaurants, a movie theatre, ice skating, more bowling, and so much more. The house has plenty of linens provided as well as everything you need to make your stay feel like home."
2022-10-01,5,Group trip,Couldn't have found a place that was better for us then this location. Great waking up in the morning on the lake and a very convenient walk to grab a hot cup of coffee.
2022-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The home was perfect for our needs, wedding weekend in Cadillac. Would love to return and bring a boat during summer months! Loved the view of the water from the very large round table."
2022-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,Awesome spot for a large group right on the water!
2022-09-01,5,Group trip,Great location and beautiful home. Easy to communicate with and the place is exactly as described.
2022-09-01,5,Group trip,"Our stay on the lake was wonderful. It was our 2nd year and our family enjoyed it immensely. We look forward to coming back next year.
Our hosts were very accommodating. A nice home, and a great location."
2022-08-01,5,Group trip,Our friends group had a great time at Matthew and Stephanie’s lake house. The communication was super easy and quick and the place looks exactly like it does on the pictures. The neighborhood is very conveniently located in Cadillac and it’s a great home with amazing views! Don’t hesitate to stay here and I would absolutely recommend friend groups and families to stay here. Thanks again for your hospitality.
2022-08-01,5,Group trip,"Very spacious home. The dining table overlooking the lake is a perfect place to have a meal. Sitting outsit and having a meal is great too. The lake views are delightful. The kitchen is well equipped for all your cooking needs. Want great ice cream, head across the street to Thistys. It is pretty charming. The bathroom on the main floor is large, larger than you could ever need. Home has a lot of craftsmen details if you like that sort of thing. Point on the lake. The water is only about 3-4 feet deep for a VERY long way out (think like 100 ft or more). It is sandy and rocky (you may want to bring water shoes). This is nice for kids, don't have to worry about them getting in over their heads. If you have blow up floating chairs, good place for those too. Star gazing is delightful and the bonfire area is nice. A great summer getaway for me and gal pals."
2022-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We had a wonderful time at Idlewind, a perfect vacation to celebrate my moms birthday. The house is very spacious, we had plenty of room- never felt on top of one another. It was a great location, easy to find and centrally located to many other destinations. Communication was great with the hosts. We hope to be back someday. ❤️"
2022-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,Our stay was very nice. The place is very kid friendly. The kids enjoyed the sand and water so much. We would stay again.
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This place was perfect for our family vacation. Super spacious, great location, and all the comforts of home. It has a mix of new updated furnishings and an old cottage feel. The kitchen is gorgeous and very roomy. Perfect for buffet style dinners once you figure out the induction stove top. Lots of seating throughout the home, and all the beds were very comfortable. No waking up with a back ache. And the lake is perfect for little kiddos as it is very shallow for a long way out. Just don’t forget your water shoes as it is rather rocky but hardly any seaweed. We loved the paddle boards and caught several nice fish during our stay. Definitely a place we would recommend for those looking for a great place to host a big family gathering."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Our family had a wonderful stay. The house was spacious enough for our group, which included 5 adults and 4 children. The kitchen was spacious and well stocked with all the cookware and utensils needed. And views of the lake from the large dining room table were very welcoming throughout the day. Living the “lake life” sums up our experience. From water activities like paddle boarding, provided by the host, to fun backyard games, we thoroughly enjoyed our time at the property. We would happily return and make more memories together as a family."
2022-06-01,3,Stayed with kids,"Overall we enjoyed our stay. The house met our needs and is in a great location. An assortment of fun items were available for use to enjoy our time together as a family and on the water. Quiet location with plenty of shade to hide away from the heat. Great parking spaces out front. Proximity to the convenience store across the street was great. The ice cream is amazing? The old gal has a lot of character and with some attention could be quite the charmer.
What disappointed me was the overall condition of the property and lack of maintenance. There seems to be quite a bit of deferred maintenance (roof, gutters, carpets, windows, grounds).
First impressions are important and this home failed on many levels. Don't expect the cleanliness of a 5 star hotel. Consider this more like a family or friend's home that doesn't have time for maintenance and you dropped in unannounced."
2022-06-01,5,Group trip,Step back into history at this old lake house. Nice location. Good communication with the host. Loved the coffee they supplied. Everything is very basic but its a nice place to have the family gather. Great big card table for everyone!
2022-06-01,5,Group trip,Great location and great hosts! Love the lake and all the wildlife! The location is close to a stores and restaurants which is extremely handy!
2022-05-01,5,Group trip,"This house is amazing; absolutely surpassed all of our expectations! 7 of us came for a memorial day vacation, and the house was so large that we didn't use half the rooms. Generally when I am on vacation, I explore the area and don't spend much time where I'm sleeping- but we only left the airbnb once! We spent the whole weekend in the water, backyard, and dining room playing games with that great view. We are planning on making this an annual trip because we all loved the house so much!"
2022-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,Great place!
2022-05-01,5,Group trip,"What a wonderful home right on the shores of Lake Mitchell! We stayed for 4 days and we’re able to prepare for our daughters wedding in the Cadillac area. All 5 bridesmaids and the bride were able to get ready for the wedding at the house and we were able to serve the bridal party a big breakfast the morning of the wedding. Plenty of cooking space, equipment and plenty of table seating! Love the big table by the window overlooking the lake! This house was unique in that it could accommodate so many people. Also, comfortable furniture to relax in! Very charming home. Would love to return when we aren’t preparing for a big wedding, although it was the perfect place to do that! Thank you Stephanie and Matthew"
2022-05-01,5,Group trip,This is a great house with a beautiful view. The lake was amazing and the house was very clean and inviting. We were talking all weekend about how beautiful and spacious the house is. The host responded very promptly any time we needed them.
2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This is a beautiful and comfortable home right on Lake Mitchell. The four of us had a wonderful mini vacation.
2022-03-01,5,Group trip,great place to stay
2022-02-01,5,Group trip,"Great location. House furnished to host up to 10 guests very easily. Owners fast to respond. WIFI awesome. ""Alexa"" helps you with music and lights. Will be back for sure."
2022-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This was a fantastic place to stay. Our kids loved it, and the hosts were very accommodating."
2022-02-01,5,Group trip,Place was everything we could ask for plus some!
2022-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This cottage is awesome beyond words! The beds were super comfortable! The view of the lake from the large picture windows was breathtaking! The kitchen was a cook’s dream come true! There are multiple living areas that allowed our group to disburse for varying activities. What a wonderful weekend!! We can’t wait to return! Thank you so much for sharing this magical home with us!
2022-01-01,5,Group trip,"Our group of 8 was so delighted with this lakeside rental we got for our annual winter trip in late January. The place has everything you'd need, plus the view of the frozen lake was postcard-esque. The cooks in the group were impressed with the well-stocked kitchen and there was so much space to spread out and play games, put together puzzles, etc. It was perfect. If you're a light sleeper, bring ear plugs because the snowmobiles get going on the lake early-ish. Five stars for the space and Stephanie and Matt's timely communication!"
2022-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,Very comfortable family home with an amazing view!
2021-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Our extended family including 6 adults and 5 toddlers under 5 spent
two nights around Christmas at this wonderful home. Spacious rooms, awesome well stocked kitchen, and cozy bedrooms. There were even some toys to play with! We cooked Christmas meals including breakfast pancakes, and turkey dinner. The owners responded quickly to our questions. Thanks so much! We will be back!"
2021-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,Spacious house. Perfect for large family gathering. Very large kitchen made Thanksgiving dinner prep a breeze.
2021-11-01,4,Group trip,Beautiful setting right on the water. lots of space to spread out in. ideal for larger families. Close to downtown.
2021-10-01,5,Group trip,Great place to stay. Lots of room and great location on the lake. We used the fire pit and had a great view of the lake! Would highly recommend this place.
2021-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,We had a great visit at Stephanie's property. It's a beautiful location and the house is as presented in pictures. My only suggestion would be add a handrail on all of the stairs. Half of the stairway does not have a handrail and that limited older folks from going upstairs. We also traveled with our baby and it would have been an added security while carrying a child. We absolutely loved the large table in front of the picture window by the lake and the bonfire pit. We would stay again!
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This Dutch Colonial is an expansive family-oriented house with a 180° view of Lake Mitchell, an easy walk to a convenience store. A well-equipped kitchen and game room only add to the fun, along with a lakeside bonfire pit and fenced-in front yard. We were there in late October when the boats had been taken in, so we can't speak to the water sports it offers. The lake views are ever-changing and mesmerizing."
2021-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,Great place
2021-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,We had a great stay at Stephanie & Matt’s place! It’s very child friendly & worked well for our annual family reunion!
2021-09-01,5,Group trip,Great place! Nice and big for large groups.
2021-09-01,5,Group trip,Great place for a little get away.
2021-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,This was the perfect little getaway for our family. Host had all the details covered to make our trip relaxing and enjoyable. The backyard was perfect for our kids who spent the majority of their time paddle boarding and swimming in the clean/shallow water.
2021-09-01,5,Group trip,What wonderful accommodations for our large group. The location was perfect and the relaxing waterside setting was perfect. Our hosts were very accommodating and made everything easy as this was my first experience with renting through Airbnb. We will definitely be looking forward to another stay in the future.
2021-08-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Plenty of room in the house for the rainy days and perfect location on the lake.
2021-08-01,5,Group trip,"Great vacation! We loved staying at Stephanie’s house! They thought of everything! Seriously, down to the marshmallow roasting sticks. Beautiful weather, lovely house, great location. We kayaked on Pine River, we rented ATVs from Dan at Happy Trails, fished off the canoe (caught some Pike), ate ice cream nightly from Thirsties (across the street), paddle boarded, played croquet, did puzzles, had nightly fires right by the lake and watched the sun set.
Kitchen had everything to cook meals for our family of 7! The house had lots of room to spread out, which was great with 5 teen and young adult children. Lots of games, outdoor toys, and a tv with Netflix for family movies.
Great communication!
We would love to visit again!"
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Second time staying here and didn’t disappoint. Cadillac doesn’t have a lot to do compared to some northern towns, but if you’re looking for a place to just unwind, this is it! The house has plenty of space and bedrooms for extended families to stay without feeling like you’re all on top of each other. It’s right on the dock and has great views of the lake. Town is only a short drive away, but the kitchen has enough pots and pans and a grill that it’s been more fun to cook at home. The house is “well lived in” but that is part of the charm of going to a cottage in my opinion. Bed are comfortable, lots of windows for a great breeze, and plenty of activities."
2021-07-01,4,Stayed with kids,"Great place for a group to gather. Lots of room to find your own space or interact together. The kitchen is big and well stocked with dishes and pots and pans. We all enjoyed the lawn games, paddle boards, and water mats. The lake does remain shallow for quite a distance as stated in the description. If you plan to rent a pontoon or boat, I would recommend making arrangements before your time begins. We spent many hours around the fire pit - plenty of wood was available."
2021-05-01,5,Group trip,Great property and location!
2021-04-01,5,Group trip,"Great place to relax, lakefront comfort, spacious enough for a group (we had 7). Close enough to town for shopping. Everything we needed was provided, just like home!"
2021-03-01,5,Group trip,"This place was everything we needed. Great space, great location just 15 minutes to Caberfae Peaks where we went skiing. Most importantly great, quick and east communication with our hosts."
2021-02-01,5,Group trip,Really unique place. Great location. Lots to do in the house and the area.
2021-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The house was clean and organized. They offered lots of local info and left cute touches in the house. We went to be in close proximity to caberfae to ski, and it was great (easy to go there and back on warming up breaks). Looked like a lot of snowmobiles and ice fishing. Plenty of room for two families and lots of extra blankets and towels. I'd stay again."
2021-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Summer must be great there, but winter was fantastic! Close to the ski hill and plenty of room for two families with a total of six kids to spread out and relax and thaw out. Fantastic access and thoughtful prep for our arrival. Plenty of towels and a well-stocked kitchen for making meals."
2021-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,Our stay was great. We enjoyed the ice-fishing on the lake and skiing at Caberfae (20 mins away). The house is spacious with plenty of room to spread out and lovely views of the lake.
2021-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Stephanie’s house was the perfect place for a quick weekend trip with family. There was plenty of space to get comfortable and was just 15-20 minutes from Caberfae, which with many of us skiing was a big plus. This space would make for an incredible summer stay, too."
2021-01-01,5,Group trip,Great big house with a cozy cottage atmosphere in each room
2021-01-01,5,Group trip,"We had such a great stay. The house was clean and very spacious, large enough to house 10 of us very comfortably! We walked right onto the lake every day to go icefishing. It was the perfect location for our ice fishing trip! We would definitely stay here again"
2021-01-01,5,Group trip,"We enjoyed our stay here! Great location for a trip to Caberfae Peaks. The house was clean, had plenty of amenities, and was very spacious for our group. All nine people were able to sleep comfortably. Definitely would like to stay here again during the summer months. Thank you!"
2020-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We stayed at Stephanie’s to ski Caberfae. It was close to the hill and very cozy. My daughters were very happy and if babies are happy mama is happy. Thanks for the memories! We will stay again!
2020-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Perfect for family relaxation. Great layout for playing cards, watching movies and big suppers. Can’t wait to visit when it’s warm enough to swim!"
2020-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Fantastic house, so cozy, great layout and a perfect getaway for the weekend."
2020-11-01,5,Group trip,Fantastic view of the lake! Well stocked with supplies and very clean! We will rent again!
2020-11-01,5,Group trip,"Had an amazing weekend! Gorgeous view and a gorgeous, spacious house. Very clean and well stocked with everything we needed! We want to come back for sure!"
2020-10-01,5,Group trip,This home is very spacious and welcoming. Lots of amenities in the kitchen and bedrooms. Our family appreciated the spacious living areas for all of us to hang out and do our own thing but still be “together”.
2020-10-01,5,Group trip,10/10 would recommend. Wonderful home with fantastic views and things to do
2020-10-01,3,Stayed with kids,"Not as clean as I had hoped. Also, not great for toddlers just learning to walk as there are many single steps from room to room and marble steps at the entrance too large for a gate."
2020-09-01,5,Group trip,Matthew and Stephanie’s place was a perfect place to enjoy a weekend away with friends. Thanks for making your home a fun place to be! Awesome awesome awesome!
2020-09-01,5,Group trip,"Great location. House was very well stocked, lots of amenities. We would definitely return again."
2020-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We will visit again. Such a good place. Response quick. Feel like home.
2020-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,This is the perfect place for a family get away! The house is wonderful with great lawn space and you cannot beat having your own private access to lake! Even in cooler temps canoe rides and playing in sand were perfect way to spend day and you cannot beat the bonfire at night and the sunset! We had 4 kids ages 8 months -5 yo and it was perfect for entertaining them. We will definitely be back again!
2020-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,Their home was very clean and they had lots of modern features in the home to make our stay comfortable and easy. They were very quick to get back with us on anything we needed and it was a beautiful place to stay.
2020-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We had a wonderful time at Stephanie and Matt's place! They had everything we needed for our stay. We enjoyed how spacious the cottage is and how it is right on the water and close to town. Would definitely recommend their place, especially for a family get-together!"
2020-08-01,4,Stayed with kids,"This house is absolutely LOVELY. My family stayed with another, totaling 4 adults, 1 teen, 4 kids and one baby.
In no particular order, here are some highlights and tidbits of the house:
Don’t blindly in badly trust your GPS. Ours had us turn one road too soon to enter the house. Use their directions :)
The lake is SO shallow near the house (think 24 Inches deep). The kids were easily able to play safely. We brought our own life vests, which is good because there wouldn’t have been enough for all the kids.
The paddle boards were a huge win. Our kids and us adults lived on them.
The house is much larger than we anticipated. Lots of space to spread out. The bedrooms all had adequate blankets. There are three extra mattresses in the closet, so we actually had all of the kids in the one room (three mattresses on the floor and two in twin beds).
There is a crib in the mermaid room with a twin bed.
The kitchen is large. Toaster, griddle, double oven, lots of bowls and pans.
The yard has gates so kids can freely play in the grass.
There were plenty of bath towels, and sheets and blankets.
We saw the most beautiful sunrises and sunsets.
If we return to Michigan, we would absolutely stay at this house again."
2020-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Stephanie's home is inviting, comfortable, and equipped with everything you could need. Our group has now stayed here twice and each time, Stephanie and Matt are very responsive and helpful."
2020-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,Great location and house. Perfect for families.
2020-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,The host is VERY diligent in her communication with me! Something that really for me personally sets the tone for a comfortable relaxing week :) we’ve been renting places for 6 years and this yard was BY FAR the best yet!!!! We’re hoping to make this our every year rental it was just perfect... the right amount of sun and shade for all to enjoy.
2020-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Thank you, Stephanie and Matthew! You’re home is a little slice of paradise!"
2020-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is an outstanding find! The hosts are really great at communicating, and you can’t beat the lakefront! The hosts have included so many extras, including the use of paddle boards. We hope to stay again soon!"
2020-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Amazing location and great hosts!
2020-07-01,5,Group trip,Awesome location. Beautiful view of the lake. Spacious living. Easy to communicate with the hosts.
2020-07-01,5,Group trip,"Dont bring seasonings or the staples like oil, ketchup or mustard. The house has all of that. The house has two large dining tables. The larger table seats at least 10. Plenty of outside chairs, beach toys and water floaties. The paddle boards are really nice ones. The water is perfect for little kids."
2020-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This house was just what we were looking for. Matt and Stephanie included so many extras; pots/pans, coffee, beach towels, rafts, paddle boards, extra mattresses and so much more! They were always quick to respond to questions and very friendly. We will definitely be back!"

2020-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,Our family really enjoyed our long weekend stay at Stephanie’s home! We couldn’t have spent it better anywhere else. Both Stephanie and Matthew were responsive and attentive to our questions. Loved the kitchen and everything that was provided for our young children to stay entertained and away from electronics! We look forward to coming again! Thank you!
2020-06-01,5,Group trip,"Great house, exactly as advertised. Perfect for a big group"
2020-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Idlewind is a large, spacious home on the shores of Lake Mitchell in Cadillac, Michigan.
The hosts are great at responding to all questions promptly. They’ve set up their yard with a number of seating areas, so that it’s easy to enjoy a day in the sun on the lake.
There are a few stones on the sandy lake bottom, so you may want to bring water shoes.
This is a great location for families to gather."
2020-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Stephanie and Matt were phenomenal hosts. Very quick to answer messages. The house was perfect with ample space for our family. We enjoyed having dinner, while looking out over the lake. Beautiful space with a beautiful view of the lake."
2020-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We really enjoyed our stay. We're also automation fans so having Alexa on hand was a nice touch. We liked all the varied spaces to hang out in, and thought it was a delightfully unique home. We might come back in the summer or for ice fishing next year!"
2020-03-01,5,Group trip,House has a old world charm with touches of the modern life. A lot of nice touches for travelers. All the stuff you need to enjoy the trip without the hassle of finding a store to buy life’s necessities.
2020-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Amazing place, Very Clean, View of Lake is Great, Pellet grill for cooking is Awesome."
2020-02-01,5,Group trip,"We loved staying here. It was very spacious and clean. We had 4 couples in our group, and there was plenty of space and enough bedrooms for everyone. And this home is only about 10 to 15 minutes away from the Caberfae ski resort, which was so convenient!"

2020-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,This was a great place to stay for our three generation ski trip. Plenty of room for everyone to spread out and still spend time together. The large kitchen is fully stocked with all the supplies you need to prepare meals. Stephanie is generous in providing multiple kinds of coffee and tea and other kitchen basics. The beds are clean and comfortable. We only stayed for the weekend and the grandkids are already begging to come back. I highly recommend this house for your stay.
2020-01-01,5,Group trip,"This place was perfect for our group! The home was accurately described and had all of amenities necessary for a great stay. We appreciated the open layout of living spaces, well stocked kitchens, and cozy bedrooms and wouldn’t hesitate to return! Perfect for a summer or winter getaway."

2019-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,Great property! Great hosts!
2019-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Loved our stay at Idlewood! The cottage was above and beyond and so was the hospitality! Matt and Stephanie were great hosts and provided wonderful touches that enhanced our stay. We loved the fireplace and the fire pit by the lake. The view from the cottage was spectacular!!
2019-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,Extremely kind hosts with quick response time! They had everything we could possibly need and more. Great location on the lake and also a great middle ground for heading to Lake Michigan or Traverse City!

2019-09-01,5,Group trip,They stay at Stephanie and Matt's place on mitchell lake was great! We had 10 adults travelling for a fishing tournament. The house was clean and had plenty of room to sleep everyone with the addition of a couple air mattresses. The house had more room than expected and some great views of the lake!
2019-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,This property is very true to the listing and photos. The layout is great with a very open main floor allowing the whole family to spread out but all be together. The fenced in area is great for the younger children as well as a sandbox area down by the water. Nice in ground bonfire pit and very spacious kitchen with everything you need to feed a big family. Upstairs bedrooms are spacious and 3 of 5 bedrooms face the water.
2019-08-01,5,Group trip,Very spacious! We very much enjoyed that there was plenty of room for our group of 7. The back yard lends itself well to activities and enjoying the lake.
2019-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,They aren’t exaggerating when they use the word “spacious” in the description. Everything is as described or better. Stephanie and Matt are generous and hospitable hosts. We found great value for the price!
2019-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Matt and Stephanie were wonderful hosts and we are already talking about returning next year. The fenced in portion of the yard was a great addition for small kids, who then didn't have to be watched so closely near the water 24/7. The house is open, with lots of living space and a great kitchen. We loved our stay!"
2019-07-01,5,Group trip,"Perfect place to spend our week long family vacation! The home was well stocked and had everything we needed. Plenty of room to spread out but also quaint spots to hang out. We had amazing weather and took advantage of the water toys, bonfire pit, yard games, and dock space for our boat. There was plenty of parking for all the cars and our boat trailer. We loved walking to Thirsty’s for odds n ends. The hosts were quick to respond and incredibly helpful during the entire process. We are already talking about when we can come back!!"
2019-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,Our family of 5 had a great time staying here on our visit to Michigan and didn't want to leave the lake! The paddle boards and canoe were such a nice thing to take advantage of on the nice days and the shallow area of the lake was nice for wading around. We enjoyed plenty of fires lakeside and it was SO convenient to have Thirsty's Party Store right across the driveway for those forgotten items and evening ice cream cones! Definitely do a homemade pizza on the pellet grill as recommended by the hosts. The inside provided plenty of space for us to all spread out. We spent a lot of time in the mornings sipping coffee in the den overlooking the lake and even got a beautiful lightening show our last night there. I would come back here in a heartbeat!
2019-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Really great experience. The house was really nice, clean and had some nice extras like paddle boards, a fire pit, and a wood pellet grill. The swimming area was nice, had a big shallow area which was perfect for the kids."
2019-05-01,5,Group trip,"The house and property were fantastic. We had a wonderful, relaxing weekend. The paddle boards and canoe were wonderful for enjoying the lake. The yard games were great to have and we played often. The setting is beautiful, the sunsets and sunrises were amazing (this house gives you a view of both). Great lake views from the house. Everything you could ever need was provided from the fully stocked kitchen & bathrooms to the outdoor offerings of chairs, grill etc. They honestly thought of everything! Stephanie always responded to our texts quickly (Note: If I had read all of her very thorough instructions I would not have even had to text her- sorry Stephanie). Would definitely recommend this place and hope to someday return to enjoy again! Thanks for a beautiful, peaceful getaway!"
2019-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We had a wonderful stay at Idlewild. The home was beautiful, with an old world charm that felt like a true getaway, while still boasting modern upgrades. There was plenty of room for our large clan to spread out, but cozy rooms where we could spend time together as well. Our son is already asking if we can go back when the weather warms up, so that we can better enjoy the lake! I would 100% recommend Stephanie and Matt as hosts, as they were impeccable, and their hospitality made our trip even more delightful."
2019-05-01,5,Group trip,For us the entire place was perfect. We had a large group and the waterfront views and common areas were exactly what we wanted. 12 adults could all come together in a central area that not many places could accomplish.
2019-04-01,5,Group trip,"This home is beautiful! Great lake access, huge rooms, lots of amenities, and the hosts are extremely helpful. Would love to book again!"
2019-04-01,5,Group trip,"Very spacious living areas, plenty of bedrooms. I love the technology. And the view is probably the best in Cadillac."

2019-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Idlewood is an absolutely lovely place! Lots of parking space, multiple sleeping options, an amazing view of the lake, and a feeling of being home (away from home)! Owners were fantastic at answering messages and even offered ideas of restaurants to try in the area. My writing group was so comfortable there that they'd like to return next year!"
2019-03-01,5,Group trip,"This place was to good to be true! Me, my sister and all of our kids had a great time in this extra big house. Just like previous reviews, it had everything we could have possibly forgotten!! LOL! It was very easy to find with lots of parking."
2019-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,This was probably one of the cleanest and best smelling AirBNB homes we have ever stayed in. The kitchen is huge and well stocked. We had 4 adults and 5 kids and there was plenty of space for all of us to spread out. We enjoyed the puzzles and games when we were tired out from a few days of skiing at Caberfae and the weather turned bad. The view of the lake was beautiful and the kids enjoyed walking on the frozen lake. We would definitely stay at this home again.
2019-02-01,5,Group trip,"Our family and friends really enjoyed staying in the welcoming home with beautiful surroundings. House was clean with fresh scent, kitchen very well equipped. After the day of skiing in Caberfae Peaks it was great to relax and play fun games. We watched snowmobiles passing by on the frozen lake."
2019-02-01,5,Group trip,"GREAT spot for a winter break. The location is great for ice fishing, skiing and snowmobiling. Having the lake access next door is nice for getting to/from the lake. Stores, restaurants and bars within a mile worked out perfect! Overall, it’s a well appointed home setup for relaxing!"
2019-01-01,5,Group trip,"Matt and Stephanie were fantastic from the beginning to end of our experience! They were accommodating for our group and responsive from before we booked up through check-out. The space and location are beautiful, even bigger than they look in the pictures! A great spot for a family or group to stay. Highly recommend their house for anything in the Cadillac area, year round!"
2019-01-01,5,Group trip,Location is perfect for ice fishing! Lake access right next to the property.

2019-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Super clean, wonderful host with quick response and awesome view of the lake. Beautiful home with great amenities that I feel was very fairly priced. Would highly recommend!"
2019-01-01,5,Group trip,"We came up to stay over the New Year with two other couples to ski. It was located across the street from a convenience store, which was wonderful and close to Caberfae Peaks! The view was great of the water and we are already talking about planning a trip in the summer and hoping to return! Plenty of space for groups!"
2018-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Thank you so much! You have a beautiful place and we really enjoyed staying at your place. Convenient, great amenities, and great response. We had a great family ski trip and enjoyed relaxing in your home at end of day!"

2018-11-01,5,Group trip,"Stephanie and her husband were great hosts and quick to reply when we had a question. The beautiful view from the large table made our Thanksgiving dinner very special. The home was quite spacious for the ten of us, with plenty of room to play games, read quietly, watch TV or have fun with Alexa. Cadillac is a short drive away where we enjoyed some shopping. Our time at Stephanie's lakefront home was wonderful!"
2018-11-01,5,Group trip,We loved our stay. Its a beautiful updated home right on the lake. The kitchen is large and well stocked. It was perfect for us since we love to cook!

2018-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"It is a great house and host! Even though the weekend we stayed were either raining or cloudy, we still had a great time in the house and at Cadillac area. The house is clean, and all the preparation made us feel like home. We already want to come back next year!"
2018-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We had such a wonderful time at Stephanie’s. Their home is so pretty and fun. We enjoyed making s’mores outside by the lake on the cool fall evenings. Thanks for sharing.
2018-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great cottage with a beautiful view of the lake, especially from the first floor bedroom.  The place was clean and had plenty of room for my group."
