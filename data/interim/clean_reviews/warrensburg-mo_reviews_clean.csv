The house had everything we needed, the backyard and patio were perfect for the dogs, and we were able to walk across the street to get breakfast and visit the farmers market.

When I messaged Brandon asking if my daughter could bring her dog over for an evening of sitting on the back porch, he immediately replied ‚Äúabsolutely!‚Äù We loved the big back yard and enjoyed playing Uno on the back deck.

2024-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This was a great choice for us as we needed a one night stay after a long drive out west. The spacious back yard is completely surrounded by a privacy fence. It allowed our pups to stretch & run after a long drive. Very clean and the decor is extremely welcoming. Everything in the home was useful and thoughtfully appointed. Really appreciated the digital clock in the bedroom so I didn‚Äôt have to check my phone if I woke up to see the time. Quiet but close enough to stores, groceries, restaurants and gas. Appreciated being able to park in the private driveway in the back of the house, much easier to unload. Brandon was a great communicator."

Extremely clean, well stocked kitchen, and nicely decorated.
Brandon and Alicia were very pleasant and responsive when contacted.
Totally recommend this location."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Our stay in Warrensburg was exceptionally memorable, because we were spending the night as we finish driving home to California with a three month old dalmatian that joined our family in Pennsylvania. We'd stayed in many airbnbs driving east to pick her up, and more on the way back east, but this place was exceptional for its ability to literally make us feel ""at home."" The decor, special holiday touches, quiet surroundings, and access to downtown and local restaurants were all big pluses...but most of all our little girl loved every inch of the house, and we loved sharing it with her during this special trip back to our home. A special connection to Warrensburg, because of her, was its history to the saying a dog is a man's best friend. We took pictures of our girl with the nearby statue and shared them with all her litter mates and breeder, who are watching her progress to California."

The home has all the amenities you could possibly need and ask for. A nice touch is a wide range of toiletries in the bathroom, washer/dryer on the main level, snacks in the pantry, and games in the living room.

Coffee and snacks, shampoo, zip lock bags, so much that went beyond what I expected. The house is adorable and there's a large deck that would be so nice to spend time on in warmer weather. I'd come back to this place without hesitation. I wish I had discovered it sooner rather than two months before my son graduates and leaves Warrensburg. Excellent place!"

A short walk to the lovely U of Central Missouri campus was perfect for our dog including late at night. Great back yard for the pooch to play after many hours in the car. There is a train that is audible in the middle of the night but my family sleep right through it (I‚Äôm unusually noise sensitive).

One thing to note, if you have infants/small children the curtains are see-through so you‚Äôll want to bring a blackout curtain if that‚Äôs what your kids need to sleep."

We didn‚Äôt have kids with us but this would be a perfect place if you do. Hosts were so easy to get in touch with and very accommodating and flexible. Oh and the king size bed is the most comfortable bed I‚Äôve ever slept in. This is a home away from home for sure!! 5 stars from us!!
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Fun commenced on star date 03192024. Two guests arrived from Unimatrix 918 to visit drone 5 of 74 of Unimatrix 660. The accommodations were sufficient and the immediate surroundings were conducive to enjoyment and relaxation (which are not - as it turns out - irrelevant) . The collective explored the local environs, mapping nature trails named after a large feline (species 6655), designated a ""lion."" Upon interactions with locals, we found many worthy of assimilation into our collective. Sustenance in the area was procured. Sustenance both exotic and pedestrian. The provided bed chambers were comfortable and made regeneration pleasurable and efficient. We are grateful for being allowed into your collective and look forward to visiting you again. We will impart a phrase long ago assimilated, ""Live long, and prosper."" - 1 of 2, 2 of 2, 5 of 74. Resistance is futile."
2024-03-01,5,Group trip,"It was the best accommodation, clean and comfortable. Everything was well-equipped and convenient.

2024-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"My stay was great. I didn't realize until after I got there that there wasn't a dvd player and I had brought some movies down. I messaged them to ask about it and the next day they brought over a dvd player and set it up. There were a lot of extra blankets and they even had snacks. Very accommodating. Only thing I would recommend is bringing your own towel as they were on the smaller side, but still worked just fine."

King sized beds, except for one bedroom were comfy. There was a waterproof mattress pad that I‚Äôm sure is probably advisable on a rental, but we didn‚Äôt particularly enjoy that. Maybe add an extra sheet on top?
The house is directly across from UCM which was handy for our particular stay. Our host was thoughtful, super easy to communicate with, and made our stay in her home delightful. We give the house 5 stars! ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è"

2018-10-01,5,Group trip,This place is perfect for a stay in Warrensburg. It is a smaller house but there is plenty of space. 6 of us shared the space comfortably for the weekend. All amenities were provided and the place was nice and clean. One of my friends even left her makeup bag and Tricia found it and made arrangements so she could get it back. Overall was an amazing stay. Would recommend.
2018-10-01,5,Stayed over a week,You will not be disappointed if you stay here. It's a fine place to stay when visiting in Warrensburg.
2018-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,Just returned from a great trip to Warrensburg. Loved the Cottage and everything that came with it. Will be staying there anytime we visit!
2018-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,Tricia's house was in a prime location to the stadium and was super clean and cozy! Made visiting with my daughter on campus comfy and convenient! We will definitely use again.

2018-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Not only was the house was clean and BEAUTIFUL!!! It was stocked with most everything needed that are normally forgotten when packing. The location was centrally located for all the places we needed to go.
2018-06-01,5,Group trip,"The home is decorated beautifully and was very clean! We (family of 6) comfortably stayed for a weekend.
Communication with Tricia was excellent!
Thanks for making our family weekend awesome! We will definitely stay there again!"
2018-05-01,5,Group trip,"This place is spotless with fantastic sleeping space! The host surprised us with enough food to feed six of us breakfast, two days in a row! It is a great place to stay!"
2018-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Cottage Central and Trisha are TOP NOTCH! We came from out of town for a wedding and it was great to walk in to a place that was squeaky clean as described, beautiful ,stylish and so comfortable and homey. We stayed 5 days..and would do again in a heart beat. The beds were so comfy and 3 bedrooms!! This is my place of choice should we be in the area again."
2018-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Awesome hosts and great location for our sporting events! Cozy home - very clean with wonderful little personal touches. Highly recommended!
2018-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Cottage Central is a fantastic place to stay - just steps away from the Multipurpose Building, Football Stadium and campus. It was nice to have parking there since there were LOTS of people in town for graduation. It is nicely decorated, has a kitchen that was a pleasure to cook in, and was very clean. Towels were plentiful and thick. There are three bedrooms & one bathroom. There's even a washer & dryer. Amenities included a basket of things we might have forgotten, coffee to start us out, information on the area, etc. If you might need it, it was there."
2018-04-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Great location and everything you want for your stay , would highly recommend this cottage"
2018-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We stayed at college central for a homeschool convention and was very pleased with the house. It was very cozy, clean and comfortable. Lots of thoughtful extras and had everything we needed."
2018-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Home away from home! Tricia does a great job of communicating with you before and during your stay to make sure you are comfortable and not needing anything. The house is clean, the beds are comfortable, there is plenty of seating, and the location is great! We thoroughly enjoyed our stay and plan on using the house again next time we're in Warrensburg."
2018-03-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Overall, great stay and easy check in process. Very clean. Right next to campus. Check out process was just as easy. Very fair price as well.
Side note:
There was weird feedback from the host about us playing loud music however no music was being played at the time the time suggested...which was from 6PM to 7PM; not the wee hours of the night. For research sake, the speaker that was brought is named ""JBL Flip 4 Portable Bluetooth Speaker""
We were unsure if the host drove by and heard music (unlikely) or if they activated the call box that's attached to the home (as a door bell) and heard music and assumed it was loud."
2018-01-01,5,Stayed over a week,"We stayed at Tricia's place for 11 days. The weather was unseasonably cold, but the house was nice and warm. The house is located almost on the college campus, so everything is very convenient. We did not get out and walk because the weather was so cold, but we definitely could have. There are restaurants, bars, and antique stores within walking distance. Kansas City is a little over an hour away and there are many towns closer to Warrensburg with a lot of shopping choices. The host is magnificent! We were there over Christmas and Tricia put up a full size Christmas tree for us and added festive decorations throughout the house. She also kept in contact with us to ensure we had everything we needed. Additionally, she was in contact with us before we arrived and checked into restaurants that would be open Christmas Day as well as store closing times on Christmas Eve. She was a life saver for us as we arrived Christmas Eve and still had a lot of things we needed to take care of before Christmas. I'm pleased to say, it was a very relaxing and enjoyable trip!"
2017-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Tricia's Place was just what we needed: clean, cozy and comforting. She made sure we had all of the small touches we needed for a great stay. The one thing that sets Tricia apart from many other hosts was not only her warmth and hospitality, but her superb communication from the time we rented until we departed. We would absolutely return!"
2024-06-01,5,Group trip,Beautiful and charming place with very nice and tasteful Boho decor. Cool loft apartment vibes with a spa shower. Only downside is road noise and the train noise. The downtown is vibrant though.
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great hosts, thank you so much!"
2024-05-01,5,Group trip,"Perfect location. Met our needs, super comfortable!!!"

2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Terrific hideaway in a charming town. Everything was as advertised and more. My wife and I had 3 kids and 1 nephew and still had plenty of room to spread out and no one ever felt crowded. The kitchen and bathroom were both especially spacious and tastefully done with great finishings and colors (HUGE shower was my favorite).
The location was also great and especially pedestrian friendly. We had multiple trips to the Meyer‚Äôs Market right downstairs for ice cream, coffee, and snacks for the family.
Highly recommend!"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Absolutely amazing! I stayed here for 45 days and everything was absolutely perfect! Wade is an amazing host and great guy. Communication for everything was top notch, any questions or issues were resolved immediately. They provide everything you could possibly need dinnerware, pots/pans, linens, blankets, etc. All the finishes were top notch as well comfortable mattresses and pillows, beautiful appliances; I‚Äôve been to several airbnbs all over the country and this one definitely stands out amongst the best I‚Äôve ever been to. If you are looking for a premium airbnb stay then this is the place, especially for the area this is 100% a 5-Star stay, don‚Äôt support the local hotels which are abysmal, support this host and his beautiful family! Thanks again for everything and God bless y‚Äôall!"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We enjoyed our stay at the loft and it was exactly as described and seen on the website. The loft was very clean and had everything we needed, the electric fireplace added a homey touch. The beds were comfortable and I slept well. The shower here is absolutely awesome.
The kitchen seemed well stocked and would have anything you need for cooking. We did not eat or cook there though as we were there to see family.
The downtown area had some very cute shops that looked as they would be great to explore but with it being Christmas we just did not have time.
I would highly recommend staying here. If we return to the area I would definitely check to see if the loft would be available."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,Came for the Dickens Christmas and shopping the location was perfect the front literally put us right on Main Street .
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,Great place to stay while visiting our son at UCM. Great property and location. Wade was great to respond when we had some issues come up. Hope to stay here again sometime
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The loft was perfect for visiting my son at UCM. We took the train in, the loft was in walking distance of not only the train station but restaurants and walking around in downtown Warrensburg. We ate breakfast at Meyer‚Äôs market. It will be my go to for college visits."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Thank you very much for the wonderful space! Location was perfect and had everything we needed. Cute space and very clean. Great communication from the hosts.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We loved staying here. Very clean and comfortable. Walking distance to coffee shop, shopping and great restaurants."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This spot is as advertised! In a perfect central spot with lots of little stores and coffee shops nearby. We loved the kitchen, appreciated the inviting and cozy decor, and really enjoyed the spacious shower! Would definitely recommend and will definitely return should we find ourselves in Warrensberg again!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Perfect place in downtown Warrensburg! Close to coffee shop and Meyers market right underneath if you need lunch. Also just a short drive to cave hollow for a nice evening walk.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,Very nice place. My Aunt and my little family loved it. Very spacious and loved the huge shower. Everything we needed a hotel couldn‚Äôt offer the few days we staid. I will absolutely be renting this again when I go back to visit family. The owners were very responsive.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Convenient downtown location. Very clean and spacious.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,Very cozy place to stay. I definitely recommend.
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Fantastic view and experience of the down town life. Very private upper apartment, safe away from the notices of the cars etc.
It‚Äôs was spacious, clean, and had a charming feel.
Would definitely recommend!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Wade and Kristy‚Äôs exactly as seen in photos. Welcoming & inviting. Beautifully decorated. Spacious & clean. History of the building-interesting. Easily located. Parking available right in front during the day and overnight parking just around the corner in 2 free lots. Two coffee shops and several wonderful restaurants steps away from the loft. The two bedrooms were comfy and beds are firm but nice. The bathroom, as mentioned in multiple reviews, is wonderful. Awesome shower and lots of storage for personal toiletries for all the people who might stay. Kitchen was equipped with all you need to feel at home. If you are a light sleeper, you might use a ‚Äúsound machine‚Äù app for those moments when nighttime emergency vehicles pass by. Yes, there is a train once in a while but it never bothered me at all and I am a light sleeper. Actually it was quite nostalgic. Staying at Wade and Kristy‚Äôs place was so much nicer than a hotel. They were extremely responsive and helpful when I had questions."
2023-05-01,4,Stayed with kids,"Our stay was great! Even though it was in downtown Warrensburg, it was relatively peaceful and quiet. The Saturday morning farmer's market around the town square was a pleasant surprise."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great location, within walking distance to UCM."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,It was lovely thank you
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Very nice and looks brand new. The parking is a little confusing and pay attention to the warning about parking tickets for cars in the street overnight. There is free parking around the corner that is a very short walk, but you need to read the guest book and look at the map. Very convenient place and very comfortable. My only critical feedback is the beds. They are good but not great, but others might like them just fine. I have already booked my next stay at this location if that is any indication of my experience."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Thank you so much Wade and Kristy! We had the most lovely time staying in the loft. We went down to the market every morning for coffee and breakfast. The loft has so much of a historical feel with all of the modern touches! We will definitely stay again!
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great spot!
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great little place to stay when we come to visit our son in college. Loved the location and amenities. We will stay here again!
2023-03-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Wade and Kristy's loft location was very convenient for us while we visited an airman at Whiteman AFB. We were able to come and go easily and the loft allowed us space to hang out ""at home"" if we chose to. The nearby coffee shops and restaurants were also a perk. The loft was clean and comfortable."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Beautifully decorated and what can I say that shower is amazing. Close to many local restaurants. Would stay again in a heart beat.
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We fell in love with this place the minute we walked in! Beautifully decorated! The bed was very comfortable and the shower was amazing!! The market downstairs was adorable! We walked around downtown and stopped in a couple local restaurants/bars. We found some fun murals and painted steps to take pics with our grand babies! We‚Äôll definitely book this place for future visits!!
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,highly recommend! will be back
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Such a nice place! Even got to check in early! Great hosts! Will definitely recommend
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Nice place
2023-01-01,5,Stayed over a week,"Excellent stay with plenty of amenities. Wade and Kristy were always responsive to messages and always provided clarity to all inquiries. The location is fantastic for anyone looking for a quick stay in Warrensburg. The loft is centrally located in town with many local shops nearby. The bar district is close but not so close that there would be noises / disruptions during your stay.
The bathroom is the highlight. I spent a few nights at the Burj Khalifa in Dubai last year and it was nothing compared to Wade and Kristy‚Äôs setup. 10/10.
If you want a fantastic stay in Warrensburg, this is the place."
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Such a cool spot! Very homey yet modern. Would absolutely stay there again.
Wade was quick to respond to any questions and gave us a great restaurant recommendation along with parking tips.

2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful loft(!!), very clean, amazing bed, everything you need, very easy to access, easy parking across street and lots of fun little shops and restaurants nearby. Wade and Kristy brought us laundry detergent after we asked where to get some at the shop (that they must own) downstairs. How amazing is that. Overall really enjoyed ourselves; learned about the local dog legend, got great pastries, beautiful flowers for friends, went antiquing and had a great lunch. Train does come by late and night and early in the morning."
2022-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Loved staying here. The hosts were quick with a response when I requested to alter my arrival date. Lucky for me it was vacant. Loved having the kitchen and being able to make my Airman some home cooked food while visiting. Great for resting after our long drive, the awesome shower and impeccable water pressure were perfect. My son really enjoyed staying off the base for the weekend in a home like environment. Plan to stay here every time we visit him at Whiteman."

2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,What a fun location. Food and coffee shop along with a bakery right next door. The noise from the bar below was absolutely no problem. Good parking for two cars. I will take this place before a hotel any time.
2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"The space is extremely nice, clean, and located right of Pine st. Convenient to restraints and bars nearby, easily walkable lots of historic buildings. Traci was very friendly and quick to respond to the reservation request (530am) as well as anything else we had sent her. I would highly recommend staying here for anything that brings you to Warrensburg."

2023-11-01,5,Stayed over a week,Great place
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"We stayed at Traci‚Äôs place for our wedding night. It is beautiful and very clean. With being right above the bar we figured we would be up all night because of noise, but truly it wasn‚Äôt bad! You could hear it, but it wasn‚Äôt disruptive at all. Traci communicated with me well and offered accommodations for us! I recommend staying here!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,Had a great trip. Traci‚Äôs place is in a great area for things to do. The loft is very spacious and comfortable. If you are looking for a central location to enjoy nightlife in town this is the spot for you. Instructions were clear and host provides helpful suggestions.

2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What a hidden gem! Located centrally, right off Pine street, close to university, bars & restaurants. The loft was both spacious & quaint. The finishes were all high-end and everything was clean & neat. Plenty of open gathering room to get together! To top it all off, Heroes restaurant, which has great food, is located just below the loft and will provide food as a room service type amenity! Would highly recommend to stay here! We had a great time. Hosts were very hospitable & responsive."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed one night,Booked last minute on St. Patrick‚Äôs Day. The location is directly above Heroes Bar & Grill. We had a ball! If you are looking for quiet on the weekend‚Ä¶this is not your place. If you are looking to be right in the middle of everything‚Ä¶you can go out the door of the bar and up your stairs. The space is clean and comfortable. The bed is really comfortable. The arched windows are also beautiful. We will stay here again.
2023-02-01,5,Stayed one night,Very responsive and tidy!

2024-06-01,5,Group trip,Charming old house. Very nice host.
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,Valerie's house was amazing! The kids loved the piano and all the games she had. It did end up storming during our stay but she had a big covered porch so it was nice to sit out on it and watch the storm without getting wet. Would definitely recommend.

Valerie was a great host. Very friendly and responsive,
The house is very unique, Nice & big with plenty of towels, extra blankets, pillows, games, movies, etc. Games were very handy on those rainy days :)
We got everything we needed. The kitchen is fully equipped.
Easy check-in & check-out.
Valerie thought of everything even umbrellas provided in the house.
Thank you!"

2023-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,Valerie was super kind and accommodating to our special requests. Would stay here again.
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This home was so welcoming. Valerie provided everything that I may have forgot minus toothbrush's. (one of my guest forgot theirs. I came in town for my sons Senior night. He is a football player and this is his last year playing although we might see him in the pro's. Valerie's home accommodated my entire family of 9 adults at this point.. I can't put into words what happened in this home because it brought together family from abroad from Denver to Phoenix. We did enjoy the kitchen, and the board games monopoly got intense as always. It united a family in one place and I thank Valerie for her generosity the goodies are to die for if you have a sweet tooth. The nostalgia of the piano and record player brought back memories to us all. Check in and out for me flawless. Side note my adult daughters 32 and 30 loved the doll house in the play room. I didn't get a chance to enjoy fully the spa downstairs I just showered, but had I known what it could do."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This property was really unique and better than expected! Valerie made it easy to get checked in and out and was proactive in sending information ahead of time. We really enjoyed the piano and comfortable accommodations! The showers were definitely unique as well, but not hard to figure out. This house reminded me a lot of the house I grew up in, which was nice. It was within walking distance to UCM campus, which would have been great had it not been so cold. We would definitely consider staying here again if ever in Warrensburg!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,Nice place to stay. Walking distance to UCM. Thanks for letting us enjoy homecoming weekend!
2023-10-01,5,Group trip,"We stayed at Valerie‚Äôs place the night before my wedding and night of and it was perfect for us! It was cute, relaxing, and we enjoyed a beautiful fall night on the porch. She had snacks for us, everything is labeled and easily accessible. I recommend staying here if you want a cozy home feel."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"I don‚Äôt normally post a review, but when I say this bed was so amazing I want to know where you purchase your linens and the mattress from. I got in bed and fell straight to sleep. The comforter was amazing. The pillows were amazing. The house was nice. It was very peaceful. It was a relaxing trip."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We were only 2 blocks from our son‚Äôs dorm and campus which made for a great family weekend! She left snacks and bathroom supplies she truly went above and beyond to make it extra great! It‚Äôs an older house, but the bed we slept on in the main was fabulous! No complaints at all ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Valerie‚Äôs was a great host, and my family enjoyed the stay. Her home was full of amenities, and it felt like she truly went the extra mile, and we look forward to renting in the future, for our trips to the state fair."
2023-07-01,5,Group trip,"It was a beautiful home, peaceful, and clean. I knew where everything was in the house. It had the touch of a great home maker. I felt home as soon as I arrived. Thank you again Valerie for sharing your beautiful home."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Would recommend Valerie's place.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,The house was very warm and welcoming. Valerie did a wonderful job responding and we truly appreciated all of the goodies and candies. It made our son's wedding weekend just wonderful.
2023-05-01,4,Group trip,"This is a historic house and everything that goes along with that was what we experienced! Some wiring issues, low shower head, short counters and you really sit DOWN on the toilet! That being said, Valerie was great to welcome us and make sure we had everything. The kitchen is well stocked and I enjoyed the family gathering spaces. The house is quaint and my brothers got a kick out of the sloping floors and loss of equilibrium in the morning! I would stay here again, if she‚Äôd let me, but I‚Äôd leave the critics at home!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The home had just about anything that a person could possibly need while away from their own home. Plenty of room for 4 adults and 3 kids. We stayed for 2 nights and we were mostly there to sleep and get ready in the mornings. The beds were soft and comfortable, and she has lots of extra blankets and towels and such. The furnishings were a little dated but still accommodating. Valerie was kind and welcoming with her instructions and responses. Our stay there served our needs just fine for a graduation weekend. It was a good experience for us."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,The house was amazing! Very clean and lots of space. All of the extra little amenities were a great touch! We had a great weekend. We would definitely stay here again.
2023-04-01,5,Stayed over a week,"Valerie's home was perfect for our large group. The location was ideal for us as we needed close proximity to the University, which was a stone's throw away! The back garden had a fire pit and was a lovely place to sit and have a coffee on a sunny morning. Valerie's home was full of snacks and the little things you need like coffee pods and bathroom supplies. Valerie's communication was instant, making the whole experience at Valerie's easy and enjoyable. We had an extended stay and found this the ideal base for our needs. Highly recommend!"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,This was my first time to use an Airbnb but will not be my last bc of how easy it was here. I was pleased with everything from booking through check out. It was much easier than a hotel in every aspect. The home is beautiful and was clean. She left snacks that my kids loved and appreciated.

There were plenty of towels and bedding for our family. We also appreciated all the comforts of home and used the washer/dryer and iron, which was nice to have. The beds were comfortable and clean. We were thankful for the baby gates and playpen! If you have toddlers/young children be alert and watch them carefully as there are breakables (just like Great-Grandma's house). It was a great place for our extended family with kids and singles to stay, as everyone had their own space! Valerie was readily available and responded quickly to our questions. We really enjoyed our stay!"
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I love renting older Air B&B homes. They are very nostalgic and that is what we love. We were very comfortable here and we had more than we needed. Very well equipped. Excellent communication with host

House has the character/style of an older home with all the nice fancy gadgets. Well supplied with everything we could need."
2022-05-01,5,Group trip,"Valerie‚Äôs home was just perfect for our stay in town.

2022-04-01,5,Group trip,"One bedroom downstairs and the three bedrooms upstairs were comfortable and roomy. There's one bathroom on each floor; we had four people and all took showers one morning and had plenty of hot water. We enjoyed the sitting area in the front room. Entry using the keypad was easy for all guests. There was even coffee, creamer, and sugar! I felt like we were visiting a relative or friend who just let us use their house for the weekend. It was great and worked better and was more fun than a hotel for each of us individually!"
2022-03-01,4,Stayed with kids,"Large and charming home within walking distance to the University. This was the perfect location for us. Spacious rooms with lots of options for sleep arrangements. The beds were comfortable and slept well. Upstairs bathroom was a little cramped. Downstairs bathroom has a walk-in bathtub. The kitchen has all the utensils, pots, pans, etc for cooking. Overall the house was comfortable, seemed clean and well-prepared for our arrival, but maybe just a little dusty if we were to be picky.
We were traveling with a 2 year old. So, we moved all the little knickknacks and decor up and away. Imagine visiting Grandma‚Äôs house with older furniture that‚Äôs a bit wobbly and lots of little breakable items.
Our host was very responsive, accommodating, and helpful. Overall, we recommend staying here. It‚Äôs a great find in Warrensburg."
2022-03-01,5,Group trip,Thank you so much! The ladies loved the home. It was nice to be busy with competition but have a place to call home in the evening! We definitely would stay again!

2021-10-01,5,Group trip,Would recommend this to anyone needing lodging in this area. We stayed with a group of seven before heading down to the Katy bike trails in Clinton. Nice quiet part of town and yet not far from main routes in town. Would definitely stay again if in area!

2021-05-01,5,Group trip,"Valerie was such a great host! We were in town for auto racing at the local race track and had a crew of 6 people. Her house was very clean, and everything was as described and ready for us as promised. We have absolutely zero complaints. House rules were reasonable and extra fees such as cleaning were in line with other host with listings. There were plenty of amenities offered such as extra blankets, towels, pillows, shampoo, soap, and coffee. This is one host we hope to come back and visit again! Thanks for everything Valerie!!"

2020-07-01,5,Group trip,"The house is in a good location and easy to find. The host left candies on the tables. The reason for our stay was to see our new granddaughter and the host gave us a monthly milestone blanket which was very thoughtful of her. The house is nice but does need some TLC. We pretty much only used the house to sleep in, which we all slept good every night. Over all it was a nice stay."

2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The place was perfect for what we needed it for ( visiting family). Centrally located near the college and just minutes away from restaurants, stores, etc. just an hour from Kansas City, which was great. House was very clean and stocked with just about anything you might have forgotten to bring. The beds were comfortable, and there were plenty of extra pillows and blankets. Donna was an excellent host. We had a question about something, and she responded in a couple of minutes. Very friendly and helpful.

2023-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Donna‚Äôs bungalow was a complete dream! As a military family waiting for housing, her home had everything we could possibly need during our stay. So clean and had all the kitchen essentials. She even made our pups feel welcome. I was so sad to leave. Definitely recommend."
2023-06-01,2,Group trip,"This house is a very good option for a maximum of 4 guests. It says it sleeps 6, however it only sleeps 4 unless you are okay with sleeping on a couch that does not pull out, or an air mattress. There was also unclear instructions for parking. A couple cars received a ticket due to parking in front of the house because it was a ‚Äúhandicapped‚Äù zone, however there was no signs that indicated so & that was not communicated to us.
Other than that, the place was very clean. The location was great."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Great, cute place!! Perfect for our family of 4 to spend a few days in. Will book again on our future visits."

The kitchen was fully stocked with all the pots and pans, casserole dishes, an air fryer, mixer, table settings for toddlers, you name it, this place has it! Being able to bring my fur baby was a huge plus as well. Thank you so much for your hospitality Donna, we‚Äôll be back next summer for football camp at UCM. Getting to and from the campus is a breeze :)"

I love that it had the backyard area for the kids to play outside. I also loved that it was very comfortable and felt like being at home. Plenty of amenities that were provided. What wasnt there was easily picked up close by, but our host went above and beyond to make sure everything was prepared for guests! Comfortable beds, coffee for the morning, games for the kids to play, and plenty of linen made staying here easy and convenient. Donna was also very responsive to messages and more than accommodating. This will be a favorite location for our future visits to Warrensburg for sure.

2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Donna's place was the perfect getaway. It was a last-minute trip to visit son, daughter-in-law, and granddaughter. She definitely goes above and beyond for her guests. We went to have dinner and had nowhere to sit the baby, and I remembered other reviews that said she had a high chair and other baby needs. that was a great little extra when the baby came to visit us and we ended up having dinner. Her checkout things are a breeze. check-in is amazing I wish all Hosts would set the locks the way she did just ""Brilliant."" We will be seeing if her place is available on our next impromptu trip."
