Beautiful neighborhood and very clean house that always smelled good when you walked in and the sheets were so soft I wanted them for our house! Lianne was so responsive even when it was 10:30 pm! We left from NC and went half way to WV just to find out a tornado hit the town and there wasn’t power or a hotel for 2 hours away.

2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Had a wonderful time in Bardstown and enjoyed our stay at Avery House. Lianne let me know all the details up front so i had no need to contact her during our stay. But I imagine she is super responsive too! She was even kind enough to let us know many shops and restaurants would be closed on Sunday and Monday. Helped us plan ahead better! Look forward to staying here again.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,5 stars across the board- will definitely be back!
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a wonderful stay. The house is small, but very livable, with comfy chairs and a nice tv with streaming services. The kitchen is one of the best equipped I’ve seen in airbnb homes. The house is in a perfect location for checking out restaurants and shops in the little downtown area. The host provides snacks, coffee pods, and other welcoming treats, and she is easy to contact with questions. There are two bedrooms with queen beds in each, so it nominally sleeps four, but there is only one very tiny bathroom, so I’d recommend it for only two guests. All in all, an excellent host and comfortable, lovely house."

2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We loved Lianne's home! It was perfect location for our bourbon tours. The house was clean, neat and nicely decorated and just so inviting. We will definitely stay at Lianne's place again. The only downside was that the town of Bardstown is very quiet on Mondays and we were unable to find a restaurant to eat dinner. We had to travel a bit outside of town to eat on Monday. Other than that, Bardstown is great and the people are so friendly."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Cute, quirky, comfortable. So much to see in Bardstown, we'll just have to come back. Would book again in a heartbeat."

We didn’t use it much, but the kitchen was also very nice and well stocked.
Lianne also let us check in early, which was a real blessing with our travel schedule."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Wonderful, cozy home. It was a perfect place for 4 adults to stay while in town for the Kentucky Bourbon Festival. We couldn’t have asked for anything better. Located in a quiet neighborhood and walkable to the festival, downtown shops, restaurants, and church on Sunday morning at the Basilica of St. Joseph.
The linens on the bed were extremely soft, and I appreciated the fans in the rooms.
Lianne was a great communicator throughout the process.
Would absolutely stay at the Avery House again!"

2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was our first visit to Bardstown and the ""Bourbon Trail"". We couldn't have asked for a better place to call home for the weekend. We have traveled extensively throughout the country over the last 30 years and we were very impressed with our rental.
We would describe the home as ""small but mighty"" in its accommodations and amenities. Beautiful and charming and very much a ""we're home"" feel. It was very clean and we loved it.
We didn't have nearly enough time to visit and see everything we wanted to do over the weekend, but did manage to get in a dinner train ride on the Old Kentucky Railroad, distillery visits to Woodford Reserve, Makers Mark, Log Still (with the Elle King concert at The Amp), and Buffalo Trace. We also had lunch at Bardstown Burger (yummy!) and attended church services at the Basilica of St. Joseph.
So...we'll be back to Bardstown and hopefully a return stay very soon!
Thanks again Lianne!"

2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This spot in Bardstown was perfect for 2 couples as we worked our way through the bourbon trail over the course of a long weekend. Being close to the heart of Bardstown was great during the times we weren't journeying too far, and the space itself was relaxing and extremely private for it being so close to the main drag. Being a relatively quick drive to Louisville was a major plus as well! We will definitely look to book again if in town."

It’s a fabulous house within a safe neighborhood within walking distance to the cutest downtown and restaurants. Everything you need is in the house and Laurie responds so quickly that should we have needed anything I wouldn’t have hesitated to ask. Extra blankets (I’m always cold), fans for white noise, appliances galore, good safe parking, mown lawn and manicured garden.

Everything is high quality—luxurious towels, blankets, shower items, and kitchenware. Emily spared no expense when furnishing this home. It is VERY well stocked with high quality items. Even though it’s on a main street, we barely knew it. It sits on a hill which makes it more private and we didn’t hear cars passing while inside—but there are noise machines, just in case. This stay was one of our favorites. Emily was so friendly and responsive. Her guidebook was so helpful. Check out procedures were so easy. Absolutely amazing. I HIGHLY recommend staying here, you’ll be glad you did!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Would definitely stay there again
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Emily’s place was the most well appointed Airbnb I’ve ever stayed at. Everything was spotless and it was stocked with games, clean kitchenware, anything we could think of she provided. She was very responsive and had a great list of recommendations for restaurants and things to do, which we used all weekend. Thanks for an amazing stay!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We will definitely be coming back!
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"Emily's place is wonderful! Beautifully renovated and decorated, this place has everything you need and more. Wish we'd had more time to just relax and enjoy it all! The place is spotless, and Emily has provided everything you would need and more. We enjoyed hot tea and the snacks that she so graciously provided. We especially appreciated the super easy checkout which allowed us to spend more time enjoying the bourbon trail! Can't recommend this property enough and will definitely stay here again!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful place with great amenities and host!
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My husband, parents, and I spent a long weekend at Emily’s place to do all things bourbon trail, and we can’t recommend her home enough if that’s what you’re looking to do as well! The location is great-within minutes of everywhere you would want to be in Bardstown, but also quiet and peaceful with a beautiful big backyard. The place was beautiful and had every amenity you could need to feel at home. The house was decorated so well and very on theme with the Bardstown location. Emily was a great host and was very communicative throughout our stay. I think the highlight of the stay was being able to use the fire pit and enjoy a beautiful evening outside with family. Next time we come to Bardstown, we will definitely be staying with Emily again..unless she’s fully booked that is :)"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I have stayed at a lot of Airbnbs. This was easily the nicest, most well appointed one ever. Very well laid out, beautiful, comfortable and a host who is incredibly responsive. I strongly recommend and would be thrilled to stay there again."

We will definitely stay here again.

2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We chose this house because the of the photos on the listing, and they did not do it justice. It was better than we expected!! Everything was clean and pristine. She thought of everything… extra bag of ice, ear plugs, plenty of towels, sound machines in the bedrooms.. and the best part.. no long list of checkout instructions like we’ve experienced at other properties. And the pleasant welcome basket that greeted us was so thoughtful. We enjoyed cocktails on the private patio every evening. Will definitely book again!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"If you’re thinking about going to Bardstown stay here. It’s 1.4 miles from downtown and is one of the best Airbnb’s we’ve stayed in. Cute, nice beds, clean, updated, huge yard and plenty to do."

The foosball table was lots of fun, the coffee was great and the toiletries were top notch!!!
She was gracious as a host and provided fantastic recommendations for food in the area (Bardstown Burger - simply delicious! My mother in law wanted to go again! ). Centrally located to several distilleries so we were able to enjoy way more than we anticipated.
Simply put, Emily is a fantastic host and I would definitely stay with her again."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The stay was super clean, easy to get to. A small playground nearby the kids liked and super close to all the bourbon stops.

Place was super clean and felt like a second home. 😊"

I’d give more than 5 stars if I could! Thanks again Emily!"

2024-06-01,4,Stayed with a pet,"The house was clean. The host communicated well. We ordered food, so it worked. But the kitchen was really tiny, I would not want to cook. The yard was fenced and nice for the dog but the patio furniture was dirty and moldy. So we could not really sit outside. Overall a good value for what we paid."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We enjoyed our stay at the Bardstown Bourbon BnB! The house was comfortable, close to town, and had an amazing backyard!

The house decor fits the name and we loved that you could purchase some of the items. The rooms are spacious, the beds are comfy, everything was very clean, and the backyard was big & secluded.

2023-12-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Perfect place to stay while visiting Bardstown. It’s close enough to walk to the downtown area, but on a peaceful street with friendly neighbors. There was a lovely Christmas tree and other cute decorations that made the stay festive given that we were there over the holidays. Coffee and hot chocolate for the Keurig were provided, which was a welcomed touch. The house has a large, fenced back yard that our dog could stay in while we were out.

2024-04-01,5,Group trip,"Laura was kind enough to host our party of six within 48 hours of us checking in! We found out the Airbnb listing we had booked months in advance was now inactive. Talk about my worst nightmare. Laura was immediately responsive and happy to help for my mother-in-laws 60th birthday. She went above and beyond by surprising us with birthday balloons and flowers! This home is absolutely gorgeous with every single detail thought out. The kitchen is filled with every item you could possibly need. The living area has all the activities to keep yourself busy while staying in; darts, shuffle board, record player, sauna, and guitars! The location is walkable to all the bars and restaurants. Note that Bardstown overall shuts down early in the night. Most bars close before 11pm and kitchens close before 9pm. I can't wait to come back to Bardstown and show off The Bard House to friends! One of my favorite Airbnbs I have stayed in over the last 10 years!"

Multiple TV’s, dart board, table top shuffle board, 2 different sitting rooms, and the music room!

2023-10-01,5,Group trip,"Wonderful accommodations and Laura was an exceptional host.
I planned a bourbon trail/golf weekend with family and friends. From the start Laura communicated wonderfully with me, which continued throughout and even following our stay. The house was spotless and the setup was very tasteful. Frankly, it was just what I was looking for.
We enjoyed our days taking tours of local distilleries and golfing. Wonderful restaurants right down the road towards the square. We especially enjoyed coming back to the home each evening, sitting around the fire, enjoying music, each others company and having a glass of bourbon together.
I can’t speak highly enough about Laura and the accommodations of this home. Again, it was just what I was looking for!
Thank you Laura!
-Larry"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Wow!!! This house is amazing all the way through. The entire house was beautiful and had a wonderful vibe that matches the feel of Kentucky; bourbon with a touch of country chic. The art work throughout the house was stunning and brought positive energy to each room. The house was very clean! Laura labeled everything making our activities of daily living very smooth. The beds were very comfortable and we felt right at home. The smart TVs were a nice touch when we were exhausted from exploring around town. Restaurants were within walkable distance and several chain restaurants could be ordered-in through mobile apps. We loved the house so much and had plenty of room and privacy for our entire party. You’ll feel right at home in this welcoming, yet luxurious, town home right next to historic Bardstown! It’s a must visit!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We stayed at the Bard House while attending the Kentucky Bourbon Festival in Bardstown.

We had a great experience and highly recommend!"

Bardstown is such a beautiful little town and Pikey's house is within walking distance of many great restaurants and shops. We enjoyed walking to The Old Talbott Tavern, Mammy's Kitchen & Bar, Scout & Scholar Brewing Co., and Hadorn's Bakery - I highly recommend them all!

2023-11-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"The place and location are excellent. Pikey communicated fine. Things were clear.
My only issue is the house had 2 empty propane tanks - gas grill and fire table. I asked where I could get them swapped and did it. I communicated that I replaced both tanks. the cost and even left the receipt. No reimbursement. So my cost of this place included buying propane for Pikey. That gives me a little hesitation to give a perfect rating.

2023-03-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Pikey’s place was really nice and very accurate to the photos. The kitchen is beautiful, but it became clear that they don’t want you cooking much more than a frozen pizza in it since there were no pans, or other basic cooking utensils. Just be prepared to eat most if not all your meals out. The kitchen did have a well stocked bar/cocktail area near the entrance to the outside patio in back! The only other complaint would be for them to invest in some higher quality pillows for the bedrooms. We could only find 1 extra pillow in the master bedroom and none of them had much support.
Other then two minor critiques, the house was beautiful, a wonderful place to call home for a visit to the bourbon trail! It is in walking distance to many places to eat and shop. The house is well build and uncluttered. If it were a little warmer during our visit, we would have definitely used the private outdoor patio to relax after our daily adventures. We would definitely be happy staying there again!"

2023-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Fantastic location and gorgeous house! The main living/dining area feels so spacious and bright - it's a great place to spend the afternoon with friends and family. The outdoor seating area is a nice way to enjoy good weather. The updated kitchen has great appliances, but it could be a little better stocked with utensils. Bathrooms are very clean and 1st floor shower is amazing (this is our second stay and the number one thing my daughter was looking forward to was showering again at the house!). We're excited to return again this summer!"

2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This house is perfect in every way. It feels like a home in the best sense of the word.
2022-08-01,5,Group trip,"You'll love being so close to town, yet feeling like youre in your own world. Perfect for group of 3 couples. Room for playing cards inside, bourbon around the fire pit at night, great walk-in showers, comfy beds, tvs everywhere. The 2 wine chiller coolers were great for all the sodas, waters, beers we had, and the owner was quick to answer our questions. Would do it again if we get back this way!"
2022-08-01,5,Group trip,"Perfect location! Spacious home for 3 couples to have own spaces, and gathering space for fun! Love the outdoor space and putting green! Wonderful Bardstown spacious home!"
2022-08-01,5,Group trip,"This house was great, just what we needed for a weekend trip on the bourbon trail. We had 3 couples and there was plenty of space. The outdoor area was small, but we didn't end up using it anyway since we were out visiting the distilleries during the day and exploring downtown Bardstown in the evening. The house was clean and Pikey was quick to respond when I had a couple questions about the house and the area. We would definitely stay here again - so much to do and see, we could easily come back another weekend and not repeat anything we did this trip."
2022-08-01,5,Group trip,Still my favorite Airbnb in Bardstown!

2022-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Our family stayed here for a full week during a baseball tournament in Elizabethtown.
So glad we elected to stay here vs a hotel near fields or downtown Louisville. We got to enjoy downtown Bardstown and Louisville, Bernheim Forest, and some distilleries in addition to baseball!
Pikey was an amazing host and very responsive before, during and even after the trip. He was flexible enough to extend the trip a night early at the last minute to accommodate an earlier-than-anticipated arrival due to a coaches meeting.
The house was wonderful. From location, layout and overall feel, it was perfect for us. Pikey also allowed us to use the huge space over garage as a fourth bedroom with a blow up and that was ideal for two boys. The kitchen was so spacious and there was plenty of storage. Kids loved the putting green.
Again, it was a wonderful stay and we hope to return with some friends soon. Thanks for everything. Cheers! ⚾️🥃"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Perfect house for our vacation! The kitchen was amazing and so well-designed; the bedrooms were huge and comfy; the master shower was fantastic, and the AC worked perfectly. Three generations of our family spent most of a three day weekend in the house, hiding from the heat, and we never felt crowded. Nice first floor guest bathroom for mobility-limited family member; fun back patio to enjoy the outdoors when we could. Really appreciated the covered parking and loved how close we were to downtown Bardstown. We really enjoyed our stay and look forward to returning soon."
2022-06-01,4,Group trip,"The house was great, just wish the patio had been cleaned, so we did not have to take the time to do it ourselves."

2022-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,Very nice clean and bright home within walking distance to restaurants and bars.
2022-04-01,4,Stayed a few nights,The checki-in keybox is difficult to operate. The beds are very comfortable and the operational fireplace is nice. The backyard area with firepit is not really nice enough for guests to use. My guests wished for curtains over the front door area because the road on that side of the house is well traveled. We felt partly on display at night.
2022-03-01,5,Group trip,Great location and beautiful home. Walkable to town and many great dining options. If you are planning a Bourbon Tour this home offers great central location.

2022-03-01,3,Stayed a few nights,"If a hairdryer is important to you, bring your own. If you plan to watch TV make sure the proper remote controls have been provided. There’s no ‘gym’ the patio is not guest ready. Location can’t be beat and the house has great bones. It just needs a re-organizing and more attention to details that could save a lot of frustration."
2022-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great home in an equally great location close to most everything in Bardstown
2022-02-01,5,Group trip,"We loved the Black Swan house! It was the perfect house for our group and had everything we needed for a comfortable stay. There are alot of places to eat, browse, or hang out within walking distance and so many bourbon distilleries within super close driving distance.

2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is a suburb rental in a wonderful location. The home is beautiful and open. The chipping green is fun. The back porch with the bourbon barrel fire pit is great.
Unlike many Bardstown rentals that have loud traffic noise, the Black Swan is relatively quiet without compromising accessibility and convenience. We will definitely rent the Black Swan again."
2021-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Beautiful home with a great location. Very easy to walk into the very welcoming downtown area.
The home is very well decorated with a modern design that felt like walking into an HGTV show. The master is gorgeous. We loved the outdoor fire pit! The home is new to the market, so we've left some private feedback on potential improvements but nothing that would prevent us from coming back again or recommending it to friends.
Beds were comfortable, but not 3 queens as the listing says. 1 was a king, 1 was a full (or double?), and unsure about the master as the other guests stayed there.
The gym in the listing is really a 4th room over the garage which we used for a pack-n-play. Half is putting turf, half is rubber floor to work out.
Guests should be aware that there is a security system camera outside the house and another in the great room. Not sure if the inside one was on, but may be a concern to some.
For those new to Bardstown, the town exceeded all our expectations and would recommend this area (and house) to anyone looking to explore the Bourbon trail!"
2021-10-01,5,Group trip,"A true gem is a cosy small town American treasure of Kentucky. Modern design and clean well equipped home.

2024-05-01,5,Group trip,Great location and awesome house. Character of an old house but modern convenience of a remodeled and updated house. High ceilings both upstairs and downstairs. Speakeasy was fantastic but we didn’t get to use it much because so many great places nearby. Not one even minor thing went wrong. Would highly recommend.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Very neat, clean, well decorated, restored historical home. A short walk to most everything in Bardstown."
2024-04-01,5,Group trip,Allison’s place was great for our stay in Bardstown. The house was big enough that everybody had their own space. The speakeasy and patio were our two favorite places to hang out. We explored distillery’s all around and that’s why we chose Allison’s house. It was central to everywhere we wanted to visit. At night we were able to walk downtown and have dinner and experience the real Bardstown atmosphere. There were bars with live music all weekend. Would defiantly stay at Allison’s house again.
2024-04-01,5,Group trip,"The house was exactly as described. The beds were super comfy, the house was well stocked with barware and the speakeasy was the cutest thing ever. We had one little hiccup while we were there and Allison quickly responded and took care of it immediately. Also, it was just a block to downtown Bardstown. Would love to visit again someday!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Excellent all the way around. Location was perfect. Beds comfy. Super clean. Loved it. Hate to brag too much because I want it available for when we want it!

Would come back in a heartbeat (and probably will when my bourbon supply runs low)."

2023-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,Absolutely wonderful place the family!
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The location was absolutely perfect. Right in downtown but on a quiet side street. We could walk to restaurants and shops within 5 mins. The home itself was spacious and very clean with updated bathrooms. Absolutely loved this house and appreciated the private backyard to sit outside and chat. One other item to note is the private parking behind a gate which was a nice feature. Would absolutely stay here again!
2023-11-01,5,Stayed one night,Fantastic host! House was great with a very cool speak east. Location is perfect with walking distance to downtown . 10/10 - would stay again!
2023-11-01,5,Group trip,Great place and great location!! Would love to come back one day
2023-10-01,5,Group trip,Solid place
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"Excellent location, responsive and friendly hosts. Accurately and well-featured home.
To me it was high-priced for a sole Monday night in a rural town. However, that price might be the going rate (I'm not sure), and of course it was no different than what i agreed to pay. It's also true cleaning fees and Airbnb fees can be proportionately higher on a single-night stay.
This property served the intended purpose and its location and furnishings were all a big plus. So were the communicative/friendly hosts. I've never previously rented an entire free-standing indep home via Airbnb and if the right circumstances re-emerged for such necessity, and of course for B-town, i would seriously consider revisiting the Speakeasy house.
Thank you to my hosts."
2023-10-01,5,Group trip,"Great place to stay with friends. Great location, clean and comfortable."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"A beautiful home with all amenities and perfect if you’re visiting a distillery or two, while in town. Will stay here again, next time in Bardstown!"

2023-08-01,5,Group trip,Will stay again next time in Bardstown.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Our family had a fabulous time at Allison's house. We received perfect instructions on how to enter and shut down the home along with wonderful recommendations for places to visit in town. Allison and Steven were very responsive to special requests and even went out of their way to research LBGTQ-friendly establishments for us to support. The home itself was fantastic - a perfect blend of small town charm and lux amenities, including art nouveaux appointments, marble tiled bathrooms, soft towels, and clean decor. Hard to say enough about the speakeasy where our family retired to after restaurants each evening to to play cards, joke around and catch up - a welcome reprieve from the digital onslaught of our daily lives. The house is centrally located close to shopping and restaurants or you can park on the porch swing and watch the world go buy. We look forward to recommending Allison's home and hopefully returning ourselves one day. Thanks for everything!"
2023-07-01,5,Group trip,Loved the location as it was very walkable to all downtown Bardstown has to offer. Super clean home with no issues. Great communication from the host and very timely when I would write them. Would stay here again.

2023-04-01,5,Group trip,"What a surprise find for our last minute Bardstown trip! Above and beyond my expectations! Their house was a real feast for the eyes, it was super bright/spacious and convenient.
The location was unbeatable, right in the middle of everything downtown. All the best spots to drink or eat were walkable - a block away from everything!
During our stay we went to Heaven hill, Willett, BBC and Beam.
The house itself was great, cool decor and the SECRET speakeasy behind the bookcase door was amazing! (pictures don't do it justice)
Stoked to have found this spot in Bardstown and can't wait to come back."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"Our last-minute stay in Bardstown turned out to be an incredible surprise! The home we stayed in was a gem and offered unbeatable convenience and comfort.
Located right in the heart of town, the house was just a short drive away from numerous distilleries, including Heaven Hill, Willett, Bardstown Bourbon, Jim Beam, and Lux Row, which we were able to visit during our long weekend stay.
The decor of the house was stunning and we loved the multiple cozy spaces available for us to unwind, especially since we were traveling with a group of six.
The highlight of our stay was definitely the secret speakeasy hidden behind a bookcase door. We had no idea what to expect and were blown away by how swanky and cool it was. It really set the perfect vibe!
Accessing the house was a breeze thanks to the keypad lock, and we found the check-in document with recommendations for local spots to be very helpful. We feel lucky to have discovered such a unique spot in Bardstown and can't wait to return"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"A Bourbon Lover's Dream in Bardstown's Heart!
My stay at the Secret Speakeasy in Downtown Bardstown was nothing short of magical! Hosts Allison and Steven have thought of everything to make this historic home a haven for bourbon enthusiasts and travelers alike. The house's art deco design is both elegant and inviting, making it a comfortable oasis after a day spent exploring the nearby distilleries.
I loved being just a 10-minute drive from just about every distillery. There's no better location for a bourbon adventure!
The hidden speakeasy inside the house was a delightful surprise that made our stay even more special. We had a blast discovering the bookcase door and enjoying the full bar inside. What an incredible touch!
Allison was a fantastic host who provided clear instructions and local recommendations. The house itself was immaculate and well-equipped, with plenty of space for our group.
This was such a rad place to stay while drinking on the Bourbon trail! We’ll be back soon!"

Was a very quiet and peaceful setting!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was by far one of our absolute favorite places we have ever stayed at with AirBNB. J.T. Was a great host, the farm house was exactly as described but better. It was so peaceful and waking up to the horses in the field every morning was great. My wife had an absolute ball feeding them. The city of Bardstown is a little hidden treasure of Kentucky in our opinion. We will be back every time we pass thru and probably just to have a place to come to and relax. 10/10"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Clean. Nice patio with relaxing view of horse pasture. House nicely remodeled.

2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,A great stay and location for the Bourbon Trail. On The Rocks really goes with the theme of a bourbon trip. The house is very comfortable and in a beautiful and peaceful surrounding. Would definitely return if we get the chance.

Must try On The Rocks if your planning a trip to the area."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful and pristine home. Host communicated with us prior to, during, and after our stay. Short drive to Bardstown. We weren’t able to take advantage of the patio area, but I am sure it would be beautiful in warmer weather! Having horses for neighbors is a bonus!"

2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Would highly recommend staying at J.T.'s place!
The location is close enough to town to get what you need and enjoy the amenities but far enough out to see the stars and sit by the fire with no sound of traffic!
Roomy, clean, uncluttered, and comfortable! Thanks!!!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We loved our stay during our trip to Kentucky’s Bourbon Trail. The neighborhood is very safe. I got to run a few miles each morning as I am training for an upcoming half marathon. Check in was super easy and seeing the horses every morning while drinking coffee was a huge plus. We will definitely be back and highly recommend staying here while you’re in Bardstown.
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had an absolutely wonderful stay! The house was in a beautiful, country neighborhood. The house was very spacious, clean and comfortable! When we vacation, comfort is VERY important to us and the loveseat was super comfy with blankets available, if needed. Bed was very comfortable. Main shower was AWESOME with the rainwater head that still had great pressure. The kitchen had everything we needed! I like to cook, I'm a culinary arts student, and I appreciated the variety of knives available.
It rained quite a bit the day we arrived so we didn't get to enjoy the patio, but it was awesome looking.
We had a very relaxing stay, which is what we needed.
There are lots of things to do downtown as well - which is just minutes away. Shopping, coffee, eateries, Bourbon distilleries and much more!
We had a great time and will be back💞"

2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Enjoyed the place. Clean and match the description and pictures. Easy access to Bardstown, restaurants, and local distilleries we wanted to visit. Kitchen was great and utilized the grill as well. Plenty of plates, utensils and other items we needed to cook meals. Great place to stay. We will stay here again if available on our next trip to the Bardstown area."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"Wonderful stay! Beautifully updated space with lots of room. Comfy beds and pillows. High end furnishings (couches, blinds, pillows, etc.) that make a difference in the comfort of your stay. Bardstown was such a cute town even though we were just passing through. Can’t wait to come back for a longer trip!"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Nice home in the country. Very clean and the bed was very comfortable. Look forward to my next stay. Great communications too.
2024-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"His place was as described and even more spacious than I expected. I felt very comfortable there.
Was not too far from town.
Had many brochures of things to do, places to eat and a sign in book with peoples comments and experiences, which was great to peruse. I would definitely stay again!"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed one night,Our stay was just for one night. It was nice and private and met all our needs. The host was great with communication and the house was very clean. I would highly recommend if you plan to stay in Bardstown.
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place. Clean and quiet. Horses out back give the full Kentucky feel.

2024-01-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We had a delightful 3-night stay in Bardstown, Kentucky. The Airbnb is conveniently located near downtown Bardstown, allowing us to easily explore the area. After days of exploring Bardstown's attractions, returning to this serene spot was a perfect way to unwind. The accommodation was comfortable, and the host's attention to detail enhanced our overall experience. Highly recommend for a relaxing stay in the countryside."
2024-01-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Great place & exactly what we needed while amping up for a bourbon tour - I’m sure we’ll be back!
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This stay was incredible! The home was very clean, with lovely linens, comfy pillows, and it even smelled great! The horses came out for one day to get some pets, but it was pretty chilly in January! Can't wait come back and see them at a warmer time of year. The hosts were so responsive and understanding when we had a late check-in and had some great recommendations out for the area. Bardstown is a wonderful place, made perfect by this Airbnb!"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Had a Wonderful stay, excellent place to stay for Bardstown visit!"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Our favorite place to stay in Kentucky!
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Fantastic location! We felt like we were at a home away from home. My parents and uncle had never stayed at an AirBnb before (they're older and don't understand how it works), after our stay, they were so impressed, it sold them on AirBnb. It was really nice staying a little ways from town so we could completely relax. We LOVED seeing the horses in the morning, and the sunrises and sunsets behind the horse area were beautiful. We also really loved that they put a tree up for Christmas!! It was such wonderful touch. Also, the house itself was just great, the showers, everything. Thank you so much for allowing dogs! Really great place to stay, highly recommend."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We are going to return to Bardstown in the spring and hope that “On the Rocks” is available. If not, we will plan our mini vaca around when it is. This is one of the, hands down, best Airbnbs we have ever stayed in. Don’t get me wrong, we have stayed in some nice plates but as soon as my wife and I walked in, we both agreed we could live there. Clean, high end appliances, bathrooms were updated and clean, and the bed was super comfortable. TV in each bedroom and large tv in the living room. The couches in the living room were super comfortable and all reclined. Once we got there, it didn’t take long and I was asleep in the recliner with a bourbon in hand. The next morning, we were greeted by the friendly horses at the fence to pet, which my almost four year old loved. Great outdoor area to relax out back as well. The hosts of this place are all great as each of them responded to questions and our responses. We will be back 100%!"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,We loved our stay! Holiday decorations were a nice touch- festive but simple! Great location! We will definitely be back next time we are in the area!

We had an amazing time and hope to be back!"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Everything here was perfect, it was very private but the hosts were responsive and helpful. Lots of distilleries around, and Bardstown itself was nice as well. My daughter loved being able to pet and feed the horses. The home itself is very nice as well. We would absolutely stay here again."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"I absolutely loved it there. Very cozy, clean and beautiful. Loved seeing the horses out back.
If I could have changed one thing it would be to have had a later check out time. 10:00 felt early wanted to enjoy the morning there a little longer but felt rushed. But other than that I loved it. And will be back!
❤️"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Great stay at JT’s. Nice and private. Super clean. Kids loved seeing the horses. Would love to stay again next time we are in the area.

The home was beautiful and spotlessly clean. The home was stocked with everything you could ask for to have a successful stay.
The best part was how friendly and responsive the hosts were."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,On the Rocks was a very inviting house from which we explored several distilleries close by. The house was well- stocked and comfortable. Very clean and open for relaxation. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at OTR and recommend it to everyone. The neighbor's horses were an added benefit. The Guest Book provided by the hosts was very helpful with restaurant recommendations and local attractions. We'll definitely book another stay at On the Rocks next time we're in the area.
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great, clean place! Beautiful house on a beautiful property!! Highly recommend"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed one night,A great place to stay for the weekend
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"On the Rocks was amazing. Beautiful setting to be outside and feed the horses while taking in the morning sunrise. The home was clean, well furnished, and well stocked with all the amenities from the necessities for making coffee to toiletries. 2 bedrooms and 2 full bathrooms make the home well suited for 4 adults.
The home is close to downtown Bardstown and only a short drive to the distilleries. This was the perfect place to stay while visiting Bardstown, and we will definitely book again when we return!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The home was in good condition, clean, and practically furnished. We did not really need to bring anything extra because all of the household items were available. The neighboring property has horses and provides a beautiful backdrop. We were very happy with the proximity to things in Bardstown. It's a few miles outside of downtown, but nothing we went to was more than 10 minutes away. We would absolutely look to stay here or another property from these hosts again if returning to Bardstown."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Loved that the place was exactly how it was described and no hidden surprises!! If we were back in the area again we would definitely try to see if it would be available!
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Our stay at ""On the Rocks"" was perfect from the moment we pulled into the driveway. The horses were right there at the fence line as if they were expecting us...they loved coming by in the morning and evening.
The house was meticulously clean and every detail was thought of to ensure you had the things you needed for a worry free stay. Comfortable beds and furniture were so nice after a day out on the trail or simply experiencing the local attractions.
We really enjoyed sitting out back in the evenings and having a drink by the fire pit because the property is so peaceful and beautiful. We hope to have the opportunity to return...soon!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We have stayed in our fair share of AirBNB's both in the states and abroad, and On The Rocks is one of the best. We felt at home from the moment we entered.
The host spares no expense in towels, shower gels, shampoos, hand soaps, conditioners, and an extremely well stocked kitchen. We also appreciated a box of tissues. It is the little niceties which make a big impact.
We also appreciated televisions in the bedrooms and great room. We cozied up on the reclining sofa with a luxurious blanket in the evenings to unwind.
The decor was both tasteful and appropriate for the theme.
In addition, treating the horses daily was a joy!
We highly recommend On The Rocks and will be booking again soon...CHEERS!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,Great place in a great location.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is our 3rd stay with JT and co-host, our first stay at this particular list. You can’t go wrong staying with this group or either location!! Both locations are roomy and equipped with all you need, having the horses is just an added bonus! Each location is very conveniently located and easy to access anything you need or want to do. You can JT and his co-host take great pride in their listings!! Can’t wait to come back!!! Thanks again for he best stay!!!!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Very cozy and peaceful home. Great design. Beautiful land with horses and close drive to town, but private and quiet neighborhood.

2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"J.T.’s was an absolute perfect fit for us.
The home had beautiful surroundings and was a Short drive to everything we wanted to see in the area."

2023-09-01,5,Stayed with a pet,It was our second stay here. We love staying here. It’s so peaceful and beautiful nestled in the heart of the bourbon capital. We can’t wait to come back again!
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Everything was great!
The house is very well stocked with everything you might need, including snacks and great coffee!
Host was very responsive and met every need we had.
Waking up in the morning and watching the sun come up while having coffee with the horses was a plus!
Property was very clean, beautiful, and secluded enough to have all the privacy you might want.
Would definitely stay again and looking forward to it!
Cheers!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"A very lovely, peaceful place surrounded by beautiful countryside, farm & horses! We enjoyed a few days to visit some Kentucky distilleries & unplug in the country with our pups, the yard is not fully fenced, but we brought extra long leads and attached to trees. The road is very private so we also could take them on walks down to the farm at the end. The horses in property directly behind are super friendly and will come visit if you call them over! (Better have an apple in hand) Even though you feel secluded, it is very short drive into town which has quaint Main Street lined with shops and restaurants.
I’d like to add that the hosts responded very quickly, suggested local services and even offered to come by with an air pump when I mentioned our vehicle had a low tire. They also provided local area guide books, restaurant recommendations and maps. I can’t wait to come back and stay longer!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great stay!
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Couples trip on the Bourbon Trail. Appreciated the thoughtful amenities and layout. So peaceful and relaxing. Ironically, we ended up not doing any of the Bardstown distilleries, yet still perfect for day trips to Frankfort, Lexington, and Loretto."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"On the rocks was the perfect location for our weekend away! The kitchen was well stocked, beds were comfy, and the host was fabulous! Would absolutely stay again!"

2023-09-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"My husband, dog, and I absolutely loved staying here. The home was very comfortable and inviting and was the perfect place to relax after exploring Bardstown. The house was very conveniently located, being close to downtown and the distilleries in Bardstown. The house and grounds were so peaceful and quiet, and it was really nice to be able to look out of the kitchen window and see horses outside! The outside area with the grill, seating area, and fire pit was very nice and we loved watching the horses. The beds were really comfortable and having two bathrooms was great to be able to both get ready at the same time. I would highly recommend this house to anyone, and will definitely stay here again when we come back to Bardstown."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed about a week,"The house was beautiful and clean. The horses were a big plus, love them. JT and everyone involved was extremely helpful and responded immediately with any questions or concerns. They went above and beyond. Hopefully we will be back."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We enjoyed the peace and quiet of the house being at the end of the road. Loved the horses that came by for a visit from time to time. Liked being able to take our dog out for a quick walk along the country roads. The house was set up with everything we needed and we enjoyed being able to grill out and the fact that the kitchen had a 16 cup coffee maker. We drink a lot of coffee. Beds were comfortable, plenty of linen and extra blankets if you needed them. Would recommend this place if you visit Bardstown as long as you have a designated driver if you choose to drink as it is a little way out of town."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"My wife and I stayed with another couple on the first night of our kid-free vacation. On the Rocks was just what we needed! We liked the comfortable, spacious layout. The kitchen and grill were nice for doing our own meals. The place was private enough we didn't worry about making a little noice while we were laughing and playing games late into the night. Communication was excellent. I would encourage other guests coming to visit the Bourbon Trail to stay here (unless it's the same time we want to come back in the future; then you should definitely stay somewhere else)."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We have stayed here several times and every time our stay has been perfect. We love staying here.

There was a book of stuff to do and also recommendations from the host on where to go to eat or do other activities We highly recommend this place to others and we will probably be going back. Thanks.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,Loved it!! Will definitely go back
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"""On the ""Rocks"" is a peaceful getaway. Very clean and newly refurbished. Loved the horses in the backyard. They were friendly and came over. You need to drive to historic downtown, but it is only a 5 minute drive. You won't be disappointed with this place. Great place to relax and enjoy your bourbon."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful and peaceful location. Enjoyed the patio area overlooking the farm. The horses came by daily and it was fun to feed them. JT’s home was very clean and comfortable. They provided every amenity you needed for your stay. Close proximity to Bardstown, which is a great central location for the Bourbon Trail. We would highly recommend On The Rocks!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Favorite Airbnb in the area! Thanks again for the great stay!
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is an amazing place to say to do everything Bardstown, Louisville, and Bourbon trail related !

2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"On the rocks felt like home from the moment we walked in. We were lacking nothing inside and out. (Loved having the grill). Coffees were great the map was handy, all of the furniture was comfortable. Would go back in a heartbeat. And the location for doing the bourbon trail was ideal . Kudos to JT"

2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We stayed the weekend to attend a sporting event in Louisville. The home was perfect. It was very clean, spacious, and filled with amenities. The horses and pasture were so peaceful...they love apples by the way. Bardstown, KY is a hidden gem. What a great small town atmosphere with great restaurants, and evening patio music. We would stay with this host many times over. The home, property, and peaceful setting were AWESOME!! We plan to stay with this host again very soon. We recommend you do the same."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"J.T.’s House on the Rocks was a perfect place for us (two couples) for a long fun weekend in the Bardstown area. The house was beautiful, clean, and well-organized and located in a wonderful spot. An idyllic location in the countryside just outside of Bardstown, but also really easy to get to town or cruise over to the nearby distilleries. It was also very enjoyable to spend some peaceful evenings outside and have the neighboring horses come check us out. We would definitely visit J.T.’s place again and would recommend to anyone."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We thoroughly enjoyed On the Rocks. Very comfortable and private. Easy drive into Bardstown. Being in the country was very relaxing and we enjoyed the horses and other pets.
2023-04-01,5,Stayed about a week,On the Rocks is a peaceful place at the end of the road. Very clean with everything we needed. Did not get a chance to use it much but also had a patio with grill and firepit with a supply of logs to start with. Just a few minutes from the Blue Grass Parkway it was very convenient for our visits to family in Elizabethtown and Lexington. Bardstown is a nice walkable village and although we did not take any tours this trip you are in the heart of the Bourbon Trail.
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,A wonderful space!! Make it your choice if you’re heading to the Bourbon Trail!!!
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We are so glad we stayed at this home! Absolutely beautiful inside and out. Short drive to downtown to all of what Bardstown has to offer. The beds were extremely comfortable. It was the perfect home away from home while exploring the Bourbon Trail! Highly recommend J.T.’s home.
2023-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,On the Rocks was an amazing place to stay. The house was super clean and the beds were very comfortable. It’s in a gorgeous location surrounded by beauty. The hosts were very responsive. We asked about firewood and they delivered it promptly. We really enjoyed our evening around the fire pit. We were hoping to see and spend time with the horses but unfortunately didn’t even get a glimpse. Next time maybe! If we’re back in Bardstown we’ll definitely choose this place again.
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great place to stay, we were 2 couples and we loved the home and it’s amenities. When the weather allowed, it was nice to sit outside on the patio. Short drive to all the things we wanted to do."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Our family loved our stay at the ""House on the Rocks"". The house was extremely clean and had everything we needed. There was a lot to do / see within an hour drive. Our children loved feeding the horses everyday!"

2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Ideal location for touring the Bourbon Trail. Close to restaurants, shopping but not right in town. Quiet and private location."

2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a great stay at J.T.’s place!
The house was as shown in the pictures, the beds were comfortable, great showers in bathrooms, and the house was very clean! The location is great for Bourbon Trail distillery visits. Would highly recommend!"
2023-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"Overall the stay was nice. Comfortable beds, coffees and teas a nice touch. Much more room than a hotel. We were only there for a day. Was surprised to see worker around the back of the house while drinking coffee in the morning. I think they were there to landscape the yard. The water pressure in the bathroom was very low to wash hands and shower. Could be a fluke. I still believe the place deserves a high ranking though."
2023-02-01,5,Stayed with a pet,We really enjoyed our Bardstown stay at J.T.'s place. Felt like we had a horse farm all to ourselves for a few days. Everything inside and out worked great for us and our two dogs. Close enough to downtown to enjoy everything Bardstown had to offer. Would really recommend the Volstead Bourbon Lounge for some great bourbon options.
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,JT and hosts were extremely friendly and kind. Excellent communication. We appreciate their hospitality and kindness. Gorgeous place!
2023-01-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"I’ve stayed at the Hampton inn in Bardstown for years whenever I am in town. This time I decided to try Airbnb so my service dog would have more room outside and I can’t say enough how perfect this place was. Close enough to everything but quiet, clean, and just a great place to relax after a day on the bourbon trail. Thank you again! I’m sure I will be back soon!"

2024-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We (two adult couples) had a lovely stay during our Bourbon Trail trip! This house was very centrally located for the distilleries we had planned to visit, which spanned from near Lexington to Louisville, including Bardstown and Maker's Mark to the south - all within a one hour drive, which was very convenient. We enjoyed the multiple amenities the house offers, including the card table, the pool table, the patio (and grill) and the fire pit (where we sat star-gazing one dark evening). We enjoyed cooking in the well-equipped kitchen when we did not eat out in Bardstown and Louisville. Some of our favourite memories are from drinking coffee on the patio in the morning, listening to the birds singing. We slept very comfortably in our beds. The host, Haley, was very responsive when we had questions. We would definitely recommend this place and hope to get a chance to come back!"

It’s super close to several bourbon distilleries, including heaven hill and willett, which are both literally 5 mins away. It is outside of town, so you do need to drive to get to the hub of bardstown. But I didn’t mind because the area is beautiful and peaceful."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Absolutely loved our visit to Bardstown and the surrounding areas! We felt right at home at Haley’s place. The house was very clean and comfortable. There was so much to do there (movie theater room, foosball, shuffleboard, pool, corn hole, etc.) Haley was very helpful and responsive. The kids had fun running around and exploring the large yard. We would love to stay again one day. Thanks for sharing your lovely home with us!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The Bourbon Basecamp was the perfect getaway spot! The house is nesteled on a little hill in the country with beautiful trees, we loved grilling on the patio. Haley really thought to include so many amenities for her guests, and made our stay so comfortable. The entertainment room was a huge hit with my family, we spent so much time playing pool, poker, shuffleboard, chess and watching movies downstairs. The stylish bars were well stocked with glassware and tools to make the perfect whiskey cocktail. The kitchen came equipped with all the tools needed to cook meals and dinnerware to serve our whole family. The beds were super comfortable and the blackout curtains were a nice touch. This place really felt like home. Haley was quick to respond to any questions or concerns, her directions were clearly communicated and she was friendly and helpful every step of the way. I'd recommend this house to anyone looking for a peaceful getaway close to all the Bardstown distilleries! Book it!!!!"

Wish I had the appliances in my own home! This house is very spacious and would comfortably fit 6 guests. Our kids loved staying upstairs with their own bathroom and TV. The beds are very comfortable and seem to be new mattresses. So many extras that made our stay perfect. Michael was very responsive to my questions. I would highly recommend this home for anyone visiting Bardstown. It's centrally located to restaurants, shopping and historic sites."

2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"FIRST RENTERS REVIEW!
I am going to fully disclose that I am a fellow host on Air Bnb and very particular + objective about the places I stay.

That being said, my friends and myself were blown away by this home and the host.
Host: Annette was welcoming, available, genuine and went out of her way to make sure we had great time!
Location : You cant get much be better. Few blocks to all the bars/restaurants in downtown but quite at house. Liquor store a block away was added bonus for a boys bourbon trip! Most of the popular distilleries were a 10 min or less ride
Home: This should be in the Air Bnb Lux home category. Everything from the outside grounds, new deck, porch sitting area were more than I expected. Inside the decor was chic and had a boutique hotel vibe. Bedding was excellent. Master bath felt new and huge. Living room was great area for a group.
Don't hesitate to book this because of minimal reviews; you will be sorry.
THIS WILL BE the top Air Bnb in town."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"From the moment we stepped into HayJac, we were greeted with warmth and hospitality.

Our hosts were especially helpful and made us feel welcome. We highly recommend the house, the location, and the hosts."
2024-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This was our 1st trip to Bardstown and the Bourbon Trail. Beautiful town and a beautiful home. This home is perfect for the Trail and the Derby. Jim and Gina took great care of us! We'll be back to visit.
2024-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The HayJac House blew us away. Best AirBnB we have stayed at. So many amenities. Well stocked. Exceeded our expectations at every turn. This is the perfect stay for visiting the Bourbon Trail. Jim & Gina’s attention to every detail is extraordinary. So lovely. So functional. So convenient. Wow. If we could give them even more stars we would.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I was in charge of setting this trip to the Bourbon Trail and suggested to my wife and travel partners that we go AirBnB as opposed to a hotel, so I was concerned that my selection be acceptable to all. Well this home is a charmer, sweet and well appointed. The finish was better than most new homes. We enjoyed the walkability to Hadorn's Bakery, Scout & Scholar, The Rick House and more.
Best was enjoying the evening together with an Old Fashion in the living room"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"And yet again, our stay at this gem in Bardstown was fabulous! Easy communication with the owners, every amenity accounted for (and then some), fantastically clean home - we cannot wait to return!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"When you book an Airbnb, this is the kind of property that you dream about. It was amazing! We were very comfortable and it was spotlessly clean. Jim and Gina added so many delightful personal touches. We were within walking distance to the town and a great new restaurant. Jim was available to answer all of our questions, often within minutes. This was our 4th trip to Bardstown and this by far was our favorite place to stay. We will 100% be back."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was one of the very best homes I have ever stayed in. The hosts were fantastic, the home was beautiful. The location was perfect. The house was so incredibly comfortable, and the hosts were so welcoming. We loved the bedrooms and bathrooms and the kitchen was wonderful. My only complaint is we didn’t stay longer.
I can absolutely recommend this home and the hosts."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"CLEAN!! This was an awesome stay for us during the holidays. There are so many great features in the home that made it so relaxing. The kitchen is fully stocked with all the necessities needed to feel at home. Right down to the LARGE Bourbon ice cubes needed to enjoy an evening nightcap. We walked the square every evening, exploring all the local shops and restaurants. We always finished our evening at Volstead Speakeasy.
We LOVE Bardstown and will hopefully return next year. Happy New Year!!"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,It was our third stay at the HayJac House and will certainly not be our last as long asd this gem of a find is available!
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"From the moment we stepped through the door, we were enchanted by Jim and Gina's beautiful home. The space was sparkling clean and decorated to perfection for the holidays.
The house itself was spacious and comfortable, with everything we needed for a relaxing and enjoyable stay. The beds were incredibly comfortable, ensuring a perfect night's sleep. The highlight, however, was the master bathroom and shower. It was luxurious and spa-like, offering a rejuvenating experience.
But what set this stay apart was the exceptional hospitality of the hosts. They were incredibly responsive and helpful throughout our entire stay. Even more special, they surprised my brother-in-law with a birthday card and a delicious cookie cake for his birthday. This thoughtful gesture made his day and added a warm touch to our stay.
We couldn't have asked for a more perfect place. We will definitely be returning for another magical stay in the future!"

This home is spotless, spacious, beautiful decorated with creative decor. Has brand new appliances, two very nice size bedrooms with each having their own bathroom, washer and dryer, along with several indoor seating areas and several covered outdoor seating areas to enjoy anytime of the day! We loved it so much, we booked HayJac House for our visit already next year!!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The pictures do not do this property justice. The house was quaint and well situated to walk around the historic downtown Bardstown. The house was spotless and we wanted for nothing. The Scout and Scholar was a great place to eat and drink. We sat on the back patio Saturday night and listened the band from Scout and Scholar, don’t worry the band was done by 10pm. We were 5-10 minutes from all the popular distilleries. Jim and Gina were great hosts!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,An excellent experience!
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Jim and Gina should be the poster child for Air BNB rentals!!! Literally the best place we have ever stayed with the BEST hosts!

2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Wow. What a place. Obviously the house has been completely remodeled. The place was immaculate.
2 full bedrooms each with their own bathrooms. A powder room as well, tucked in behind the kitchen. Laundry facilities available if needed. Great back porch for enjoying the outdoors.
We’ve stayed many, many places but this location and amenities tops the list. Will definitely plan a stay there again."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The HayJac House was beautiful! We celebrated my husband’s birthday with a trip to the Bourbon Capital of the World and we were so impressed with Jim and Gina’s home! The back porch was prime seating for live music Friday night at the brewery next door. The home was cozy, very clean, has an awesome kitchen, primary suite is amazing, and is walkable to restaurants and boutiques. We’re already planning our next trip to Bardstown :)"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was our first trip to Bardstown and we will not be able to stay anywhere else after such a wonderful experience at HayJac house. We received texts from Jim with easy check-in instructions and recommendations for the area. The home is spotless with perfect decor and furniture. The beds were extremely comfortable, the linens were so nice. Added bonus for having two robes! The appliances in the kitchen are brand new and sleek. Having ice balls in the freezer is a perfect touch. The covered patio was the best spot to end each evening with our friends.
Thank you Jim and Gina for making us feel spoiled and made our trip feel extra special. We will be back!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Jim and Gina were amazing hosts! Their place was very clean and the amenities were above and beyond what we expected. Jim had numerous recommendations that were very helpful. We actually got to meet him while we were there, which was a plus! The entire home is beautifully decorated. The bed is very comfortable, linens and towels were top notch! We especially loved having Scout and Scholar brewery and Haydorn’s Bakery next door. Definitely get a YumYum at Haydorn’s. We did several distillery tours while we were there. Heaven Hill, Jim Beam, Willet and Preservation were all worth it. Don’t hesitate to book this place! You will fall in love with it!
Thank you Jim and Gina for your hospitality. We absolutely enjoyed our stay and can’t wait to come back!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is our third year returning and again did not disappoint. House is immaculate, clean with a beautiful high end kitchen and bathrooms. No detail has been spared. The old charm of the house has been masterfully included with all the modern amenities. Will be back for year 4!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Exceeded our expectations. Perfect home for two couples in the heart of Bardstown. Nice, comfy furnishings throughout. Great kitchen. Nice patio with very comfortable chairs."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Pictures don’t do it justice. It is a beautiful place that is decorated with care and excellent taste. It was very well stocked with all amenities needed and many more. The location was great. We visited many distilleries on the bourbon trail. All were in a short to medium drive from the house. We spent a lot of time on the comfortable patio tasting the bourbons we picked up! Jim Hagan was great at communicating about the area and the house!
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Coming to Bardstown? Book HeyJac now! Location perfect, you can walk everywhere! The house is meticulously clean with five star decor and amenities . Thoughtful care in every detail…. You won’t be disappointed… Jim and Gina thought if everything!!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"this is our second visit here and we love it! they have every amenity you could want or need. not your typical Air bnb, it is a home with beautiful details and touches. we also love it shares a back fence with Scout and Scholar, a stellar brewery. we recommend this home!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Perfect place to stay in Bardstown. You can sit on the covered patio name listen to the music at Scout & Scholar.
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The place is beautiful! Very walkable. There was a brewery right next door. Lots to do around Bardstown. I would visit here again!
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was the second time we stayed at this property. There was great communication from Jim and Gina. Checking in was very simple. The house is very comfortable and beautiful. It is in a great location making it convenient to walk around Bardstown. If/when we come back to the area, we will definitely try and stay here again."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful house in perfect location! So comfortable….felt like we were at home! We only used the master bedroom but the second bedroom looked just as cozy. Don’t have not even one complaint. Excited to see that the master king bed was split adjustable….just like ours at home! Bath in that room had a fabulous shower and vanity area. Really appreciated that there was a comfortable chair in the bedroom. Actually, furniture in every part of the house was very comfortable and in great condition. There was a Keurig coffee machine with lots of pods furnished. We stayed 5 nights. Bourbon tours a couple of days and races at Keeneland were an easy drive. It is very evident that Jim and Gina take great care of their rental! May just make another trip back in the fall!"
2023-04-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Great location! Beautiful home.
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Jim and house was absolutely gorgeous. Everything was just as described. Beautifully decorated, well supplied, very clean, great neighborhood. The only bad part was that we didn't stay long enough. :)
We definitely would book this place again!!"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We had a wonderful stay! The place was even better than the descriptions and pictures! The house was extremely clean and had everything we needed. The location was excellent and we would definitely stay again!

2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This was an amazing Airbnb. Beautiful home.
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very comfortable great location lots to do
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was the best airbnb we've ever stayed in! We were in KY for a bourbon trail trip and stayed at Jim and Gina's house for 3 nights. Everything was just as advertised - The house was lovely, within walking distance to many restaurants, and perfectly situated in bourbon country. Do NOT miss staying here!"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great location, can walk to downtown and most restaurants. Beautiful kitchen and setting. Loved the outdoor patio area."
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What a great place! Incredibly well appointed (especially for those fortunate enough to be in the master bedroom suite). Large living spaces, plenty of comfortable seating, superb lighting, spotlessly clean, and special touches everywhere - extra pillows, throw blankets, bathrobes(!), multiple coffee machines with all associated supplies, and even large ice balls and large ice cubes perfect for sipping bourbon. Great location, just a short walk to all downtown restaurants, bars, and shops, including the donut shop right on the corner. Had great interactions with Jim, getting restaurant recommendations in advance and during a chance encounter with him one evening when we all ended up at his favorite restaurant."
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"If you are looking for an immaculate Airbnb to stay in while visiting lovely shops and experiencing the local but world famous distilleries then this is your place. It is charming, clean, comfortable and just feels good. Great place to relax and unwind where every detail has been thought of. Don’t miss out!"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Gorgeous house with an amazing location! Everything is within walking distance with a donut shop right next door and a brewery. We had a great time and the house is worth every penny we spend on it. I would recommend to stay here any day! Super clean and very welcoming atmosphere.
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Best air bnb experience ever. Jim and Gina went out of their way to make our visit as easy and convenient for us as possible. Their house is absolutely lovely and in the perfect location.
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Would have given bonus stars! Have never been so well taken care of by our hosts in any other Air BnB. Communication was outstanding, location was absolutely perfect. Everything about the house to the littlest detail was outstanding - even a deck of cards was there (we had forgotten ours). A truly in forgettable time! Thank you ever so much for being such wonderful hosts!"
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place is amazing. If you are traveling to this part of Kentucky, you should book it. Seriously.
The home is comfortable, beautiful, everything we needed (and more) was just where you'd think to look for it.
We stayed with my mom, who is 75 and has some mobility challenges, and so a place with no stairs was important (there is a step up to get into the house, and that's it). Mom also prefers a bathtub, and it's getting harder and harder to find a nice rental with a bathtub. The bathtub is great, and the bathrooms in general are lovely. The kitchen is a dream.
The covered back porch was a favorite, complete with very comfortable chairs and ceiling fans.
There are two recliners in the lounge area near the open kitchen/dining area, and they are SO comfortable. I slept quite happily in one of the recliners on the night my husband was snoring, and when I felt chilly in the middle of the night, there was a lightweight but snuggly throw blanket within reach.
The hosts are super helpful and answer questions quickly. We never saw them, but we deeply appreciate the thoughtfulness and heart that they put into this place. My mom finished her book while we were there and left it in the free library in the living room for someone else to read in the future. We traveled from two different places, arriving with a 21 foot long van and an SUV, and the driveway was long enough to park both with room to add even a third car.
The donuts next door are excellent (traditional/classic donut shop with a few twists), and the brew pub next door is lovely, with good beer and pretty good food. The pizza place recommended by the hosts was PHENOMENAL. You can walk to so many interesting places in the town from this rental, and many more amazing destinations are an easy drive.
Book it. You won't be sorry."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Our second stay at this location and once again exceeded our expectations. Beautiful home, tastefully decorated and equipped with all the amenities. A truly luxurious experience."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is the PERFECT Air Bnb to stay in while visiting the Bourbon Trail!
The location was excellent (within walking distance of bars, restaurants, historical sites, and shops), the home was immaculate and so well appointed (sleep number beds, luxurious linens, and beautifully decorated).
The hosts thought of everything!"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The best Airbnb we’ve ever stayed in. Could not agree more with all of the positive reviews. Will definitely be back again. 10/10…Highly recommend the yum yums at the bakery, dinner at the Rick House, beers at 3rd Street Tap and cocktails at Volstead. Loved all the bourbon trail spots, can’t go wrong with any, but if looking for something different we had a great time at Sun Valley Horse Farm (near Woodford Distillery)."
2022-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"A beautiful and very comfortable, roomy home in a great location in downtown Bardstown."
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Perfect! We are now spoiled. Jim and Gina have created the perfect Airbnb home to stay for a weekend in Bardstown for 2 couples. The living space is spacious with a gorgeous kitchen and bar. A wonderful front porch to sit and greet folks as they walk by. A fantastic back covered patio to sit and plan your day in Bardstown with a cup of coffee and Bloody Mary, and review your day in the evening after exploring Bardstown with a bourbon bought from your days journey. Your within walking distance of dozens of great shops for the ladies to spend the day and some great mens stores to find very cool stuff. Your also within walking distance of dozens of great restaurants and bars. The Bardstown night seen is hopping with great people from many states. If your wanting a great weekend in Bardstown, this is the place to stay!"
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Very nice inside, all amenities and awe some location"
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,If you are going to be in Bardstown this is the place to stay. The location is awesome and the house itself could not have been more comfortable. We highly recommend it.
2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Perfect spot located right next to downtown. Easy to get to all of our Bourbon tour spots. Beautiful patio seating areas. Clean and welcoming!
2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I could go ON and ON about how amazing this home is. I have stayed at many vacation rentals but this home exceeded all of our expectations. The hosts are SUPER responsive, caring and have taken the efforts to merge an historic cozy home with modern day amenities. I won't give away all the home's secrets, but the heated master bathroom floor, adjustable master bed and the most amazing comfortable furniture you have ever sat on will enhance your stay..... especially after visiting walking distance shops, restaurants and some tasting tours. We personally loved relaxing on the back porch listening to the live music on Saturday night from the restaurant next door, Scout and Scholar. Oh and the donut shop next door, Hadorn's is a must for a special breakfast treat. We are looking forward to our next visit. You WILL NOT be disappointed. This home is spectacular."
2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We booked our trip at the Hayjac House quite a few months before our stay. From that moment on, Jim & Gina have been responsive when we had questions about the stay or the area. Let me tell you, it only got better from there. The house is beautiful, in a FANTASTIC location and so comfy and fun. Every restaurant in town is a five minute walk or less - a waiter said that the sidewalks in Bardstown roll up at 10 pm and it's pretty true. Plan your Bardstown shopping and dinner for early. Hadorn Donuts next door means you have amazing fresh donuts for breakfast.
We can't wait to visit Bardstown and the Hayjac House again. It was clean, well-appointed, comfy and we felt safe with all of the outdoor cameras showing the exterior. This house, and the hosts, are gems for sure."
2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Extremely comfortable and beautiful home, wonderful hosts, and amazing location!"
2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,What a wonderful gem in the heart of Bardstown and Bourbon country. Jim and Gina's place is a great base for Bourbon tours in the area. The house was immaculate and had everything we could imagine needing. Communications with the hosts were clear and thorough and they responded quickly to questions. There are plenty of restaurants within walking distance and a wonderful donut shop right next door. It felt like a home away from home and was a perfect set up for two couples traveling together. We highly recommend this place for anyone wanting to explore the Bourbon Trail or just enjoy the Kentucky countryside!
2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This is an outstanding home. Great location and hosts. You can’t go wrong by staying here
2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The stay was fantastic and the accommodations were the best I've experienced through Airbnb! Location was unbeatable, you can walk to everything downtown has to offer including cute shops and restaurants. The back porch was ideal to unwind after a day of bourbon tastings and great food. I cannot recommend the Hay Jac house highly enough. Stop scrolling and stay here!!"
2022-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful home away from home.
2022-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Perfect gem of a house.
2021-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This Airbnb is amazing - the pictures don’t do it Justice. If you are looking for a two bedroom house in bardstown this is a must stay place. We will be staying again.
2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Fabulous home terrifically located in Bardstown’s entertainment district. Accommodations are excellently appointed - truly a home away from home.
An easy walk to excellent restaurants and local stores, including a terrific new local brewery just next door. Centrally located on the Bourbon Trail plus Bardstown offers easy drives to Lex, Louis, or Frank."
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This house is wonderful! The decor , attention to detail and location can't be beat ."
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Two words - STAY HERE! This home is even better in person. Jim & Gina have renovated literally the entire home, down to the smallest detail like heated floors in the master bathroom. It's in the perfect location in Bardstown - right next door to the best donuts/pastries, and a really cool hangout restaurant, Scot & Scholar Brewing Co. Everything, for our needs, was in walking distance. The town is adorable and there's a lot of great finds like antique & consignment stores. If I'm ever back in Bardstown then I'll definitely try to stay at Jim & Gina's house!"
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,A top notch home! Jim and Gina are perfect hosts!
2021-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Jim and Gina’s home was by far the best Airbnb we have ever stayed in. There is not a single thing to be changed that could have made it better. It was the cleanest Airbnb OR hotel room we have stayed in, and everything was absolutely luxurious. All communication with Jim and Gina was quick and helpful. We cannot wait to go back!"
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful home. Exquisitely furnished with anything you might need. Spotlessly clean. Close to all the goid restaurants—especially enjoyed Primo, The Rickhouse, and Scout and Scholar."
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We really enjoyed our stay at the HayJac House. It was clean, well appointed and close to everything. We were able to walk to several very good restaurants including the great bakery next door. We hope to return sometime soon."
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"A beautiful home in a great location.
We were a bit concerned when we arrived due to the scout and scholar being in the back yard however it closes early (9PM and not open Mon & Tues) and it was VERY quiet. It had amazing food (as did the bakery just next door) so a great spot for amazing food and good beer.
There were other areas in town (all walkable and safe) that offered great food and spirits as well. We even stopped in at the farmers market and had an amazing meal on the immaculate grill on the back porch.
Great location, beautiful home and very friendly owners!!!"
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This house is perfect. It has everything you can possibly want or need for a relaxing stay. The location is perfect and the house is very comfortable and spacious. The owners have spared no expense in renovating the charming home. You feel like you are in a luxurious 5-star hotel but it is an entire house of luxury! This location is within walking distance to many restaurants and shops downtown. Great patio out back and just all around wonderful. We enjoyed everything about this house. We hope to stay here again.
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The HayJac house is the perfect mix of feeling right and home and staying at a 5-star hotel in the heart of Bardstown. If you’re reading this, you really should just book this place already. Or maybe not so it’s easier for me to come back!
The house feels like a home, renovated as if you were going to live there vs renting it out as an AirBnb. The quality of the appliances, bedding, finishes, everything is really top notch. The bedding and towels are some of the softest I’ve seen. The washer/dryer are oversized and top quality. The kitchen is well stocked with everything you’d need from zip-locks to both a Keurig and drip coffee making. Even consumables like K-cups, ground coffee, toothpaste, and water were supplied.
The location is perfect, right in down town with lots of dining options within easy walking distance. Try the brewery and bakery, both of which are next door. Cafe Primo is nearby and a great pizza option. The Rickhouse was a disappointment.
Checkin was quick, easy, and contact free."
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Where do I begin? This house exceeded our expectations. It was so comfortable. Jim and Gina have thought of everything. We even asked if there was a Keurig and there was a new one there when we arrived! We could walk to every where we went. We loved sitting on the covered porch. The house was exceptionally clean and well stocked with anything you would want. We highly recommend staying here. Thanks again Jim and Gina.
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Best Airbnb ever! The description and pictures do not do this home justice. It is absolutely beautiful inside and out. Jim and Gina are wonderful hosts who communicate well and have literally thought of every perfect little detail. The location couldn’t be better. Everything in town is within walking distance. The house was spotless as well! We have nothing but good things to say. If you are thinking about renting this place, do it!"
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Jim and Gina were extremely gracious hosts. The pictures don’t do the olace justice! It was incredible. Without knowing anything about the area, this was the most perfect place possible! Close to everything in downtown Bardstown. Nice central location for all the bourbon distilleries. I will definitely be recommending Jim and Gina’s AirBnB to friends and family!!"
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is a fantastic home where every detail has been thought of. The house is beautiful and very tastefully designed with high end materials and appliances.
The home was exceptionally clean, quiet and luxurious. It is also ideally situated and within walking distance of almost everything.
Thank you and we will return!"
2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This home is fabulous. They have all the amenities you need and more. Care has been taken to make you feel pampered and at home. The location to Bardstown and Bardstown activities can’t be beat. It is within walking distance to downtown, and right next to the bakery-can anyone say donuts for breakfast!! It is minutes from several distilleries if you are there for the bourbon tour. We will definitely stay here again if we are in the area and have recommended it to several friends already."
2021-06-01,5,Stayed about a week,"This house is wonderful. We were there for 8 days and it was great. Central location to Bardstown and within easy driving distance to Louisville, many Bourbon sites and even the Ark Experience. There is a new craft brewery and bakery on the same block. Wonderful porches and a beautiful back yard."
2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Jim & Gina's home is everything the reviews reflect! As so many others have stated - the luxurious touches everywhere are outstanding! The spaces are designed elegantly yet with comfort in mind.
The touches include items you realize how much you miss in most Air BnB homes like a lemon juicer, cutting boards, baggies, laundry supplies, towel racks that are gorgeous, well-placed toothpaste and hair spray in each bathroom, lovely bath supplies, enough thick luscious towels to feel like you are in a 5-star penthouse hotel...and the details keep going! Fantastic glassware of any kind for your drink of choice, heated master bathroom floor, the master bathroom shower had a dozen jets on it and the claw foot tub was an especially nice touch.
The exterior camera system is the 'right' way to do cameras at an Air BnB - where they actually showed - you, the guest - what was happening outside vs. broadcasting to an unknown audience outside of the home (with no idea what the cameras are actually observing).
The kitchen, master bedroom, closet and bathroom were so inspirationally designed that we took notes for our own remodel!
Major bonus for us was an absolutely fantastic brewery, Scout and Scholar, literally shares the backyard fence with the home and we LOVED it. We are been snobs and this place was true quality - from the food, beer and service and, of course, proximity.
This home was like moving right into a beautiful home designed by a professional interior designer.
Everything is walkable and Bardstown is charming and wonderful. we will absolutely be back!"
2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"A beautiful home in a great location. The home matches the pictures and is just beautiful, clean and comfortable. The small touches Jim and Gina do are appreciated. From having bottled water available, to coffee/tea, little things like storage bags, etc…. No details are left unattended. Highly recommend this home in the heart of bourbon country and just steps away from anything you want to walk to in Bardstown."
2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Guests will be amazed at how close all of downtown shops and restaurants are and well within walking distance! The home’s interior is exquisite and so comfortable and welcoming! Highly recommend!
2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,wonderful location beautiful home. we would love to stay again!
2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We had a great time! The house is amazing! Convient to everything Bardstown. We look forward to staying again in the near future. Thank you for sharing this incredible home with us.
2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Such a great place to stay. The location is perfect, walking distance from everything. The house is absolutely beautiful as well!"
2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great stay,"
2021-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I said in my first review that this was the nicest Airbnb I’ve stayed in. That remains true but has gotten even better. The absolute only thing I mentioned to Jim about our first stay was that a grill would be a nice addition for guests with longer stays and cooking at home. Showed up this trip, brand new Weber has grill outside. Now, a brew pub has opened up right behind the house. Amazing micro brews and food. It’s literally the perfect location for anything in the area. HayJac House is my first choice for all my business in Bardstown."
2021-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We loved our stay in Bardstown. Hayjac House is in perfect walking distance to so many great spots in town. The space was super clean, relaxing, and perfect for our get away. Jim was quick to respond and offered a number of suggestions that we’re glad we took advantage of while in town. It was a great get-away."
2021-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My husband and I loved every minute of our 4 day trip and our stay at the HayJac House is what made it! It was so nice, extremely comfortable and immaculate. They have thought of every detail - the pictures on the website don't even do it justice. The location in town was perfect and quiet at night. We also really enjoyed our evening cocktails on the back patio. Jim was very responsive and accommodating. We didn't want to leave and cannot wait to go back!"
2021-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I can’t say enough good things about the HayJac house! It’s beautiful and probably the cleanest Airbnb/hotel I’ve ever been in! We loved their tips and the house is just so spectacular. We’re already trying to figure out when we can come back!
2021-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Best. Air b n b. Ever. Clean, close to everything, beautiful, relaxing. We literally took pictures of the interior for ideals of remodeling our own home. If you’re looking for a place to stay in Bardstown look no further."
2021-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,One of the best Airbnb’s we have stayed at! Absolutely beautiful inside. Really appreciated all the local recommendations. Location couldn’t have been better for local restaurants and bourbon trail-ing
2021-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Perfection, you must stay here while visiting Bardstown!"
2021-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place is PERFECT! The house was remarkably clean, the beds were super comfortable and the master bath was to die for! Their place is in a perfect location in Bardstown and is an easy walk/drive to so many things! We will definitely be back! Five stars all around!"
2020-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I usually do not write reviews, but I was so impressed with this house and the owners that I had to write something special to show my appreciation. This house has everything covered from top to bottom. Great location, wonderful amenities, and superb cleanliness. Before the end of our first night at the house I was on the Airbnb app looking when I could book this house again. As I write this I am hesitant to give such a glowing review as I do not want it to sell out for next year. Selfish I know, but seriously we truly enjoyed our time and will be visiting again soon."
2020-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Return visit for Sue & I to this beautiful home, and once again, we were absolutely delighted. The house itself is wonderful! Beautifully renovated, immaculately clean, and FULLY equipped... we felt safe, secure, and and amazingly comfortable and welcomed. Jim And Gina have thought of everything when it comes to comfort, convenience, and security. Went out of their way to make us feel welcome to their place once again, even including a much appreciated ""Welcome back!"" gift to make a sweet tooth very happy! Very special touch..."
2020-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great stay!
2020-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Trust us - this is THE BEST Airbnb we have stayed in and we travel a lot!
2020-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great location and super clean!!! Wonderful place with great perks (including the bakery next door)!! Amazingly comfortable and couldn’t have asked for more!
2020-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Saying it’s the best airbnb I’ve stayed in is doing the HayJac house a disservice. Absolutely every aspect of hospitality was taken in to consideration with this property. You will not be disappointed in any way.
2020-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great place to explore Bardstown and Kentucky.. We loved this house, not only is the location great, but the house is just perfect, it has all the amenities you might need away from home, and to make it even better Jim and Gina are great hostess. We had a fabulous time."
2020-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Far above and beyond the norm in terms of comfort, function, design, and simple elegance. This home is a gem, plain and simple! Jim and Gina's customer service, quick response, and downright graciousness are equally impressive and appreciated. Thank you both so much! Hope to see you again soon."
2020-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,A beautiful find in the heart of Bardstown.
2019-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This house is perfectly decorated yet has a homey feeling! No detail was missed when creating remodeling this home. It was near downtown and we could walk to restaurants and other venues. Definitely want to go back and spend more time inside the house.
2019-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Words cannot describe how much we love this home! Jim and Gina have done a superb job decorating and upkeep. Location great. We will be back! Oh, and Jim went out of his way to help us when my sister-in-law left her medicine in the house! Thank you!!!!"
2019-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"When you see the quaint home from the outside, you would not expect the extravagant interior from the beautiful exterior of the home! There is so much space and perfect for a getaway in a happening city like Bardstown. The bedrooms, bathrooms, and kitchen are what you would wish for in a dream home! The best features of the house, we enjoyed were: the master bedroom walk-in closet (fit for a royalty), the best bedroom king size mattress (very firm memory foam with dual adjustable bases), and the master bathroom (with heated floors, a shower with an amazing shower head, and a deep claw-foot bathtub). Highly recommend and wish to be able to go back one day!"
2019-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I can’t begin to tell you how lovely this home is. Besides being a perfect location (Barbara’s, donuts, coffee, downtown shopping, church, etc..), the space is beautiful & obviously thoughtfully planned. It was wonderful to be able to bring my family together for a home cooked meal all in one place locally.
Top of the line kitchen & bathrooms (omg showers!)...you won’t want to leave the shower.
Check in was super simple (they even left the lights on for me). 😉
Can’t wait until I return in December!

2019-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"In person, this house is even nicer than the photos and description indicate. Beautiful finishes, sparkling clean and a super location. Walking distance to shops, restaurants and bars . . . And next door to a donut shop.
At certain times of day, the street was a bit busier than expected, but I can understand . . . the lure of the donut."
2019-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The property is located perfectly to allow easy walking access to all of downtown Bardstown. The house itself is immaculate in every regard - an amazingly remade home, exceptionally clean, and beautifully decorated. The house is a gorgeous mix of old and modern styles. We loved every minute. I found myself taking photos of different elements of the house so can can attempt to recreate them in my own home. It really is a treasure in Bardstown!"
2019-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!!!! This property is a GREAT find! BEAUTIFULLY DECORATED with lots of extra special touches! Perfectly clean..... SPOTLESS! You won't find a better location to be able to walk to restaurants, shops & Baskin Robbins! Comfortable beds, top-of-the-line linens and towels! Enjoyed the covered porches to relax and unwind after a day on the Bourbon Trail. We can't wait to come visit again! Thanks for being GREAT hosts and sharing your GORGEOUS home!"
2019-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The HayJac house is lovely in so many ways. Outdoor spaces to gather, cozy beds & amenties, special touches, and a prime location near many unique Bardstown sites. We look forward to another visit. It was a wonderful place to call home for the weekend."

2019-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Jim and Gina‘s house was so neat and tidy! Our group of four had so much space to mingle together as well as have our privacy. The house is newly renovated, and it’s clear Gina and Jim spared no expense on top-of-the-line furnishings. Both bedrooms are master suites, so this place is ideal for two couples.
Jim and Gina were also very responsive to my questions leading up to our visit. I would book this house again without hesitation."
2019-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful home. Great location.
2019-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place for 2 couples as you both get your own king bed in a very large bedroom and full bath (fully loaded with upscale showers and a claw foot tub) for plenty of privacy. The floor plan is very open and the decor is impeccable. You can walk to many restaurants and boutique shops in minutes. The location is within a 15 minute drive of 5 distilleries. I would hope to stay here again!
