2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Such a cute cottage! Came in town for a baseball tournament & needed a place that was dog friendly. This place was cozy, super clean and a 3 minute drive to the ballpark. It has the charm of an older home with lots of space and modern amenities. Also walking distance to some great food on Main St. The host was so friendly and responsive. We’d love to stay here if ever in town again. Thanks!"
2024-04-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"April did a great job with this place it’s an older space but you can tell a lot of love went into it. The space was clean and as described beds were very comfortable.
Area felt safe."
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay in Albertville! April provides all that is needed for a comfortable stay. She communicates well and is flexible which I appreciated so much as our plans kept changing. We will definitely stay again.
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Very cozy, clean, quiet dwelling. We were close to the high school and not far from shopping and restaurants. Beds were comfortable and bathroom & other areas of the house were very clean."

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This place was everything I thought it would be. Relaxing and private nature retreat. Would recommend
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,There were so many things I LOVED about this place. The outdoor shower being my favorite. The next best thing...hearing the birds chirp and the creek rushing by as you wake up in the morning. This was by far one of my favorite stays through Airbnb (I use Airbnb for most of my vacations ) The location was good. I mean you are in the woods so don't expect to right downtown. We went to a neighboring county and had dinner on the lake. Not a bad drive. I would highly recommend this place for a long weekend.
2024-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"A perfect place to unwind and unplug. The sound of the creek was enchanting and the lack of ""gizmos"" was absolutely perfect. We can see ourselves staying here again and again."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We stayed at the Hawks Nest, and I can’t recommend it enough. There were so many thoughtful details. It was definitely a glamping experience. I highly recommend making the small hike down arrowhead trail. It’s a fairly easy hike and the scenery is so worth it. Everything about my experience was 10 out of 10. We can’t wait to come back for a longer stay."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Was a perfect place to be able to get out and take a break from life period. Hands down she has a beautiful place and has something great going that she has built. I would live there if I could.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This was my second visit to Coyote Cabin and I’m already looking forward to returning again! It has everything I look for in a serene escape: privacy, comfortable accommodations, a welcoming host, and endless nature views. Highlights of my stays always include watching the sunrise from bed, enjoying a hot cup of coffee while taking in the nature sights and sounds from the private outdoor shower, and star gazing in the spacious hot tub. We love making a fire in the designated fire pit area by the cabin (also private) and wandering the “Arrowhead Trail” on the property. The cozy outdoor furniture provides a peaceful space to bird watch, do yoga, journal, and make memories with your loved one. We have never have any trouble navigating the short walk to and from the parking area, just a few steps away from the cabin door. Cannot wait for my next relaxing weekend at Coyote!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We stayed here for our anniversary and it was exactly what we needed! Hawks Nest was extremely relaxing and peaceful! Christy answered every question we asked and had the place extremely clean! We enjoyed wine and cheese on the deck over looking the creek… and what a cool experience! We will be back!

2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Celebrated my anniversary and the Hawks tree house, and it was everything I was hoping for.

2023-12-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"Christy’s treehouse was very clean and pretty. She was nice, responsive, and helpful. We loved the hot tub. Unfortunately, the bed was so uncomfortable that neither of us slept. I would highly recommend for people who don’t mind hard beds. It wasn’t worth what we paid for that reason."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This is the special place we choose to stay for our honeymoon. We loved every minute we got to spend there. Soon as you walked in, you could see and smell how clean the place was. The hot tub was so relaxing after a long day! We will be back forsure!"

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My boyfriend and I had a wonderful stay the weekend of the Fourth of July! We were supposed to go for my birthday this past spring, but we unfortunately had to cancel last minute. I’m SO glad we had the opportunity reschedule this weekend! It was just what we needed. We live 600 miles from each other and this was a perfect way to spend some time together. The cabin is adorable! So remote and quiet with lots of places to hike in the area. We felt right at home, and Christy was an excellent host! We had no trouble checking in and knew what to expect getting on and off the property. We LOVED our stay and will hopefully be back sometime soon! 😊"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Christy was amazing and very responsive to any and all questions. Pictures don’t do the place justice. Great romantic getaway in the woods with coffee shops and restaurants close by. Highly recommend
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Can’t wait to come back! This was a perfect little slice of heaven!
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"A peaceful paradise. I could tell that allot of love and care had been put into this treehouse. All the modern amenities, but still remote. Would highly recommend!"
2023-06-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"The place is exactly as described. It has a really nice view of the creek and we did not hear anything the whole time we were there. We did worry that the outdoor shower was clearly in the view of the walking trail, but we did not have any issues. Overall a very restful property with a great host."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We absolutely loved it! Super nice, clean, quiet, and beautiful little getaway. Christy was beyond helpful and resourceful. 10 out of 10! The only complaint is that I can't rate it higher."

2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Such an amazing place!! So beautiful. So peaceful. Stunning scenery! We could not have hoped for a better place. Everything was so clean and we loved every, single thing!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"My husband & I stayed at the Hawk’s Nest for our anniversary. It was a unique experience & very peaceful. The view from the balcony overlooking the creek was beautiful & the hot tub was relaxing. We took advantage of the fire pit & charcoal grill as well. The bathroom situation didn’t bother us at all & is easy to use if you read the instructions. If you’re looking for a relaxing getaway surrounded by nature, the Hawk’s Nest is the spot! If you don’t like nature, can’t walk up/down gravel slopes, don’t like outdoor bathrooms or being in the middle of nowhere, this place probably isn’t for you. There is no TV or wifi but the cell phone signal picked up just fine (AT&T & T-Mobile). The arrowhead trail down to the creek was grown up so we didn’t attempt hiking down there but more adventurous couples may enjoy it. The host Christy was accommodating & sweet! Only con: it’s a little pricey for budget travelers."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,My wife and myself decided last minute to book the location on AirBNB and we were blown away by how amazing this property was! Complete privacy and a true sense of being off the grid. The instructions to the treehouse were simple and easy to navigate and all the amenities listed were provided and more! Thank you so much Christy for being such a friendly and responsive host! The wife and myself plan to be back very soon!
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We celebrated our 5 year anniversary here and it was nothing short of amazing! We stayed in the hot tub 75% of the time! The peacefulness and the sounds of the creek flowing were exactly what we needed! The bed was perfect! We visited the vineyard that is down the road (Jules J. Berta vineyard & winery) while we were there! Christy was so accommodating and communicated so well the entire time. She answered every question I had and was so nice!
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,It was great
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Definitely a place to return… We enjoyed every minute of our stay. Beautiful surroundings with privacy.

2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,My partner and I stayed at Hawk’s Nest for his birthday weekend and absolutely loved it. It was even better than the pictures. It is pretty close to the other cabin and Christy’s house but feels totally private because of the way it’s set up. The atmosphere was incredibly serene with a great view of the river.
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was our second stay here. We loved it! It’s at the end of a small neighborhood to gain access so the first time we didn’t know what to expect. Very private, very quiet with a great view of the creek. Hot tub is perfect. We didn’t know if we would like the outdoor shower, but it’s actually very nice! Perfect for a couple who wants to be away and alone."
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"A beautiful place to stay! The views were perfect, the hot tub was relaxing, and very much to my surprise, the outdoor shower was amazing! It was very private and like your own little piece of heaven."

2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This was a last minute booking on thanksgiving day. We where so happy with this stay came in late at night during the rain Christy was very nice we did not want to interrupt her plans for the holidays. Once we arrived it was beautiful the light they had around the decking made the whole place glow in the rain !
We woke up early that morning to catch the sunrise it was breathtaking. This is a trip we will definitely be taking again in the future.
Thank you for sharing your place with airbnb."

2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This was an amazing stay! Christy was so kinda and accommodating for us. It was truly a remote stay that lets you feel disconnected from the rest of the world.

2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Enchanting is an absolute UNDERSTATEMENT. This place is absolutely refreshing and delightful. We were here during firefly season and they were everywhere. We enjoyed the hot tub at night while they danced all around. Outside showers are completely freeing. No one can see you either. The tree house faces sunrise as well so we got to wake up with the sun. After hiking all day, it was the perfect place to relax. 10/10 would recommend to a friend. Beyond stoked to visit again in the cold season."
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This is truly a great place to stay. Both the house and surroundings offers a unique and tranquil experience. We hope to come back in the future!
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Fabulous stay at Hawks Nest Treehouse!!
Funny thing, i booked late night/on a whim & did not read the description, but the primitive-ness was awesome & fun. I was heading for a first visit in Guntersville which was awesome, but this was the first Airbnb option that popped up, fell in love immediately, Very Happy to have booked the visit. Hot tub was nice, place was very clean, everything was Perfect for my 1day stay. Christy was available, very responsive & incredibly kind. She has a 2nd Treehouse available next door, fyi. I will definitely stay here again in the future!!"
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Very cute place! Very clean and loved the running creek below!
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Phenomenal visit with a nice view of a stream. Definitely different in terms of toilet and shower but if you can get past that it was very enoyable
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My husband & I spent our third anniversary at the Hawk’s Nest and we enjoyed every minute. The space is comfortable (especially the bed) and intimate. We felt as if we were miles and miles away from everyone. Christy thought of everything for the Hawk’s Nest so be sure you only bring the bare necessities. Need body soap, shampoo, conditioner? She has it all ready for you. We loved the outdoor shower and unless someone is coming up the creek, no one will see you. The space is perfect for an intimate stay with your significant other.
For outside entertainment, we went into Gunthersville and fell in love with the town so be sure to check it out. City Harbor in Gunthersville is beautiful. The Gunthersville State Park is worth drive through as well.

Great recently built cabin with a deck and a hot tub overlooking a small river— the hot tub is perfect for 2 and you’ll be warm enough for a hot outside shower afterwards. There is electricity and heat/ac inside. The toilet seat is chilly if it’s cold out. The tap (well?) water was delicious. Exactly the kind of chill, restorative place we wanted. The guest before us had left a strong perfume smell behind— the host asks you not to use those in the house rules so please, don’t!"

You can expect spectacular views of the creek, looked like a river to us today, but it’s been raining a lot and so the water was rushing, but it sounded wonderful! The outdoor shower gets nice and hot, so even if it was 20 degrees outside, you would be toasty! The bathroom was cleaner than most hotel bathrooms, it smelled fantastic in there. Disinfectant and patchouli spray! The light for the shower is inside the bathroom as well as a plug-in night light if you are half asleep and don’t like turning bright lights on. The hot tub!!! Worked great and the jets were amazing! You can expect nothing short of perfect from Christy! She aims to please, and that she did! We will be back! Thank you again! Happy New year!"

Otherwise, we were pleased with the house and accommodations available."

Really, really comfortable beds and bedding, big, modern TVs you can stream to, large, spotless bathrooms, big, beautiful soaking tub. We can’t say enough to convey just how lovely our stay was. It’s a truly magnificent house. We were wishing we could stay longer. We’d come back for a week just to relax even if we had no other plans in the area, it was so wonderful. More than five stars, all the stars! A+++++ I hope we can come back again another time for a longer stay."

Looking forward to visiting again in the future.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Escape the hustle and bustle and step into tranquility. From the meticulous and thoughtful furnishings to the awe-inspiring scenery, Birdseye View provides a sanctuary both within the beautiful home and while enjoying the view from the deck. The host goes above and beyond for his guests which is few and far between these days and very much appreciated. Our stay and overall experience was excellent."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"If you like serenity, a fairytale-like oasis, a tranquil hideaway in an exclusive location, a cozy environment with clean spacious rooms and awe inspiring vistas…look no further. The word sublime comes to mind and I don’t recall the last time I’ve described anything as such. I hope to return at least bi-annually. The host, Chris, is the absolute best which heightens the experience. I want to give the BIRDSEYE View 10 stars but the app only allows 5. So, here you go ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️. ~Evette"

The house is cozy and they have so many little details that you will appreciate.
The kitchen very well stocked had everything you need to cooks meals at the house. Look forward to our next visit"
2023-12-01,5.0,Group trip,The house was spacious and pristinely clean. Very comfortable. The beds had nice linens. The house is in a very convenient location and a nice neighborhood.
2023-11-01,5.0,Group trip,It was exactly what we needed !! I rented for my son’s wedding ( a place to house the groomsmen). My son got married at Gore Creek wedding venue and it was about 10 min from there. It worked perfectly.
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Five star stay! Could not ask for better!!!
2023-10-01,5.0,Group trip,Great place to stay at. Love how peaceful the location is.Highly recommend. Would definitely book again!!
2023-10-01,5.0,Group trip,I would definitely recommend this home!
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Good place close to everything
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This is a perfect place to stay if youbwanna be close to downtown or the amphitheater! Make sure you check out the Burbon bar downtown, it is very cool."
2023-07-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"We were in town for a baseball tournament with my family of 4. Spacious for families. Convenient to SandMountain facilities. I was impressed at how clean the entire space was. Neighborhood was quiet. Carport for parking. Super spacious kitchen area.
No curtains in living room & kitchen. 3 of the lamps didn’t have bulbs. Hot water is almost non existent in the kitchen. It worked well in the bathrooms for us. Beds were ok. Overall is it was a good stay."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This is an older home that was nicely renovated. It was spacious and very clean with wood flooring and nice furniture, which included two leather sofas and two leather recliners and a large dining room table. The beds were very comfortable. The air conditioning kept the house cool, and it was nice having a washer & dryer. It was very convenient to Sand Mountain, where my grandson played in a baseball tournament, and close to the downtown area. Be sure to eat at Mater's downtown. We enjoyed our stay here and would definitely stay here again. Note: Bring hangers if you have clothes to hang up. None are provided. Also, the dining & kitchen area do not have window coverings."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Everything was exactly what we needed. Thank you! Praying a special blessing over your business.
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Good location to the local softball park and in a safe area. Just what we needed.
2023-05-01,3.0,Stayed with kids,"The overall home was great on the inside. We had issues with the water and it's pressure, neither of the bathroom showers water had heat. The master bath is where we all had to take baths because the other bathroom wouldn't heat all the way. The arrival kind of through us off, because the grass looks as if it hadn't been cut in a few weeks, not to mention it looks as if construction was taking place, old doors where left under the carport.
The inside of the home had been maintained and kept very well, the fact that their wasn't any curtains through the dinning room, living room, and glass patio door area was quite disturbing, especially with me having three daughters and a wife with me.
I tried to contact the owner (Destiny) a few days before about adding an extra day and never heard anything back, that was before we arrived of course. Master shower door had a crack, master bed post under mattress was bent and so was guest bed."
2023-05-01,5.0,Group trip,Convenient to the amphitheater and very spacious! Would definitely stay again.
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We enjoyed our stay. Location was easy to find and very close to local restaurants. House was just as pictured. Plenty of space in the large living room and kitchen/dining room. House was clean and free of clutter except for a fireplace insert sitting to the side--looks like it was waiting for an installation to be done in the future :-). The only fault we found was a light switch cover missing in the dining room that left the wiring exposed, but again we expect that was part of some future renovations to be completed. We will definitely be booking again for upcoming baseball tournaments this summer."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The place was clean and spacious. There are large windows with no curtains/blinds. If you like complete privacy, try to stay in the bedrooms 😂."
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This very clean house has an excellent location; convenient to downtown, Sand Mountain Sports Complex, the local winery and several nice restaurants. The layout is perfect for two couple providing privacy with a split floor plan. When we come back to Albertville we will look here first for a place to stay."
2023-03-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"Pros: The place was clean and had everything we needed. The house is large and there was more than enough room for all 6 of us. The neighborhood is quiet and the backyard is large.
Cons: The toilet seat in one of the bathrooms is loose and moves. I’m not sure if the heat in the house works. It was pretty chilly and we ended up using space heaters to warm up. The stopper in one of the bathtubs doesn’t work which was a bummer because we have little kids that needed baths.
Overall we enjoyed our stay and would stay again if we were in the area."
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,Great Stay
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,Very clean
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Awesome stay as usual!
2024-06-01,5.0,Group trip,"this beautiful house was super comfortable and clean. we were there for a wedding at River Rocks so we spent the weekend in this quiet and quaint town. The decorations stood out, the outdoor patio and yard was a plus. It's a great place to stay."
2024-06-01,5.0,Group trip,"We had a delightful time at the Turret House. Quaint, cute, clean ... couldn’t ask for much more! It was one of the cleanest places we’ve ever stayed. The location was good for our purposes: a great base to go to lots of fun sights in the North Alabama areas. We’d highly recommend staying here and would do so again if the opportunity comes up!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Group trip,Our stay at Shane’s place was great! It was clean and efficient for all our needs and we want to say thank you!
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Always a great stay

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We had a very peaceful time at Shane's house. The house is well equipped, the only thing it didn't have was a blender, but the kitchen is well equipped. There's a park nearby and stores."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"The house was absolutely beautiful inside and out I really love the decor my only complaint is the outside furniture is dry rotted and you absolutely cant sit on it, one of the chairs it looked like someone had already fell through, other then that I enjoyed our short stay and would definitely book again."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Thank you
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Awesome stay as always!!

2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great stay. Quiet and relaxing.
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Wonderful place to stay if you are in Boaz. Private, quiet and homelike. My teen daughter had a swim event at the Boaz Recreational Center that was a short drive away. We enjoyed walking to the park and around the neighborhood that included the local community college. Everything that we needed was super close. The house has a great layout with an upstairs entertainment room and bathroom for kids, and the backyard has a neat deck with a grill and firepit that was an extra bonus. Would definitely stay again if ever in the area."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Shane’s home is absolutely breathtaking! I loved that he had a huge Christmas tree in the living room and a Christmas vibe all throughout the home. It was so peaceful and quiet in the neighborhood. I loved the church bells ringing and the sounds of the organ coming from the next block over. I found myself singing along to them. It truly is a beautiful home!
2023-12-01,3.0,Stayed with kids,The beds are kinda small for two people. House only really holds five with privacy. The extra twin bed is on an addition and had no privacy from the room with a double bed. We had six adults but only two double beds. And two twin beds. One only had privacy. The beds are small. Many light bulbs were out so no bed side lamps for reading. Shower downstairs drain is slow to drain out. So might need cleaning. House is super cute and in a great location. I suggest barn doors on addition downstairs and another big bed to help hold more people. House smelled very clean and it was nice to have use of carport
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The house was extremely nice. Very quiet neighborhood and I would recommend it to anyone who is interested in staying there. No complaints.
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We loved our stay at the Turret House. It was cozy, comfortable, and absolutely adorable. Everything was very clean and well kept! Shane was very responsive, kind, and understanding, and we had everything we needed. Plenty of room for my family of 4 and both my parents to stay comfortably."
2023-10-01,5.0,Group trip,Beautiful home. Will use again.
2023-10-01,5.0,Group trip,I had a great stay at this home
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The stay was amazing!!! The house was beautiful!! I loved the neighborhood 10/10 I DEFINITELY RECOMMEND!!
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Loved our stay in Boaz, AL. Home was wonderful. Location is close to everything. Would recommend highly."
2023-09-01,5.0,Group trip,Beautiful home will definitely return
2023-08-01,4.0,Stayed about a week,"Nice and cozy home. Clean and comfortable. 99% as described.
We did have an issue streaming shows on the TV's in the living room and upstairs bedroom. They had problems connecting to the wifi and staying connected. The TV in the downstairs bedroom worked. No antenna for local channels.
There are some cosmetic issues on the interior such as missing grout near the bottom in the shower and popping and peeling paint on a few of the walls. As a handyman I see the paint issues quite often in older homes with plaster walls.
I also noticed the lack of smoke and carbon monoxide detectors. There is an empty mounting ring on the kitchen ceiling that peaked my interest. After searching through the house, I found the detector on the second floor was newer but had a dead battery and the detector on the first floor was a year from expiring and contained no batteries. This is definately a code violation for any short term rental. Something the homeowner should be mindful of."
2023-07-01,5.0,Group trip,This is a wonderful place to stay. Extremely clean and lovely area. Close to the downtown area lots of cool murals and awesome vibes. Safe neighborhood and peaceful stay!
2023-07-01,5.0,Group trip,"The Turret house was super cute! The neighborhood was friendly and very walkable. There isn’t much “to do” in the town but we had received some recommendations from the neighbors on restaurants to go that were only 10-15 min away in Albertville or Gadsden.
The layout of this house is so unique but worked perfectly for me and my friends. Would definitely stay here again!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,This house was amazing! Loved every minute of my time.
2023-07-01,5.0,Group trip,"This place felt very homey. When we came home from outings, we felt like we were coming to our own home. It was nicely decorated, the kitchen had everything we needed and sitting in the living room felt very comfy. We would certainly stay here again and would recommend it to others."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I stayed here for an extra long weekend-Wednesday thru Sunday- for a baseball tournament with my two teenage kids. We had a fun time in the house and the surrounding area. Very quaint. This neighborhood was quiet, peaceful, beautifully landscaped, and felt super safe. We had trouble getting in at first but Shane was super responsive and got us in quickly.
I feel like the backyard didn’t get much show in the profile as I was so surprised to find such a gem of a patio/deck. Decorated with lights and native plants. My son stayed upstairs in the loft bedroom and loved the air hockey game (we couldn’t get it to turn on but you could still play it) and tv. My daughter nested in the double bedroom and absolutely adored that carriage day bed. We were all cozy in the beds/linens. The only thing I would recommend is if you are staying more than 2 days bring more of your “essentials”-TP, shampoo, body wash. But this was not an issue. I can’t say enough good things about this place. We loved it!!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Great place to stay, beautiful house! Confortable and clean!
Thank you!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Group trip,"Charming historic home, close to town, clean and well decorated. A great value and experience of your travels take you to Boaz."

2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay.
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"What a beautiful home. As soon as I walked in, it felt right. I was absolutely
beeming with excitement to explore it. Couldn't get the smile of my face as I was walking through the entire home. Every door I opened was a source of aww. It was absolutely beautiful and kind of whimsical. The house was a great source of peace, so bright and airy. I was able to meditate and do my yoga in complete Zen state. We had everything we needed in this home and some extras that we didn't expect. I chose the room with the bonus space that leads out into the back deck. It was exactly what I needed. I didn't know the effect my trip to Boaz was going to have on me. I came back home with a sense of peace and tranquility. Your home played a big part in it. Thank you for sharing your beautiful home with us. I WILL be staying here again. The only place I want to stay in Boaz"
2023-03-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,We enjoyed the house and it was perfect for entertaining out of town relatives for family wedding.
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We enjoyed our stay. The house was very comfortable and met our expectations.
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Shane was amazing. He even came over and swapped out the lights on the gorgeous back patio so we could enjoy it at night. You won't regret your stay.

2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"Shane is the absolute most incredible Airbnb host I’ve ever met. He helped us out in so many ways. I truly can’t thank him enough. The house was also great, having all the amenities we needed. The main bed is super cozy and our stay was everything we’d hoped for. Thank you so much, Shane. We appreciate you so much!"
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Another amazing stay!!
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This home is beyond beautiful and inviting. I told Shane that we could have moved right into this place and not changed a single thing because of how much we loved it. The decor is modern southern chic with beautiful unique pieces. Very comfortable beds with soft bedding. Clean and smells nice. This home is so huge I got lost a few times. The backyard gas fireplace was a very nice touch. We miscalculated our travel plans and realized we needed to stay an extra night in Alabama and Shane was more than friendly and accommodating accepting us another day. This is the most comfortable I have ever been in a strange place. We will come back here the next time we visit family in Alabama.
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful beautiful place! The cutest area, you can walk to downtown and around the cute little community college! Also you can hear church bells from the back yard which I loved!!! Will definitely stay again if I am in the area!"
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Excellent as always!!!
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a wonderful time at the Turret house! It was clean, so cute and charming! We were pleasantly surprised at the church bells really close by. We stayed over Christmas and they played Christmas songs in the morning and we all stood out on the patio and enjoyed them. Incredibly peaceful. The teenager enjoyed having a little private space upstairs. We would definitely stay again! Shane was a very responsive host. When i messaged about a shower chair we had discussed for my mother he brought us one….two days before Christmas in 6 degree weather! So kind!"
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This cozy house makes you feel right at home. It’s clean, comfortable, and well decorated; it’s a cheery, welcoming place that we and the kids truly enjoyed! (And the beautiful Christmas tree was an extra special touch to enjoy during this holiday season!)"
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,2nd time to stay here….so nice being in a comfy home instead of a hotel ….loved my stay….thanks again
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Awesome stay as always!
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Shane was very fast in answering any questions I had….we stayed over thanksgiving and he reached out to see what kitchen supplies we needed during our stay ….incredibly thoughtful !!!!

2022-10-01,5.0,Group trip,"Very adorable, cozy, home! Very comfortable beds. Easy check in process and great communication! Thank you!"
2022-09-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,Checkin was at 3pm. Could not get in till almost 4. Then checkout is 11am and cleaning service showed up at 10:20 and wanted us out. Had to prove that checkout was 11 before she would leave. As far as the property itself; it was great. Spacious and relaxing atmosphere. Everything was clean and beds slept great. We did buy sheet pans as there was only one. But overall the property itself was great. The owner was also very pleasant and easy to reach.
2022-09-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,Nice place in a good location.
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Wonderful stay as usual! Love this little house.
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"A very positive experience. Worth every penny.
An absolutely fantastic, cozy, relaxing stay. House is situated well in a quiet Boaz neighborhood with quick access to the towns of Albertville, Guntersville, and Gadsden. Very clean and well kept.
Definitely a go back the next time we are in the area for a short or extended period.
Highly recommended."
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Always my favorite place to stay
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Another awesome stay!
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Beautifully decorated home on a nice quiet street. My husband and I had an enjoyable weekend antiquing. Shane was helpful. We be back.
2022-08-01,5.0,Group trip,Shane was a great host!!! Everything was so nice and clean. This home was a great fit for what we had to do. We will book with them in the near future.
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Awesome house with great communication. Hope to stay again soon!
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,This was a wonderful home in a small town close to Lake Guntersville where we took the family kayaking and also close enough to Cathedral Caverns for a tour. Clean and cozy.
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"What a great house! Clean, comfortable and such charm! Shane was easy to communicate with and if we’re ever in Boaz again, this is where we’ll be staying."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Awesome stay and I can’t wait to come back!!!
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Matt's rental was a nice change of pace from the hotels we're used to staying in when traveling for baseball tournaments! The location was not far from Sand Mountain Park where my son's team was playing for the weekend. We were actually closer to the park than most of his teammates, who stayed at a hotel!
The rental is the basement of a house and it was very comfortable and cozy! Everything looked exactly as depicted in the pictures online, so no surprises. The space was clean (spotless), particularly the kitchen and bathroom, and the overall space, though small, was very comfortable and perfect for a travel ball player and his dad! I would recommend this rental for anyone coming to Albertville who is looking for a nice, comfy, cozy, and affordable rental instead of an over-priced hotel room!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Booked this last minute and ended up being better than we imagined! Very clean, cool technology, and Matt was super responsive. Space was just big enough for what we needed for the week. Will be staying here again!"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Matt was a great host! Very responsive and fast response when messaged. Would definitely recommend
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I loved staying at this airbnb! The house was very clean and Matt was very helpful. I personally loved the bedroom because of the overhead lamps, which makes it great for reading! This home is very beautiful and I would recommend to anyone visiting in the Albertville area!"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Home away from home describes this lovely apt. Clean beautifully decorated, comfortable, great location! Matt was very responsive and checked in to see if anything was needed.
If I have the opportunity to be in the area again I would seek this rental for sure! Highly recommend!"
2024-06-01,3.0,Stayed with kids,For us the traffic noise was terrible. Even at 2 am it sounded like drag racing was taking place. The house smelled musty and there was a lot of spider webs as we walked through the house. This is the first rental in a lot of years that didn’t have a stocked kitchen with appliances and amenities. Having to come through the garage to enter each time was frustrating because the garage door is super loud and even the neighbors have an opinion regarding the noise. Luckily we weren’t at the house for long periods mostly just to sleep. It served the purpose for what we needed.
2024-06-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,If you spend most of your time at the tennis courts and you need a place to stay it works good!
2024-05-01,5.0,Group trip,Very homey and perfect stay for a large group!
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We stayed her for a baseball tournament. It was 0.3 miles to the park & a little more room for our boys to move around vs a hotel. Older home with some updates - but very functional for our needs. Home was clean, large TVs in all the bedrooms. A couple of squeaky drawers & such - but it’s an older home. Only suggestion I would have is to upgrade the sheets which are pretty worn. We would stay here again for sure."
2024-04-01,5.0,Group trip,Everything was great.
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Awesome House!!

2024-01-01,5.0,Group trip,Wanda was very helpful and responded quickly
2024-01-01,5.0,Group trip,"We loved being so close to Sand Mtn Park. The house was perfect for our group of 7 and we definitely plan on coming back for the next pickleball tournament. We felt right at home and the one thing that stood out was check out time. We loved the fact we did not have to spend our last day cleaning up and stripping beds. Overall, this was a great stay that we highly recommend."
2024-01-01,5.0,Group trip,"Me and my friends had such a wonderful stay! Super cozy home, and the host was very helpful!"

2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Felt right at home, Wanda was very nice and answered any questions and was very responsive. It was a great place especially since we had kids there was bored games, pool table and back fenced yard. Have an anual conference and will definitely be staying here again."

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Comfortably place to stay within walking distance of Sand Mountain park. A great place if in town for a baseball or softball tournament. The gate in the back opens into the park, so no need to fight traffic searching for a parking spot."
2024-06-01,5.0,Group trip,"Our stay was great! Easy access to everything! Brenda was an amazing, helpful host. Would stay here again!"
2024-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We stayed here for a concert. You simply just walk across the backyard and through the gate and you’re on the Sand Mountain Amphitheater property! Great location! Will definitely stay here again!
2024-04-01,5.0,Group trip,"Brenda's place was perfect in every way. We had plenty of room; the beds were comfortable, and the location could not have been better to walk to the amphitheater for the concert. Everything about the stay was great. We all would definitely recommend this to our friends and will stay here if we come to another concert in Albertville!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Very nice house. I feel at home. I'm a lover of floors. That's what I think about seeing all the plants in the house. Excellent!!
2023-07-01,5.0,Group trip,Brenda was the perfect host! The house was spotless and just as described on the listing. She went above and beyond to make sure that me and my groomsmen had a nice place to stay before my wedding! I highly recommend!

2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Perfect location for a large family in town for a baseball tournament!
2023-06-01,5.0,Group trip,Awesome place to stay especially if your playing in a baseball/softball tournament. All you need to do is roll out of bed and walk out the back door through the gate and your there. Definitely would recommend to anyone.
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We’re one of those traveling baseball families but we have two younger daughters tagging along for the ride. Brenda’s place was PERFECT for Albertville games. We were rested, uniforms washed, bellies full for all of our games. Our kids got their naps between games and we even hit up the aquatics center via stroller. AMAZING."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Great place to stay! Especially if you’re in town for baseball! You can walk from the backyard to the Sand Mountain park fields and can see field National 2 from the house. Very clean and comfy, we will stay here again!"
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,everything was beautiful and clean and a good area
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Staying at Brenda’s place was the best decision we made for our weekend soccer tournament at Sand Mountain. My son had 3 soccer games over the weekend and it was so nice to be able to walk to the fields and have a place to rest/eat in between and easy to wash uniforms. Not just convenient, Brenda’s home was also comfortable and had everything we needed for our stay. We took advantage of the nice clean linens and the kitchen where we cooked a few meals. We really appreciated all of the special details that made our stay more enjoyable. Next time we are in Albertville for a tournament if available we will absolutely choose to stay at Brenda’s place again. Thank you Brenda!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This was a fantastic stay!! Christy was so helpful and always responsive when I had a question!! Definitely a place I will like to return too!!

2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We enjoy our stay in this beautiful place , I will stay again ,Thank you Christy"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My wife and I had such an enjoyable stay in Christy's treehouse! The views were breathtaking, and we enjoyed reading and relaxing in the loft. Coffee on the deck each morning was our favorite part of the trip. This little gettaway was exactly what we hoped it would be and MORE."
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Quaint little cabin in a beautiful setting. Perfect for a weekend get away. It was so nice to relax on the deck or in the hot tub and listen to the creek rushing below.
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Was very nice and neat for a weekend will stay again
2024-02-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"The place is pretty cool . I enjoyed so much, I had a wonderful and unforgettable stay. I loved the hot tub was perfect . I just miss a ladder on the side it for can go inside cabin. I definitely will back !"

2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,My Husband and I loved every minute of it. Good way to relax and reconnect with each other!! Highly recommended!!!
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"So happy with our stay here! The location was so beautiful, especially if you're a nature lover like us! The creek below was my personal favorite part. We enjoyed hiking the trail below the cabin as well. As far as the cabin itself, it was so cute. Perfect for a couple (or even 3 people). I liked the fact there was no tv because it forces you to unplug - but we still got great phone service! I would highly recommend this place to anyone."
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Amazing cabin!!
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Such a great stay and beautiful property! Definitely make sure to read fully the description, it is very clear and explains EVERYTHING that you need to know about the place. The view was beautiful and hearing the creek in the background was peaceful. The grill/fire pit area was such a relaxing area to hangout. Christy was very responsive and even recommended places to go, we brought our four wheeler and visited Buck’s Pocket State Park that had some ORV riding trails and only 30 minutes away! Highly recommend this was a great way to start the New Year!"
2023-12-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"Instrustions were very easy to follow getting in. Bed was comfortable and everything was very clean. Definitely a place to stay during a warmer season. There a nice table and chairs outside but it was far too cold and windy to sit outside and enjoy a meal. Inside had stools but no table. We didnt get to enjoy the trails because it was too dark by the time we got there and i felt it was way too steep and did not want any injures. The next day was rainy and needed to check out before we were able to explore. The hot tub did not feel hot enough, started at 102 but wouldnt go over 97 after being in for maybe 15-20 min. It would have been nice to have stairs to the deck on the hot tub side as it was sooo cold having to walk around the house to get back in. On a nice warm day this would have been great! It is a small space, quiet and peaceful. Very pleased with the quick response from the host. We will definitely keep this place in mind next time we travel during the warmer season!"
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Very nice and very relaxing without mobile devices.
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had the best time at Coyotes Cabin! We will definitely be back. I’m hoping to make it an annual trip, if not sooner! The cabin feels like you’re secluded but just minutes away from a wide variety of restaurants. This trip was exactly what we were looking for, if not better. I loved the loft in the mornings for a beautiful view with coffee and a book. The hot tub was so nice, we have considered getting an inflatable one for our home and are officially sold on it after trying out Christys! Christy was a fabulous host, very responsive and helpful. We felt right at home. We will absolutely try out the other cabin next time if this one isn’t available. 10/10 stay and host!"

2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I wish we’d had more time to stay! The location and surroundings was exactly what we were after. Quiet and peaceful. Absolutely adorable inside! Next time we will stay longer so we can actually enjoy it more.
Only complaint with the whole place was that whatever was used to clean it smelled extremely strong to us and it was requested that we not leave the windows open since there were no screens and they want to avoid bugs. Understandable."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,we really enjoyed the location and the view was awesome !
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The view is great! It is very peaceful! We loved sitting on the deck! We had a great time!

2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We stayed here for our honeymoon and it was just as magical as we had hoped. Plenty of privacy but not to far from civilization so going on a food run is no biggie. We utilized the grill and had a romantic steak dinner on the porch and then went for a soak in the hot tub! Our honeymoon was our second stay at Coyote Cabin and we will definitely be coming back for another romantic getaway! Thank you for all your hard work in making the perfect little cabin Christy!

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"What an amazing gem of a property! Christy has done an excellent job communicating and describing this property online. It’s exactly what she says but SO, SO much better! You cannot describe how peaceful and relaxed this property is. We enjoyed the bed downstairs over the loft area but the loft area is cute! We loved the hike down to the private creek. Absolutely worth the hike down and back! Beautiful cool water in the creek. We just sat and talked on the rocks enjoying the scenery! One of our favorites amenities was the private outdoor shower. So relaxing and wonderful to have the comforts of a warm shower but outside to enjoy the nature. I think I could have sat on the deck all day but we hiked into Noccalula Falls, which was breathtakingly gorgeous! Rocky but pretty easy hike to the bottom. The swimming hole there was super fun …can’t wait to take the kids! Lots of things to do see within a 30 mins drive (or less) and lots of good food also!
I cannot recommend this place enough!!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Second time staying in one of Christys cabins. Absolutely love it!
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was a tranquil escape nestled in the woods with a creek down below. Our experience at Christy’s quaint cabin exceeded expectations, and we cherished every moment!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Christy is a great host! The cabin is beautiful, clean, and private. Communication is great! I highly recommend coming here if you want a peaceful romantic getaway!"
2023-07-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"We were not aware that there was no oven or stove. Also that we would not have TV or Wi-Fi. And there’s no reason why the house should not have had any paper towels or glasses to drink from we had two tumblers and two champagne glasses, that did not work out."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a fantastic stay. Christy was always extremely responsive. The place is very quiet, great fire pit, deck overlooking the river below. Will stay here again."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Loved staying here! I think my favorite part was seeing the sunrise rise as soon as my eyes open or having dinner looking over the creek. Awesome time!
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This was a great experience. The host was extremely friendly and helpful and even checked in on us and made sure we had all the supplies we needed. Would definitely recommend staying here. Loved the peaceful creek that’s located right on the property
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,this place was amazing. the view was even better than we expected and the place was exactly as described but even cuter when you got there. Miss Cristy was amazing. gave awesome spots to go check out and when we couldn't find them gave us amazing directions to get there. she's the best.
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Would 100% stay here again. Perfect for a quiet get away!
Christy was always quick to respond
Beautiful place"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My husband gifted me a getaway for Mother’s Day. Coyotes Cabin was the PERFECT place to rest and be refreshed! The cabin is adorable with gorgeous views, there’s great hiking and a beautiful rushing creek. I spent most of my time hiking and reading/eating lunch on a big flat rock in the creek, or relaxing in my hammock enjoying the sound of rushing water and nature all around. It was so peaceful and beautiful! I’ll definitely be returning!!!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Really cute place with lovely, peaceful views."

2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Coyote cabin was such a beautiful sight. To be able to go up to the loft and still see the view was amazing. The space was very comfy and we were providing with everything we needed and more! Christy was very nice, responsive, and gave you all the questions to your answers before you knew to ask them. The hot tub/jacuzzi was absolutely wonderful also being able to look out and see the view! Thank you so much for the opportunity to stay in the beautiful cabin! It was a nice peaceful change of pace. 10/10 would recommend visiting!!!"

2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great getaway! This was last min and only 45 mins from home but it was so peaceful and private I felt a million miles away❤️ Christy was a great host responded quick and was very helpful. I highly recommend this stay❤️
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"First I have to say Christy was fantastic during our stay. We ended up extending our stay and stayed in both cabins on the property. Being from the area I was surprised that I had never seen what the area there has to offer nature wise. I would recommend to anyone that is looking for nice hiking, waterfalls, and if you just want peace thats there also. Will definitely be back. And thanks again Christy for being such a great host."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"we absolutely loved this cabin! We had a great stay .. bed was comfortable, cabin was clean. Hot tub was clean.. beautiful view of the river below. We hiked down to the river .. be warned very steep hike! Definitely watch out for the wild life... we saw a snake, squirrels, racoons, lizards. Nice little fire pit and a small grill like the ones on campsites. Check in was easy. We will definitely book again."

2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a wonderful time!
The best parts:
The view!!!, the privacy, the hot tub, and the outdoor shower.
The only things I could say I had an issue with were the mattresses being too soft and the hot water running out too fast during a shower (but if you turn the water off while sudsing up, you should be ok).
I would definitely love to return in the future!!"
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a great time at Christys cabin. If you’re planning activities that’ll require a table top, know there isn’t a coffee table - we made the upstairs loft work for reading and puzzles. We ate breakfast and dinner out on the patio. Pack a pair of outside shoes to wear to the outside shower and hot tub, if you don’t your feet will be dirty by the time you get back inside. The stay was wonderful and everything we hoped for, for our kid free getaway. Christys local recommendations came in handy. A lot of places are closed on Sunday and Monday’s but there’s still plenty open. We checked out Co-Op Brewery & harbor view winery over by City Harbor. In downtown Albertville we are at Local Joes and we also tried Julia’s like Christy recommended."
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We had the best time and the view was amazing!

2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Christy’s coyotes cabin is the best. If you want peace and quiet this is it. Beautiful scenery the creek runs all the time the sound is so pleasant and the cabin is beautifully decorated and very spacious for 2 people perfect restful and would be a great stay as part of your honeymoon. If u like hiking and the out doors this is it. We are seniors and we made it down to the creek very carefully but we made it and it was perfect. The town is about 10 away and looks of shopping and eatery. I want a week on my next trip.
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This places is just perfect! Want to go again!
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Amazing place so wonderful and the hot tub is great. Everything was very clean and check out was easy. Supplied with enough stuff to get you through your stay and coffee/tea was a nice touch. There isn’t a table in there, we had to use a stool to play games but the area is small there’s no where to fit one and the stool works just fine. Would recommend.
Restaurants and bars are very close only 10 minutes away. The speakeasy bar, brewery, and local bbq are all amazing."
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Loved this cabin experience! Everything was thoughtfully explained and the location was stunning.

2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Coyote's Cabin is exactly as described! The location is secluded, quiet, and peaceful, and the cabin is unique and has everything you need. We enjoyed all the place has to offer - we hiked down to and along the creek, relaxed in the hot tub, drank coffee and talked by the fire pit, showered outdoors, had breakfast on the deck overlooking the wooded creek - just the perfect little getaway! Christy was a great host, communicated everything upfront and responded quickly. We highly recommend Coyote's Cabin! 👍"

2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This cabin was beautiful! It sits on the bluff which feels like a treehouse from inside. Christy communicated well with us from start to finish. The cabin is laid out nice for a small space and decorated well. Parking was easy and convenient. We also loved the deck with the stunning view! I would strongly suggest reading the fine print extensively and more than once though. My only complaint is that there are zero coverings for the wall of windows facing the deck nor the window over the kitchen sink (this is listed in the listing details but we missed it). We felt a little open and exposed knowing that there were other cabins close by. I could see the cabin next door and their car through the kitchen window so I assumed they could potentially see me. Since it’s all one big open space, we felt like it wasn’t private except in the bathroom where we could shut a door. The sun also rises directly through the wall of windows. It is a gorgeous sun rise through the trees, but we wanted to sleep in and were up at 5:15am due to no way to block the sun at all. Our desire was to stay our night in a place where we could rest and refresh with some extra sleep after a day of driving which unfortunately wasn’t the turnout. I am sad that we won’t be staying here again for this reason. For the price of this cabin, I feel that an option to cover the windows should absolutely be included, no matter how gorgeous the sunrise is."
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The cutest little place with great sunrise views! Christy was a great host! Would definitely rebook!
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great location to celebrate an anniversary!

2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Excellent outdoor escape! The cabin is perfect for two to just relax and listen to nature. Fire pit was perfect for nightly s’mores and hotdogs.

2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Beautiful cabin and scenery! It's definitely not too small for 2 people. The creek was a beautiful site and we enjoyed the hot tub. Its very quiet and gives you a nice sense of peacefulness. We will be back!

All my needs were met. Christy went above and beyond when I requested citronella and lent me a burner and incense. She helped me whenever I needed and replied quickly. I will certainly be there again I even extended my stay this time!!!
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Coyote’s Cabin was the perfect getaway. We were out of town for a wedding at Lake Guntersville and needed a place to stay and decided to stay at Coyote’s Cabin. I’m so glad we did because we enjoyed every second of it.
The inflatable hot tub was great. I did not think an inflatable hot tub would be as good as a regular hot tub but it was!
The cabin is located in a nice neighborhood and not to far from restaurants and stores.
You can see Christy’s house and the other cabin but we still felt like we had plenty of privacy.
The cabin was very clean and decorated so cute.
I thought we would have to hike to get to the cabin but it wasn’t a far walk at all.
Would love to go back and spend more time there. 100% recommend booking it."

Christy is such a sweetheart!"
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We had an amazing time! Would love to come back!
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Total relaxation! Christy is great and makes sure you feel very welcomed. There is another cabin to the left of this cabin so it’s not totally secluded but they did try to give you privacy. I’m looking forward to going back!
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The first thing I noticed when we arrived was the peacefulness of the cabin! Everything was just as described in the listing. The host Christy makes herself available if there are any issues. We had no issues but it was nice to know she was there if we did. If you are looking for a nice, quite getaway with your significant other I highly recommend you checkout Coyotes cabin! We hope to go back soon!"

2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Christy is the most wonderful person! Our stay at the Coyote Treehouse was exceptional. She was made every step of the process so simple and went above and beyond for us. The treehouse itself was absolutely gorgeous and peaceful. My husband and I made memories we will cherish for a lifetime. This was our first stay at the Coyote, but it want be our last. Thank you from the bottom of our hearts, Christy! ❤️"

2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This is a great place to DISCONNECT from the world to RECONNECT with your special someone. The outdoor shower is my favorite feature! Buck’s Pocket State Park is a short drive away. It’s worth it to go to the overlook!
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Christy is an amazing host, very attentive and she made our stay superior. Cabin is much better then on the pictures, so cozy and romantic, we loved sound of the river during the day and rain during the night we stayed. There are everything you need in the cabin. We Loved design and accents of it, cabin was super clean. It was a fantastic stay. We definitely will come back soon."
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My wife and I were unable to travel home for the holidays so we decided to spend it here at the cabin! We had a wonderful time! We are avid hikers and found all of the surrounding state parks (all no more than an hour away) very beautiful and with lots of trail options! We also loved the downtown of Guntersville, which was very cute and had plenty of great restaurants! We will definitely be staying here again in the future!"
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Christy was GREAT! We Absolutely LOVED the cabin and we HIGHLY recommend it!
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This place turned out to be really nice, and more things to do around the area than we anticipated."
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Such a relaxing, secluded cabin perfect for a little get away! I honestly felt like I was in the mountains in Gatlinburg. The view and sound of the creek below is wonderful and the hike down to it is worth it! It is such a cozy cabin. I could have stayed in the bed the whole trip because it is SO comfortable. Christy was so nice and quick to respond! We are already talking about another trip back!"
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This was my second stay at the cabin and it was even better than the first! It’s such a peaceful little cabin. My husband and my best friends husband sent us for a moms weekend and it was perfect! Christy does an incredible job with personal touches for your stay! The sound of the creek is absolutely beautiful! Will continue to come back to this sweet little cabin in the woods!
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Christy was the best host you can ask for. So helpful. Welcoming. Her place is so beautiful, just perfect for couples to get away.

2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This little treehouse/cabin was perfect for a weekend away! This was our first vacation without our kids and it was a dream! The view is amazing. We were so comfortable and the place smelled so clean!! We would definitely stay here again. We did not miss a TV or even think about it honestly! The walk down to the creek is so worth it!! Christy is so sweet and accommodating! You can tell they put their hearts into their rentals!!
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Christy is absolutely kind and attentive to her guests. Responds in a timely manner! You will not be disappointed with your stay! Book and enjoy!

2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We had a fantastic stay at the cabin. The trek down to the creek is definitely worth it.
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Just left yesterday and I’m ready to go back. Everything you need for a relaxing stay away from it all. Every detail has been addressed. Wonderful host.
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Christy is a kind host and her cabin is quite lovely! The cabin is as listed. The view from the loft is a wonderful one to wake up to. It's quiet and peaceful, but from the deck you can hear the sounds of the creek below. The creek is definitely worth the trek down, just wear appropriate shoes. The only problem we had was nothing to do with the host or the cabin itself, we didn't have cell phone service to call her to check in, but she was extremely helpful and got the code to us. It was very nice to be disconnected and just spend time together in a cozy place. Albertville has everything you would need and is nearby. Lake Guntersville is stunning. Our only regret is that we were only there for two nights."
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great experience!
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very clean and cozy. Beautiful view.

2021-10-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"If you are wanting a new experience, then you must stay at Coyote Cabin (the Treehouse). Check in is so easy and the outside ambience is breathtaking. Our host had the check out rules posted which was so helpful. Extremely clean and convenient."
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Deserves more than 5 stars!!!! Best small trip we’ve taken! So relaxing for a business trip for us! We will be back for leisure!
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Our stay at Christy’s Coyote Cabin was just the relaxing weekend we needed! Her listing includes accurate details, and her cabin includes everything you need for a relaxing stay! We aren’t “fancy” people, and this cabin was more than we even expected! I highly recommend this listing for a couples retreat to nature but close enough to town for any other type of activity you can think of!"
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"great place, affordable, accessible and PERFECTLY, ACCURATELY DESCRIBED. very clean. we will be back!!"
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,You will not be disappointed. Well equipped. Super clean. One of a kind stay. Great location. Sleeping in the loft while listening to the water flow is magical. Host is great. Can’t recommend highly enough.
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Our stay here at Coyote’s Cabin was great. Still beautiful even with rainy weather. The outdoor tub and shower is an added bonus with a great view of the forest. Very romantic and relaxing stay. Plenty of activities and parks around to enjoy too! Christy was great and in touch throughout our stay. Answered all our questions promptly, and extremely nice."
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,It was beautiful breathtaking to say the least will definitely visit again!
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This tiny cabin is a perfect getaway! Secluded, away from the world, and so very cozy! Christy was a wonderful hostess and went above and beyond for us to have a great stay! The view from the cabin is amazing! We had a wonderful time and would definitely recommend it!"
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Christy’s cabin is as wonderful as advertised and expected and more.
For us, it was a way to unplug (but not completely) and recharge. The sights and sounds, the coziness...
Christy thought of all the details needed to escape and feel well taken care of! We will be back soon!"
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Coyotes Cabin was so much fun! The sound of the water was so relaxing. This is definitely the coolest little getaway.
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We loved the cabin, it was cozy, clean, and has a beautiful view. We would stay here again."
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Everything was amazing. It’s in a great location short distance to everything. Everything around is decently priced. It was amazing the view is great. Will definitely be back.
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Christy's place was absolutely wonderful! Gorgeous views. Loved the space! My husband and I definitely want to visit again.
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Super convenient location near Guntersville and amazing babbling creek and tin roof. The tub was a novel idea, but we weren’t interested in taking a cold bath. Love the fire pit but had to get our own wood. Excellent get away to unplug!"
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Randomly picked this place coming from Ohio and we glad we did. The place is very clean, no gritty feeling on the floor. The bed is comfortable enough for two people. I'm 6ft tall and it was fine for me. The trek down to the water isn't bad, it's slippery when wet. (we didn't slip at all with sandals and it rained a bit during our stay) The tub was a nice addition, my wife had bubbles going and she loved it. The view was fantastic. Eating outside in the morning with the sun rising before going to scenic destinations my wife planned was great. I didn't expect the area to be as nice as it was. So many things to see all around. Felt it was better than the Smokey Mountains. The caverns nearby seemed better than the Mammoth Caves. not a bunch of people crowded the places. Our 10am appointment in the cathedral caverns, we were the only ones there. The big waterfalls nearby, only ones there. The caves nearby, let a couple rappel down, then had the whole cave to ourselves. Didn't expect any of this really. Such an awesome area with wonderful a wonderful host. Thank you so much"
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"A perfectly quaint cabin in the Alabama hills! The accommodations, views and host were all equally awesome. We enjoyed a three night stay at Coyote’s Cabin. We took a kayak down to Paint Rock River, walked down to “Hideaway Beach”, cooked over an open fire, bathed in the outdoor tub and listened to the pitter-patter of rain on the roof every night to help us sleep! Highly recommended, exactly as described, we’ll be staying again!"
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Beautiful property with an amazing host! Christy was very fast at responding to all my questions and was super kind. The bed was very comfortable and she had lots of toiletries, k-cups, popcorn etc out for the guests. There is even a cute outdoor shower that is secluded with a beautiful view of the gorge/river !"
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is the perfect place to just unplug. The cabin is so cute and comfortable. It offers a definite home away from home feel. The outside shower and tub were our favorite. The steep hike to the creek is worth the effort. Thank you to our host for all the personal, thoughtful ammenties."
2021-08-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"Great little place for a pit stop!
We stayed one night and were kinda bummed that the tub outside was for esthetics purpose mainly, it doesn’t have running water and is apparently used for hot Summer day with a water hose! It’s a very small house, tiny bathroom and shower. Be sure to not put the ceiling fan on high because it will make a racket while you sleep and you’ll think it’s something trying to crawl in the house with you! lol
It could have been a little cooler in the house but the air conditioning is a split system that is set at 72 and if you want it turned down the owner has to do it for you. Also, the bed is a full. Very small for me and my 6 foot tall hubby!
Owner of property was prompt in response to questions and check in was a breeze!
The creek was the best part about it, but be warned it’s a treck there and back. Straight down hill getting to it and then straight up hill coming back!
Overall, glad we stayed at house but probably won’t be revisiting."
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Both the inside and outside of the cabin are excellent. The beautiful and relaxing outdoor scenery are wonderful as well. Pictures don't do it justice. Having no TV or Wifi was such a blessing, truly relaxing and able to unplug. Outdoor shower was the icing on the cake. This is one that will stay on the list."
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The house is located at the very end of the rooad, not at the address with the mailbox. It's further down on the same property"
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The cabin feels wonderfully secluded despite not being too far from things to do. The outdoor shower was so nice with great water pressure though maybe avoid taking one late at night unless you want a wholesale June bug storm.
Lots of little amenities everywhere in the cabin, it was a perfect romantic getaway"
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This cabin is absolutely amazing. A perfect, picturesque place for a getaway. We enjoyed listening to the creek from the loft, and the trail down to the beach was definitely worth it. Saw some cool wildlife, and had an overall great time. Christy was a great host and we had everything we could have possibly needed."
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Christy's Coyote Cabin is a perfect get-away for two!
The location can't be beat and the tiny cabin is thoughtfully designed and really feels like a treehouse in the middle of nowhere! Though situated next door to the owners, it is the last structure on a dead-end road and angled away from other homes and towards the woods & creek for a very private stay.
Thanks again for a lovely stay & much needed respite from the world!!!"
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Take the trip!!! Coyotes Cabin is beautiful and so very peaceful!!!! Exactly as described, the claw foot tub and outdoor shower is so amazing after a day on the creek!!! Christy is the best host on top of everything and makes sure your trip is perfect!! Will be back!!!!!!! If you are contemplating going, GO you will not be disapointed!!!"
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"It was a great night! Perfect view, perfect set up! Thank you Christy!"
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"An incredible space. Feel like you are off the grid without going in the middle of nowhere. This is a super intimate, perfect spot for a couple or a single person looking to get away.
Your own quiet corner of peace overlooking the river."
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Amazing view!! Gorgeous cabin! We loved it all!
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,10 out of 10 Great location so relaxing. A quiet getaway for a couple me and my husband had a great time just the two of us.

2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great getaway! Loved it!
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We enjoyed it
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Beautiful and charming place! Very comfortable and cozy… The river is a trek to get to and the outdoor bathtub would take some work to make it useful but otherwise a great stay and Christy was a delight to work with! Would definitely return…
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,What an awesome getaway we had here. The view is incredible. The stream is awesome. The cabin is beautiful. The owner is top notch. And the outdoor tub was just the icing on the cake! You wont regret your stay.
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Christy's cabin is wonderful! It's very private, nestled in the woods with a beautiful deck that overlooks a green valley with a lovely creek at the bottom. The firepit is so comfortable and relaxing. Definitely build yourself a fire and settle in for an evening. The outdoor clawfoot tub was so much fun: we filled it up with bubbles and drank mint juleps in the bath under the trees. So. Much. Fun. The walk down to the beach is steep, but worth it. If you walk upstream a little from the beach there is a big flat rock on the creek that is perfect for laying out and listening to the water while you relax under the trees. The bed is comfy, the view is beautiful.
And, Christy is as gem. We had a problem with one of our vehicles, and she arranged to get us help right to the cabin so that it didn't disturb our weekend at all.
We loved the place. Perfect romantic getaway for a couple!"
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Coyote’s Cabin is an amazing, secluded retreat in the heart of Alabama. No TV or internet- just what we needed to unwind and rest. The cabin is very clean and Christy provides amenities to make it feel like home. Having no stove wasn’t an issue. The hike up and down to the creek can be a little tricky. Definitely bring tennis shoes or a croc-type shoe if you plan on going down. We ate at Local Joe’s, Fire by the River, grabbed coffee in downtown Albertville (can’t remember the name)... every local we encountered was super friendly! Christy is an amazing host and communication with her is always easy and fast. We have fallen in love with the cabin and already want to come back! Thank you, Christy, for sharing your cabin with us!"
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Coyote’s Canyon is a wonderful place to stay, I really enjoyed it, the nature, the quiet, the time to just have an evening with my Wife, just to talk and hang out was great. I highly recommend staying there. Would be a great stop fo anyone traveling on a motorcycle also. Easy parking. Don’t skip this one. Just book it."
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This cabin is awesome! I am so glad that we chose to spend our vacation here on Sand Mountain. Driving distance from great restaurants, but feels so secluded with the bubbling creek and wooded back yard. We could stay all day on the deck! Loved it and we will be back!"
2024-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Great place to stay for Albertville baseball tournaments. Clean, affordable and hosts were quick to respond. Close to everything you need! Will stay here again and highly recommend. The beds were very comfortable as well! 10 stars!"
2023-11-01,5.0,Group trip,This is the 2nd year I booked Michael’s home for the long Thanksgiving weekend for myself and my adult children. My family and I enjoyed this home both times. Owner/caretakers are very responsive and we enjoyed our stay. We will be back. Thanks!

2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This was just as described. It was clean, quite, safe and very spacious. I would definitely revisit if I was back in the area. Overall, I would have to give it a 10/10."
2023-04-01,5.0,Group trip,Very pretty home. The one and only negative is there is no entry into a bathroom without going through a bedroom.
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Look forward to staying again in the future
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Thank you!
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We truly enjoyed staying in this lovely home. The kitchen is great for cooking and dining areas are spacious. The beds are comfortable, nice outside patio with ample seating. This was mainly a family Thanksgiving visit and so nice to be together with my adult children and granddaughter under one roof. We were able to do some fun things also. Highly recommend checking out Lake Guntersville and a visit to Noccalula Falls. Nice experience!!"
2022-10-01,5.0,Group trip,"This home is so spacious. We had a group of three couples traveling together. The space had great places where we could gather together and when we needed time apart, many different places to spread out! The updated kitchen met our needs as we ate most of our meals in and did a lot of cooking. The hosts were very communicative and helpful when we had a few small needs. The neighborhood was lovely and quiet. We highly recommend both the home and hosts!!"
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This house is indeed charming and very well taken care of and clean. The backyard was an excellent touch it is fenced in perfect for a sipping coffee there was a trampoline with the safety net which came in handy for my toddler. The decor and layout of the house is very nice, plenty of room for everyone to congregate. The bed was very comfortable. This was my first Airbnb experience and definitely will not be my last. Michael was a very gracious and kind host to answered all questions very promptly."

Returning to Mike’s home felt so comfortable, and familiar, it felt like returning home almost.
The place is great. It is a pretty big size. The backyard is fantastic for letting your dogs get some exercise or for sitting around in the sun, or just enjoying being outside. Showers work great, beds are comfortable. Tv works great, and the house has everything you could need.
I enjoy Albertville very much, but Mike’s neighborhood is so perfect, as it is away from it all, yet still close to everything.

2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Brown's Creek Cottage is delightful! Peaceful, comfortable and lovely. The hosts, Larry and Monica, tailored a welcome note to us and messaged us after the check-in time to make sure we were in and settled. The bed was comfortable, the back porch is of real benefit when traveling with a pet. We spent a bit of time each evening on the porch watching our pup Bella take her last outdoor stroll before bed. Each morning, we took her to Civitan Park a couple of blocks away right on the lake, which is gorgeous and peaceful in the mornings. I loved that each bathroom came equipped with body wash, shampoo and conditioner, thoughtfully selected, easily dispensed. It is obvious that these hosts understand that the ""difference"" makes all the difference. Little things are important - from well appointed bathrooms, to having a pot/pan of every size. Browns Creek Cottage is one of the best Airbnb experiences we have ever had and we highly recommend it.
JoAnn, Dex and Bella"
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Larry’s place was cozy and so easy to access. It’s minutes from City Harbor and Larry was response time was quick and he jumped to bring an extra key. The backyard was so spacious and fenced in!

The house was clean and set up great for bringing pets. The gate at the steps that latched made it easy to let our girl hang out and sun on the porch without worrying she'd wander off. The fenced in back yard was huge!
The kitchen was well stocked! We visited the Piggly Wiggly and ate all of our meals at the house instead of eating out.
Thanks for being a great host! We will definitely stay here again when we're in the area!"

2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Dad's dog had knee surgery 3 weeks before we came, so he didn't get to fully enjoy the fenced-in back yard, but he was very happy with the dog biscuits Larry and his wife left :) A pleasant, comfortable stay in a nice area.

2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Hosts are terrific! They go out of their way to make sure you have everything you need. They even got us a mattress topper to try and see if a softer top might help with comfort due to recent shoulder injury. It was perfect and much appreciated. House is very clean and WiFi worked great.
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"This was my second stay at Larry's place, and like last year he was quick to respond to any messages and the check-in was easy and flexible. Walking into the house, it was wonderfully clean and everything was organized and ready for my stay. I was there for a longer time, and mid-stay he proactively checked in to make sure I had everything I needed. This was a fishing trip for me, and the place is great for that purpose: close to the boat landing (maybe 3 minutes), and you can pull your rig into the driveway from the alley - no backing up. As an added bonus, it's a quick walk from the house down to the waterfront walking trail, which is a nice feature of this area of Guntersville."
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Larry’s place is a quaint beautiful home with a view of Guntersville lake. Would definitely stay again and would highly recommend it!
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"place was great, very comfortable, and very close to everything I needed it to be (boat ramp, food, groceries).

It has a generous supply of kitchen items, soap, towels etc. The back yard is as it appears in the picture of the fenced yard - hugh! Another plus is the driveway extends from the street to an alley that connects to another street. For renters who come with more than one vehicle this is very convenient. No one gets blocked-in."

We loved it and are staying there again later this year!"
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Sweet little cottage close to everything you would want or need. Clean house fully stocked with everything you would need. Check in/out time is earlier and later then most places and that was a plus. Screened porch was nice and the fire pit was too. Will definitely stay again sometime.
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Came for a weekend girls trip with my daughters and their brother, “Mr Chunks”. The home was lovely and was nicer than we were even expecting. Mr Chunks is an older dog, and the steps out the front door were easy for him to manage. In his younger years, the large fenced in back yard would have been fabulous! The mattresses were very comfortable, and I appreciated the power strip available for easily charging my phone. I enjoyed the fact that I didn’t have to back out of the driveway, but could just pull forward out the alley.
I loved that everything we wanted to do was a short(and beautiful) drive away. We spent most of our time going out to eat, exploring the state park and just sitting and enjoying the lake views…and laughing…lots of laughing.
We plan to come back and bring a few other family members next time. Maybe we’ll even have time to put some puzzles together next time(that were at the house). We kept saying we were going to, but never did.
It was a perfect little get away. Can’t wait to come back."

Easy parking with electric for the truck and trailer in a quiet neighborhood. The location is only a couple blocks from the boat ramp and within a few minutes of downtown Guntersville.

There is a dog park, a playground, walking path, fishing pier, lake access, etc all within walking distance. There is a strip mall right across the way as well and the Lodge and state park is a short drive away. Larry and Monica thought of everyone for our stay including the dog.

2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Larry’s home was perfect for our stay! A nice, updated 50’s style home, reminiscent of grandma’s homestead (without the clutter 😉). The bedrooms were large with wonderfully comfortable beds. The added tv in the master was a nice addition although not used in our case. Access to a large laundry room with supplies was nice also. The kitchen was a little small, but well-equipped. The Keurig with a hand full of samples was easy to operate. There was also a nice little screened porch out back that would’ve been perfect for a coffee quiet time, if only there was time. 😉
Overall, I would highly recommend Larry’s place. His communication was exemplary The best part was that the home was only a block from the magnificent lake with a nice park with tables and a front row seat to a flock of Canadian geese and their chicks.
A side note, my daughter and I came up from Fl to do some hiking post-grad decompression 😁. The first day, we went to Bethel Spring/falling Sink which was a moderate 2mile trail to a lovely waterfall. The second day, we hiked Stephen’s Gap (listed as 1.4miles, but seemed longer). This was extremely challenging and you have to sign a waiver and agree to wear helmets etc, but the cave/waterfall were amazing to see! Both trails were about 30 minutes from the house and the scenery en route was so serene and beautiful as it was accompanied by open fields, wild flowers, livestock and horses. In all, I would give Guntersville a five star rating for a peaceful vacation destination."
,,,didn't stay here
,,,"Nice view but horrible communication from the host and very unprofessional experience that just keeps getting worse since we left….cried the whole way home from embarrassment because of these accusations. Hawks nest was nice until we realized the door malfunctioned and locked us outside with all our belongings in the treehouse and host was not answering any calls or texts so we ended up having to walk up the hill to her residence to get any help with getting the door open. Then hosts husband comes down and inspected the door lock and says it malfunctioned and needed to be reset he continued to mess with it for about ten minutes before providing a Lowe’s card for us and told us how to “break in” and out of the tree house.. we had to sleep in a strange place to us with the door cracked open all night so we wouldn’t get locked inside which ended up happening anyway because getting up in middle of the night I found we had been. my husband had closed the door and it locked me INSIDE the tree house. at this point I’m panicking rather then relaxing. then the table was poorly built with small nails and came loose when I set two drinks on it right before we ate breakfast. We assumed the host already knew it was loose with the lack of proper nails and thought nothing more of it so we put it back in place and sat down to eat. then the morning we’re leaving I woke up to unexpected spotting from my menstrual cycle and I tried to do the best I could with the situation, embarrassed we left the place as clean as we possibly could with given supplies. Then an hour after check out the host requests 300$ for damages and cleanings. I agreed to pay the $150 for the bedding when I privately messaged the host… then to add to the embarrassment I see she blasts us on her business page as if I wasn’t already embarrassed enough… nothing like opening Facebook and first thing to pop up is pictures of your spotting for the public to go and comment of how nasty and gross of a female you are because you have an unexpected period….. this weekend has me traumatized to ever stay in an Airbnb again.
and now we are up to $520 because I didn’t agree with her claim. After I agreed to pay for all bedding expenses.
SO if you want a quite place this is nice but enter expecting to be blamed if anything happens and you won’t be able to get a fast response from your host if something goes wrong. ..if you’re a postpartum woman like myself with irregular cycles make sure to bring your own bedding because there’s no way to clean bedding at the tree house and host will blast you on their Facebook business page (pictures and all) for being a gross female because something natural happed to you."
