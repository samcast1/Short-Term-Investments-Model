2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"We truly enjoyed staying in the lovely, clean, and cozy cottage on Debbie’s beautiful, spacious property. The location was excellent for exploring a variety of towns and beaches on the cape, as well as ferrying to Nantucket. The kayaks, canoe, and paddle board were great to use on the large, serene pond. It was fun to have a balance throughout the week between exploring the area and relaxing while enjoying the gorgeous property. Thank you, Debbie."

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Debbie is an excellent host! Cottage was wonderful!
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Our recent stay was a great getaway from start to finish. Debbie responded quickly, check in was easy, and there was even a welcome wine when we got there. The property is just as described, and we appreciated the flexibility to use the lake or drive to the beach. When we accidentally left a charger, Debbie even mailed it back to us. We highly recommend it to anyone seeking a comfortable and enjoyable stay."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Debbie was a responsive host. Property sits on beautiful surroundings and near pond. Convenient but private location on Cape Cod. Thank you Debbie.
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Debbie’s place was great for our family. We really enjoyed hanging around the house/yard, very peaceful! And as other reviews mentioned great proximity to so many other places to explore on the Cape. Would highly recommend!"
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Wow, the property is beautiful! There is a lake, and the hostess provides nonmotorized water equipment. The cottage is small, but it is the perfect size for two people. It is tastefully decorated and super clean. Debbie is a great hostess, very lovely and friendly. I highly recommend this listing."
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,Beautiful place. Generous hostess.
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"This is a little gem! Just the perfect size for a couple and the location is awesome - convenient to beaches, shopping and of course Ice Cream!!"
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"We had the pleasure of celebrating our 44th anniversary in this beautiful little cottage! The grounds were gorgeous and so well kept. The little lake was so relaxing to sit by and read a book!
We spent almost two weeks there and enjoyed every minute of it. Boston and Plymouth were close enough to drive there, and back to the cottage the same day, which was perfect after a day of sightseeing!
The cottage had everything we needed, the bed was importantly comfortable, and there was even a very comfortable recliner for my husband to sit back relax and watch TV. He felt like he was at home.
Debbie was a great hostess, she was there in the background if we needed her and willing to send over information when we inquired about traffic, sightseeing and grocery shopping!
We hope to make this a yearly thing!"
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"Amazingly cute cottage on a very nice property in great location. Central to so many towns on the cape and you even have your own pond access. Very private and secluded with own driveway but close to Hyannis, shopping and dining.
Debbie is an amazing hostess and very communicative. We were able to store our bikes in the barn for when it rained. Even though it says no WiFi access she shared the main house connection with us and it was strong enough for me to work remotely from inside the cabin. Very clean with nice sized bathroom and bedroom. Mini fridge but great oven and kitchen equipment for cooking.
One thing to note is to keep the windows sealed. When we didn’t have them shut on top a lot of flies got in. There’s ac in the bedroom so not a huge issue.
Thanks for a great stay!"
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"The description for Debbie's cottage is accurate. Although it looks & feels secluded down a country lane, it's not far from shopping & restaurants and easy access to both Rtes 6 & 6A. It was a bit cool for us to take advantage of the adjacent lake, but kayaks and a canoe are available. The property is large, so perfect for a dog (or puppy) to run off their excess energy. Drive south to reach Falmouth & Woods Hole for ferries to both Martha's Vinyard and Nantucket. We enjoyed the location and the neigh or we met."
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Debbie was a fantastic host, she took care of every detail to make our vacation perfect. The cottage was beautiful and very clean, she had everything that we could possibly need. We brought our fur baby golden retriever and Debbie had a dog bowel and treats for her., that was such a special touch. The property was gorgeous with plenty to do. It was my first time to Cape Cod and I’m already looking forward to returning ."
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Absolutely loved this little place. The property is well maintained and beautiful. The lake is a great feature too! Everything you need for 2 people to enjoy their stay. The privacy here is a bonus as well as the location to near restaurants and attractions!
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"A very charming and cozy cottage. Huge bedroom. The grounds were awesome and we spent part of our last day kayaking around the lake. Great location for going to all parts of the cape. I highly recommend renting bikes in Dennis and biking the rail trail up to Orleans. One of my favorite parts of the trip.
I highly recommend.! Not too far of a drive into Hyannis to shop at Trader Joe’s also!
Perfect week!"
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This cottage is so cozy and lovely and the grounds are gorgeous. The host is right next door, very responsive and helpful. I love all the sweet touches and being near the pond. The swimming and kayaking are so great and the small private beach so nice for relaxing. The location is great for exploring all parts of the Cape."
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Adorable cottage on an incredible property. The pond is beautiful and we got to row around once but we were too busy exploring the cape everyday. Central location to anywhere on the cape. Debbie was a great host, good communication and very thoughtful. If you wanted to just relax, you wouldn’t even need to leave this property."
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Adorable cottage and beautiful grounds for a nice relaxing stay. The location is great, quiet, but close to so many things on the Cape. Pictures and description are accurate, Debbie is friendly and helpful, would highly recommend!!"
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We had a wonderful time staying at Debbie’s cottage. She thought of everything a guest might need to have on hand during their stay. The property is beautiful and it is wonderful to be able to enjoy kayaking and swimming in the pond as well as be a short drive to multiple beaches. The nearby village is also lovely with wonderful restaurants and art galleries. Thanks so much for hosting us Debbie!
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,DEBBIE WAS AN OUTSTANDING HOSTESS. THE COTTAGE HAD EVERYTHING WE NEEDED AND MORE. SHE ATTENDED TO EVERY LAST DETAIL PERFECTLY. THE COTTAGE WAS DECORATED ADORABLY AND WAS IMMACULATE. WOULD NOT HESITATE TO STAY AGAIN.
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Second time staying. Very comfortable. Lovely grounds and pond to kayak in. Convenient location. Recommend
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"This cottage is a wonderful and the property is just amazing. So much to do, you really don't need to leave. But, if you do the proximity to everything is GREAT. A short drive to the beach and you can hit ever town on the cape in just under hour. What a special place. Debbie was a great host and the cottage is well a pointed. Look forward to going back!!"
2021-07-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,A/C could use an upgrade.......very noisy. Otherwise a 5 star thumbs up!
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Debbie’s Cape Cod Cottage is indeed adorable, very comfortable in a beautiful, picturesque setting. The cottage was clean, well supplied and in a great location to explore the Cape. Debbie was quick to respond and very accommodating. We would definitely stay again."
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great place! Comfortable, pretty grounds, well stocked, great value!"
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is our second time at Debbie's place. She's made some renovations which only enhance its charm. Our dog absolutely loves it too! Debbie is always available for suggestions on where to eat or things to do or to answer any questions you might have. We'd absolutely recommend it to anyone looking for any couple looking for a private, quiet place to stay on the Cape."
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Lovely cottage with all the amenities, beautiful property, and a wonderful host! Highly recommend."
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Barnstable is one of the most picturesque, appealing towns in Massachusetts, and Debbie's guest house may well be the most appealing public lodging in the town. The house has the charm of a building over 200 years old, but it is also up to date for both comfort and style. It is set on beautiful, spacious property which includes a lake for kayaking or swimming. It even has good fishing! You simply couldn't ask for a cooler, more gracious spot as a headquarters for exploring the Cape generally, or just relaxing in beautiful Barnstable."
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This well maintained cabin with artistic touches was just what we were looking for in the way of a vacation. The large stone on the front lawn facing the street says ""Serenity"" and that was exactly what we found.
Debbie was accessible and answered our questions right away. She was gracious in sharing all the fabulous amenities of their several acres in the back, with a sliding swing, hammock, picnic table, canoe/kayak launch (life vests and paddles) and the whimsy art placed around the beautifully landscaped yard was great for an evening stroll.
Parking is at the front door with a key pad entrance. All the furnishing, curtains and towels, etc were charming and new. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay and hope to return many times in the future.
There was easy access to main roads leading to Route 6 and the city of Hyannis with all it's shopping possibilities. Also, we found an entrance to a conservation area with hiking trails on a morning walk down the narrow country lane to the left out of the entrance, which was an added bonus for us."
2020-10-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"Such a darling little cottage in a postcard location. Felt totally private and secluded, with old cape cod charm."
2020-09-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Wonderful spot on beautiful grounds. The pond was a fantastic option for swimming, kayaking, fishing (it was our dog's favorite thing). The cottage is small but provides all you need and Debbie is a great host. We'd definitely go back."
2020-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had such a wonderful, relaxing time at Debbie's little cottage! The accommodations were simple but plenty of space for us. The ground were incredible especially if you're bringing any canine family members - the private yard feels like a park, and the spring-fed pond is beautiful and clean. Our dog loved swimming. Extremely convenient to 6A and the small towns and businesses along the way, while still feeling very remote and quiet. Debbie's cottage is the perfect way to stay on the Cape for a few days without feeling like you're in the middle of the beach hubbub."
2020-09-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Excellent stay. Very comfortable cozy space on a great property. Kayaks were fun on the pond. Kitchen limited equipment but great for breakfast and lunch. Would definitely return. Beautiful area and grounds. Host was very helpful and communicative. Posted back earrings left behind. Highly recommended.
2020-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Debbie's cottage is in an idyllic spot, beautifully decorated and in lovely grounds which my puppy loved exploring. It has every amenity you would need. Debbie was an attentive host and when I had a small issue in the bathroom was quick to get is resolved and follow up to make sure all was working well. I hope we can come back again soon. It's the perfect base to explore the Cape."
2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Debbie's guest house is a wonderful and cozy place filled with thoughtful touches. The place itself felt quite spacious (at least to us city-dwellers) for a family of three plus a small dog, and we greatly enjoyed taking advantage of the peaceful yard, the hammock, and the pond. We would love to stay again some time and would recommend without reservation to friends."
2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Debbie was very responsive and had great recommendations. The cottage was very clean with a nice and thoughtful touch to it. The location made it very convenient to get everywhere. Definitely recommend this if you’re looking for a place to stay on the cape!
2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Had a great stay at Debbie's place! It was the perfect little cottage for our trip to the Cape, central to everything and easy to access. We loved the pond that was accessible from the property and went swimming there most days. Highly recommend!"
2020-07-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,The cottage is absolutely adorable! It was the perfect combination of peace and tranquillity and yet close enough to everything to stay busy all day long. Debbie is the perfect host and we suggest if you're looking for the above mentioned then Debbie's little cottage in West Barnstable is the place to go. We will definitely stay there again when we go back to the cape.
2020-07-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Lovely, lovely cottage on an incredible piece of property. We loved the spot especially the huge lawn and access to the lake and my dog had a blast. Debbie is extremely friendly and accommodating. Highly recommend!"
2020-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Very tranquil place to relax and enjoy. Afetr arriving at the cottage we realized that we stayed at te Best Western 4 years prior, We are so happy to have rented this cottage for our stay. it was everything that we expected. People were so friendly."

2020-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This cottage is really lovely, charming and comfortable with interesting antiques and everything you need. Swimming and kayaking on the pond with bald eagles and turtles to watch are a real treat. Quiet and peaceful, this is a great location from which to explore the Cape. Debbie was very helpful with everything I needed. The grounds and her beautiful flowers are really spectacular too. I can't wait to return!"
2019-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This was the perfect place for our visit to Cape Cod. The cottage was cozy and comfortable- it had everything we needed. Great location and the setting was awesome. During our stay we had a few questions and Debbie`s responses were immediate. Would definitely stay there again if we return to Cape Cod
2019-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"If you are looking for peace and quiet, this is your place. What you see is what you get. No surprises. Great location and a wonderful host."
2019-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"What a wonderful experience!
This guest house is more than we expected... 100% historic cape cod with fantastic lodging, land, water, tranquility and all the comforts one needs to have a memorable time..
Debbie is great!! She provided us with answers and advice to my many “pre-trip” emails, which resulted in a fabulous time from P-Town to Nantucket and most everything in between...
Thanks again Debbie!!!
Hey Debbie - We will return, and next time we will absolutely go to the Vineyard ;)"
2019-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great little cottage on a picturesque piece of property.
A Perfect hub for a couple and our little dog, Zorro. We were able to explore Cape Cod and Rhode Island and come back to the cottage for down time and rest in a comfy bed. Nice kitchenette and little living room to start off and wrap up the day.
Beautiful acreage with lake access. We enjoyed waking down Plum street and September gave us lovely weather to enjoy.
Debbie has her home and cottage decorated for fall so it was fun for us Florida travellers to get an early taste."
2019-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Debbie was a great host. I hope to stay again at the adorable cottage. It was even better than I imagined. Just perfect!
2019-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is my 2nd time staying at Debbie's. I love how peaceful & charming the cottage is. Plus my pets love to stay here too! Had a great weekend!
Thank you Debbie."
2019-07-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,I would strongly recommend this adorable cottage and property!! The cottage was perfect and Debbie was warm and friendly. I wished we had been able to get to know each other a bit better. I loved everything about the visit and my time in the cottage. the property and cottage is 100% CAPE COD! See you next year Debbie! KW
2019-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Debbies cottage is lovely! I was traveling with my daughter and grandaughter, and all three generations equally loved this place. All the essentials were provided plus unexpected touches and treats. The cottage is in a peaceful, picturesque setting, and neighborhood, with beatuful gardens and local architecture. We enjoyed kayaking, paddle boarding and swimming in the pond every morning before heading out to explore the cape. (the pond is closer to a 30-40 acre lake that is crystal clear, and warm as bathwater). Barnstable is a great starting point on the cape and in close proximity to many beaches and points of interest. We would have loved to spend more time here and would definitely return. Debbie is a wonderful host. We made great memories on this trip."
2019-06-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"What a little slice of heaven! We had such a wonderful stay at Debbie's. She was such a welcoming & friendly host. A great location, great time!
Thank you Debbie for hosting all of us!!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Pam is a fantastic hostess! She made us homemade muffins, got us ice cream, and stocked the fridge with drinks and snacks. She even left treats for our dog. The place is very dog friendly and her backyard is beautifully landscaped! Her place is close to many beaches and the main center of Hyannis. Highly recommend!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"A great visit and Pam was a great host. We felt very welcome from the moment we arrived. Sophie the dog) felt very welcome as well. This house is stocked with almost anything you might need, Including maps and guide books to the area. Highly recommend!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Pam and her place exceeded our expectations in every way. Whatever you forget, she probably has it. Breakfast is not just a muffin. There was eggs in the fridge, granola, cereal, snacks, candy, dog treats, your favorite ice cream and all kinds of toppers, drinks, condiments... need I say more?! It was like our home away from home. We have an anxious dog and before we knew it, she was navigating the doggie door, bringing her toys in the bathroom so she could lie on the plush rugs lol, and finding a patch of sunshine to lie in. The yard and gardens and lit pathways are beautiful. We hope to come again sometime, if we can find an opening!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Our stay was absolutely WONDERFUL. Pam is an amazing host that truly goes above and beyond to make her guests’ stay perfect. As a couple with a neurotic dog that has to travel with us, we have stayed a lot of places that allow dogs, but this is the first truly dog friendly rental. The fenced in yard is beautiful, and secure. The doggy dog allowed our dog to enter and exit as he wanted which he loved. The space was cozy and felt like home. Pam has thought of everything, and we would 100% recommend her place to anyone traveling with their dog!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Pam was wonderful! Her place was spotless, well stocked, and she was very welcoming to my family and especially to my dogs! The best part was the gorgeous fenced in yard, so perfect for the dogs to hang out. We can’t wait to stay again !"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay! Pam goes above and beyond for her guests human and dog alike. The BNB was comfortable, clean, and had everything you could need. We loved how much she loved accommodating our pup. She gave great recommendations and the location was perfect for us. We will definitely be returning in the future!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Pam’s wonderful apartment felt like a true home with dogs and all! Everything in the kitchen was labeled and wonderfully organized. She truly paid attention to every detail. The wife and I had a beautiful experience. Pam is wonderful and her dogs are all happy and nice. I can’t recommend this place enough. Best AirBnB we’ve ever been to!
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,I can’t say enough about this stay. Let me start off by saying the place was immaculate !!! Pam was very friendly and welcoming. I felt like I was living in my own home. Pam had absolutely everything that you would need in that home from snacks to toiletries ect… She had our favorite kind of ice cream waiting for us when we got there and amazing homemade blueberry muffins for the morning. She also had dog treats and toys for the dogs. I give this place 10 stars !!! Thank you Pam !!!
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"I am so glad we found this gem of an airbnb. My partner and I brought our dog and it was our first time vacationing with our dog. Pam's place is absolutely perfect for dogs, with a fenced in back yard, quiet neighborhood for walks, and Pam preparing so well for our visit. The apartment itself was clean, well stocked, and comfortable enough to want to spend time in. Pam is a kind and thoughtful host, we will definitely be back!"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,I can’t say enough about this space. Pam was so wonderful and she has left nothing out in terms of having all of the comforts of home accessible. I have never stayed at an Airbnb with all of the comforts that Pam’s place has. I highly recommend it as does my dog Luna
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We had such a wonderful time at Pam's place with our dog, Daisy! Pam is a kind, thoughtful, and responsive host, and she went above and beyond to make sure we all had a great trip. The place was cute and clean and was a great home base for us as we explored Cape Cod. We would definitely stay here again and 100% recommend to others!"
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Pam is amazing friendly warm and welcoming. She thought of everything down to the two local beers, local goodies like Ice cream and yummy home made muffins. If you forgot something it is prob there my wife forgot a tooth brush and there was extras in the bathroom which was nice. She gave us good food places in the area and which were her fav. Thank you we will be looking her up next time we’re in the cape."
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"My pup and I had a wonderful stay at Pam’s place! She greeted us upon arrival and gave me a tour of the space. Everything is super clean, organized, and labeled. The couch and bed were super comfortable, I slept like a log! Pam’s pups were very friendly to my little guy and he enjoyed the yard. It’s very close to the beach, cute coffee shops, restaurants, and anything else you might need. It was the perfect place for my little getaway and I will 100% be booking again!"
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Pam’s place is super. Great value for what you get. We went there because it was dog friendly. It is so dog friendly. Our boy got to play with other dogs and Pam babysat while we were out - giving us total piece of mind. We will definitely return. This is the kind of place you leaving planning to add Pam to your Christmas card list with pictures of the dog!!
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Staying with Pam was like staying with a friend, she was welcoming to my dog and me, provided a stocked fridge including ice cream after checking on my preferences, the dog yard was clean and fun, I think my dog enjoyed walking around at night and having the motion sensor lights come on. Everything was comfortable and clean , wish I could have stayed longer."
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We just spent 2 nights at Pam's and had a wonderful time. Pam is very friendly, happy to chat and give information but is not intrusive and did not bother us when we needed privacy. The place is very dog (and people!) friendly, and we wished we had found it years ago!
The kitchen was stocked with everything you need for cooking. Beach chairs and equipment looked great, but as we stayed in February, we did not use any of it. Our dog was happy to run around in the fenced yard.
We will be back :)"
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Fantastic host and great space
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Pam was very welcoming and hospitable, even leaving home-baked muffins for my arrival. Her attention to the needs of my dog, monkey were also front and center. Her description of it being a dog-friendly stay were spot on, too. 100% would stay there again!"
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We spent an extraordinary week with Pam. It began with her greeting us (my dogs and me) right when we pulled up. We chatted easily as if we were old friends. She gave me a tour of the unit, described what I needed to know, and then left us be.
The most important thing to know is that Pam’s place feels like home. There are books, pictures, wall hangings. It exudes warmth and comfort, and within an hour, you feel like you’ve lived there forever. I cannot remember a more thoughtful host. There is nothing she has not considered, and everything is right there for you. The fenced backyard was perfect for Samwise and Emily and allowed me to rest assured they were always safe.
Something that hit me that makes this rental stand out from any place I’ve been is the number of lamps! It makes every room, and I mean EVERY ROOM, feel cozy. ( There’s overhead lighting if you want it, but why would you (other than to clean?)
I know we’ll be back because I feel like we made a friend on Cape Cod."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Comfortable and quiet little spot in a very convenient location for getting around the Cape. Pam is lovely and so concerned for her guests’ comfort - the pups and I had a great stay.
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"As owners of 2 labs, we were looking for a place with a nice fenced yard. Pam’s home was perfect. The dogs had a blast. The rental was very clean, comfortable, and it had everything we needed. Pam was a gracious host and very knowledgeable about the area. We’ll be back!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We can't say how Fabulous this place is!!! and How Great Pam is...
Been staying at Airbnb for 11 yrs.. this was the BEST we've ever been too!!!
She thought of EVERYTHING! for US and our DOG!!
DEFINITELY going BACK!!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Our stay at Pam's place exceeded our expectations. The appartment is super clean, cozy and comfortable. Pam has thought of every possible need for visitors and labelled everything so it is easy to find. There were delicious muffins and ice cream waiting for us in the well equipped kitchen when we arrived and Pam then made gluten and dairy free (!) brownies for my husband's birthday. Also the shower has amazing water pressure!
For dogs (and their owners) it is heaven. The fenced backyard is safe and gorgeous and the home has everything you could need for your dog - bowls, toys, towels, crate if needed. There was a little welcome sign with our dog's name and Pam even watched our dog while we spent an afternoon at the beach! Many places describe themselves as ""dog friendly"" but we've never experienced a place that made traveling with a dog feel so relaxing and truly welcoming. Thank you, Pam, for being such a kind, friendly and thoughtful host."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Pam and her husband are truly wonderful airbnb hosts. They make you feel like family staying in a family home yet provide you with the privacy you need. Their fenced in properly, split just for guests dogs, is heavenly. My dog is not lucky enough to have a fenced home property so running off leash in such a beautiful space was a vacation for him as well.
Pam was helpful with information on the local area, flexible to changing needs, provided a great local guide. I generally prefer to rent airbnbs that are not owner occupied but since Pams listing was so dog friendly (and I was brining my young, rather obnoxious, Yorkshire terrier) I reserved. I am so glad I did.
Do not be daunted by the fact Pam has her own dogs or that she pet sits for others. You hardly know they are there. I don’t know what kind of sound proofing they put in but I had was only aware of other dogs if we were outside. Dog lovers, this is the place for you!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We had a wonderful stay with Pam, she is a Super Host! Her suggestions were spot-on from whale watching to lobster rolls. She welcomed us with muffins and local ice cream plus treats for our dog. The extra amenities in her place made it the best bed & breakfast we've stayed at, she thought of everything. We had a great time and hope to go back soon! Thanks, Pam!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Pam is a great hostess and has a beautiful rental and gardens. She has anticipated all your needs and goes above and beyond in household items available. My dog loved the private fenced yard and Pam!
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Pam is the perfect Airbnb Host! Her location is just as described -- perfect for dogs and their people. She put a great deal of thought into the design and layout of the space for visitors, as well as all of the thoughtful extras -- beach pass, beach chairs and towels, dog towels and blankets, complete cooking supplies and ingredients, yummy snacks and coffee, as well as extra toiletries in case you may have forgotten something. The Visitors Bureau should thank her for introducing her guests to local treats like Cape Cod Potato Chips, Beer, and local creamery Ice Cream. Fresh-made muffins and just-picked baby lettuce from her garden made us feel especially welcome. Her large fenced yard is beautiful and a wonderful place for your dog to run and play safely, alone or with her dogs. Best of all, she knows the area well and has great recommendations for beaches, restaurants, and anything you might need. We had a fantastic time visiting her sparkling clean guest apartment!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Pam's airbnb is one of the best I have ever stayed at! She has everything you could possibly need available for you and your dog if you are staying with your pet. The area is beautiful and the backyard is peaceful. The beach pass Pam provided was awesome to use for local beaches. She recommended a ton of great food options and things to do in the area. We loved the blueberry muffins, ice cream, and beer she left us. Our dog Sprout was so happy to be there. We will definitely be back!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I can’t say enough positive things about Pam and her place. If you’re looking for somewhere where you and your dogs are welcome, appreciated, and valued, look no further! Clean, every amenity in the house you can think of (truly, it is fully stocked), and a safe residential area with the beach and town nearby. There’s a full-size dog door as well so your pups can go in and out at their leisure. I can’t recommend Pam’s house enough!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Staying at Pam’s place Memorial Day weekend 2023 was the best experience. Her place is so clean and welcoming and is filled with too many extras to name. Pam and her husband Don were so friendly and welcoming! It is listed as dog friendly but you can’t truly understand how much it is set up for dogs until you stay there. Pam even watched our dramatic cocker spaniel who was protesting being left alone in an unfamiliar environment by barking/howling so that my husband and I could go out. Cannot recommend this place enough - we are already looking for when can visit again!
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"You absolutely have to stay here when visiting Cape Cod. You won’t ever get another host like Pam! Pam and her Airbnb were above and exceeded our expectations from the beginning!
First, she gives you local muffins and local Ice cream! She gives a very thorough tour of the place and EVERYTHING is labeled! She thought of absolutely everything, even the things you may have forgotten. Pam also knows all the great places to eat and see! On top of it all, it’s Dog friendly! Can’t wait to come back!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Pam was such a great host. We enjoyed our stay and so did my pup. Apartment was clean, organized, very dog friendly, and provided lots of accommodations. Would definitely stay there again."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,This was my 1st Airbnb and my 1st vacation with my 2 year old Cavalier King Charles Spaniel. Pam was a wonderful host! She left me blueberry muffins and my favorite mint chocolate chip ice cream. The place was absolutely perfect. I think Finley may have had more fun then me! He could not wait to get outside and see his new doggie friends. Pam even had the same crate he has at home for him to sleep in. Pam gave me so many wonderful suggestions on places to visit and to eat. On the last night Finley hung out with the pup squad so I could go have a nice meal! The place was clean and beautiful . I highly recommend ! I will be going back in the very near future. Laura & Finley
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We had a great time staying here with our 2 dogs! Pam was welcoming, accommodating and just really nice. She even got our favorite ice cream and made us blueberry muffins and the place was stocked with everything a dog could want - toys, bowls, treats, and a dog door out to a beautiful fenced in yard. The bed was super comfy and the shower water pressure was great. We had a busy weekend and Pam was so helpful and flexible. We definitely plan to stay here again. Thanks Pam!!"
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,This is the second time I’ve stayed at Pam’s place and it was just as perfect as the first time.
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Pam is the best host we could have asked for. She asked what things we liked, and then had them at the house for us. Ice cream, muffins and more. Our dog was welcomed with open arms and enjoyed playing with her dogs. When she knew it was our birthday, she made us a special treat to celebrate. We stayed for a month, in anticipation of moving to the cape. I feel like I have made a true friend. Would definitely recommend her!"
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Pam is an amazing generous and gracious host. This was by far one of the best places I’ve booked on Airbnb. It was my dog’s favorite vacation spot by far. Spotless ( one would never know dogs stayed there , completely odorless) , very comfy bed and comfy couches. Couch was large enough and comfortable enough to sleep on. Large fenced in yard was so awesome for my golden retriever. We don’t have a fenced in yard at home yet so she was in heaven. Place was so very well appointed. She thought of virtually anything and everything one might need ( both for people and for dogs). I could go on and on. I ‘ll conclude with don’t look any further. Book now. You won’t regret it. We thank you so much Pam for a lovely stay. Can’t wait to return in the warmer weather."
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Can’t recommend Pam’s place enough. She is an incredible host, with a great listing in Barnstable. Central to everything on the Cape, it was a wonderful base of operations to explore all the Cape has to offer for us and our golden retriever. The listing is clean, accurately described if not even better, and Pam is a gracious, responsive, but not overbearing host. I would not hesitate to book this again and certainly plan to make this a mainstay when we visit Cape Cod."
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,This was the first time that we ever used air b&b and she set our standards to the max! Everything about her place made it feel as if we have been there a million times before. My fiancé was sent to work in the cape for a week. We packed up our everyday life and the dog. The moment we got to Pam’s house it felt like our daily routine hadn’t missed a beat! She had everything anyone and a dog could need for a normal day to day. We can’t thank her enough for that experience!!!
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Pam's place was cozy and really well equipped. Pam was very generous and friendly. It was much bigger than I expected and had lots of interesting things. We really enjoyed staying there.
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We had an absolutely perfect stay here and my corgi, Morty, felt right at home. Pam was thoughtful, caring, and efficient. The space was spotless. We had a bit of a messy check out (personal issues on my end), but she was so kind, patient, and compassionate. I couldn’t recommend this air bnb enough. Thanks Pam. ❤️"
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Wonderful place to stay with you and your pup
Great yard, great space
Pam was wonderful and even checked on our pup while we were at an extended event for us— great hospitality and space had everything you could want
We have local family and will tell all our friends
Book you space with Pam before it fills up!"
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Pam is a most gracious hostess. She really loves her guests and their dogs. If you have dogs that you want to bring to Cape Cod, then Pam is the way to go. The yard is fenced in with everything to keep your pet safe and happy. The living area is cozy with a kitchen and bathroom that has everything you need for your stay. She lives in a neighborhood that is safe enough and spacious enough to walk your dogs safely with little traffic. The bed is very comfortable and the TV room is comfortable with many books and two comfy couches.
Pam herself is the most friendly hostess I ever met. If your pet needs friends on its vacation, her dogs are really friendly also and like to play with other dogs. I really enjoyed my stay."
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Pam is a world class host. Responsive, helpful, so very kind and thoughtful. I highly recommend staying at Pams."
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,We had a great stay! Can't say enough about Pam. She goes above and beyond what's expected. She certainly is a superhost! Teddy and Gracie loved Pam and their stay too!
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Pam was terrific! She made us and our two pups feel welcomed!
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Pam's place was great! Our two dogs had a blast. She had everything we could have needed and more. We are so grateful to her for keeping an eye on our anxious pups so we could go to dinner and around town without worrying about them. Our first trip to Cape Cod was so fun, and we are looking forward to the next time we get to go visit Pam."
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We very much enjoyed meeting Pam and staying at her very comfortable home. The very thoughtful touches she provided, from the fresh flowers and snacks to helpful suggestions and time spent visiting with her and her dogs. Her home is very nicely located and our pup enjoyed meeting and playing with her two friendly dogs. We came home feeling like we have a friend in Barnstable and very much look forward to staying again!"
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We absolutely loved our stay as did our black lab! Pam’s apartment is exactly as described plus much more. It is very clean, has a wonderful outside fenced in backyard, many amenities (I.e beach chairs, towels, beach umbrellas, coolers, toiletries, dog toys and bowls), and some special touches that we have never experienced at any other Airbnb stay (I.e. local ice cream, homemade muffins, and a stocked fridge/snack cabinet).
Pam was incredibly accommodating and wonderful to work with. We are already planning our next stay at this Airbnb in Barnstable!"
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Staying at Pam's was incredible! She saved us so many times. We arrived late at night with a cranky toddler and no food. She provided thermometers for the little one, wine, beer, eggs, bread, all the staples to get through the night. And delicious ice cream and banana bread! The garden was a lovely place to drink tea in the morning and the beach pass and beach supplies really made a nice trip. Thanks so much!"
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Best host ever! Pam was very friendly and attentive. She provided us with ice cream and muffins as a treat. Lovely apartment that was spacious and comfortable. She was absolutely right that our dog would like it. All sorts of thoughtful touches for our dog (treats, food bowl) and us. The kitchen was well stocked with cold and dry food staples that we were not expecting. We definitely will return."
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Pam is an absolute gem. She’s very thoughtful, kind, and very accommodating. The property is beautiful, my golden Bailey loved every single part of it. I can’t think of a better place to come with your dog! Pam has thought of everything, including beach essentials, little things you may forget to bring, and more importantly, catering to dog visitors. Very clean and has a cozy home feel. I will definitely be back for another stay."
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Thank you Pam for the role you played in our 10 day stay in Cape Cod! When we return to the Cape we plan on booking with you! You have a lovely, comfortable place with beautiful gardens to escape in!! Being able to enjoy a vacation with the dogs meant the world to Susan, myself, Molly + Peanut !!"
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,We enjoyed everything about our stay! Our two dogs especially loved the fantastic yard. Pam had everything we needed and more with dog treats and people treats including ice cream and gluten free muffins! If you love traveling with your dogs Pam’s place is perfect.

2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,I wish I could give Pam's place 10 stars! She was an amazing hostess. there was not an amenity forgotten! there was even a drawer in the bathroom If you accidentally forgot something at home. very dog friendly place. it's all about the dogs here. the fenced in yard has beautiful garden beds and lots of places for pups to sniff and explore. We had a brief power outage in the morning of our check out and she bought us breakfast to make up for the inconveniences. 10/10 will definitely stay here again!!!
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Pam is a wonderful and congenial host. We had a great time - the property was absolutely beautiful - just as stated and more! Pam really has thought of everything and the space has all the amenities. Pam is full of knowledge and a great resource for things to do/see in the area .

2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Pam is a great host, very helpful and accommodating. Our dog loved the fenced in yard, treats, and toys. Pam made great recommendations on dog friendly places as well as restaurants in the area. We’ll definitely be coming back."
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Pam is a wonderful host. She greeted me with open arms and welcomed my dogs into her beautiful airbnb. The location couldn't have been any better as I wanted to drive around the Cape. The unit was equipped with everything I needed...and more! Pam had snacks, ice cream, and banana bread waiting for me upon arrival.
My two dogs had the best time running around and playing fetch in the backyard. Pam and I took her dogs + my dogs for walks every morning which was a fun way to start each day. I would highly recommend staying at Pam's place. I couldn't have asked for a better experience. Thank you, Pam! Can't wait for next time."
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Our Host: Pam was absolutely wonderful and so welcoming. She was so sweet with our Great Dane and even had a welcome sign just for her. Pam has thought of everything you could need while traveling and provided it. She greeted us with fresh muffins, ice cream, snacks, and beer. We felt as though we were staying at a luxury hotel inside of a loved one's home.
The place: The apartment was spacious at the same time. The bed was comfy and the pillows were fluffy. The bathroom was fully stocked with anything you might have forgotten at home. Our dog was able to play outside in the beautiful backyard while we made coffee. The living room was a nice place to sit with said coffee and read or watch TV.
Overall, Pam is awesome, this place is incredible and we will definitely be back!"
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"5 stars isn’t enough!!! Pam is a lovely, gracious host who thought of everything to make our stay perfect! We’ve been to MANY Airbnb’s and this one is by far the best. Not once will you say, “I wish the house had…” because it does! The dogs are treated like family and so were we. The apartment was the perfect size for 2 adults and 2 dogs. The yard is fully fenced in with beautiful plantings and the patio is a perfect spot to start your day with plenty of morning sun. Location is convenient to beaches, the ferry, downtown, dog parks, and trails. You’ll love it here!"
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"A beautifully appointed, seashore themed home complete with everything you and your dog could possibly need or want. Pam is a gracious and cordial hostess."

Everything looked and felt very clean. My dogs were at ease here, and so was I!"
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Incredible spot for dog parents. We had a blast! Thanks, Pam!"
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Couldn't ask for a better host or a better experience! I surprised my husband with a visit to Pam's because he grew up vacationing in Cape Cod, but it was my first time and our little 6-month old pup's first vacation out by the sea! All three of us absolutely loved it. Especially if you're someone who wants to explore all that the Cape has to offer (even during the off-season), Pam's place is a central location which makes driving to both East & West ends super convenient. We were so pleasantly surprised by both the nice weather and the access to authentic Cape restaurants, including The Impudent Oyster in Chatham and Lobster Trap in Bourne (which you MUST. MUST. MUST try if you like lobster rolls). As for the place itself, we were big fans of the interior design, from the marine and ocean color scheme to the bird-themed items around the house, with dog treats (and human treats, aka local ice cream and beers) to boot! Definitely coming back :)"
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Pam is an amazing host and her place is thoughtfully put together for dogs. The apartment is cozy and clean and has everything you need, from a fully stocked kitchen to snacks to freshly made muffins from Pam! It was a real delight to stay here with my dog and I would recommend it to anyone."
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"I'm not sure what we can say that hasn't been said already. The property is great and Pam really cares about making your stay perfect. The little touches make it a 5+ star in our opinion, and our pup would give it 10 stars if we let her. Great getaway for city people with a dog who wants a backyard!"
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Pam is the BEST host! Her Airbnb is heaven for dogs and humans alike. It is so cozy, amazingly well-stocked, and private yet accessible and close to tons of local attractions. The bed is extremely comfortable, the kitchen and bathroom both have everything you could possibly need. We were even able to cook ourselves a lobster dinner! Pam is great and gave us tons of recommendations for things to see and do. She even provided homemade muffins, local ice cream, and lots of great snacks. We cannot wait to return. :)"
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Pam's apartment is perfect for a Cape getaway with my dog. The apartment is roomy, yet cozy. The kitchen was nice, big and really well stocked complete with snacks and other cooking necessities such as spices, oil, coffee and filters. Lots of well thought out necessities for my dog too. It was the perfect spot for a writing retreat with my dog with easy access to local beaches and going out in Hyannis."
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Great communication. Pam made us and our dog feel so welcome. Great fenced in yard.
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Perfect everything. Our pups loved how free they were in this cozy home. The unit was very clean, cozy and comfortable. Everything was provided for by Pam. Pam is the perfect Airbnb host. All Airbnb hosts should take notes from her :)"
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"When Pam says your dog will love it here, she means it! Pam was very welcoming and a great host. 10 out of 10 from me, and Rosa (my dog) gives it a 4 paws up and a tail wag! The place was clean, the backyard was perfect for Rosa to play and she settled in really quick."
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"I’d give 6 stars if I could. Pam is the ultimate host. Her place was immaculate and in a gorgeous location in a very private and quiet area.
Anything you could possibly need was provided including an arrival gift of home made muffins and local ice cream in my favorite flavor. Pam was there if needed but provided complete privacy for our stay. Pam is very pet friendly and has everything you could need for your pet including treats. Her place is very comfortable and clean. Amenities included the Kcups, creamer, sugar, a couple local beers, soda, jam…. It goes on and on."
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"This beachy oasis was perfect as a cozy Cape getaway! Not only did we feel at home, but our pooches did too! Our hostess was so gracious and put the finishing touches on a great stay!!! Highly HIGHLY recommend!!!!"
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Pam is an outstanding host. She provided us with sugar-free ice cream, and baked sugar-free muffins for us. The apartment is set up for everyone's comfort. The fenced garden is great for the dogs to safely run around in. The location is convenient to get to beaches, great restaurants, and most of the what the cape has to offer. It was our first vacation with the dogs, and it couldn't have been easier to take them along with us."
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Where do I begin?
The space was absolutely incredible in every way. Everything you could need/want for a nice getaway. If you have pets this is the perfect place for you. Our little guy had friends to play with and the entire yard is fenced in.
I have absolutely noting negative to say about Pam's incredible hospitality or the rental.
We booked for a week and were ready to enjoy our week's vacation, but mother nature had different plans and blessed us with a Nor-easter. We ended up losing power and Pam and her husband sprung into action and supplied power via their generator and we were able to adapt and overcome. She did everything in her power to make the stay memorable, even with the storm looming over us.
We will surely come back soon..."
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Pam is amazing and everything was perfect! She goes out of her way to make you feel welcome and at home during your stay!
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Pam is an amazing host and her place is perfect! It has everything you could ever need (including delicious banana bread that she made and ice cream). Our dog loved the backyard and playing with Pam’s dogs, and he can’t wait to visit Pam and her dogs again. Thank you for your wonderful hospitality Pam, and we look forward to staying at your place again!"
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Pam is a wonderful host with a beautiful garden and private oasis.
Her dog guests are pampered as much as her human ones. Great location for visiting the entire Cape. Highly recommended."
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Pam is a super great HOST.
we enjoyed very much every single minute we stayed at her place.
our little dog loved the private fenced backyard and he got to play with Pam's dogs too.
Pam's place is in a dead-end street so it's very quiet and has a very relaxing atmosphere , her Garden is very beautiful. I took advantage the BBQ grill .
Pam's Banana Nut cake is to die for. And she welcomed us with locally made Ice Cream.
The kitchen is complete and it has everything you will ever need.
The bedroom is very cozy, the bathroom is ample and clean.
The Dining room is perfect size and the living room has a really good selection of books.
within a 5 minutes drive from Pam's Place there are many stores available, so you can just head out to town, buy your groceries and bring them in to the kitchen .which is fully stocked with everything and anything you'll need to prepare your own meals.
Also don't forget to check out Hathaway's Pond, there are 2 doggie parks (large and small dogs), fully fenced.
Hyannis is a short drive away and the whale watching Boat is also a few minutes away.
this is my first time in Massachusetts, but I can't wait to come back again.
I highly recommend Pam's place if you have a furry friend, he/she will appreciate it very much."
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"All the other reviews are spot on. This place is fabulous and so is the host! Super cute, nicely decorated, with everything you could need plus more."
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had an amazing stay with our dog!! Pam is the most gracious hostess! She had muffins and ice cream from a local creamery ready for us at check-in, which was such a nice treat!! There was everything we needed like beach chairs and towels, beach pass to the local beaches, and coolers. She also had a cute welcome sign for our dog and had all these toys and treats for him. It was so sweet!! Our dog loved playing in the backyard that’s bigger than ours at home. Pam is also the nicest person, so friendly and kind. I cannot say enough good things about our stay especially since it’s so hard to find a dog friendly rental. We’ll definitely be back when we’re in the area!"
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Pam is more than a Super Host. In the many Airbnb’s that we have stayed in, none have been so we’ll provisioned. Pam has thought of everything that you could possibly need, from a full complement of spices and condiments in the well equipped kitchen to soaps, lotions, shampoos, etc in the bathroom. This is a very dog friendly place and our dog Marley was very comfortable in a fully fenced & beautiful yard which also has a comfortable patio with a Weber grill, comfortable seating, etc. Pam is a very friendly & warm person, easy to converse with. The ice cream and home baked banana nut bread were an added bonus along with a refrigerator with soft drinks beer, juices, eggs & much more. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!"
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Wow! What a great place to stay. Pam thought of everything to make your stay superb! We can’t wait to visit again and we would definitely recommend Pam’s place.
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a wonderful time staying at Pam and Don’s apartment in Barnstable! They went above and beyond and greeted us with delicious ice cream from a Cape Cod creamery, incredible homemade banana nut bread, and a couple of cans of Cape Cod beer. Our dog also had an awesome stay and loved playing with their dogs and going in/out the doggie door, playing with the toys and in the incredible fenced in yard. The location is in a quiet neighborhood and about 15 minutes from Hyannis. Pam recommended a delicious seafood restaurant Spanky’s (dog friendly) with outdoor covered seating. We also went to the Black Cat which is also dog friendly and has a really cool back section with a bar that serves drinks, appetizers, and dinner. We were so fortunate that we found out that the Cape Cod baseball league was playing in town and it was an easy walk and we were able to catch the end of the game. Thanks again Pam & Don for the wonderful hospitality and making it so special for our dog!!"
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"With our first vacation in over a year, we weren't sure what to expect. This space felt personal, cosy, and truly accommodating. The yard is fantastic, Pam had any and everything we needed, including beach chairs and ice packs, and she was super friendly and very helpful. Her recommendations led to some great adventures! To top it all off, Pam had everything we needed to make our dog feel like part of the gang. We'll certainly stay here again."
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had the pleasure of staying in Pam’s awesome place with our dog, Walter, last week. Her attention to detail is unmatched…ensuring that your stay is comfortable, easy, and homey…even when traveling with your dog! We kept joking that this trip was really for Walter, and staying here made it the truth. Not only are humans needs met (especially with ice cream, and freshly baked delicious muffins!!), but your pup’s needs are also met, right down to the Welcome sign above the food dishes. The landscaping in her yard is gorgeous as well, definitely an inspiration if you love to garden yourself! Fresh, gorgeous little tussie mussies were placed in different rooms as well. I couldn’t stop looking at them! We look forward to being able to come stay with Pam again! Thanks for everything!!! ♥️"
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Pam is amazing and her place is gorgeous. It’s located very close to shops, beaches, and food, and has a lovely outdoor space. She helped our little Poppy come out of her shell. We had a great time and plan on returning soon!"
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Pam is one of the warmest hosts I've ever had and I highly recommend her place to anyone visiting the Cape with a dog. Pam offered to watch our dog on multiple days if we were going out to eat or somewhere that might not be dog-friendly. The fenced-in backyard was great for our dog and we enjoyed a lot of time sitting in the yard watching her run around. Location-wise, it's very central for driving around the cape and close to some very nice beaches. It's hard to beat going from the beach to an incredibly green backyard in 15 minutes. Inside felt like home and we had everything we needed - cooking supplies, extra toiletries, internet, streaming services. Pam even had local beer and ice cream waiting for us when we arrived, plus home-baked banana bread. It's obvious that she's put a lot of thought and time into making guests' stays as comfortable as possible and I would go back again in a heartbeat."
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"You can expect spacious, clean, well-stocked amenities in this space. Pam is incredibly kind and respectful, her dogs are the sweetest and this space is perfect for any summer trip to the Cape. We are so grateful to have found this space and certainly hope to return soon."
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Pam's place is a God Send! She was so welcoming and accommodating to us and our fur baby, Riley, who got the chance to visit with and make some new furry and human friends :D Everything was clean, so lovely, and it truly is catered to the furry friends. She had a basket of toys to welcome him when we walked in and water in the water dish. Even though the weather was crappy all weekend (Memorial Day), it kept the holiday travelers away so it wasn't all bad. Her gardens are simply lovely and we get an excuse to come see it in full bloom later in the year. to enjoy them in full bloom! The amenities were very well stocked, right down to the room fans so I don't have to bring my own next time. I highly recommend Pam's place when you are in the Cape. We will definitely go back!"
2021-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Pam’s place was perfect for a weekend trip! Great location and she was so helpful with local suggestions. The huge fenced in backyard was a big plus for traveling with our dog. We will definitely visit again!

We especially enjoyed meeting her dogs. I would highly recommend staying with Pam as she is a great host."
2021-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The true definition of a superstar host with a perfect place! I cannot recommend this place enough for those with dogs. The home is sparkling clean filled with amenities and attention to detail. The location is perfect for all the best things Cape Cod has to offer. A short drive anywhere. Our dogs didn't want to leave and loved the fenced yard.
2021-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Pam's place was a wonderful escape. Our dog, Mazie, did indeed love it and so did we. Pam was an incredible host, with lots of great advice on local activities and restaurants. She was also very helpful when I had an unexpected injury the first day."
2021-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Pam’s place was just amazing. Easy to find, quiet and safe neighborhood, good location with lots of restaurants nearby, great sized fenced-in yard, etc. It was extremely clean, despite the fact that it’s a (very) dog friendly place! We enjoyed having convos with Pam and seeing our dog play with her dogs. Pam and Don went above and beyond to make sure we had all we needed. The kitchen is well stocked and every cabinet was even labeled! We hope to be back again!!"
2021-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Perfect for 1-2 ppl and their dog(s). The set-up is just like an in-law suite with the host, Pam, next door in the main house. Its a great location with plenty of privacy, a lovely neighborhood yet close to beach (about a mile) and restaurants, Whole Foods, shops, etc. I stayed with my sister and new dog for a weekend in early March and our only complaint is that we couldn't stay longer. A a host, Pam is a gem. 100% responsive, easy-going, and has thought of everything and you will find her thoughtful little touches throughout the place. The piece de resistance is, of course, the amazing back yard and deck accessed by your private entrance. You and your dog(s) will LOVE it. We stayed in March so I can only imagine how beautiful and colorful it is in summer with all the flowers. We will visit again for sure and highly recommend Pam's place."
2021-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,If you want a host who is kind and thoughtful then stay at this Airbnb! It’s perfect for dogs but also people too! It’s a perfect location. Everything was so homey and comfortable. We loved it and look forward to returning!!
2021-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Honestly when Pam says your dog will love it here and you will too— she means it!! From a personalized welcome for my corgi Harry, to treats and toys for him, snacks and personalized local ice cream for us, we sure felt at home. Harry loved playing with her dogs and felt like it was his own personal dog park, the next morning he already knew to wait by the fence for his new best friend Julie to play fetch with. Pam told us local beaches and trails to check out & she did not disappoint! This apartment was so clean, fully stocked with cooking supplies and spices, the tv had everything we could ask for, and the water pressure was amazing. Pam was so sweet, great to chat with, and made sure everything was taken care of, including shoveling after a big storm so we could safely walk to our car. I can understand why people in the guest book have already stayed here 5 times because Harry and I will absolutely be coming back!!"
2021-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is one of the best AirBnb stays that I've ever had! The apartment is super clean, cozy and well-stocked. If you need or forgot anything, I'm sure you will find it in the apartment. It was perfect for the long weekend getaway needed to recharge and to visit family. Pam goes above and beyond with her hospitality and genuine kindness. If you need anything, she is there to help. The muffins were amazing! She also had sorbet and orange juice for me. We had a snow storm and they took the time to help me clean off my car! If you have, pups they will love it too! I absolutely loved my stay and will be back again soon!"
2021-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I can't overstate how wonderful our stay was at Pam's place. She accommodated a later than usual check in and check out with no problems and welcomed us in the apartment with homemade banana bread, fresh cut flowers, local beer and ice cream, and all the spices/utensils/toiletries/books/etc. that I would have in my own house. We really felt right at home from day one. While there we got to know her dogs who were every bit as joyful and welcoming as Pam was. Her backyard was perfect for our Luna who barely ever wanted to come inside! I can't recommend this place highly enough, though I secretly don't want anyone else to find out about it so I can keep coming back :)"
2021-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"If you have and/or love dogs, this is a little piece of mid-cape heaven. Pam keeps a perfect place with everything that you could want or need and if by chance there's something missing she will take care of you (Thanks for the lobster crackers and picks, Pam). A quiet, private neighborhood and a short distance to Barnstable center make for great walks and our dog had a ball playing with Pam's. The place is cozy and comfortable and the little touches like flowers and snacks (and ice cream!) made us feel welcome and relaxed. An unexpected treat: The excellent water pressure made for great showers. I highly recommend Pam's place. You won't be disappointed."
2020-12-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"If you are looking for a stay in Cape Cod for you and your dog(s) and are the type of traveler who saves different possible matches and then weighs lists of pros and cons, I can save you a lot of time/effort – book Pam’s place!
My two small dogs and I stayed for about 3 ½ weeks beginning on Thanksgiving Day. We could not have felt more at home. After I mentioned Christmas presents in an email (thereby verifying I celebrate the holiday), Pam decorated the inside of the apt for our arrival, planted a Christmas tree right outside the front door and decorated the yard. So thoughtful and brought cheer to a challenging year/holiday season.
The amenities Pam provides are amazing – not only was everything we could possibly need provided but in many cases, there were different varieties of the thing I needed!
The apartment is in a lovely, wooded neighborhood perfect for long walks with pooches and the charming downtown of Barnstable with cafes, a market and a small beach is a manageable walk or quick drive away. Plus, all the shopping, restaurants, sites of Hyannis are only a few miles away and the rest of the Cape is easily accessible.
The dogs were sad to leave – they enjoyed the big fenced in yard, playing with the resident dogs and the attention Pam gave them.
We will absolutely be back!"
2020-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great apartment and host! We loved the ice cream Pam provided and fully stocked kitchen. Our pup enjoyed the doggie door and yard.
2020-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Our stay at Pam's place was spectacular!! She made our little pup feel at home, which is no small feat since she is a nervous rescue dog! We humans also had a fabulous time and we greatly enjoyed all the nice amenities and special touches to make us feel like we were on vacation. Thanks for a great stay! We will be back :)"
2020-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Pam is an outstanding host! Check in was seem-less! Property is quiet and well maintained. A separate fenced in area with all the amenities for a pup! She even got us ice cream, local beer, and a banana bread!!! Thank you so much! 11/10! You won’t regret this retreat!"
2020-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a lovely stay in Barnstable at Pam's! The apartment is comfortable and has a nice homey atmosphere. Pam takes care to add some very nice special touches that made us feel welcome. I loved the fresh flowers so much! Our pup, Sadie loved using the doggy door and playing in the fenced in yard. She also appreciated the basket of toys and even some cookies by the door! Very sweet and thoughtful! The apartment is super clean and the location is perfect for a stay on the cape! We hope to visit again!"
2020-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This will be one of your favorite stays and Pam is an amazing hostess. She goes out of her way to make you feel welcome with so many amenities. Our dog truly loved the fenced in yard to run around and the doggie door. We’ll be back again sometime for sure!
2020-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Pam’s place was awesome! So many little touches, including ice cream on arrival and sparkling waters in the fridge. Made our dogs feel super at home too with a very large back yard and dog door that they loved. It was an excellent stay!"
2020-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Pam has everything you need and more. We had everything we needed for our 5 night stay and it was nice to not have to pack things like beach chairs, towels and coolers. Crosby loved the fenced in back yard and doggie door. He was so sad to come home. We will be back for sure!"
2020-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Dog heaven! The place is spotless, has everything you need or you forget to bring. Pam is an amazing host. She provides you all the little extras you don't get at a hotel. Highly recommend if you want to get away and wanna bring the dog with you!!"
2020-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was the best AirBnB experience we’ve ever had. Pams place is great but Pam makes it even better. From the ice cream to the local tips - just the best!
The place is roomy and completely SPOTLESS
Location is perfect - 2 minutes to Barnstable Village and less than 10 to Hyannis shops and restaurants.
Can’t wait to return. (Next time with our dog!)"
2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Pam was right - our dog Ollie loved her place and we did too! The location was perfect for the activities we had planned. Right in the middle of the Cape with easy access to golf, great restaurants and visiting close friends. We drove up to P-Town, Truro and Wellfleet for shopping, wine tasting and a drive-in movie.
The apartment was filled with conveniences like Keurig coffee, creamer, filtered water, snacks and plenty of toys for Ollie. He even had his own water and food bowl set up when we arrived.
Her yard is so pretty and you can tell immediately that she takes pride in her space. It’s completely fenced in and includes two different seating areas to use to sit and watch the birds. I saw many species of including blue jays and even a hummingbird outside of the kitchen window. The yard was very peacefully and the surroundings are private and quiet.
We are looking forward to booking with her again. A must for all dog owners!"
2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The reviews are true! This place is amazing. Pam is so kind and watched our dog a few times when we couldn’t take him somewhere. The location is calm, peaceful and central so it’s easy to explore the whole cape. We decided to do a whale watch in the harbor nearby and would definitely recommend! Overall we are grateful for having had such a nice, relaxing trip in the middle of this crazy year. Highly recommend."
2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Pam’s place is great! We really enjoy our stay and it was just what we needed. It truly is a haven for dog lovers and anything you could possible need is taken care of. As other have said, Pam really goes above and beyond. There was even local ice cream and homemade bread waiting when we arrived!"
2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Expect warm greetings, a homey feel, beautiful landscaping and backyard, and if you forgot to pack anything, don't worry- Pam has almost every amenity that you can think of-wow! And, of course, meeting her sweet pups!"
2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was one of the best and one of our most favorite Airbnb experiences. Pam is one of the most incredible hosts. She has truly thought of everything - beach chairs and umbrellas, beach towels, coolers, ice packs, snacks, drinks, beer from the local brewery, coffee. It feels like a home away from home and she had thought of everything we could possible need for a vacation/beach weekend. I have never had such a well prepared Airbnb. Pam goes above and beyond in every way. She also gave us some great food recommendations, places we would have never found on our own. The beach pass is also a huge benefit and Pam gave us her favorite beach recommendation - which was a beautiful beach! She even called the morning we were going to let us know that there was a line for entry to the beach which was really helpful!
Pam also goes above and beyond for all doggies. The Airbnb is completely dog friendly - she had extra blankets, doggie bowls, and the most amazing yard for out little beagle. The fenced in yard is perfect, even for small dogs -all the little openings are closed off so even little dogs are safe - I am always worry about my little guy, and didn't have to worry about anything here! And, the doggie door is perfect. That being said, it's an amazing place even if you don't have a dog with you - the place is completely clean and can't tell another pets have been there (our beagle didn't even notice that another dig had visited before us). It's just the most lovely experience all around for a Cape Cod getaway.
Long story short, this place is great and Pam is the best host! The location is great - super clean, and the yard is amazing. It has everything you could ever need. We can't wait to visit again! It was a perfect long weekend."
2020-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Pam is an amazing person!! We really enjoyed our trip and stay at Pam’s place !! She’s a dog person for sure!! Pam goes out of her way to make sure you have everything you need for a great trip and beach days. She’s super kind and sweet and we loved her dogs !! The dog door was a blessing and our dogs had a blast! Would highly recommend her place !!
2020-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Pam takes extra care in making sure that guests have a beautiful private yard space to enjoy flowers, birds, and peace and quiet in the company of her dogs. I don’t have a dog right now, however her friendly loving dogs were wonderful companions during my time there. Comfortable quiet space."
2020-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We had a great stay at Pam’s place!Pam is SO thoughtful and went out of her way to get us beer and ice cream, homemade muffins, and she even left me a dessert for my birthday (whoopie pie- delicious!!) We didn’t bring our dog but if you travel with yours this is the place to stay. Our daughter loved playing with the dogs in the yard. It was spacious and super clean and the bed is really comfortable too. Would stay again."
2020-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Best AirBNB experience I've ever had. Best combination of host and facilities I've experienced.
Pam's place is quiet, clean, well-located, private, and spacious. Her dogs are so fun; the place caters nicely to dogs, and this was fine even though I didn't have my own. There are ample things to do and places to eat within a 15 minute drive (the full kitchen helps, too), and walking around the neighborhood is calm and easy.
Pam is amazing. She went out of her way to make me feel cared for as not just a visitor but as a person. She got me my favorite ice cream before I arrived, gave me a lantern with batteries (didn't need it!) just in case in a storm, and provided the best trip planning and restaurant recommendations. Her kindness and generosity were infinitely appreciated and will not be forgotten.
I'm already looking forward to the next time I'm able to stay at her place, which I hope will be sooner rather than later."
2020-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"From the strawberry ice cream in the freezer and banana bread on the counter when I arrived, to the love and care Pam showed for my little dog, my stay in Barnstable was refreshing, reviving and totally relaxing. Pam also stocks basic kitchen supplies that are a cut above: Cape Cod potato chips, organic half-and-half, fresh orange juice, as well as ample amounts of food wrap and food storage containers. The apartment is laid out better than my place back in Boston! Pam also gave me impeccable directions to the nearest entry point for the Cape Cod Rail Trail and I had a fabulous day on my bike. Truly, the best BnB experience I've ever had!"
2020-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Pam is a wonderful host! My dog and I had a wonderful time on our Winter Weekend in the getaway. I had plans to run the Hyannis Half Marathon and needed a dog friendly place to stay.
Pam had the perfect apartment downstairs. Private entrance and a big fenced in yard for my pup to run around free. Close to restaurants and shops.... Grocery store.
My dog who is typically anxious really felt at home here.
Pam asked me if I wanted to walk her lovely neighborhood with her and her dogs. So we did! It was really nice!
I would definitely stay again. Enjoy!"
2020-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"There are ""dog friendly"" places and then there is Pam's place. This was more a vacation for our dog than for us. Pam has so many thoughtful touches that we've decided we'll never be staying anywhere else when we're with our pup.
For human amenities, Pam's place is so well stocked and well thought out. Snacks, fresh Cape Cod-made ice cream, homemade banana nut bread (amazing) and some local brewed beers in the fridge....seriously, could not have been any more pleased.
We feel like we've known Pam for years and are eagerly looking forward to getting back there as soon as possible. Beat AirBNB we've ever been at. Our dog agreed."
2019-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This home is perfect - very clean, large fenced in yard for the dogs, hostess is very kind and generous. We couldn’t ask for more."

2019-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"As we'd stayed with Pam before, there were no surprises. She's really sweet and laid back. I typically don't feel uncomfortable around people but even hubby said he appreciated her welcoming disposition. We really hated that we had to dash back to reality to early Friday. Thanks so much Pam!🤗"
2019-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Pam's place has everything to make your stay comfortable and homey. She even includes phone chargers for Apple and Andriod! Your dog will love the space and so won't you.
2019-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Our stay on the Cape with Pam was perfect. Our dog loved it there and having the opportunity to play with other dogs. It was comfortable, a great location, and extremely affordable considering all of the extra touches that Pam provides. She truly goes above and beyond as a host and having the apartment well stocked with extra things you might need. We'd happily stay there again."
2019-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Very warm and inviting person extending the same compliments to the apartment. Outstanding hospitality including a delicious homemade breakfast treat and local homemade ice cream. While I was at work all day, Pam took the time to care for and include my little pooch through the day, making this a vacation for him for sure. Thanks again Pam, and anyone able to snag your place is very lucky!"
2019-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is a home away from home. Pam is the ultimate host who goes above and beyond for her guests---human and furry.

Although we didn't cook during our stay, the kitchen was very equipped and had everything we needed. Plenty of goodies were also provided by our hosts. Pam was very helpful in suggesting places to go...whether it be for dining or for fun activities. We will definitely revisit with our pups.

2019-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very nice apartment with plenty of room for comfortable stay with pet
2019-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Pam sets the bar for Airbnb hosts! Her hospitality was fantastic-from a welcome sign for our dog to delicious homemade banana bread and local ice cream and an apartment stocked with all of the necessities for a beach vacation. The space was very comfortable and clean and we loved having a fenced in yard for our dog and a quiet neighborhood for his morning and evening walks. The inclusion of a resident beach pass was key and we were able to enjoy numerous beaches in the area. Location was very convenient for day trips to Martha's Vineyard and the outer Cape. If you are traveling with your dog to the Cape, Pam's place is a must-book."
2019-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We are so thankful that we found Pam's dog-friendly rental that allowed us to explore the cape with our pups and have such a relaxing weekend! Pam and Don are such amazing hosts. It was fun to get to know them. There were lots of little treats that they left for us and the dogs to make our stay even better! We hope to come back again soon for a longer stay to further explore the surrounding area and relax in the tranquil and beautifully landscaped backyard. Having access to a beach parking pass was an unexpected plus!
2019-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great place in a great location! Pam is an amazing host and her apartment is even more amazing! My one regret was not staying longer. However, we are already planning our next trip!"
2019-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Pam and Don were wonderful hosts! They added so many nice and thoughtful touches to our stay from fresh flowers to delicious local ice cream and homemade banana bread. They took amazing care of our dog Bailey while we explored the cape and even updated us with photos of her. The apartment was very cozy and had everything we could have needed. We even used the grill on the back patio! The local beach we visited was beautiful and super easy to access with the pass that Pam gave us to use. I would highly recommend staying here. Thank you again for everything!
2019-07-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Pam and Don are the most wonderful, thoughtful, accommodating and helpful hosts! We were immediately relieved after meeting them, their dogs and touring our “home” for the week! Our dog was warmly welcomed and we loved all the special touches for him including a sweet welcome sign with his name above immaculately cleaned dog bowls, treats and toys for him to use. Their home is very clean and comfortable with everything you need during your vacation, literally. Don’t worry if you forgot to pack something because most likely Pam thought of it and has it ready for you to use. Pam stocks the kitchen with lots of yummy treats including a delicious homemade banana bread and your favorite ice cream from Smitty’s! Our dog absolutely loved the beautifully landscaped fenced in yard that he had hours of fun playing in with their dogs. We fully enjoyed our vacation and would love to return!"

There were a ton of dog toys/treats, as well as plenty of treats for us too! We were welcomed with fresh baked banana bread, ice cream in the freezer, and the fridge stocked. The house is in a great location, not far from Hyannis and great local restaurants. Pam had every thing we could have needed and more. We couldn't have asked for a better place to stay."
2019-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,OMG. Where do I begin? Pam is by far the most genuinely warm hostess. She is a wealth of knowledge for all the best spots on the Cape. Especially Spanky’s The home is immaculate and you’re fur baby will have a blast! Our Bailey did! We can’t wait to go back next year!
2019-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We could not have asked for more! Pam is a considerate and attentive host. Her apartment is better appointed than any hotel and most homes. She thought of everything! Restaurant recommendations were terrific! Her yard and garden are beautiful and the fresh flowers throughout the apartment were such a cheerful touch.

Her home is located on a quiet road away from the noise of the big roads but close enough for easy access."

I was attending a training for work and Pam checked in On my dog while I was gone. I would definitely return."
2019-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Pam’s place was AMAZING. It exceeded our expectations by far. This was by far the best air b n b we have stayed at all thanks to Pam. Pam was extremely welcoming. She made me a birthday cake, had fresh fruit and morning glory muffins ready upon our arrival. The living area was super clean and welcoming to our fur baby. The living area was very well decorated, including nice amenities for our dog- water and food bowl, welcome sign, treats, doggy door and huge fenced in yard with option to play with other dogs. Pam was there to answer any questions we had, offer suggestions of where to go and what to do, but also gave us space and relaxation. She even offered to watch our fur baby or let her out if need be while we were away. The living area was puppy proofed and easily accessible for our large dog. We had more than enough towels, the shower was filled with necessities as well as the cabinets in case we forgot anything.
Our expectations were definitely exceeded. We will definitely be back soon!
Thanks Pam for everything!"
2019-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a great time here with our puppy. Pam is such a thoughtful host, and we appreciated all the special touches, including local ice cream and home made muffins. Our dog also loved playing with Pam’s dogs outside. Thanks for everything!"

2018-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Absolutely welcoming, extremely dog-friendly and delightfully cozy place!
It is truly made to experience with a dog: there are friendly pooches living in the host’s house, there is a fenced garden accessible via dog door, and there are food bowls prepared for your pup.
Pam provides many tips on the neighborhood, and the Cape Cod, and it was a pleasure to talk to her."

2018-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We LOVED IT! This was our 1st time staying at any Airbnb.com place and Pam 's Place has set the bar very high! She has thought of EVERYTHING! And I mean EVERYTHING. I don't pack light I want to have everything I could ever need with me. So much that I bring standard with me Pam supplied. She has fans in the closet (for those of us that need them to sleep or hate steamy bathrooms). 2 pillows for each person, dog treats, and toiletry item you might forget or need, snacks, home made ice cream and I just had to get her banana bread recipe. You could show up with your toothbrush & a change of clothes and not want for a thing. She checked on my dog (who loved her) while we went to Nantucket for the day. She text offering to turn lights on for us so we didn't have to come back to a dark place. I just can't say enough about Pam & her place we love her. Oh and her dogs are so sweet...and the yard is beautiful. The very best part of the vacation was sitting in the chairs in the photo with my morning coffee. I miss it already & hope I can make it back soon."
2018-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Pam’s place is everything you could need for a stay away from home. She was unbelievably accommodating and helpful to us. She has thought of everything possible you may need in the house from toiletries to an Amazon fire stick to watch TV. We explored Provincetown for the day and were able to relax as Pam was gracious enough to let our pup out to play with the dogs throughout the day. Our dog loved her stay, especially her new fur friends she met and the doggie door to go out and explore every morning. The location is convenient to anything you may want to do (shopping, food, beach) and there are plenty of recommendations from past guests and Pam. She made for a very stress free stay. And she was so nice to get the most AMAZING ice cream I’ve ever had! (Get s’mores if you can) as well as making delicious muffins. (I need the recipe!) We highly recommend you and your dog stay with Pam."

2018-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Highly recommend staying at Pam's -especially if you enjoy traveling with your dogs! The space is warm and inviting, and so dog friendly. Pam has a beautiful, fully fenced-in backyard for your dogs to enjoy, as well as a lovely patio area. There is even a doggy door for dogs to come and go as they please. Pam is a wonderful host, and even had cookies and homemade ice cream waiting for us when we arrived! We would definitely stay with her again!"
2018-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Dog lovers: this is the place you have been waiting for. For years I have been seeking a place as welcoming as this for my dog. Dogs can be our families and it is was so heartening to have Evie welcomed so warmly and completely. The large fenced backyard and chance to play with other dogs was outstanding. The first floor apartment is very comfortable and the small touches go a long way: homemade icecream, muffins, and cookies, a supply of beverages and snacks, and an abundance of materials on all the activities the Cape has to offer. Pam is also very knowledgeable about the Cape and her suggestions were very useful to a first-time visitor. The gardens are such a beautiful setting that the first night it was great just to sit on the patio and eat-in. If you are looking for a place to stay that is quiet and exceedingly dog-friendly, this is it. Your canine companion(s) will thank you."
2018-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Pam was a wonderful host. She made us feel very comfortable and welcomed. Would highly recommend to anyone staying in the area, especially if you are traveling with your dog. Excellent service, good location, short drive to many great restaurants and beaches. The house is very cozy, and you feel very safe staying there."
2018-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We had a fabulous stay at Pam’s Air BNB. She is an absolute gem! Our entire trip was 100% what we had expected from the reviews. From the personal touches to her willingness to take care of our pups so we could stay at the beach a little longer or spend more time with extended family, this was the perfect place for our growing family. Even though we had to leave a day early (teething 9 month old), we enjoyed every minute of our stay and would recommend Pam’s place to anyone looking to get away and not have to worry about who is going to take care of the pups. Our four legged friends, Stella and Ryder, hope all of their friends will go and visit Pam! Thank you so much Pam, we truly had an amazing time! <3"
2018-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Pam’s hospitality and thoughtful actions were above and beyond our expectations. She pulled together a vegan meal for us when we arrived later than expected and didn’t have time to go out shopping (bc we had a tired 1 year old). She watched and cared for our dog as if it were her own when we were out all day visiting Nantucket. And she provided great advice and tips that helped enhance our experience. We highly recommend staying at Pam’s place. You won’t regret it.
2018-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place to vacation with your fur babies! Pam is a gracious host who thinks of everything you may need and more. Beautiful accommodations inside and out. All the comforts of home. Hope to return sometime soon!
2018-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"A fantastic place to stay on Cape Cod, especially with your dog!"
2018-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"If you’re looking for a clean, quiet, enjoyable place to stay with your pup(s) then we highly recommend staying at Pam’s! She thinks of everything you could possibly need from the ice cream and baked goodies to the closet of beach supplies, nothing is missed. She makes you feel right at home and your pup(s) will love the beautiful backyard and play time with her pups as well!"
2018-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Pam goes far beyond what anyone could expect. She has everything you could possibly need or want and goes above and beyond to make your stay relaxing, enjoyable and comfortable. Our two pooches were in great hands and none of us wanted to leave. This Airbnb is a gem!!
A+++++++"
2018-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I can't say enough nice things about our stay at Pam's place! My husband and I drove from New York City with our two dogs for his birthday and truly had the best stay. Our dogs loved the beautiful backyard and playing with Pam's dogs. She left us delicious snacks and drinks, plus was even sweet enough to bake a cake for his birthday! When she heard we were cooking in one night, she brought us fresh picked greens from her garden. Everything is super comfortable and clean, plus it's in a great location. We spent the day at the beach (with Pam's beach pass) and she offered to check on our dogs so we wouldn't have to cut our day short. We'll for sure be back!"
2018-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Pam truly knows the meaning of “super host”. Her place is so homey and was a great place for my husband and I to stay with our dog. Pam welcomed us with open arms, had many treats for us and our dog Bentley. everything was wonderful and the location was central to many awesome places on cape cod. We will definitely being returning!"
2018-05-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Amazing spot, your dog or just you will enjoy this fantastic retreat. It's cozy, clean and has a warm cottage feel. Pam truly is a sweet and loving host providing lovely cookies and delicious ice cream, a few beers in the fridge and a stocked bathroom. Location is perfect, close to everything. Our dog loved it and felt comfortable. Great host and great place !"
2018-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"A welcoming haven for dogs and their owners. Pam thinks of everything. Lovely garden and patio, water bowls already filled, coffeemaker ready to go, a breakfast nook with tourist pamphlets to peruse, ice cream in the freezer and muffins on the counter. Also a fenced in yard that the dogs loved. Best of all is Pam who is so helpful and accommodating."
2018-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a very relaxing weekend at Pam’s place. Our dog, Bella, doubly enjoyed playing with Pam’s dogs in the giant backyard. The apartment is spacious, has all the required amenities plus extra touches that make you feel at home. My wife and I grilled, enjoyed the sun and watched the dogs play. The perfect weekend getaway. Will definitely be visiting again in the future."
2018-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Out of the dozens of Airbnb’s I’ve visited across the globe, Pam has to be one of the best hosts - no doubt about it. My girlfriend, dog, and I had such a wonderful time staying at Pam’s! Hers is the most dog-friendly Airbnb we have ever visited. She is such a wonderful, kind and accommodating host. I mentioned to Pam that I have Celiac Disease (a food allergy) and she was very sweet in making sure that I had some gluten-free chocolate muffins as a welcome when we arrived. She also provides us with tons of local food like Cape Cod chips and local ice creams. She made us feel very at-home, plus, her airbnb is very cute and spacious. Highly recommend to anyone visiting Cape Cod!"
2018-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The minute we got to Pam's, we felt at home. From her warm welcome after our long drive from New York City to the chalkboard sign she hung up at the apartment welcoming our pup Oogie, and the yummy chunky cookies she handed us at departure. The apartment is lovely and well decorated in a cozy nautical theme. It was also well equipped with everything we and our pup needed, and Pam even made sure to stock the fridge with our favorite drinks, yogurt, and local ice cream. She went the extra mile baking us delicious Passover friendly goodies (!!) after we told her we were observing the holiday. The location in charming Barnstable is great, and we loved coming ""home"" every day after exploring. It was rainy and off-season when we came, so we were able to relax and turn on the grill outside the apartment to make a fresh meal. Our Oogie began every morning at playtime with Pam's sweet dogs in his very own backyard and had the time of his life. Pam was even so kind in offering to check in on him when we went out for a bit and gave him so much love (and his dinner!). Truly an above and beyond stay. Highly recommended."
2018-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had the best time staying at Pam’s again over Presidents’ Day weekend! Our dog, hachi, has so much fun playing with her pup friends, too! Great stay and can’t wait to go back."
2018-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"My family enjoyed ourselves very very much during our stay at Pam’s! She is an amazing host and we felt like we had known her forever - her thoughtful touches were above and beyond. It was heaven for our pooch, and dog lovers, alike. Thank you for creating such a wonderful home-away-from-home for our little family! We cannot wait to come back and make a tradition out of our stays."
2017-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"You will not find a better place to stay on the Cape! Pam has thought of everything. If you've forgotten something, no worries, you'll find it in Pam's apartment. She leaves awesome goodies and loads the fridge with drinks. The apartment is very nicely decorated, comfortable, and caters to dogs of all sizes!"
2017-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Pam’s place is award winning for its warmth, cleanliness, extra touches, gifts of ice cream and cookies and her love for her dogs. I’m sure her babies are thinking they have the best human in the world. And I agree. Pam went over and beyond to make me feel safe and to see that I had a great time. The landscape is great and the flowers are beautiful. Pam loves her city and she is able to help others love it as well. Thanks for the experience."
2017-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Pam's cottage apartment was perfect in every way especially if you are traveling with your furry babies. Upon our arrival Pam greeted us with a smile and gave us a nice tour of the immaculate cottage. There was a basket of flyers for local attractions and another with local menus. The doggie door and large fenced in backyard allowed my wife and I to venture out for an evening on the Cape without having to worry about our dogs being confined in an unfamiliar place. Pam attended to every detail from fresh flowers, homemade muffins, local treats, beach chairs, beach blankets even special blankets and towels for the dogs. This is not the average Air B&B experience. We will definitely be back."
2017-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Pam's apartment is a wonderful way to enjoy your time in Cape Cod and Pam is perhaps the finest AirBnB host we've ever had the pleasure of staying with.
First the apartment, it was ideal for us with every little amenity anticipated and made available. As dog owners/travelers Pam's apartment was just ideally suited for us. Her yard is big and completely fenced in and she has a doggie door too so the pups can come and go as they wish. The apartment was above and beyond with little amenities which just put a smile on our faces. Also, dog owner/travelers you can take comfort in knowing that Pam's neighborhood is really nice for dog walks. Lots of little options and friendly neighbors everywhere
The location is pretty good too for a visit to the Cape. Barnstable is centrally located and Pams apartment is minutes from 6A. Also, she is only minutes away from all of Hyannis' shopping and necessities.
We've already decided that when we choose to come back to Cape Cod we'll look to stay with Pam.
Cheers"
2017-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"From the day we booked our tripe Pam was so responsive and welcoming and so were here pups. Our pup had an amazing time and was definitely tired after three days of play time.
Pam supplies us with dog treated, local ice cream, local cookies and homemade bread. As well as many other beverages and snacks too!
We had the entire place to ourselves, our own entrance and our pup had a big backyard to play around and run and the choice to play with the other pups or not!
If anyone is looking to take a trip to the cape with their pup this is THE place to go! There’s even a dog door so your pup can come and go as he pleases.
Highly recommend and we will be back!"
2017-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The apartment and fenced in yard at Pam's home is so lovely and inviting, for both the humans and their dogs!! Pam goes out of her way to welcome her guests, from her yummy homemade banana bread to the local ice cream and cookies she has waiting, and all the essentials anyone could ask for!!! She also cared for our dog Charlie while we were at a wedding!!! Best Airbnb I have stayed at, and I hope to return again soon!!!"
2017-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Pam is the Best! A warm and generous host. An absolutely wonderful place for our 16 year old cockapoo! He can come and go as he likes into a beautiful and safe backyard. - And an amazing place for us. Pam supplies us with so much - food including baked goods, ice cream and so much more and she is particularly thoughtful and friendly.
We enjoyed every minute of our stay and would not hesitate to come back. We recommend this Airbnb to All."
2017-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We chose this airbnb because it was dog friendly and there were so many positive reviews. We are very happy to add yet another one because we had a wonderful stay! Pam is THE best host and goes way above and beyond by providing a cozy apartment, well stocked kitchen including drinks, snacks, cookies, ice cream, and home baked muffins (she even surprised us with a cake for our anniversary!) We enjoyed exploring the entire Cape from one end to the other with our wheaten terrier Wiley. But we actuall got the most enjoyment out of just hanging with Pam and her dog pack in the backyard. They were all endlessly entertaining! We have already recommended her place to others and we definitely plan to be back again."
2017-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Where to begin? We normally stay in detached Airbnbs or ones where the owner is not present because we like privacy. We had plenty of privacy staying at Pam's apartment but also had the most wonderful, attentive host we could ever have imagined. Getting there and in was perfectly easy. The space is big and wonderfully decorated. Pam provides literally everything you could possibly need for an amazing Cape Cod vacation. The ice cream, cookies and homemade muffins were incredible. The beach (pass was provided by Pam) was private to residents and perfect and beautiful. The location is central to everything on the Cape. Pam's dogs are the best we've ever played with! Our little Sophie the Frenchie made the best friends of her life and wants to go back and stay with Pam and her puppies asap."
2017-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Pam was a lovely hostess, with a perfect spot for your pet! She included very thoughtful touches, such as beach chairs, sunscreen, and local muffins & ice cream. Great location for a day trip to Nantucket. We'll certainly be back."
2017-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Pam is a wonderful and warm, friendly host. Her super comfy dog-friendly AirBnB could not have been better. We had a wonderful time and Pam provided everything we could have possibly needed including wonderfully delicious muffins, cookies, ice cream and doggie treats and a variety of drinks and other treats. Just wonderful. Would highly recommend to any dog loving person or couple. Rudy our differently-abled 3-legged Malti-Poo just loved it."
2017-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Pam's place was exactly as described - a perfect getaway for dog-lovers. Her backyard is beautiful, fenced in, and great for dogs and their owners to relax in. Pam welcomed us with our favorite ice creams, local kayak cookies, and delicious homemade banana bread, a refrigerator and pantry stocked with drinks and snacks, and tips on some of her favorite spots. She watched our dogs while we were away so we never had to worry about them being lonely. We can't wait to visit again!"
2017-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We enjoyed a relaxing Cape Cod getaway at Pam's place with our two dogs. It's a very convenient location in a quiet residential neighborhood, a mile-ish walk to a few restaurants, a delicious ice cream place, coffee shop, beach, and the Hyannis whale watch (a must do!). The highlights of the stay were the special treats and items provided by Pam---local ice cream, Cape cod beer, snacks for the beach, homemade muffins and bread, cookies, dog treats, and everything in the beach closet (chairs, towels, umbrellas, coolers). The convenience of being able to travel with our dogs was the other major pro---they loved running in and out of the dog door all day and meeting new friends when Pam brought her pups or visiting pups by for playtime. Pam went above and beyond to make our stay a relaxing one and we highly recommend her place to others!"
2017-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Pam is usually in the house, so any questions you have (where to eat, how to get to the local store, etc.) are answered instantly. Her dogs are very friendly, and if you are a dog lover, you and your dog(s) are going to have the best time."
2017-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Nice, very clean. Kitchen loaded with snacks and amenities. Quiet neighborhood and friendly dogs"
2017-08-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"We couldn't have asked for a better AirBnB experience. Pam is an incredibly kind and generous host, and she made our stay so enjoyable. The apartment has everything you could possibly need and Pam showered us with goodies (ice cream, cookies, delicious, homemade muffins, the list goes on). She also gave us some great recommendations for things to do and places to eat in the area. Best of all, Pam is a true dog lover and was so wonderful to our active pup, who loved roaming around her fenced yard (with a gorgeous garden) and playing with her dogs. If you're traveling with your dog, this is the place for you. Pam was even nice enough to take care of our dog and let him out when we were out sightseeing. We can't recommend Pam and her lovely place highly enough!"
2017-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay! Pam's hospitality is unmatched. She made sure that we and our dogs felt right at home. We enjoyed relaxing on the patio and watching our dogs play in the yard. Pam's meticulously cared-for gardens were beautiful. What a variety of flowers! We also enjoyed having the beach pass which gave us the flexibility to enjoy the local beaches several times for a few hours at a time without feeling obligated to stay longer than we wanted to make the parking fee worth it. The neighborhood is peaceful and secluded but so close to everything. We were pleasantly surprised how central the Barnstable area is. It seemed like everything was a quick and easy drive away. And it was nice to check in on the dogs because it never seemed out of the way. Pam also gave us several ideas on where to go and where to eat. For breakfast, look no further than Spoon and Seed. We went there almost every day. Dowses Beach was beautiful. Cape Cod Beer was super close and fun. There's a local Marylou's Coffee to get the day started with a delicious jolt. We can 100% recommend Pam's place and we will definitely return! Thanks Pam!!"
2017-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"By far my best experience at the Cape and it was all thanks to our wonderful accommodations and amazing host!
Our pup,Bear, was in heaven and there were plenty of things for the fam to do. We especially enjoyed our whale watch which was 5 minutes from our apartment. I would definitely recommend this location!!"
2017-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"A hidden Gem on the cape. We just returned from a weekend at Pam's with our dog and the stay couldn't have been more special. The apartment is spacious, beautifully appointed and extremely comfortable. The fenced yard is a delightful respite for both you and your dog. Pam goes out of her way to make you feel welcome. The kitchen is stocked with everything you could ever want (coffee, tea, juice, yogurt, snacks, ice cream, homemade muffins and cookies) and Pam provides beach chairs, beach towels and beach passes. Our dog got anxious about the July 4th fireworks and Pam spent the evening hanging with our dog to comfort him when we couldn't be there. If you are traveling with your dog to the cape, there is no place else to stay. We are looking forward to booking our next stay with Pam and her dogs."
2017-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"SHORT REVIEW:
Excellent!
LONG TMI REVIEW:
On the drive up to Barnstable, my little Chloe had a sudden medical emergency. Unfortunately, after spending hours at the vet's office, she did not survive. Pam was exceptionally compassionate, offering to let me cancel the stay with no penalty. Since I was 20 minutes from her place and 3+ hours from home, I thought the safest and best thing to do in the situation was to stay anyway.
Pam's airbnb is absolutely the best place I've stayed, for many reasons, the first being for how gentle and sweet she was with me showing up completely traumatized by my dog's sudden death.
The apartment is so clean -- no animal smells, no fur anywhere.
It was wonderful to have snacks on hand -- fresh fruit, muffins, cookies, and ice cream. I'm not typically a beer drinker, but I really appreciated the Cape Cod Beer in the fridge. The apartment is well-stocked with pretty much anything you could want -- beach chairs and towels, shampoo and conditioner, bug spray...you name it. That one thing you forgot to pack is probably there.
Although it might not be ""walking distance"" for most people, you can walk to at least one of the town beaches from there. I appreciated being able to experience Cape Cod in a less touristy way, and every suggestion Pam provided about beaches to visit or other things to see was on target. On the way home I stopped off at Spoon & Seed, one of Pam's recommendations, and had one of the best meals ever.
I know my dog would have loved this place, with the large fenced in yard (check out the new cute lawn ornament), treats and fresh water waiting on arrival, and company of other well-behaved and well-loved dogs. I completely plan on returning someday."
2017-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Pam and her apartment were absolutely amazing! Check-in was super easy as she greeted us when we pulled up. She gave us a tour of her immaculate apartment, which was stocked with fresh towels, blankets, and food. Everything was so comfortable, it really felt like home. Pam even went above and beyond by baking my husband a cake for his 30th birthday (which was why we were there in the first place). Having a beautiful, fenced-in yard was also perfect for our dog, Lemon. She constantly had other furry companions to play with (and I'm certain she wanted to stay there). I couldn't recommend staying here enough."
2024-06-01,5.0,Group trip,Erick’s house was great! Everything was newly updated and there was more than enough space for the five of us. Would definitely stay here again!

2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We had an enjoyable time. The home was comfortable for our group of 4 adults, 2 kids, and 2 dogs.
The home was clean and well stocked with household items such as dishes, cutlery, linens, etc."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"It was a good spot for multiple families for a long weekend. While you're not in the middle of the action in this more residential spot, you're fairly centrally located to multiple towns if you're hoping to explore different areas of the Cape. We had more than enough room for babies, dogs, and everything else including room to roam in the fenced in yard. Midori was very communicative throughout. There were some small unexpected issues with the HVAC and plumbing but they were quickly resolved."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place! It is super cozy and decorated so well!
2023-05-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,"The house was in a very nice quiet neighborhood and close to Hyannis, Barnstable and other attractions."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We were traveling with our baby, the grandparents and a mini golden doodle. The house is very true to the pictures. Spacious, beautifully decorated and well stocked. We enjoyed our stay and hope to stay there again next time we visit cape cod."
2023-05-01,5.0,Group trip,this place was beautiful!! perfect for me and my dating we loved it and hope to book again for a trip in the summer!!
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We had a wonderful 3 night stay .. place was very clean, quiet and spacious for 4 adults, 3 kids and 2 dogs. The only con I would say is the backyard definitely needs some sprucing up. Overall, we had a great time and will book with Midori on the cape in the future."
2023-04-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"Wonderful house but a bit older so the creaks and noises from the heater can wake you up if you are not used to it. House was clean and we really appreciate the amenities provided -- shampoo, conditioner, body wash, laundry detergent, soap, dish soap, dishwasher detergent. The house was quite but there was a few times that the lock on the front door would beep in the middle of the night as if someone was trying to come in which woke us up. The house was very comfortable for our family of 5 and plenty of room for us and our three children ages 3, 8, and 13. Thanks!"
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We had a wonderful time staying the weekend at Midori’s home. They were very responsive, and their home had everything we needed. Our dog loved the fenced in backyard and we loved the dual living rooms and overall space of the home. What you see is what you get and we thought it was perfect!! We would definitely stay here again. Thank you for having us!"
2023-03-01,5.0,Group trip,"my friends and i stayed at midori's for my birthday and this home really brought us all together to have fun and enjoy ourselves to the fullest. everything was clean and organized, and they sent me clear instructions about check in and check out. i would definitely recommend staying here if you want some peace and quiet."
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great house. Very clean and exactly what we expected.
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We had a great, relaxing week at Midori's home. We had four adults, one baby and two dogs for our visit and we were all very comfortable. The fenced in yard was great for the dogs to run around. There was also a pack-and-play and high chair for the baby to use."
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This home was perfect for our stay! This home is clean, well equipped, beds are comfortable and historic is very responsive. Highly recommend! Everything was perfect!"
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,My husband and I stayed at Midori’s place with our 6 month old and 2 dogs and everyone loved it! We had originally booked for just a long weekend but we were enjoying ourselves so much we ended up staying for a full week - Midori was extremely accommodating and responsive. The house was very clean and cozy and the fenced in backyard was perfect for our dogs to be able to run around. Overall I highly recommend Midori’s place and would happily return!
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"Midori's house was excellent. It's was spacious, clean, quiet, and comfortable. This would be a fantastic rental for two families or 2-3 couples given the two eating areas and two living rooms. The bedrooms were also spacious and had plenty of storage for luggage and clothes.
I appreciated the shampoo, conditioner, and body wash in both bathrooms and the plethora of dish soap and laundry detergent-this is a detail most homeowners overlook (in my experience) and it makes a big difference if you're staying for a long time period.
I was here for two weeks to help my dad. The home was large for one person, but I rented it due to the proximity to my dad's place. Convenient enough location for tourists too-you are a short drive to Craigville and Hyannis. Being near route 28 also means you are central to the main road to Falmouth and Woods Hole.
Definitely would rent again. Midori is one of the nicest and most responsive hosts I've had."
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Great place to stay and great host to deal with
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Was perfect for what we needed! I’d rent it again!
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Extremely well-appointed home in an idyllic neighborhood. The neighbors that we saw while walking our dog were all super-friendly. The house itself is beautiful with some really interesting and eclectic decor. It's bigger than it shows in the pictures with tons of room for a large gathering. The home wasn't as clean as we'd have liked - maybe there wasn't enough turnaround time between us and the previous guests.
Midori was extremely responsive despite the fact that she was travelling abroad. Check-in was a breeze and she was gracious enough to extend our check-out time. Overall, a great family vacation fully of home cooked meals and tons of board games."
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,It was a great experience for us. The place was clean and everything was as advertised.
2022-12-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,"If you need space to spread out, this is the house for you…an extra large family room, two dining areas, two seating areas both with ultra large TV’s. Very comfortable. The new owners have been doing a good job of renovating and granite counter tops and freshened bathrooms are a nice touch. Midori was very responsive to email questions. We rented this house for Christmas week and were very happy here especially with all the open space! We would rent this house again."
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Midori’s house was amazing! I stayed here with my 2 girlfriends and our dogs for a stay- cation and it couldn’t have been more perfect. Lots of space for the dogs to play in the fenced in yard and plenty of space to spread out. Everything was clean and comfortable
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We stayed at Midori's Airbnb while we were waiting to close on our new home in a nearby town. While moving is stressful and we were in between homes, staying here provided a bit of calm. The home was exactly as pictured. All the furnishings were very comfortable. We had plenty of room to work and relax. Our dogs loved running around in the fenced in yard! I would certainly recommend this home to others!"
2022-11-01,5.0,Group trip,Beautiful home great host.

2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This house is a beautiful place to stay! It was clean and we loved all of the personal touches in decor! I found myself taking pictures all over the home. Adrian and Midori are very kind hosts and communication was easy and prompt. The beds are very comfortable and the TVs are huge. It is a quiet street and very relaxing getaway.

2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Property is spacious and very clean
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"This home was wonderful - one of the best Airbnbs we’ve stayed on the Cape. It was well-stocked, comfortable, and convenient to beaches. It’s a lot larger than the pictures depict and the fenced-in yard was a huge bonus. I would definitely recommend!"
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"This was a fantastic place to stay. Very clean, comfortable and quiet! Midori was very quick to respond to any need and question. Will definitely be returning next year!!"
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Wonderful spot beautiful house
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Midori’s place was exactly as described and great. The house was very spacious and we really appreciated their accommodation for us bringing our dog. The rooms are large and great for groups but were also great for just the two of us. The internet is very fast as well. We would recommend staying here for anyone and would happily stay again if given the opportunity. Thanks!
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We had a nice end of the summer stay at Midori's house. We loved the fun beach and nature decor, the place feels very homey. Midori is an awesome hostess with excellent communication! We especially appreciated the beach chairs, umbrella, and towels which came in very handy."
2022-08-01,5.0,Group trip,"Great accommodations! We appreciated the extra shampoo conditioner and body wash in the shower, along with the grilling utensils. We had a great time at the home while enjoying a nice bbq. House decor was also very cute 😊 thank you Midori!"
2022-08-01,5.0,Group trip,Our family had a lovey stay here. It’s located in a quiet neighborhood and the home is really cute inside. There was the perfect amount of space for our family of 8. Adrian and Midori had beach chairs and towels that made for a perfect beach day.
2022-08-01,5.0,Group trip,"It was a really nice place for our weekend getaway. It was clean and the second open living room we truly enjoyed just staying in. We utilized the firepit, grill and played games in the backyard. Overall, we had a great time. And, the host was quick with our questions and it's close to Hyannis to catch ferry to Nantucket or Martha's Vineyard."
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The house is quiet and beautifully located. It is beautifully submitted and decorated with a lot of love for detail. Everything you need is available.
Please note that the reservation and check-in were hassle-free. We needed some help to adjust the air. Again, the help/response came super fast
The house is recommended to pick up case, we had a few nice days there."
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,We enjoyed our stay and would book again in the future. Our host provided recommendations and was quick to respond to my messages. We had a pleasant vacation.
2022-08-01,5.0,Group trip,"My family and I loved the bnb's open, spacious layout. We had a teen watching an F1 race in one living room, and a 2 year old dancing to Barney videos in the other. The location of the bnb is great, close to several beaches and cool dining options. The bedrooms/bathrooms were very clean, and the whole living area was really comfortable and choicefully decorated. We wish we could have stayed longer! The communication was quick and always helpful. Honestly, I wouldn't change a thing."
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We booked this last minute and it was perfect. House was clean and communication with Midori was excellent.
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We would book with them again. We enjoyed our stay. The house was clean, spacious, and consistent with the details disclosed in the posting."
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"The house was clean, well-maintained, and spacious. The decorations were cute and beachy. My favorite room was the second living room attached to the house. We spent most of our time in that room. Both TV’s were huge. Some nice touches that were included in the house were the yard games, seafood sets for cracking shellfish, and beach gear (umbrella, folding chairs, and beach towels). The host offered to reimburse us for some firewood if we bought any, but we ended up just using the branches in the yard. The bedrooms are close together so noise does travel a bit. Sound from the kitchen also travels into the bedrooms. I would recommend bringing ear plugs if you are a light sleeper. Beds were comfortable, but I wasn’t a huge fan of the soft pillows and material of the comforter. That’s more of a personal preference though. The location was perfect for us because we had cars. We visited two beaches. I preferred Sandy Neck beach, which was closer to the Airbnb, dog-friendly, and had calm, clear, light blue water almost as if we were in the Caribbean. The Airbnb was a 45 min drive to the more popular beaches along the “elephant’s trunk.” We went to Nauset Beach and Chatham for one of the days. Nauset Beach was packed, not dog-friendly, and had bigger waves, colder water. Definitely visit some oyster farms and buy some oysters to shuck while you’re there. All in all, this was a wonderful stay and I would definitely recommend it."
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We stayed at this property for a week and it was great. The home was well decorated, clean and very comfortable for our party of 8. The home is well stocked with linens etc. as well as beach towels, beach chairs, toys for the kids. We enjoyed our evenings around the firepit in the backyard and early morning breakfasts on the patio.
It was our first stay at the cape and Midori had great recommendations for our family. Beaches are very accessible. We will definitely come back to this property next time we are on the cape!!!
Thank you for a great experience..."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was a wonderfully peaceful home and looked exactly as it did in the pictures. It was very centrally located to everything the Centerville and Hyannis areas have to offer. Lauren was an excellent host! If you are looking for a quiet home in a safe, beautiful neighborhood in this area, do yourself a favor and book!"
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Lauren's house was amazing it looked just like the picture. I would definitely want to come back it was beautiful our Christmas was amazing. She was available anytime. It was an easy check in we had no issues all around it was great my dog had a good time and it was awesome. The neighborhood great.
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,I unfortunately couldn’t make the trip bc I had COVID for the first time. I sent the rest of the family in my absence. They knew nothing about the house as I handled the rental. They were so pleased by how easy it was to get in and how comfy and clean the house was. I called ahead and asked if they could arrive early so they could rest b4 our families big Thanksgiving feast in the next town. Our host made everything seamless and responded immediately. I was thrilled how everyone loved the house and had a delightful experience. We will be renting it again. Thanks so much!!
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,We had a lovely stay at Lauren’s place. Beautiful kitchen and living room. Very well equipped.
2023-10-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Lauren’s place is a lovely home and comfortable stay. She responded quickly. Though, it needs more attention to detail on the cleaning."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"BEST AIRBNB EVER!!!!! This location is even better than the pictures and descriptions. Lauren was a dream to work with. She went above and beyond to make our stay absolutely perfect. And she's thought of absolutely everything. From the moment you pull into the driveway you know it is going to be special. The inside is beautifully decorated, the beds are so comfortable, and Lauren has anticipated all her guests' needs. The welcome basket of wine, beverages, and snacks was so welcomed after a long, exhausting day of travelling. And what a surprise to find all the needed items for coffee, tea, breakfast, etc. It is all the little touches that make Lauren's place so special. Bikes, kayaks, extra toothbrushes, other toiletries you may have forgotten, First Aid items, games magazines, and the list goes on. And this doesn't even begin to touch on how cute the surrounding area is. We were sad to leave and can't wait to return. Cannot recommend this AirBnB highly enough."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"1st time as an air B&B er, couldn’t be happier with the house and neighborhood."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Lauren's home is a great base for exploring the cape. We were welcomed to Lauren's home with wine and treats which was such a nice surprise. The cottage itself has everything you need to feel at home. Comfy beds, a great shower, fully stocked kitchen and even kayaks and bikes to borrow.
We loved eating around the table at night and watching a family movie on the rainy evenings.
There are plenty of boardgames and it's a 5 min walk to the lake if you want to kayak.
it's about an hour to Provincetown and 20 mins to other spectacular beaches.
would definitely recommend as a base for families wishing to explore the cape!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,My girlfriend and I had a wonderful stay at Laurens's place. The house itself is cute and is in a quiet neighborhood not far from local activities. It was great to have the bikes and private community beach nearby as well. Lauren was very communicative and went above and beyond to ensure that we were well accommodated. We would definitely stay again and so should you!
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a great stay at Lauren’s place! Lauren was very friendly and responsive, and even left us snacks for our stay, which was a nice surprise. The place was perfect for our needs. We would stay again!"

We made countless memories and look forward to returning in the future!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Mary's place is wonderful. It's a great home base for exploring Cape Cod. The space is comfortable with thoughtful amenities. Mary was proactive in her communication.

2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Truly beautiful. I could live here. I wish I could have stayed longer but it was already booked.

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We would highly recommend this place! It was exactly as you see in the photos.

We felt supported and cared for the whole time, and quickly thought of the space as a home. There were great suggestions for things to do nearby, and a great presentation of privacy and respect. The trip was so comfortable and fun and full of great memories -- and it wouldn't have been possible if the place was lacking!!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,My fiancé and I stayed at Mary's wonderful home for a short vacation in the Cape. Mary made us feel right at home with a welcome sign as well as a cheese board and some wine. Mary also provided us with a light breakfast which was waiting for us in the room. The room was clean and cozy. Mary made check in easy by providing us all the details a week before our stay. Mary also left a booklet which described things to do around the area as well as restaurant recommendations. We greatly enjoyed our stay and will be coming back for our next vacation!
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Mary is a most efficient communicator & an exemplary host. Her place was exactly as described and I was delighted to find the ""live"" version of her place better than the description & photos! The space is quite new and fresh.
She asked for our preference in snacks and saw to it that it was in place; all unnecessarily and incredibly generous! The wine and cheese platter; a really nice touch, was a saviour to my wife and I who were forced to check in late w/o dinner. I highly recommend this listing!!!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Mary’s place was absolutely perfect for our stay at the Cape. Not only did the space feel private but it was also very homey and had ample space. We were able to take advantage of the surrounding trails and it was conveniently located to everything we wanted to do including Provincetown and Martha’s Vineyard. The small touches made us feel welcomed and made the stay that much better. Can’t recommend Mary’s place enough
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Mary was unbelievably kind! The place was beautiful, clean, quiet, and the perfect distance from all of the CCBL ball fields (the main purpose for our trip!). Not only did she provide lots of personal amenities, but she also provided a cute cheese platter, wine, and a personalized welcome sign. She was very quick to respond to all messages and was even kind enough to let us move our reservation dates when a personal event changed our travel plans. I can’t say enough positive things about Mary and our stay! Thank you Mary!!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I was blown away by our stay at Mary’s. Not only was everything very clean and in excellent condition, it was so cute! Pictures definitely did not do it justice. She definitely went above and beyond with the hospitality, was very communicative and so thoughtful in every single aspect. From the homemade scones to the cheese board to the beautiful soaps she left in the bathroom and the guide to what’s in the area, everything was meticulously thought out, organized and beautiful. The house is tucked away but a beautiful cape cod getaway for two which is exactly what we were in search of. We have already been talking about coming back to the cape and of course staying with Mary."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Mary’s place was more than we expected! The location was perfect for us to explore the Cape. We had our privacy while feeling so welcomed and at home!

2023-06-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"I echo all the wonderful things everyone else has said about Mary and her home! It is impeccably kempt, great amenities, peaceful and spacious!
Only thing to caution is you will hear talking and some pots and pans from the door at the bottom of the steps inside the space as it is connected to their home, but besides that all went swell!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is a lovely, quiet space with some extra amenities: I arrived after a long drive to find a cheese and fruit platter, scones, and other yummy food in and around the fridge. The bed was very comfortable and the place is beautifully appointed. I like when the host or hostess does nothing more than answer my emails, and otherwise leaves me to myself. They and their neighborhood are blissfully quiet and unintrusive."
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Our stay here was wonderful! My husband and I came here for our honeymoon and it was a perfect little getaway. The room was just the right size for the two of us and we were met with wonderful hospitality. We can’t wait to come back!
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Such a great space! My husband and I stayed for two nights and felt right at home. Very clean and comfortable space. Mary is super kind and left us some goodies to enjoy during our stay. Highly recommend her space!
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Mary goes the longest distance to be the perfect hostess! She includes so many little details throughout the space. You will instantly feel welcome. Enjoy the charcuterie plate, homemade scones, and wine. The house is perfectly quiet. The room is very spacious, the bathroom is fresh and lovely, the little kitchen quite adequate. The king Bed is comfortable, and well dressed!"
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Mary’s place was so cozy and very clean. Also located in a quiet neighborhood which was nice. When we arrived Mary had a wonderful cheese plate and a bottle of wine for us.
We were there attending our best friends wedding so we didn’t get the chance to spend as much time in her place as we would have liked. But next time we’re up on the Cape visiting, we will stay there again for sure."
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Highly recommend Mary's place. It was beautiful, immaculate and relaxing. All of the little extras make a huge difference after being on the road. She had drinks and food on hand ready and waiting. Mary is truly a superhost--5 stars without an ounce of hesitation!"

2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We highly recommend this B&B. It is in a quiet neigborhood, yet conveniently close to Hyannis and other popular Cape Cod locales. The room was impeccably clean and Mary provided such nice touches such as fresh cut flowers on the table, a welcoming cheese platter with wine, scones and other breakfast items. The decor is top shelf and Mary was very accessible to answer questions. Do not hesitate to book this B&B."
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"A clean and comfortable studio alert environment. Nice touches included a cooler and folding chairs for the beach, filtered water pitcher, and coffee maker.
The host went out of her way to welcome us with a delicious selection of fruit cheese, crackers, and a nice bottle of wine. One of us is on a vegan diet and she included some nice non-dairy cheese, yogurt, and cream for the coffee. I would definitely stay again the next time I’m in the area!"
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My husband and I stayed here for three nights for a quick honeymoon getaway. The space is very calm, clean and classy. We slept very well on the bed. My husband has a broken back, and he thought the king mattress at Mary’s was better than the one we have at home! We even checked to see what the brand was in case we decide to get one. The location is great if you are looking for a getaway that avoids the tourist crowds. We loved that we could run down the road for gas, pizza, ice cream and anything else we needed without sitting in traffic. Sandwich is only a 20 minute drive away, and we really enjoyed spending time at the canal, fishing. We wanted privacy, and this place was perfect for that."
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Highly recommended. Mary’s guest suite is a wonderful place to stay while enjoying all the cape has to offer. Her personal touches and welcoming atmosphere made our stay perfect for what we were looking for.

2022-08-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Mary's place was one of the cleanest AirBnB I've stayed in. Amazing king sized bed and lovely linens. Snacks and wine for our first night.
The lock was a little sticky and we had to wiggle it to unlock it every time. This was a lovely place to come back to at the end of a long day, but was not close enough to our excursions to ""swing by"" for a change of clothes."
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Truly great place to stay! It’s comfortable, homey, and clean. Very comfortable king bed, sitting area, dining table, and kitchenette. Great little coffee bar with provided k-cups and scones! Mary and Tom left us complimentary wine and a cheese plate at check in. It’s very conveniently located with a grocery store less than 10 minutes away. Hoping we’ll be able to make another trip back and stay again!"
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The perfect apartment! Spacious, welcoming, tastefully decorated, intimate and very clean. Everything we needed was available.

2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The studio apartment was perfect for our Cape Cod getaway. It was a great location in Cape Cod complete with beach chairs we were able to use.

The studio is fresh and modern and decorated like a cute beach house. We will definitely stay here again if we are back in Cape Cod.

If I could give more than 5 stars, I WOULD."

2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Looking for a place to go with your loved one on the Cape?! This is the perfect place! Start with the wine and cheese and enjoy a immaculately clean and comfy space. Cook your own breakfast, stay cool with the central AC, and enjoy the quiet neighborhood. Plan adventures and day trips from a great central spot. Great communication with Mary (but lots of privacy), stylish space, great memories. No complaints, all complements! We wanted to stay forever but will have to settle for repeat trips to this spot. Book it ;)"
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My boyfriend and I had an absolute blast. Mary and Tom’s place was exactly as pictured. It was so welcoming with a sign with our names on it. As well as wine and a plate with cheese, fruits and chocolate and other goodies; it was a lovely touch! Mary was very quick responding when I messaged. We definitely look forward to staying here again! I highly recommend checking out Martha’s Vineyard and taking the drive up to P-Town!! It’s completely worth it!"
2021-08-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,My girlfriend and I had a very enjoyable time staying at Mary's Cape Cod home. It was well prepared and had many welcoming provisions. Mary also answered any questions we had very promptly and made our stay very comfortable. If you are looking for a place to spend a quick trip to Cape Cod this is a very pleasant experience.
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Mary and Tom have a little slice of heaven on Cape Cod and are gracious enough to share that with us and so many other guests. Mary was very accommodating and responded quickly if you needed to reach out to her. The space was very clean and was more than enough room for 2 people (we have stayed in cramped studios before and this was the exact opposite). The kitchen has a little bit of everything for you to use (hot plate, toaster, multiple utensils, plates and bowls, etc). We really enjoyed having a normal sized fridge so that we didn’t have to sacrifice any refrigerated/frozen goods. The bed is a king and a cloud to say the least! The tile shower is amazing and you can tell a lot of thought went into every corner of their home. The neighborhood is very quiet, and the space is extremely quiet and relaxing. The only noises we experienced were the central air kicking on or the fridge but was not disruptive. The little driveway hook allowed for us to park in the driveway but aside from their driveway so that everyone can move around freely.
We were so happy to have stayed with Mary and Tom, we hope you will be too."
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Mary’s home is so lovely. Lots of thoughtful touches, very cozy, in a fun and peaceful location. Would love to visit again!"

It was a perfect stay little getaway, I would definitely stay here again."
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great space with lots of thoughtful details. Felt like we had plenty of room to move around and not feel cramped. If you plan to prepare any meals the induction hot plate is amazing, comes up to high temperature almost immediately. We love places where we can leisurely take our time in the morning and eat breakfast in before heading out for the day. Mary has made this easy to do and provided some healthy snacks and drinks as well.
As for exploring the area. You don't need to go far to find the perfect walking beach (although going at low tide is best for walking) Sandy Neck Beach. Pay for the day and the same pass gets you into 6 other beaches that day. For a shady walk, Hathaway's Pond trails were perfect.
We spent one day going out to Martha's Vineyard and realized it would have been nicer just staying in Barnstable area."
2019-10-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Very stylish, studio style apartment. Incredibly special in the attention to detail. Beautiful location, but make sure you get precise directions if you don't have satnav, otherwise very difficult to find. We did struggle with noises throughout the night - heating & fridge cutting in - though earplugs are provided! Otherwise would have been a 5 star rating."
2019-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is the place you will want to choose for your stay on Cape Cod. It is like having your own private home. It has everything you could need or want to include small kitchen with full size refrigerator, bar and table eating areas, sitting area, extremely comfortable bed, nice bath, and very nice furnishings all around. IT IS REALLY NICE!! It is all the pictures portray, but even nicer. Thank you Mary!"

2019-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Our stay was an absolute dream!! Beyond how wonderfully clean, comfortable and inviting the space was, Mary went above and beyond with a welcome sign personalized for my sister and I, a beautiful and delicious cheese plate, wine, breakfast food and orange juice. We couldn’t believe our eyes when we walked in! We have stayed at many air bnb’s and this was both of our favorites.

We will be staying there again on our next trip to Cape Cod!!!"

Mary did a perfect job at communicating/hosting and making us feel at home. The location is great -just a few minutes from several beaches, grocery store, etc. And the trip up to P-town for some whale watching is definitely worth the drive as well! I really can’t think of anything that could have been better."

Mary has a knack for personal touches, anticipating guests' needs, and keeping an immaculate and lovely space. My husband and I were in for a wedding and we felt as comfortable as at home, and every amenity was perfect! Sounds silly but I really loved the available cooler, with ice packs in the freezer ready for use, and paper goods to take to the beach. Not to mention - beach chairs! We were so thrilled and will be visiting again! XO"

help. I highly recommend this rental."
2018-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Mary puts the “super” in “superhost”! My son and I visited Cape Cod to watch baseball. Mary greeted us with “peanuts and cracker jacks”.

Cons - location (make sure to bring your GPS)"
2018-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Everything was great from beginning to end. Mary was great at communicating from check-in instructions to answering the couple of questions we had leading up.
Upon arrival the space was exactly as pictured. Very clean and decorated with a beach and nautical theme. It’s perfect for a coupLee though there was a fold out bed in the closet so I guess it could work for more than 2.
Mary goes above and beyond she left us a light continental breakfast and as well as a cheeseboard and wine. Since she knew I was pregnant she went out of her way to leave me seltzer. There is also a guest directory filled with information about local attractions and additional information about the studio. It’s quiet and secluded but still close proximity to everything on the Cape, Rt 6 is just 10 minutes away. We highly recommend this location!"

The space was gorgeous, sparkling clean, and had a lot of thoughtfulness put into it. There were clear instructions on entry/exit of the space, temperature control, etc. There were so many amenities: a full kitchen, TV, super comfy bed, refrigerator, microwave and plenty of storage and seating.

The wonderful attention to detail was second to none, a welcome sign (it was my husband's 50th and our Anniversary), fruit, cheese and cracker platter with a wonderful bottle of Pinot Nior, fresh scones, cinnamon rolls, yogurt and more fruit for breakfast.

Mary really makes you feel welcome as soon as you pull in. Highly recommended."
2017-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This studio was absolutely perfect for our long weekend getaway! We were able to travel to various towns and cities(on avg. 15-20 minutes from her studio) on the Cape because of the central location. It was secluded just enough though that we weren't in the heart of tourism, so we could enjoy a peaceful evening once we returned. The studio had everything you could ever need, and Mary was a great host! She made you feel welcome immediately upon arrival with a sign that welcomed you with your name, a cheese platter, wine, and breakfast for the next morning. The studio was immaculate, and the photos do not truly do it justice. We would recommend this studio to anyone, and we hope to be back!"
2017-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"What a perfect first experience using Airbnb to stay at Mary's place. The accommodations were really nice and it felt like staying at a private bed and breakfast with all the goodies Mary left for us! (Side note: if you're pregnant or not a drinker, Mary will leave you a bunch of great alternatives to the wine she normally leaves!). The space is not near the touristy parts of the cape, which was a welcome change of pace. My husband and I highly recommend this for a romantic trip away!!"
2017-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Mary's studio is even more beautiful in person. It's very spacious and everything is high quality. My wife and I stayed there for our wedding anniversary, it was perfect. We were welcomed by a nice cheese/fruit platter and bottle wine. Mary was very responsive when communicating. I'd recommend this place to any couple!"
2017-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very nice place! Clean and spacious. Easy communication. Would definitely recommend.
2017-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,An excellent hideaway for exploring CC. Would recommend for couples!
2017-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Marys space was comfortable , quiet and clean. She welcomed us with a fruit and cheese plate, wine and few items in the fridge. The price was very reasonable and better than some 2 star accomodations in the area. This was far better!"
2017-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I highly recommend Mary's place for your next trip down to the cape. This being my first airbnb experience I could not be more pleased. Personalized welcome along with wine, cheese, breakfast, and snacks to go along with an absolutely incredible room and setup it truly shows how much pride she takes in being a host. Was a fantastic experience for my wife and I. We will definitely book again for another trip down the cape. Place is a gem!"
2017-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Fabulous 3 day stay to the Cape. Our host Mary welcomed us with wine and cheese platter which was a nice treat. The private loft was clean and comfortable. Centrally located to all the Cape has to offer. Would stay again!!!
2017-07-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Enjoyable stay in very quiet residential area. Clean, quiet and hosts did not disturb at any stage."
2017-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Mary's place was super clean and extremely spacious--it was actually bigger than I had expected it to be. Mary checks in with you beforehand to let you know that she will be leaving some fruits, cheese, and small breakfast items which were all very thoughtful and delicious. She was also planning on giving us wine as a welcome gift but since I was pregnant, I asked for an alternative and she more than accommodated. She is quick to respond and was helpful with any questions I had on things to do/where to eat. I would highly recommend staying at her place if you're visiting the Cape!"
2017-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We visited the area for 5 days, beautiful, perfect temperature, very easy to circulate. Mary's place is very comfortable, clean, the place is quiet and welcoming, perfect for 2 people"
2017-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We loved Mary's place! The room was beautiful and it was such a great personal touch with the bottle of wine and the snacks. And Mary couldn't have been sweeter!
2017-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The studio is centrally located in Cape Cod and very comfortably furnished. Mary had welcomed us warmly with a personal message and an aperitif like breakfast. The tips in a separate folder were helpful and Mary was always available for questions. We had a very good time and a lot to discover. Thank you, Mary, for your warm hospitality."
2017-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Mary's place is beautiful, cozy, clean and in a great location! Couldn't have been a more perfect place for my boyfriend and I. I'd love to come back."
2017-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We were welcomed by a fruit and cheese tray and Mary went the extra mile to get a drink both myself and my pregnant wife would enjoy. The space is welcoming and perfect for a Cape Cod getaway. Would definitely stay again.
2017-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"It's clear that Mary has worked extremely hard to create the ideal space for a stay in cape cod. As a host she was very welcoming, keeping clear lines of communication open at all times and greeting us with wine and cheese etc which was much appreciated after a long drive.
She also goes above and beyond by handing over detailed information about the local area which was a great help when it came to deciding on which beach to visit, where to eat, shopping options etc.
The space is beautifully furnished/decorated, spotlessly clean and boasts one of the comfiest beds I've ever slept in!
Location wise it's ideal. Situated in a quiet residential area, you won't find much on your doorstep but it's a good place to base yourself if you wish to explore different parts of the cape by car.
All in all, Mary provided an excellent place to stay and our only regret is that we couldn't hang around a bit longer."
2017-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Mary's place was the perfect getaway from the city to spend a weekend on the Cape. The loft was nice and clean, with plenty of natural light, which created a peaceful ambiance-- just what my fiance and I needed. The fruit and cheese tray was a lovely addition to our relaxing weekend. Thanks again!"
2017-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We had a great time at Mary's place! She is very welcoming and even secured the place
2017-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,My girl and I had a great stay here. We took the ferry to the vineyard every morning which was about 25 minutes away. The place was very cozy and Mary even had a personalized welcome note with a nice bottle of wine. Definitely book time here if you can.
2017-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Our first stay in an Airbnb lodging was fantastic. Absolutely recommendable.
2017-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Mary and Tom's loft was absolutely wonderful! We had a great trip on the Cape and the loft was everything we were expecting and more! We loved the wine and cheese she left us and are so happy to have such amazing hospitality! Thank you again!! Highly recommend!

2016-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Terrific set up in a beautiful private loft connected to owner's home. Very much enjoyed the location and spending time out on the Cape. Tom and Mary are terrific hosts, and were very responsive. Thanks for a great stay, Mary and Tom!!"
2016-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The place was perfect. The amount of space of the apartment and how clean everything was was great.

If I return to the Cape, I will be staying here again."
2016-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Mary was wonderful and the apartment was perfect. It was spotless, comfortable, and very well designed. She made everything extremely easy and exceeded our expectations in every way. The location is pretty central to different areas of the Cape, we cruised up to Provincetown for the day and also saw Hyannis and Chatham. I would stay here again."
2016-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Our stay at Mary's place was a memorable one. It felt just like home. The place was impeccable and we admire Mary's attention to small details. Thank you for making our stay comfortable and memorable.

The place is beautifully done and Mary had made sure that you have everything you need - from wine, cheese, tea and coffee, beach towels and even chairs for the beach! She was great at communicating, just loved everything about it - thank you!"
2016-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This was one of the best Airbnb's we've been too. I felt like I was staying in a hotel. It was a comfortable living space for two people and she was nice enough to let us borrow her beach chairs. She also provided a handbook of places to go which gave us a lot of ideas on restaurants and beaches since we were unfamiliar with the area. Mary always responded quickly when we had any questions. It was a pleasure meeting her. I would definitely come back for another stay and recommend anyone to come and stay here!
2016-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This space is lovely and very comfortable - a perfect home base for exploring the Cape! Mary is a very gracious host and made sure we had everything we needed. We hope to visit again soon!
2016-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Had a lovely weekend at Mary's apartment. Came down to the cape for the Falmouth road race and enjoyed the many restaurants and things to do around Mashpee/Barnstable. The space was lovely, very clean, and spacious. Mary was extremely hospitable, leaving us wine & cheese platter along with delicious scones for breakfast and a nice packet of suggested restaurants and attractions. She's thought of everything you may need from k-cups, cream & sugar, to shampoo and beach towels! Would definitely recommend this space and will hopefully return in the future!"
2016-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Marie & Tom's place was the cherry on the sundae for our Cape Cod trip. The place is beautiful and the pictures do not do it justice!

2016-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had an amazing stay and everything was EXCELLENT. Mary was a great hostess, the place was exceptional and very clean. Location of the house is close to everything Cape Cod has to offer. This is a 5 star accommodation."
2016-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,My wife and I had an absolutely tremendous experience staying at this beautiful space. Everything was spotless when we first entered and you can tell Mary puts a ton of energy into making her guests feel at home and appreciated. And the wine and cheese upon arrival...simply the greatest cherry on top of a wonderful place. We both give our highest recommendation to this lovely space on the Cape!
2016-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,It was a pleasure to be welcomed to stay at Mary's. Her and Tom kicked off our pre-honeymoon with the warmest gesture of giving us the sweetest and most thoughtful wedding card upon our arrival. Their studio was equipped with everything you'd need. Mary was very accommodating with us and communication was extremely prompt. The studio was very comfortable as if I was in my own home. We'd definitely visit Mary and Tom again when in Cape Cod.
2016-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Mary was a great host. The place was impeccable... Very clean & met all our needs. She greets you with a bottle of wine & cheese which is an extra touch! She's also readily available for anything you may need. We loved staying here & recommend to anyone looking in the Cape!
2016-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Mary and Tom were amazing hosts! Everything in the apartment was clean and beautiful decor. There is so much to do in Cape and their house is located in a perfect quiet area. I will definitely be staying back with them in the future :)
2016-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Mary's place was the perfect space for a relaxing four days on the Cape! The studio is actually much bigger than it seems and super clean! The queen bed was so comfy and we loved that the home was in a quiet neighborhood, but close enough to beaches and town. Their home is centrally located where we had easy access to Dennis, Hyannis, Chatham and even over to Nantucket for the day. Mary provided everything you could need for a long weekend, coffee, snacks, wine and a very informative guest book for things to do, places to eat and even things to do on a rainy day! We had an excellent experience here and we will definitely be back again!"
2016-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I absolutely loved this place! Just like the listing promised, we were greeted in our new room with wine (Mary checked which wine I preferred beforehand), cheese, and crackers. My initial reaction was that the room was definitely bigger than what I saw in the pictures. They have an impeccable taste for decor from the choice of tiles in the bathroom shower to the beached-theme paintings and sea-stars lined against the wall in the kitchen. Mary was very friendly and responsive and I would definitely recommend this place to anyone interested in vacationing in Cape Cod."
2016-07-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Mary was great- she sent me instructions on the door lock, parking directions, and even asked me what kind of wine I like and left a bottle chilled in the fridge for us! The space itself was immaculate and new, very spacious, the kitchenette was very convenient, as was the private entrance so we didn't disturb anyone with our comings and goings. The bathroom and walk-in tiled shower are brand new, and the whole space is very nice Cape cottage style. With the mid-cape location close to other towns, but off the highway, it's a great location close to Mashpee, Hyannis shopping, restuarants. etc."
2016-07-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Mary's place was our base for a family wedding on the Cape as well as exploring the area & worked perfectly. A wooded neighborhood off the beaten track, we had our own parking space & keyless entry to the suite so came & went as we pleased."
2016-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Such a nice time at the Cape! Mary was a perfect and gracious host, giving us all the privacy we needed but being available to us whenever we had a question. The listing is very accurate: the space was very clean and up-to-date, with plenty of nice extras like beach towels, coffee, snacks, and a lovely cheese plate upon arrival. A beautiful neighborhood with houses spread out and gorgeous Cape cottages and gardens in every direction. We hope to return!"
2016-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,I was in Mary's house for the 4th of July weekend with my wife. I can't describe how beautiful that place is. Everything was clean and beautiful decorative. A bottle of wine and cheese was there waiting for us. Thank you for this experience Mary. Definately our next Cape Cod choice.
2016-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a great stay with Mary! Everything was perfect! A really big room/Apartment, everything in perfect condition and a nice style/ Design. She made everything childsafe for our 1 year old son and organised a highchair and a pack'n'play. It was the best to have some snacks and wine in the room when we arrived. The surrounding is very calm, only neighborhood. The access to the pond is not so easy for non-residents. That was the only thing that I was a little bit disappointed about, but it was not Marys fault."
2016-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I'd give my stay with Mary 5 Stars (6 Stars if I could)! The space was immaculate, the bed was ridiculously comfortable, and we were greeted by a cheese plate and a bottle of wine! Mary was great, she was available whenever we needed to get in touch with her and was generous in offering us a set of beach chairs to use for the weekend! I am hopeful I'll be able to make it back to this air bnb in the future!"
2016-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Mary was great - it definitely was a 5-star hotel experience! You get as much privacy as you need, but she is still there to assist with anything. The studio We were greeted by a cheese plate and a bottle of wine, as well as muffins for breakfast - the best airbnb experience I've ever had."

2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We had a great stay during our vacation on Cape Cod. Location is great, close to everything we needed! It was close to cute cafes, fish markets, supermarkets, and a number of nice beaches. The house was adorable, clean, private and felt very relaxing. It looked exactly as the pictures. It had nice balcony to relax in the morning and a backyard for playing if you have kids. The kitchen was well stocked with what you need to cook and a thoughtful coffee station. The porch was nice to relax and grill in the evening. Adi was very responsive and the instructions were very clear. Would definitely return if we get the opportunity!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Group trip,"Beautiful, peaceful getaway. Exactly like described/shown. Lots to do in the house for adults and kids! Felt just like home. Great for a weekend girls trip!

All the touches of home along with high quality towels and linens. Adi was extremely responsive and communicative. We would definitely stay here again!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We were able to get into the house earlier than check in and the smart lock made it convenient to come and go as needed. The house was very clean, great A/C and it had every amenity we could’ve wanted. Games, books, TV, full kitchen, washer and dryer with soap, 2 showers, big bedrooms, and a great outdoor space with a seating area, grill, and fire pit.
Adi answered every one of our questions within and hour (usually less) and provided helpful recommendations. Adi also remedied any problems we had (which were very few) very quickly. I would stay here again on my next trip to the Cape."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Had a fantastic long weekend stay at Cape Haus with 6 adults! Comfy beds, beautiful kitchen and super close to the beach and amenities. they even have board games for when it's rainy and great TV. Thank you again!"

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The Cape Haus was a great location and perfect for a vacation from our home in Arizona! Some (of many) of the amenities we appreciated during our trip to celebrate the 4th of July and explore the history of the area were: comfortable beds, good water pressure (that heats fast), dual pane windows, great A/C (once we figured out the remote slides open), the quiet neighborhood, & the host’s eagerness to help with anything if needed! Adi’s quick response saved us when we were in a time crunch, faced with a decision about where to shop before heading to the Red Sox game. Osterville was perfect for coastal decor items and souvenirs for the family. The home was just as described - clean, modern decor, and a great home base for our adventures! We used the hosts’ guidebook nearly every day. We loved the day at Dowses Beach and our last stop of the week at the Snack Shack in Sandy Neck. We will spend more time at both on our next visit. It was a trip we will always cherish!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The house was great & Adi a wonderful host. Any questions we had she answered within minutes. Everything was neat & clean, comfortable with plenty of room to stretch out inside & out. The availability of beach towels, chairs, & umbrellas was greatly appreciated. Centrally located so that anywhere on the cape was a short drive away. Relaxing inside & peaceful outside with only birds breaking the silence. And so many ways to make coffee! Highly recommended. Thanks Adi!

It was the perfect brief getaway to visit family for Thanksgiving. We will certainly be back for future visits to the Cape!
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Aditya! She is a rockstar. Super communicable and just an overall pleasure to work with. The automated lock system was dying due to cold weather. Aditya reached out before I even had to and gave me the lockbox code. House was very clean and exactly as advertised. Kitchen has everything you need to cook whatever you want! House was stocked with fun board games and the back yard is huge with a beautiful fire pit. Only 10 minutes to down Hyannis. Definitely stay here!
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"What a delightful place for our last Airbnb stay before moving to our new home. Lots of space, clean and comfortable, thoughtfully decorated. Adi thought of all the little touches too that you need when traveling. Device chargers in the bedrooms, toiletry items including makeup wipe removers. We especially enjoyed the fire pit several fall evenings and playing one of the outdoor games in the backyard. Although near a main road, felt private. Close drive to restaurants and other attractions. Wish we could have stayed longer. Hope to return with family and explore the area more."
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"A fantastic stay at Aditya’s place. The house is immaculate and location perfect for a Cape Cod vacation.
We will be back!"
2022-10-01,5.0,Group trip,"The house was modern, wel kept, and definitely had recent updates to it. But that isn't super unusual for Airbnb. What really stood out was that the owner really went out of their way to make sure you had all the random incidentall stuff you needed. For instance, they had shampoo, conditioner, and makeup removing pads in the bathroom. They even had all the fixings for smores. You could tell a lot of thought was put into making your stay comforable."
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Absolutely gorgeous home. Clean, bright and beautifully decorated. Located in a quiet private road. The host was responsive and accommodating. It was a very enjoyable stay. Would definitely come back."
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We enjoyed our stay with our two young children (3 and 5 years old)! The house is very clean, spacious, comfortable, well-located (grocery store, pharmacy, restaurants nearby). The kitchen is very well equipped. We enjoyed the outdoor fireplace! Many small touches for children (games, highchair, dishes), hosts respond very quickly and have developed a guidebook with good suggestions of places to visit that we found very useful. We would most certainly stay at this place if we return to the area, it was perfect to go visit the surrounding area and enjoy the area. Thank you!!"
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We are an elderly German couple. And yes we are a bit like that. We like it clean, well organised, of really good quality. And even considering this I got to say: this was a marvellous experience. We were fully happy with the house. The description/pictures fully display what you get for your money. So 5 stars from me."
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We had a wonderful time at Adi’s place. Everything was sparklingly clean and the house was very beautifully decorated. The location is very convenient to the beaches, shops and restaurants. Besides all of that, we are also very much impressed with the thoughtful details and provided toys/games/beach supplies/fire pit/grill. It was a five plus star experience for us and would highly recommend for everyone if traveling to the Cape."
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Staying at Aditya's place was absolutely fantastic. Right from the get go, they are extremely communicative, friendly, and helpful. The house itself a split-level chalet with a few stairs to the upstairs rooms and bathroom and a few stairs down to the kitchen, bathroom, living room, and writing room. Each bedroom has a little balcony and the back yard also has a nice patio area with a gorgeous grill. The fire pit was what really made it special, allowing us to enjoy a crips New England evening without freezing too much.
The place is extremely well stocked (sheets, towels, wash clothes, utensils, dishes, etc.). The furnishings are all very well new and the design is impeccable.
We can't wait to come back and stay!"
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We truly enjoyed our time at the Cape Haus! Aditya was a wonderful, attentive host, and the house was clean and well appointed. Our only wish is that we could have stayed longer so would have had time to enjoy the fire pit and grill. Maybe on our next trip!"
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The home was gorgeous, beautifully decorated. Super clean. Directions and guidelines were simple and easy to follow.

2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"enjoyed the layout and design of the house. Almost like a new house with fully equipment kitchen, washing/drying machines and furniture and fire pit in backyard, so much more. More important, owner responded to our request in reasonable time. I will definitely recommend this property to others."
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This house is great. The furnishings are comfortable, clean, and tasteful. The place was exceptionally clean and well maintained.

2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a wonderful stay at Cape Haus by Aditya and Varsha. Their house is clean, organized, well stocked and nicely decorated. They have anticipated every need (my wife especially appreciated the makeup washcloths 😉). Having a nice yard and deck to sit outside and enjoy coffee or a drink was perfect for relaxing after the beach and an outdoor shower. They were quick to answer any questions before and during our stay. I would highly recommend staying here and we look forward to our return to Cape Haus."
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,The response was so quick with every question I had . The house was beautiful and a quiet area
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Very nice, clean and cozy place at a great location in cape cod. House has all the amenities which made our stay super comfortable especially with a small kid.

I would highly recommend this place!!!"
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"What a great stay! The hosts were super accommodating, easy to get a hold of, and the location is super cute! We were there on one of the hottest days on Cape Cod, and the AC units cooled down the house SO nicely. Comfortable beds, great bathrooms, amazing kitchen with coffee bar and a great backyard. Location wise it's a super easy drive to beaches, shopping, and restaurants. HIGHLY recommend staying there (I know we will again!)"
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Verry nice stay in the house of Aditya.

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Bonnie and Mark's place was perfect for our one year wedding anniversary trip to the Cape with our two dogs.
It was super clean and very comfortable, even the pooches felt right at home!
We lucked out with beautiful weather and were able to enjoy the back patio for breakfast, which was just as nice as the inside.
Although we went just the two of us we would definitely come back with friends as there were three bedrooms and plenty of space.
Great restaurants and beaches are in the area and plenty of local recommendations in the welcome booklet provided.
There was so much attention to detail, and we couldn't have felt more welcomed and comfortable.
We would absolutely recommend this house to anyone looking to stay in the area, we for sure will be back!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Bonnie was a great host! Super clean home and very responsive to all our questions.
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The stay exceeded our expectations; we wish we had more time to enjoy what the home has to offer. The biggest negative common to all AirBnB rentals are the fees. We've found hotels now to offer more advantages with more flexibility on fees.
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This cottage on Cape Cod is delightful: spacious, spotless, and perfect for our group of 4. The bedrooms were large with TVs and cozy, comfortable beds, with plenty of blankets and pillows in the closets if needed. The kitchen had everything we needed, with new appliances and enough dishes, glasses, and utensils to easily handle a large group. The living area was spacious for our group of four and was extended by a beautiful outdoor patio with plenty of seating as well as a gas grill. The house is located on a very quiet street and is bordered in the back by woods. Its central location on Cape Cod makes it easy to travel in any direction to get to PTown, Nantucket, or Martha's Vineyard. We highly recommend Bonnie's place in Cotuit--you will not be disappointed!"

We had a wonderful time here! The house was spotless and very comfortable. I especially enjoyed the deck and the backyard, which is beautifully lit at night. All the bedrooms have a big screen TV and a fan.

We loved everything about it and just wish the weather cooperated enough for us to enjoy the beautiful deck a little more! The town is an 8-min drive to Mashpee for Starbucks, grocery stores, and shopping, super close to Hyannis for the ferries and great dog-friendly restaurants, and lots of great beaches (including some dog-friendly spots) in local Cotuit and Barnstable. So many great recommendations from Bonnie and Mark, too. Will definitely want to come back next year."
2023-08-01,5.0,Group trip,We really enjoyed our stay. The house is situated in a residential area and Loop Beach is only 5 minutes away. The backyard is private so you can sit outside on the patio. Bonnie was gracious to leave parking pass to any nearby beaches and allowed use of their bikes.

The house is so beautifully cozy with plenty of space for more than my wife, me and our pooch. We loved how private it felt and at the same time there was plenty of wonderful people in town. The way Bonnie and Mark made us feel welcome with the personal welcome basket was above and beyond. Thank you both for welcoming us and having us feel so invited in your beautiful home."

The hosts are super kind and accommodating. By far my favorite Airbnb visit, I would book with Mark & Bonnie again in a heartbeat."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Absolute 5 star review! The photos don’t do this place justice for how peaceful the backyard is, how nicely done each touch is, and just how comfortable everything is. We had 6 adults and a dog and felt like there was plenty of room to both spread out and enjoy time together. Bonnie was very communicative leading up to our stay and provided a great list of recommended activities."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Bonnie’s place was clean and so well decorated. The beds were very comfortable too. Kitchen has everything you need. Overall an outstanding place to stay!
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We absolutely loved staying here. Bonnie’s place is the way BNBs should be ran. It’s the little things like being fully stocked in the kitchen, having soft towels, using name brand soap, leaving a small welcome basket, extras like bug spray and such as well that set hosts like her apart.
Too many folks nickel and dime things and treat you like a dollar sign, but you will feel like family here.
The place itself is very roomy, private and peaceful. It’s in a fantastic location on a quiet road that is an easy drive to anywhere along the Cape.
We only wished we had stayed longer and had more time to enjoy our stay!
Thank you Bonnie for representing the best of hosts! We will be back anytime we come to MA."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"My family and I returned to Bonnie and Mark’s home for a long weekend, and it was just as lovely as we remembered! The space is beautiful, with a very comfortable and cozy interior in addition to a great outdoor space that is very private. It’s located close to lots of great beaches, and we loved riding the bikes around Cotuit as well. Mark and Bonnie were very responsive and welcoming - they have truly thought of all the details to make their AirBnB feel like a home away from home. We can’t wait to come back!"
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We loved our time here! There's so many great parks and trails all either walking distance or a short drive. Hosts were very communicative about check-in and provided tons of activity/food recommendations as well as a thoughtful welcome basket. The cottage itself is very clean with a simple, beachy vibe (beds and couch very comfortable, too) in a quiet neighborhood. We would love to come back with our pups in the summer :)"

2022-09-01,5.0,Group trip,My family and I came on a house hunting trip over a long weekend and arrived late at night Check in was extremely easy and we were greeted with a delicious basket of snacks and a magically lit backyard!! The house is comfortable and allows for easy commute around the cape.

2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The house is clean and very comfortable. We had a lovely time.

2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We loved this place in Cape Cod. The only issue was bugs but the host had a basket full of insect repellents and bracelets for kids which came super handy. We will stay again - for a family of 6 with teenage kids and a baby, we had all we needed and more for a short beach break. Thank you!"
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"A lovely home in a lovely, quiet town on the upper Cape that's very easy to get to, avoiding much of the summer traffic that can be such a drag when going to towns further out. The home's layout is a little unusual...you enter at the bedroom level and the living room, kitchen, and access to the beautifully furnished deck are downstairs from there. Every room is newly renovated, well-appointed, and absolutely immaculate. The kitchen and family room are comfortable and lead out to the beautiful, private, and quiet deck. Prior to our arrival, Bonnie and Mark sent a link to a variety of things to do in the area and the highlight was Yoga on the Beach on Little Poppy Beach, which can be a little tricky to find but very much worth seeking out if you're there in the summer. But note that there's no parking where the group meets so you either need to be dropped off at the end of Wading Place Rd (see here on GoogleMaps: HGGR+HGP Mashpee, Massachusetts) or walk one mile from the parking lot at the Popponesset Marketplace, 259 Shore Dr, Mashpee. We also enjoyed using Bonnie and Mark's bikes (2 adult-sized, 2 kid-sized), especially because parking at town beaches is by permit only."
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Cotuit Cottage was the perfect location for enjoying the Cape Cod Hydrangea Festival. The cottage is pleasantly decorated, clean, and the kitchen has everything you need. The patio and deck were perfect for morning coffee/breakfast as well as afternoon appetizers. Plenty of supplies for the beach including beach bag, towels, blankets, etc., and an outdoor shower. Great location for visiting all of the regions/villages of Cape Cod. I highly recommend Cotuit Cottage, and Mark and Bonnie were excellent hosts and great communicators."
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We really enjoyed this rental - Bonnie and Mark provided anything you could need, great kitchen with spices too. Many thoughtful extras too - like cheese and cracker varieties and treats for the fur baby, even an outdoor lead for the dog! Everything in the home was in great working order, and very tastefully decorated. The outdoor space was great with big table, couch and chairs - loved all the solar lights that made the space look magical after dark. Would highly recommend this home!"
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Awesome house - has everything you need for a nice getaway
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Great house for 4 adults and a small child. Very well equipped and owners responsive to all requests. Outside area in back is really the highlight.

2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Our family stayed in Bonnie and Marks lovely home, had many enjoyable meals cooked in the well equipped kitchen, and spent family time together both indoor and outside on the deck.

2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"This cottage was perfect for our little family getaway. We were in a wedding down the street at Willowbend, and we were able to bring our in-laws, little ones, and dog down for the weekend. The cottage had the perfect layout with the bedrooms upstairs and the living space downstairs that opened up to a gorgeous patio. The kitchen was fully stocked with pots, pans, glasses, plates, you name it! It made it very easy for us to travel as a family. The house was very clean—you would never know it was pet friendly. We are so glad we spent our weekend here, and we will be sure to recommend this rental to anyone heading down to the area! Thanks again for having us, Bonnie & Mark!"
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"The home is amazing! Perfect for a family. It is decorated so well, clean and the kitchen is stocked with everything you’d need. The location is so nice, we’ll definitely be back."
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"Bonnie’s house is perfect & truly feels like a home. Well decorated, incredibly well stocked with kitchen items, cleaning supplies, all the linens you could want, this place truly lets you just bring your clothes & toiletries & not worry about the rest. Over a 3 month stay I cooked & baked pretty extensively & the kitchen had everything I could ask for. It’s a quiet neighborhood, great for dog walks & bird watching. Beautiful back deck with a nice grill, great lounge chairs, the works. Would be an amazing spot for a quick getaway, or longer term stays. Bonnie was great with communication & couldn’t have been a better host. Thanks again :)"
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Bonnie and Marks place was a dream come true. The place was even better than expected. The hosts were great at communicating if we needed anything, which we really didn’t because everything was provided. The home and property are beautiful and look brand new. The bedrooms and bathrooms were spacious and the living room was very comfortable and relaxing and there’s a real wood burning fireplace too. Perfect charm! Kitchen had everything we needed and then some. The host even left us a little cheeseboard in the fridge with some cheese samples. On the counter was a basket with a local book, some crackers and snacks as well as some treats for the dogs. Very thoughtful touches. The beds and bedding were some of the most comfortable I’ve ever slept on.
The property is private but also not far to drive to get some groceries or other shopping done. It took us about 40 min to drive out to cape cod national seashore area. I’m assuming bc it was the off-season, traffic wasn’t too bad. The area is beautiful. This was definitely one of my favorite Airbnb stays! Highly recommend."
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"My Husband, our 2 sons and I had a great Christmas at Bonnie and Mark’s home. The home is incredible, the decor in the entire house is very beautiful. The place was very clean and had all of the necessities for our stay. The bedrooms are big with huge closet space, the beds and pillows are extremely comfortable. The living room (were we spent most our time) is very beautiful, spacious and very comfortable. We were able to spent quality time together watching movies and playing board games. The kitchen was well equipped and had everything we needed. This was by far our best Christmas getaway.
Overall, Bonnie and Mark are great hosts who thought of every little detail and made us feel welcome."
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Mark and Bonnie were great hosts, would gladly stay here again! The house was very well set up and the beds were dreamy!"
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Great roomy accommodations in a quiet setting. Clean, and great for an extended family. Kick back and relax."
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"Bonnie and Mark's Cotuit house was exactly as shown and described on the listing. They are super nice, helpful, and responsive. The spaces are tastefully decorated and comfortable. The back/outdoor space is surrounded by trees and so peaceful. I needed a break from my home in the city where I've been working since the pandemic. Bonnie and Mark were also very accommodating in letting me bring my old well-behaved cat. I totally felt at home. I also hosted Thanksgiving there and Bonnie even got me all the tools to roast a turkey! Mark brought me a computer monitor to make my ""work from their home"" more comfortable. They are such great hosts and I would definitely recommend their home. Thanks Bonnie and Mark!"
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"I had a wonderful stay at Bonnie's Cotuit Cottage. It is exactly as advertised. Clean, quiet. I enjoy cooking and the kitchen had all one needs to prepare meals. Communication was easy. I would stay here again and can highly recommend."
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Bonnie, thanks for sharing your lovely home with us. You provided everything we needed and included some extra special touches. Wish we had more time to relax on your deck & enjoy the fire pit. The weekend went by too quickly. We’ll definitely return. Cape Cod is beautiful! Thanks again for the terrific hospitality!"
2021-10-01,5.0,Group trip,"Beautiful home in such a charming neighborhood in the Cape! Bonnie & Mark were wonderful hosts, extremely responsive and welcoming. The space was very clean and also dog friendly, it was the perfect place for our family to get away for the weekend. Would love to come back again!"
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Wonderful stay at this beautiful airbnb! Very quiet neighborhood location with wonderfully private deck/outdoor space. House was spotless and very comfortable, and Bonnie has really thought of everything in terms of amenities! Easy drive to local beaches. Hope to be back!"
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We loved staying at Bonnie and Mark's home. What a great location, the house is in such a peaceful setting, so quiet and private. The house has everything you could possibly need or want. There was a lovely basket of snacks left for us and cheese and crackers, very thoughtful. Great patio with beautiful furniture/umbrella for enjoying the outdoors. Also just a quick ride to the grocery store or places where you can pick up food/drinks. We love the location as we were just a quick ride away from Falmouth, Chatham, Hyannis - we just wish we had more time! Thank you again for such great hospitality!"
2021-09-01,5.0,Group trip,The house is so beautiful and every detail was thought of. It is very clean and decorated really nice. Feels like a home and not a rental. The beds were comfortable. We didn't get a chance to utilize all of the amenities and wish we had more time. *FYI there are stairs. I don't remember reading anything about that but it is good to know. Didn't pose a problem just giving a heads up. Bonnie thought about everything. A little goodies to tide us over until we could get to the store and an incredible book with all information and activities in the area. She responded incredibly quickly to any of our questions. We would stay there again if we were in the area.
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"My family's stay at Bonnie and Mark's place was fantastic. The house is immaculate! And, so many nice touches...they really have thought of everything you need to be comfortable and feel welcomed. They were also incredibly responsive along the way, answering all of our various questions within minutes. The house is very convenient to all the points of interest in Cotuit and throughout Cape Cod. We would love to stay there again in the future!"
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Beautiful, comfortable, cozy home. Bonnie and Mark made sure our stay was enjoyable and relaxing by adding special touches. Perfect location, close to the beach and Martha’s Vineyard. Would absolutely recommend their home for a family vacation"
2021-08-01,5.0,Group trip,"Bonnie was such a great host, she included lots of thoughtful extras with the house…towels, sunscreen, s’mores supplies, restaurant suggestions, and more! The house with very clean and inviting…the back porch and yard were so peaceful. Many quaint towns are close by as well as lovely beaches. We would definitely stay there again!"
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place was truly lovely! Bonnie and Mark's place was spacious and immaculately clean. The back porch was so private and gorgeous, and the neighborhood was quiet and peaceful. We LOVED having the bikes there to cruise around the neighborhood and to the beach close by! Their book of recommendations was also extremely helpful and spot on, they did not steer us wrong (especially Polar Cave ice cream, YUM). I would love to come back next Summer and stay here again; it was the perfect getaway for my boyfriend, dog, and I!"
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Mark and Bonnie are terrific hosts, quick to respond and extremely hospitable. They have a beautiful property and have set it up nicely with everything you need. And their house is located in a quiet and friendly neighborhood but with few mins driving you get to Stop and Shop, Walgreen and other stores, restaurants. We also stayed in their nice patio to have outdoor BBQ. We loved our time here!"
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This was, by far, the best Airbnb we have ever stayed at. We were worried it wouldn’t live up to the photos, but it certainly did. Everything in this home is beautiful, clean, comfortable, and brand new. The yard and outdoor space were also immaculate. (We had a great time doing s’mores in the fire pit one night!)
We brought our toddler and two medium-sized dogs with us, and the space was great for them as well. We have found a lot of Airbnb’s claim they’re dog-friendly, but then have lots of rules that actually make bringing your pets along very difficult. This was NOT the case with Bonnie and Mark’s house, and we truly appreciated that our dogs were allowed to be comfortable!
We walked around the neighborhood everyday — it was very quiet (during the day and at night) and everyone we passed was extremely
friendly!
We also walked down to the Cotuit Kettleers’ field for a ballgame one night, and went on runs. There were some beaches within walking distance, but unfortunately you need a residence pass for those. If we didn’t have all the beach gear needed for a toddler, we would have taken Bonnie and Mark’s beach cruisers to the beach or walked the short distance. Instead, we opted to drive 25min to a nearby beach with public parking.
The kitchen was fully stocked with everything you could possibly need. Even the dishes matched the decor and felt welcoming!
The only “con” we can think of is that the twin bedroom has very thin curtains. We initially planned to put our toddler in that room, but decided we wanted to sleep beyond sunrise on vacation :) Instead, he slept in a full bed in a room with light blocking curtains. If you’re a parent and need all the bedrooms in the house to accommodate your kids, we suggest bringing some of the travel light blocking curtains you can find on Amazon. Other than that, there’s absolutely nothing negative we could possibly think of!
Overall, we rate this a 10/10 and will absolutely suggest it to our friends and family! Bonnie and Mark have clearly put a lot of time and energy into their Cotuit home — we repeatedly found ourselves commenting on how no detail was overlooked or unthought of."
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We loved our time at Bonnie and Mark’s place. The house was truly a family-friendly environment. Bedrooms are spacious and provided comfy bedding. The outdoor space is perfect for barbecuing or if you’re just looking to lay back and relax. Cute and quiet neighborhood with a amazing spots to watch the sunrise, hike, or go kayaking. House is equipped with literally everything you can imagine. We are already planning on coming back here next summer! Thanks again Bonnie and Mark"
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great new location, house and host. Book early as this will become popular."
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Bonnie’s cottage is the perfect place to stay for a getaway! We appreciated the attention to all of the details - Bonnie has literally thought of everything which makes it so easy to sit down and relax once you arrive. Her suggestions and recommendations for the area are so helpful and made us feel as though we were staying at a friend’s place 😊.
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Bonnie and Mark’s house is a great place for families. It was on a quiet dead end street and we felt very safe at night leaving the windows open. The home was clean and cozy and they thought of just about everything to make our stay enjoyable and comfortable. They went above and beyond and left a special treat for my sons birthday and for my dog. The beds were very comfortable and soft, and the linens smelled better than any other place I’ve stayed. The kitchen was fully equipped with everything you could think of to cook a family meal. The out door deck was beautiful and the landscape nicely maintained. The back yard was perfect for our dog to roam and they even had a brook that was so peaceful to watch and listen to. I would highly recommend Bonnie and Mark’s home."

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,I love this place great place to stay in
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great place to stay! We had the place to ourselves but may need to double check if it's the entire home or shared space. Definitely enjoyed having the house to spend time relaxing and everything was great! Clean, cute decorations, and everything you need for a vacation stay was at the house. Thank you, Julie!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Group trip,"Great time on the cape, the place was clean and had plenty of space"
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Another great stay, and we'll be back. Jennifer's communication is particularly good. Need something? On it. And you won't need much, because the place is fitted for everything -- including cooking for Thanksgiving!"
2023-10-01,4.0,Group trip,"The only issues we had were pulling in and out of the very steep driveway and for my mother, who has mobility issues, to negotiate the unusually large step at the front door. Other than that everything else was fine and as described."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The house was a very comfortable space. It was very clean and nicely decorated. The kitchen had everything we needed for light meal prep. Jennifer was very accommodating in every way. It was a very enjoyable visit.
2023-08-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Nice few days in Cape Cod. Great location right in the middle of Cape Cod with easy access to beaches, towns, restaurants etc. House has everything you need and was updated as described (eg new paint, interior design, some new appliances etc. with bathrooms on the older side). Worked for us, as we didn‘t spend much time in the house. Jennifer is a great and very responsive host and everything worked out as expected."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,A great house to stay within a great part of Cape Cod - lots of good food and activities for the kids near this house that’s perfectly setup for adults and kids. The basement playroom was perfect for the kids!
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Wonderful house with enough space, good beds and further amenities. Everything was very clean. The house seems to be recently refurbished and is nicely decorated. We had a lot of fun with the foosball table."
2023-08-01,4.0,Group trip,"Great location and lots of space for our multigenerational family vacation (ages 25-85). Appreciated having some kitchen staples on hand, like flour, as we had forgotten to pack a ziplock portion for the trip. Enjoyed sitting on the back deck sipping coffee in the morning watching the bunnies scamper around. The AC works great! Jennifer was very responsive.
While there are two rooms with two twin beds each, none of these mattresses are supported by box springs but rather lie straight on wooden slats. For an elderly person, this was not comfortable. For a younger person, it would be fine.
While a cleaning fee is assessed, just prior to arrival was told we would have to launder all sheets and towels. It would have been nice to be told this prior to booking."
2023-07-01,5.0,Group trip,The house was easy to get to and check in was easy with a door code. The house was beautiful and spacious. There were 6 females that stayed and we didn’t feel like we were bumping into each other. The house was clean and had pretty much everything we needed. The back deck was perfect for morning coffee! My only suggestion would be to have some additional hand towels for the bathrooms. Jennifer was quick to respond to questions and messages. Overall a great place and great time!
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We had a wonderful stay at Jennifer's place in Osterville. The house was spacious and comfortable, with all the beds, cozy spots, and necessities that our family of 5 needed. Jennifer went out of her way to check in with us, made sure we had everything we needed, and answered our questions before and during our stay. We had a terrific Cape Cod vacation, with easy access from the house to all that the Cape has to offer, from beaches to bike riding to whale watching and more. Would love to return!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Group trip,"We had such a lovely stay in Barnstable at this beautiful home. The space was perfect and so comfortable for our family of 5 to spread out and we loved having the living room and kitchen spaces to spend time together. The kitchen was well-stocked and we had everything we needed to make some meals with the local seafood. The foosball table was a definite plus for everyone. We had a fairly short drive to Craigsville beach which we enjoyed and were not far from Hyannis to the ferry for a daytrip to Nantucket. Our fave spot was Four Seas ice cream which was super close and so friendly - the ice cream was delicious and perfect for a summer day. Staying here was the perfect, relaxing end to our tour of New England!"
2023-05-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Very appreciative of Jennifer's communication. Great space with nice location. Minimal amenities provided (soap, shampoo, etc), so make sure you bring your own things, but nothing that detracted from the enjoyment of the stay."
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Good communication was the first sign we'd have a good experience. It was confirmed when we arrived to find a really lovely well-appointed, modern house. You can be confident of a good experience staying at Jennifer's place. Thanks!"
2022-09-01,5.0,Group trip,"Thanks for a great Cape stay! This spacious home was plenty of room for our family of six and the bonus bed in the lower level was a pleasant surprise. With three generations traveling together, having a little extra room to spread out was appreciated. The kitchen had everything we needed and the outdoor space was perfect for enjoying the great fall weather. We really loved having a table in the eating area where we could all sit and enjoy a casual dinner or for breakfast before we went out exploring the many Cape sites."
2022-09-01,5.0,Group trip,"Jennifer was super responsive with messages regarding check in details as well as any questions during our stay. The home was clean, spacious and beyond our expectations. Would highly recommend!"
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a fantastic stay at Jennifer’s place. The location was in such a quiet and peaceful neighborhood. The house was very comfortable and inviting, we felt at home immediately. Craigville Beach was just moments away, which was awesome! It was centrally located to almost everything we wanted to do while in town. We would highly recommend this location!"
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Overall, we enjoyed our stay. The place is specious, on a very quiet street, has a lot of privacy, and has a well-equipped and clean kitchen. The host was also very nice--she responded fast to our messages, let us use her Netflix account, and let us check in early. There are two things that could be improved: (1) the AC units are pretty old, noisy, lack temperature sensors and (2) the bed in the master bedroom was too soft for people with back issues."
2022-08-01,5.0,Group trip,"Our stay at Jennifer’s Osterville Ranch was perfect for our family of five. As advertised, the house was Clean, Bright and Spacious and also perfectly located for our bucket list of Cape Cod fun. Even the neighbors were helpful when our minivan broke down out front !
Jennifer’s communication with us throughout our booking and stay was timely and appreciated. We are already looking forward to renting again next summer!"

2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"great house! location was good... about 25 minutes from awesome beaches. street is quiet... neighborhood made it nice to let the kids go on bike rides. the house itself was spacious and adequate for a large family. the kitchen was very well supplied, much appreciated that they were Tupperware containers for the duration of our stay! definitely a great find!"
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Jennifer was a great host. she was very communicative, and our check-in and out were seem less. The place is fantastic and a perfect central location for the Cape. Comfortable beds, safe neighborhood, and beautiful house."

2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We'd loved our stay at Jennifer's place. It was very comfortable for our family of five. The neighborhood was nice and close to lots of things. The kitchen had a good amount of amenities. We appreciated that she had some beach items in the garage that we could use (chairs, mats, umbrella and a cooler). Jennifer was very good about communicating with us and making sure everything was ok. I just wish we could've stayed longer. I highly recommend this place!"
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Wow.
This is truly a gem on AirB&B. The photos don’t do this property justice. Walking in, upon first impression, you’re like “Wow, this is way better than the photos could even show us!”
Drinks on the deck… a 5-star quality King size bed… a kitchen with everything you need…. All of our dinners were “to-go” style so we could enjoy all our meals in the more intimate setting of the private back porch.
And the location is literally perfect. Quick trips into any town you want on the Cape…. Easy access from Boston all the way to P-Town. I’d be hard pressed to rent from anyone again for a Cape vacation.
And as a transgender woman, having a host that was loving, accepting, and willing to open their home to me and my family made the vacation even more special for us.
Jennifer, our host, was an amazing communicator via AirB&B chat and was easily to get a hold of for any one-off questions.
Thank you Jennifer for hosting the best vacation of our lives!
Amber & Sabrina"
2022-06-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"Jennifer has a beautiful home. Our stay was good. The only thing we would have appreciated knowing beforehand was that there are blinds in the windows, but no curtains or shades. In June, it is full light at 5:30 in the morning, making it difficult for children and adults to sleep. Sleep masks would be advised and helped us a lot during our stay."
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,The house is beautiful and our kids loved it too. They enjoyed the football. We were 10 minutes from the beach.

The check in/out process was simple.

We would definitely stay again and highly recommend to those looking for a vacation getaway!"

Beautiful home inside nestled in a quiet neighborhood, which suited our needs for meal times and naps. Cute back deck. Game room downstairs with board games and football table made downtime in the house really fun. We explored the surrounding area and were in driving distance of so many beaches and fun things to do.

The bed was so comfortable, and the shower was awesome. There's a lovely little outdoor deck too.
You can be sure I will be back.

2023-07-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is a very nicely updated and clean cottage. It has a great location with the walking distance to nice and private Keyes beach. We really enjoyed the outside terrace above the woods. One thing to note is that the space is a very tight squeeze for four grownups, it is better suited for a couple with small children than four adults. The bunk bed is short and the lower one is very low and tight for an adult to get in and out of. Kitchen is also too small for multiple people to prepare food in at the same time. Other than that, we had a very nice stay and Tory is a super responsive host."
2023-06-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"If you're looking for a small quiet place near several ocean beaches, this cottage will be great. It looks to have been recently renovated and everything in bathroom, kitchen and the rest looks nice and works well. A few cautions: 1) bring k-cups if you want coffee, 2) bring plastic wrap and aluminum foil if you'll need them, 3) the bedrooms don't have room for much more than beds so not the normal storage space for clothes that you'd find in hotel rooms, and 3) not a lot of hangers."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We had a great stay, and Tory is an accommodating host. We enjoyed being able to walk to the ocean!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"this was the perfect place for my trip! it was the perfect tiny and cozy home for myself and my 3 friends. the house was just as described and was a very quick walk from a super nice beach! it’s also very close to main street in Hyannis where there were fun shops and restaurants. Our only complaint would be that when we arrived the house smelled like smoke, but other than that it was amazing!! thank you so much, we absolutely loved our trip!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great little cottage right next to beach. Walking distance from Hyannis strip...Exceeded my expectations 💯. Thank you
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The cottage was cozy and private; a great little space to rest and relax and within walking distance of the beach
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Cute, clean place. Simple and organized. Great for a couple with 2 small kids. Smack dab in the middle of all the right Hytown attractions (Main Street, Kennedys, Kalmus beach...). Good communications TV has live Youtube for major networks."
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We had a great stay at Tory's place. The location is in close proximity to the beach and town and a great launching point for other destinations on the cape. The space suited our needs for a relaxing weekend away!
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I booked the cabin very last-minute, right before NYE. Tory was very fast to respond to my messages, even on new year’s day, which I really appreciated. The cabin is a very short walk from the beach. It was so peaceful and quiet. The cabin had everything I needed, and we very cozy and comfortable to stay in. 10/10 recommend for a quiet getaway!"
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Its a firepit away from being perfect.
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The beach and downtown are super close!
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Awesome place to stay on the Cape! The place is very clean and Tory is an excellent host. Will absolutely stay at her cottage again in the future.
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great little house very close to a quiet beach.
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We had a wonderful stay here! Perfect location, everything was clean and easy check-in/out. The bunk beds were great for the kids. It was such an easy walk to the beach. 100% would recommend!"
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We loved staying here !!!! It's is the perfect little beach cottage - tastefully decoarted - spotless clean- everthing is new, crisp & fresh - wonderful location - super quiet and very charming. Great inside and outside living. What a great place to stay. We spent a week and loved every minute. Nikki & Steve"
2022-09-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Very nice, very quiet. Tory was friendly and helpful.
The two only problems are the mattress - not very good quality - and also the absence of real shutters for the light, which mean that you will probably be waken up at 6 or 7am, when the sun appears.
Appart from that, it’s charming, small, and very close to the beach."
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Tory’s cottage was perfect for our impromptu girls trip! The place was immaculate and so cute. It has everything you need and the street is private and quiet. We really enjoyed having coffee on the patio before the start of our day. The location was ideal, walkable to so many things including the ferry. Tory was really nice and responses were very quick. I would absolutely stay again and highly recommend!"
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Great location, clean and well decorated cottage"
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We had the best time at this cottage. We stayed there (4adults) for 3 days with a two year old. The area is small but very well thought out and super clean. The location is amazing. Just five minutes walk to two different beaches in about 15 to 20 minute walk to the nearest strip with all of the little restaurants and shoppes. The cottage is at the very end of the street in a very peaceful location. I’m originally from Poland and lived in a very woodsy area and this reminded me of my home country. The host was very responsive and always available through the air bnb chat. The check in was super smooth. The cottage is small but very well designed and has great use of space. The back deck is very relaxing and whimsical. The beds were super comfortable and the blankets were fresh and fluffy. Loved everything about this experience. Great place for families with kids.
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We had a wonder stay! The cottage was extremely clean with new furnishings. Tory was a great host and very responsive to messages. We really liked the location on a quiet street, a quick walk to the beach and minutes away from Hyannis center."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Great stay! Super convenient to Hyannis but this sits at the end of a quiet road and long drive (house is about 100 ft away) so it doesn’t feel like it. Walkable to Main St or just a quick drive. We brought our pup who doesn’t do well with other dogs and Marlene was kind enough to keep her dogs mostly inside and, if they were outside, they were on leads. This second floor studio space (over the garage) had everything we needed and the water pressure in the shower was next level - shampoo rinses out in seconds!! Everything was clean and tidy and the small dorm fridge has a freezer for all you ice cream fans. WiFi was fantastic (cellular was spotty but welcome to the Cape!) so not sure what a prior review was talking about. The split heating/air unit with remote kept the temps perfect. I wouldn’t say this is a modern updated space but it’s exactly as described, super clean, private and checks all the boxes — 100% we would stay again."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Easy check in, good host communication, quiet place with beautiful surrounding nature and parking spot. Walking distance to downtown with many shops and restaurants. Few things to note but no issue for us during the stay: Wi-Fi was spotty and could be stocked with more towels and blankets. Overall would recommend to anyone!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We had a great time staying here! It is so close to Hyannis and the ferry port which we used to head to Martha's Vineyard for a day! It was an easy checkin and check out and would definitely recommend
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great location, great for 1-2 people. Bed was comfortable, strong AC, and strong water pressure. Would definitely stay here again"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Nice Airbnb near downtown Hyannis. Pleasant stay.
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Marlene’s place is a perfect quiet oasis from Hyannis, yet it’s still in walking distance of everything. She communicates really well, and this was a perfect spot if you are bringing a dog with you on your Cape adventures."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,What a fabulous place! I regret we didn't have time to explore more. highly recommend!
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Maralene's place was perfect for a weekend getaway with my five-year-old. It was a very short drive from the shops and restaurants on Main Street. The property was surrounded by nature - very peaceful and rustic. My son loved seeing the animals and the Goat Experience (booked via Airbnb experience) was really cute and fun! Maralene kindly provided a bowl of snacks that came in handy and saved us from stopping for breakfast on the way home (I also appreciated the k-cups and to-go coffee cups!). A small hair dryer and 2-in-1 shampoo/conditioner was provided as well which helped save some space in my suitcase. The room gets a little bright in the morning so my sleep mask came in handy. We would come back!
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Great place. Host was very friendly. Location is great, we had an amazing time"
2023-06-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Marlene’s place was good for our stay. The place and garden are really good with chickens, goat. Its really close to reataurants and ferry terminal."

2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,What a cute spot! We come to Hyannis every year to race the triathlon. This house was close by and perfect for us and our dog. There was plenty of space outside for our dog to play. The house was exactly as pictured and the host is so kind! We’d love to stay again!
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Marlene thought of everything to make the rental space homey such as coffee, water bottles and snacks. Centrally located in greater Hyannis area. Marlene was very responsive and friendly. Great get away for us and our dog."
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Marlene’s place was very convenient for the conference I was attending around the corner. Very quiet and easy check in and checkout. Place had everything I needed and more.
2022-10-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,"This is a hidden gem that feels like you are tucked away in the woods, yet minutes from almost anything you would need! It was a great location for beaches and easy to travel to other places on the Cape. When had a small issue at first and Marlene fixed it right away, We brought our dog with us and it was very dog friendly! We appreciated the little personal touches and goodies. It is a great, affordable place to stay if you are looking to explore!"
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Marlene’s place was great. Perfect central location and easy to access so much on the cape, but still secluded and private. Hosts were very friendly and helpful!"
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,We had a great stay at the loft. Hosts are accommodating and friendly. Very close to downtown Hyannis and easy to get to other areas of the Cape. We appreciated being able to have our dog with us and would definitely return again on future trips.
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"This is a great place to stay. The Airbnb is in a great location, just a couple minutes drive to Hyannis main st. We had our dog with us and Marlene left out some doggie treats and a dog bowl, which was a very nice touch. There were plenty of human snack and drinks including coffee and tea as well. The spaces itself has everything we needed and I would definitely stay here again."
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Such a great central location in Hyannis! Especially if seeing a show at the Melody Tent.
Owners very friendly and accommodating.
Stay was clean and well stocked"
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Couldn't of asked for a better spot! So close to downtown, the melody tent and the beaches. Thank you for being a great host Marlene!"
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Quiet, private, and central! We had a great stay."
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Couldn't ask for a better getaway location. The unit is nice and cozy for two. The host is very receptive and answered all my questions quickly. Really close to downtown Hyannis, and even exploring the property is a lot of fun."
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,We were able to snag the loft on some last minute plans and it was absolutely perfect! The space was jampacked with everything we needed and the hosts were very responsive. We already talked about coming back!
2022-08-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a very nice stay, perfect size for two people."
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We absolutely LOVED staying at the loft! It had everything we needed, both space-wise and supply-wise, and was in an excellent location (minutes from downtown Hyannis). The host was always available if we needed anything, the shower pressure was fantastic (better than my actual home), and the kitchenette was prepared with mini cereal boxes, granola bars, and bags of microwave popcorn; a really lovely touch to the overall experience!
We also had so much fun participating in the ""goat experience"", which takes place right on their farm! We were able to feed the chickens, check for eggs, greet the ducks, milk a goat, and watch a demonstration of how goat milk soap was made! It's a separate fee from staying in the loft, but it was such a great experience that we had to mention it in this review, and urge others to give it a try!
Thank you so, so much to our hosts; we had an unforgettably fun time in the Cape, and wish you all the best in the future!"
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great location within walking distance of downtown Hyannis; this location feels very comfy, safe and secluded. Other than the fact that you might have a hard time showering if you are tall (taller than 6' 2""), the location is perfect and there are many Barnstable beaches nearby where get a $25 day pass that gives you access to 5 great beaches like Craigville and Kalmus. You can rent a complete beach set from Marlene for $20. The beds, sheets, floors and bathroom were very clean which is our priority. Overall, great stay! - Paulo and Lydia"
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Perfect for my small quick weekend getaway
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Located in a beautiful tucked-in corner of Barnstable -- a nice and calm retreat after being out all day. Thank you!
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"If you are looking for a cozy place to stay that is a stone's throw from Hyannis, stay at Marlene's. She's there when you need her.
Her own Victorian style home looks like something out of a fairy tale. Marlene also raises goats and chickens and has a friendly dog.
It was a perfect getaway for me. It's quite and comfy. You'll be greeted with snacks, water, milk, cereal, coffee, microwavable popcorn, and tea. Great shower bath and as someone said, great water pressure.
The location is very close to Main Street Hyannis and down the street from a music venue called Melody's Tent. The ferry is also close by if you want to go to Martha's Vineyard. You may want to visit Edward Gorey's home in Yarmouth; he is the person whose illustrations you see if you watch Masterpiece Theatre on public television.
I highly recommend this Airbnb property. It is in a great central location."
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Cute room above garage. perfect little place. Nice balcony to have coffee in the morning. Awesome water pressure in the shower. Great communication, would stay here again."
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"A wonderful, secluded space was just perfect for my son, my dog, and I. We visited the local museums and shops. Were able to relax and unwind in the space that gave the feel of being off the grid. My son already asked if we can visit again."
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Had a great time staying in Marlene's loft. It's a lovely little space, perfect for two people, separated from the main house to give you a sense of privacy. It was well kept and had coffee, soap, and snacks provided when we showed up. Great central location to get anywhere on the cape, too. We ran into some pests initially but Marlene came by as soon as we asked and solved that problem while we were at the beach."
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great stay ! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,This was a nice quaint place to stay in Massachusetts! We will definitely be coming back. Nice place to stay with the dog as well

The shower has amazing water pressure. Adorable balcony over looking a pond. If you love animals you’ll be even more in love with this oasis. Goats, ducks, chickens, and their dog Dylan!
We already can’t wait to go back and stay!
Highly recommend! ☺️"
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Marlene does a wonderful job maintaining the loft, and even went so far as to provide snacks and breakfast cereals for the morning. The loft is located very near central Hyannis, and is a very cozy setting. So glad we chose to stay here!"

2019-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great spot in a convenient location. Marlene was super responsive and checking in was a breeze. The loft is basically a gorgeous studio apartment.

2019-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Marlene’s place is a cute little loft over her garage. The room is very quiet and secluded, and has a nice small balcony which looks out into a wooded area. The rooms were amazingly clean and Marlene had provided nice selection of snacks, some board games, and several options of coffee. Bathroom was a tad tight fit, but not a major inconvenience for a short stay. Highly recommend and would stay here again!"
2019-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This place is a GEM in the midst of Hyannis. Marlene is caring and kind. This is my 2nd trip and I look forward to returning next fall too. Really one of my favorite AirBnbBs in the country

2019-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Marlene's place is one of the beautiful airbnb's I have ever stayed in. The loft was sparkling clean with thoughtful touches. She had even left treats for our dog. I would definitely stay at her place if I am visiting Hyannis again.
2019-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I stayed only a night between my bus ride from Boston and my ferry to Nantucket. It's very peaceful, well equipped and has everything for breakfast or if you need a snack. Close enough to the center. Careful if you walk there, there's a turnaround hard to cross."

2019-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,A great place to stay without the hastle of parking downtown. About a 20 minute walk to the ferry. Loved the special touch of breakfast cereal and milk!
2019-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Marlene's loft is a wonderful little getaway. She has a beautiful property and her loft it a delightful place to stay. This is a very easy walk to the Melody Tent and a short drive to Craigsville Beach. Check in was easy and Marlene had lots of little amenities to make you feel welcome.
2019-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This loft was perfect for a weekend down the Cape! There was plenty of space and privacy. The property was beautiful and the atmosphere was quiet and peaceful. The loft is very close to downtown with less than a 5 minute drive or, if the weather is nice, it makes for a nice walk. Marlene provided breakfast, snacks, water, and coffee for our stay which was a thoughtful touch. Her daughter came to clean our room and restock towels and snacks when we left and she even left some treats for our dog! Overall it was a wonderful experience. I would stay here again and highly recommend it to anyone looking for a place in that area. Thanks, Marlene!"
2019-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Excellent loft for a weekend trip down the cape! Everything was very modern and super clean! Would absolutely recommend!!
2019-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We had a great visit! Marlene's place was perfect... Check in was easy. Marlene was very quick to respond to any questions we had which was greatly appreciated. Our place was clean and loved that we had waters in the fridge and light snacks upon arrival. We had a great visit.
2019-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"My boyfriend and I stayed here when we were seeing a concert at the Melody Tent. We could walk to the venue in under five minutes which was very convenient.

I would recommend this place to anyone looking to spend some time in Hyannis."
2019-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,The Loft is located in a great spot...walking distance to downtown on a nice summer night. The loft itself is spacious and clean....with all of the little extras provided by Marlene! This is a no brainer!
2019-07-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Marlene’s loft in Barnstable was the perfect size for my girlfriend and I to explore the cape and still have a cozy space to return home too each night. Theres a full kitchen minus the stove so plan on eating out. They were quick to respond and very nice from the short time meeting with them. Check them out!
2019-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Everything was perfect
2019-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"An absolutely gorgeous little place tucked away in the middle of a city makes you feel like you are not in an urban environment at all. Completely surrounded by trees at the end of the road provides privacy and comfort. Also, there is a great air conditioning system that was key in the middle of the heatwave. The place was very clean and neat and they tidy up and provide fresh towels every day. Marlene was an awesome host, very willing to help and easy to talk to. Also, there are goats on the property!"
2019-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Great spot, very clean and they always have coffee, food and snacks ready for guests. Our second stay and definitely not our last!"
2019-07-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"Great place for visiting the area.
Easy to check in/out.
Marlene cares for your confort everyday. (Thks. Marlène !)
We missed a (even shared) place to stay/eat outside of the loft.
Cheers !
Phil."
2019-07-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Looks like on the pictures, (a bit dark, cause of trees).
Easy to find and check in, smiling and service minded people at the receptio.
Very clean.
Basic breakfast : cereals, milk, coffee, tea) .
Goodies provided daily.
(thks for the Oreo's).
Close to Islands ferries and all sites around : easy to get to drives to lots of nice places.
We would stay again here next time !"
2019-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The loft space is absolutely adorable and full of thoughtful amenities that made our stay both memorable and convenient. Very clean and tidy. As a whole, the property is beautiful and well-maintained. The location is perfect — walking distance from Hyannis Main St. and a short drive from the best beaches on the central Cape. The two goats on the premises, Bella and Stella, are so cute and clearly well cared for. Thanks for a lovely stay, Marlene and Maureen!"
2019-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,a beautiful place
2019-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Beautiful, scenic and serene private loft just outside of Yarmouth was everything you could need for a getaway from the beaches and the bay."
2019-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great host. Quick communication. Location was a quick walk to the center and to the ferry port. The place was clean and welcoming. My husband and I had a great time and would definitely stay here next time we visit the cape.
2019-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a great stay at Marlene's place. Nice room, super clean, appreciated the cereal, milk, bottled water and snacks. Great location at one end of main street in Hyannis, but off the main road and very quiet."
2019-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This was my first Airbnb experience and it was amazing! The loft had so many thoughtful and smart touches, and it was located on the cutest property. Can’t wait to come back!"
2019-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Wonderful little space! Close to Main Street and even just a mile from a beach where we walked with the dog early morning! So many useful things to do in the manual and great thoughtful touches like small snacks, coffee/tea and oatmeal!"
2019-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My husband and I stayed here with our senior cocker spaniel and it was perfect. So cute and secluded so you feel like you're in a secluded area of the woods, but are really close to everything Hyannis and surrounding areas have to offer. It was extremely clean, had sweet touches (extra soap/shampoo/conditioner, treats for our pup, coffee/milk, snacks for us), and was just a great stay all around. We would highly recommend and would stay there again!"
2019-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Exactly as advertised. So close to the Melody Tent. Will definitely be back!
2019-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Our stay over the weekend was wonderful. The location is great. Close to the beach and downtown Hyannis but far enough away that the only thing heard with the windows open were the birds chirping. The loft was very clean and nicely appointed. Marlene had lovely touches in the loft with snacks, coffee, cereal and milk as well as individual shampoos and soaps. We were traveling with our dog and Kitty the housekeeper left some little treats. They also restocked the snacks when we were out. Check in was a breeze. We arrived very late on our first night and they kept the place brightly lit awaiting our arrival. The hosts were friendly and welcoming. We will be coming back."
2019-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Had a great time! Nice location near downtown and super cute loft.
2019-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Marlene's place was wonderful! So many thoughtful touches such as tea/coffeee, snacks, all the bathroom necessities, and great magazines. The queen bed was very comfortable and the shower was so amazing I wanted to stay there as long as I could. The entire place is very clean, spacious and tastefully decorated, definitely comparable to a well-appointed studio apartment. We loved the little porch terrace outside as well. The loft access by an outdoor and indoor staircase was very convenient. Our only regret is we did not have enough time to really enjoy the woodland retreat with the peaceful meditation area and cute farm animals as we arrived late in the evening and had to catch our island ferry early the next morning. If you plan to take a ferry to either Martha's Vineyard or Nantucket Marlene's place is only a 6 minute drive to the docks, it was perfect for us! I would absolutely stay here again, thank you for being such a wonderful host Marlene!"

The kitchen had plates/bowls and silverware, as well as snacks, cereal, and a coffee maker with coffee. The fridge also contained bottles of water, fruit, and milk.

2018-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Marlene's is a quiet getaway... in the woods at the end of a cul-de-sac. She provided several lively touches: cereal, milk and water, snacks. Loved the little side deck with binoculars for birding! If you have trouble with stairs come prepared to handle 2 flights up to the loft...plenty of hand rails."
2018-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The private loft was very clean, private and quiet. Downtown shops and restaurants were a short distance away. Appreciated the great location on the Cape and the hospitable host. Would definitely return to this lovely place in the woods."

2018-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"A great locale, close to Main Street , the Harbor and beaches but tucked away in a private setting. Sitting on the balcony is like being in a tree-house as you are amidst branches and bird's nests. The loft was clean with many nice touches, snacks, toiletries, and large screen TV, for instance. A very comfortable stay!"

Close to the beach, town and entertainment!"

2018-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Our second time at Marlene’s place. Everything is great as always. The space is beautiful and confortable. One of my best AirBnB experiences to date.
2018-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Not much to say besides the pictures don't do it justice. Right at the end of a dead end road, away from the traffic and lights, but close enough to be convenient (especially for the music tent). Well thought out amenities and the little touches really set this place apart."

2018-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"My husband, young son, and I stayed at the loft for a long weekend at the Cape. It was perfect! The space was super clean and well-stocked. The shower was amazing! We loved being able to walk into downtown Hyannis in the evenings, and the place is just a short drive from several good beaches. This was a great spot for a great price! Would highly recommend it!"
2018-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"My wife and I stayed a single night at the Loft, and I can say that Marlene sets the bar for hospitality with attention to every detail. She was flexible about the check-in time, allowing us to arrive when it was most convenient. Everything was incredibly clean when we arrived. Local tips and hotspots were outlined in a binder. Coffee, tea, water and some light breakfast items were set out for us. The loft was private and comfortable, decorated on theme with the area.
If we are ever back in the area, we will definitely try to stay with Marlene again!"
2018-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Beautiful property! Lovely place!
2018-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"The place was great. Very close to downtown and the beaches, yet it sat back in the woods and made you feel as though you were out in the country.
The loft was larger than the photos suggested. Perfect size for our small family."
2018-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Marlene’s home is a special place. Located on a nature habitat it was nestled in a private space surrounded by gardens. The amenities were abundant and thoughtful making for a very welcoming atmosphere. The home is located a very short walk away from the Melody Tent in Hyannis where the concerts are spectacular. We look forward to returning!
2018-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This space was perfect for the two of us. We were visiting Hyannis to see a concert at the Melody Tent and we could walk right down the street to it. The space is private, clean and very comfortable. Marlene thought of everything including milk in the little fridge ( which also has a nice freezer space), cereal, wine glasses, tea, coffee and even a reusable shopping bag! The grounds were fun to explore with 2 adorable goats and 2 chickens. Many sitting spaces on the grounds and nestled in the gardens. We may look for another concert to attend so we can return. Thanks!!"
2018-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Really lovely little spot and a great location as a jump off point for exploring Cape Cod. Will surely head back next time we are in the area.

2018-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The studio is plenty big for a couple and possibly one child. Marlene was accommodating when we had to shift plans and bring our son. Check in was a breeze. The loft was
Immaculate and had a much appreciated a/c unit. Bed was very comfortable. Location was great - close to downtown Hyannis, the ferry, Craigville Beach (our son skateboarded to the beach - 3 miles), and easy access to main thoroughfare.
The home is definitely private and off the main drag. We liked that. Goats are our favorite and to say hi to them daily was a treat.
Marlene is a great communicator and quick to answer questions."
2018-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"As described by previous guests. Space itself, I might give 4 stars, for tiny little things here and there but everything packaged together was definitely a 5. Privacy was aplenty. Host was very unintrusive. It certainly felt like our own place, which for us was exactly what we were looking for."
2018-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The Loft was wonderful! It was the perfect location for the wedding my wife and I attended in Hyannis!
2018-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This is a beautiful loft space with a nice kitchen nook and a great shower. Very clean space with a nice front yard with lots of cool little statues. We only stayed one night and didn’t get to meet Marlene but if in the area, will definitely come again.
Only thing to note is that Waze tried to get us there through someone else’s driveway so use Google Maps."
2018-07-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,Had a lovely time!

2018-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Marlene’s place is at the end of a street just off the main business district of Hyannis. It is quiet and secluded, yet close enough to the commercial district with its variety of shops and restaurants. She provides all the amenities you could ask for and the apartment is very comfortable. We would not hesitate to stay there again if we are fortunate enough to return to the Cape."
2018-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This place was amazing! We wanted to move in. They were very considerate hosts and had many special touches. It is a beautiful property and within walking distance to town.
2018-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Great space. The place was spotless, there were snacks for walks and breakfast cereals - even little cartons of milk for us. There was also a folder with guides and recommendations for things to do in the area. I wish we were able to stay longer!"

2018-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Easily the best Airbnb I've stayed at yet! The space was so beautiful and had tons of little touches and cute items. We loved the coffee and cereal as well as the snacks. Maureen and Marlene came out to greet us and they were so friendly! They even walked us around their property and let us meet their baby goats. I highly recommend this Airbnb!
2018-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Perfect place!!! Loved all the thoughtful touches

2018-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"5 stars and then some! We had such a great experience staying at this loft retreat. It was affordable, but certainly didn't skip on cleanliness, hospitality, location, or anything of the things you'd expect to find at an expensive spot on the Cape. I'd stay here again over a hotel any day! It was wonderful to have a dog friendly spot to stay and the hosts checking in on the pup while we were out was just incredible! I can't wait to stay here again! Such a gem in an amazing location! One regret was not making plans to go to the Melody Tent because it's so close and a cool spot! West End (a hip dinner/ bar location) is also walking distance! This was the perfect location for a couple and a pup!"
2018-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This a cute little loft that is perfect for a quick getaway. We saw the baby goats on our last day and it was the best moment of my life. Great location near lots of Hyannis attractions and restaurants.
2018-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great little loft which felt very private away from the main home. The loft was very clean and well equipped with snacks and breakfast cereals as well as being conveniently located a short walk from Hyannis Main Street.

2018-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Marlene’s place is in a great location, about a 5-10 minute walk from anywhere on Main Street. The loft had great amenities such as snacks, breakfast cereals and also some water bottles etc.
Overall Marlene’s place had a big impact on the stay in Hyannis."
2018-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We have stayed in multiple Airbnb’s in the US and abroad and this was by far the best one yet. The place was much more spacious than we expected, we were pleasantly surprised by how huge the loft turned out to be. The lift was extremely clean and the location is beautiful. It is in the midst of a lot of greenery so you truly feel like you are on vacation. There are a lot of great personal touches - water bottles, chips, milk and cereal. It is really close to downtown Hyannis so the location was great too!"
2018-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This loft is a lovely private getaway that is conveniently located close to Main St Hyannis...and other attractions. The room is very comfortable with every thing you could need. Will come back again!

2017-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Marlene's loft was so charming, clean, and beautiful. She was such a thoughtful host, too -- we had plenty of clean towels, a keurig coffee machine with capsules, and a super cute yet effective space heater. Her place also has a small outdoor deck with two chairs and a lovely view of trees.
We had a wonderful time staying there and liked how it was an easy commute to both Provincetown and other beaches along cape cod."
2017-10-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"Need to drive to Main Street.
Halloween decor is awesome!"
2017-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"So appreciated attention to detail and touches of comfort like the extra padded floor, fresh towels on day two, and total ease of check in. I'll never stay in a hotel in Hyannis again. Dibs on this spot! Highly recommend."

When the power went out due to the storm we were provided with a lantern right away. Highly recommend this place"
2017-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful little Cape Cod apartment!

2017-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a lovely stay in Hyannis at Marlene's loft. The surroundings are very quiet, and the loft was perfect - comfortable, totally adequate in all respects. She has thought of everything to make one's stay a perfect 10!"
2017-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great place. Would've been even better with a car.
2017-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"You honestly won't find a better place for the value. Marlene took great care of us, and the location is incredible! I can't recommend it enough."
2017-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Marlene was a great host and very accommodating! The space was great very close to downtown but so quiet and peaceful. She left us snacks, waters and coffee. Could not have asked for a better host and the place was perfect for us!"

2017-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"DARLING loft...
Marlene's studio loft was very charming. The attention to detail in this loft was exceptional, from the adorable decorating, nice furnishings, comfortable bed, luxurious towels, and many snacks that she provided... everything was perfect."
2017-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"A nice and spacious apartment in the middle of Cape Cod. Restaurants, shops, beaches and bike trail are close.
Marlene is careful and left lots of snacks for the breakfast, apero or sudden little hungers."
2017-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Marlene was an outstanding host. I have used airbnb well over a handful of times- and Marlene was hands down the best host I could have possibly asked for. We arrived during the solar eclipse and she let us use her special glasses to see it. That set our vacation off to a great start! We were only there for 3 days but Marlene provided us with lots of boxed cereal's, breakfast bars, juices, apples, etc. it was well betond expectations- and helped make the trip spectacular. Marlene even tidied up the space while we were out for the day- and noticed we had struggled to open a wine bottle without a corkscrew – so she left one on the counter for us. Everything was more than what we could have asked for, and we can't wait to come back!"
2017-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,The loft was better than I ever anticipated. I was impressed with the level of comfort and cleanliness. The snacks provided really added a personal touch. This was so much better than a hotel! I would love to stay here again! -Jon

2017-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,The place was very spacious and clean. Conveniently located very close to the Main Street area in Hyannis. Thoroughly enjoyed the level of privacy – would definitely recommend!
2017-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Clean, idyllic, close but not too close to everything, and our hosts were gracious and warm. I almost don't want to write a review because I want to keep this gem to myself. But this deserves all the accolades. We can't wait to go back."
2017-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We highly recommend staying at Marlene's loft. It was so clean and comfortable. It was also in walking distance to our favorite places in town which made it very convenient. We are already planning our next trip!
2017-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Marlene's place was just as advertised. It was very clean and comfortable. We arrived late as we had an evening wedding and Marlene was so gracious and left the lights on for us. She was only a text or call away which was great. We definitely recommend staying here!!!👍👍👍
2017-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Calling this a ""retreat"" is spot on. Marlene gave us a warm welcome, and we quickly settled in to the beautiful corner of Cape Cod she's created. We loved the breeze flowing through the open windows and on the back porch. The loft was roomy and had all the amenities you could want. The restaurants and harbor of Hyannis are right around the corner when you're ready to explore. Highly recommended!"
2017-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Really enjoyed my stay at Marlene's loft. Great location that is close to all the fun stuff in the area but still manages to feel secluded and private. The loft looks even better in real life than it does in the pictures. Everything was really clean, there were some snacks out for us, and it just felt super nice and cozy. Good vibes all around. Definitely recommend to anyone looking to stay in the Hyannis area, especially couples and solo travelers."
2017-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was our second time staying here and we loved it! Quiet, peaceful, very clean and plenty of space for yourself because it is a loft apartment above a detached garage. It was a nice relaxing place to come home to after a day at the beach. Also within walking distance to downtown Hyannis shopping and restaurants, so the best of both worlds!"
2017-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Marlene was an excellent host. The room was clean and comfortable. She had snacks and coffee waiting for us in the room. The location was peaceful and secluded yet still walkable to restaurants in downtown Hyannis. We loved it!
2017-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very clean and wonderful location to downtown. Very quiet and peaceful. Would recommend to any couple going for a nice vacation!
2017-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Marlene provided everything we needed to make our stay so comfortable. Would definitely rent again, and recommend!"
2017-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Marlene's place is great! very clean and private. She also provided us with a bunch of snacks ,juices and coffee which was a nice touch. Everything you need is just a short drive away. We had such a great time there and will definitely be back to her place again! Thank you :)"
2017-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful loft!
Located on country grounds in town. Cleanliness assured and maintained during our stay!
Service ***** *! Minutes to downtown and the ferry.
Perfect welcome! Don't hesitate, quality / price is great ."
2017-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This space is phenomenal! The posting completely undersells it. The loft is above a detached garage, and it is a pristinely kept space with a very private entrance at the end of a very quiet dead-end street. Located less than a half mile from the restaurants in the heart of Hyannis, the location is truly the best of both worlds. Marlene responded almost immediately to my inquiries. When I arrived and found there were snacks and suggestions for dinner and a well-kept, tidy room I knew that this was one of the best bargains on the cape. Would recommend 100%."
2017-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Such an adorable little loft perfect for a couple visiting the beach! Close to shops and restaurants, and a short drive for activities in Yarmouth! Would definitely stay here again!"
2017-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We had a great stay at the loft this week! The property is so beautiful and on quiet street not too far from downtown. Looks like a hot new restaurant opened up at the main corner in walking distance but we didn't make it. Marlene left the doors unlocked for us and we let ourselves in. The loft is a great size for a couple and the bed was comfy. I loved hearing the chickens in the morning and noticed a few goats and even a bunny running around. Loved the snacks she left for us like cereal, granola bar and even milk and apples."
2017-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The place looked adorable from the pictures, and was even better in person. There were instructions for a lockbox, but when we arrived we ran into the host, who had just unlocked the loft for us. The place itself is adorable -- a great back porch, little kitchenette and SUPER comfortable bed -- but even better was the location. It was less than a mile to downtown, so we could leave our car and explore on foot, too. The kitchen had basic silverware, plates, a fridge and a microwave. We made our own breakfasts and packed lunches there no problem. We were also restocked with water and some other goodies (apples, granola bars, juice, cereal) each morning, which was a nice touch. There was nothing at the Melody Tent while we were in town but it would be a great place to stay if you were catching a show there. The property itself is charming. We were greeted by a rooster each morning, and could see a goat on property too. We also got the chance to meet two adorable dogs! Would absolutely stay here again."
2017-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"It is close to the beaches, very close to main street. Be ready to get up early with the rosters.
Clean and comfortable."
2017-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We absolutely loved this place! So close to the melody tent and walkable to the downtown. Marlene was a great host. We would love to come back!

2017-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,The loft was absolutely perfect! Very cozy and clean. Marlene was very accommodating and hospitable. I would recommend anyone to stay in this location. It was a great weekend!
2017-07-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"Marlene was a great host for my parents who were staying at this loft. It was immaculately clean, so comfortable, had all the snacks and breakfast fixings already in the fridge, and a beautiful little outdoor space. It definitely feels like your in the country, but close to everything. You might hear a rooster early, so just one thing to be aware of but a great place overall."

The studio has all the necessities and is quite spacious. The studio has a great balcony amongst the trees and I loved waking up to the sounds of their chickens. The beach, restaurants, and night life are about a 5-10 minute drive as are grocery stores. Highly recommend!"

2017-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was a nice secluded space. It was like staying in a studio apartment. The house and loft are tucked away from the hussle and bussle of the main area of Hyannis yet very close with only a few minute car ride. It is located very close to the ferries, shops and restaurants. Marlene kept water, cereal, juice, and a few other goodies stocked. The water was helpful after walking around a lot. The a/c was a little noisy when it turned off and on but otherwise it was cool and enjoyable. Thank you, we enjoyed our stay!"
