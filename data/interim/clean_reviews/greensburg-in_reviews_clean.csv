2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The selfish side of me wants to tell you that Mary Kay, Joe and even Benny the cat are sub par hosts at best and their listing is not worth a glance, but I‚Äôd be flat out lying if I said that solely to keep this hidden gem all to myself. Truth is Mary Kay and Joe are absolutely exceptional, knowledgeable, and cordial hosts. Their place is not only immaculate and well appointed, but ideally located to anything you might want to do in the tristate area. We were welcomed like family by our new found friends and felt right at home from the moment we arrived. The self check in was a breeze and the detailed binder of ‚Äúthings to know‚Äù was easy to find and follow. Mary Kay and Joe even went as far as lending us their cat so we wouldn‚Äôt miss our cats back home. Hands down ideal lodging and super friendly, amazing hosts and cat that I can‚Äôt wait to get back to see again. I highly recommend you see for yourself how incredible this stay and the hots truly are. Safe travels my fellow airbnb‚Äôers"

We got in at 2am and I didn‚Äôt worry about my dogs being wound up from the trip because they were able to run and get all their energy out before we climbed into bed.

The place is really nice, quiet, and in a very nice neighborhood. It‚Äôs a stand alone guest house. Perfect for one or a couple.
I was so impressed I booked a series of nights over the next two months for my local visits."

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"While this studio was modern, beautiful and spotless as advertised in a gorgeous location, the hosts were the absolute best part about this listing. They are very friendly and welcoming yet not intrusive, and when my car broke down, they bent over backwards helping me arrange a rental car and even ‚Äúinfluencing‚Äù the repair shop to move me to the head of the line. Thank you just doesn‚Äôt seem adequate to express how I feel about the experience and my hosts. They turned my miserable, hopeless feeling of being stranded into one of my best Airbnb experiences. Until we meet again!"

2023-05-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"We were in town for a wedding and Brent and Susan‚Äôs studio was a wonderful place to stay for our visit.
When we arrived, Brent gave us a helpful intro tour of the studio to show us how to get in, where things were, etc.
The space is lovely - the windows let in tons of natural light, the furniture was all very comfortable, the kitchenette is a good size for one or two people, and it‚Äôs above a stand-alone garage/shop, so you aren‚Äôt sharing a wall or anything with your hosts. The neighborhood is very quiet and pleasant to walk around while still being close to Batesville proper and easy to access from the interstate."

It had all the amenities I needed and the setting was amazing (especially with the colorful fall leaves). I slept like a baby in the quiet setting and comfortable bed.
Brent was an extremely gracious host and took the time to meet me and show me around the apartment when I checked in. He told me the wifi had been recently upgraded, and I could definitely tell. It was blazing fast and more than adequate for business or pleasure.
I would definitely recommend this hidden gem if you ever find yourself in Batesville or the surrounding areas."
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The pictures do no justice! Loved the place! Gerald‚Äôs wife was very kind and showed me around when I got in. Definitely will be staying again!
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Wonderful place to stay, I was in for a week to see a friend but still needed a quite place to work during the day. Everything was perfect, and wonderful people. However, the internet was quite slow. I never got above 5 mbps on each Speedtest I ran, that made having multiple Teams meetings a day quite slow and blurry. But otherwise I have zero complaints. Beautiful location for this time of year the leaves changing colors were absolutely magnificent."
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The unit was perfectly fine. Everything was clean, the bed was comfortable and no issues checking in or out. Always a great place to stay!"

We will fire sure come back ! Thanks for all‚Äô !"
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"If you need a place to stay in or around eastern Indiana, this Airbnb is definitely the one to rent! Gerald and his wife keep it extremely clean and well appointed. Although I have problems with stairs, they kindly helped me haul my numerous bags up into their unit, and the sturdy railings enabled me to negotiate the stairs myself.
Their location is a bit tricky to find initially, but once you do find it, the drive within their neighborhood is quite stunning.
Finally, there is a railroad running close behind the unit, but short trains come by only occasionally.
I highly recommend renting Gerald's unit!"

there is a train track very close to the place, but the train passing through is infrequent."

2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The studio was perfect for us, Gerald Brent was a great host. He greeted us when we arrived, gave us a tour of the apartment and made sure we were comfortable. It was really nice to meet him.
The studio had plenty of room for two people to be comfortable, and felt very private. The neighborhood and property are beautiful. I really wish I could have just sat outside the studio and enjoy the wooded setting instead of going to the wedding we were in town for. :)
The studio has everything you probably need. We made use to the kitchenette by refrigerating and reheating leftovers. It's a simple drive to restaurants in Batesville, New Point and Oldenburg. If I'm ever in the area again, I will absolutely stay here."

2021-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"If you are looking for a place that is private, quiet and homey, this is it. Far enough off the beaten path that you feel like you are in the quiet country. However, you are only 5 minutes from great local spots, business locations and the interstate. If you are passing through on I74, I would highly recommend this quaint little spot as you overnight!"
2021-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great space, spotless and quiet. I love staying in the Airbnb."
2021-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Perfect separate entranced, spacious studio apartment in a quiet, residential, wooded neighborhood.
Hosts were most welcoming and made sure we had all the information we needed for an effortless stay."
2019-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is a lovely studio apartment nestled inconspicuously in a beautiful upscale quiet neighborhood. The apartment itself provides all the conveniences of home whether you want to prepare a home cooked meal, work or relax in the comfortable bed and watch TV. The hosts are accessable but not intusive and are MORE than accommodating. This is a real hidden treasure in Southeastern Indiana."
2019-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I can‚Äôt say how impressed we were. We have stayed all over the world with Airbnb. You know how some pictures portray the accommodation to be better than what it actually is? Well the pictures of this place don‚Äôt do it justice. Beautiful neighborhood, beautiful home and beautiful accommodation. We are beyond grateful for the flexibility of the owner and how down to earth and welcoming they were. Plus they recommended Izzys for breakfast! Literally the best breakfast burrito I have ever had and I used to live in Texas where b-burritos are king. Thank you again for everything and we will be back."
2019-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was not only a beautiful place to stay, the Brents were like talking with family. The space provided a refuge for us while we looked at housing possibilities in the surrounding areas."

2019-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Brent and Susan's studio is impeccable and a pure gem! Brent and Susan clearly spent a significant amount of time planning to make a space that is inviting, comfortable and makes you want to move in! I have never stayed at a Airbnb where I felt more at home; and, quite frankly wish I had found the studio earlier (I had been staying in hotels for business for a few weeks). Subsequently, I reserved the studio for several weeks thereafter. The studio is set in a upscale private neighborhood and not a single detail has been missed. This property is for people who enjoy fine amenities, impeccable cleanliness and are willing to respect the property as if they are at their own home."
2019-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Expect to be WOWED!! Much more than advertised. Brent was a wonderful host. Peaceful, beautiful and very tasefully decoracted."

2019-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Nice place to stay.
2019-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Gerald Brent's place was great. More than big enough for the two of us. He even had Kroger cards for us to use (the only grocery store in Batesville). The recessed ceiling lights in the kitchen and family areas really made the loft look bright. Locks on the outside door and on the inside loft door (same key) made us feel safe but so did the whole neighborhood. Everything you'd need in Batesville, restaurants, groceries, library, golf, etc. was less than seven minutes away."
2019-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Pristine conditions like it was just constructed. Very peaceful !

2019-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place was lovely, way exceeded my expectations considering there are very few options to stay in Batesville. My favorite part was the privacy, as well as the gorgeous nature views on all sides of the room. The spot is extremely tranquil and quiet making it ideal for business travel as well as a getaway. It is clear Gerald and Susan highly prioritize their space, and care deeply about making it as perfect as possible for their guests. Will absolutely return to this spot and recommend to anyone I know staying in the area. Thanks again for everything!"
2019-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We had a great stay! The loft is warm and inviting, and larger and even better than we had expected from the photos.

2018-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The apartment was great - very new, and very clean. It was in a very nice neighborhood in a scenic part of Indiana. We were travelling from Chicago on our way to Kentucky after work on a Friday night, and the owners were very accommodating with our late check in. We would definitely stay there again if travelling that way!"
2018-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Sparkling clean and very comfortable! A relaxing, private get away. We hope to return some day. You were a great host - and thanks for the tip on the place for breakfast!"
2018-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Gerald Brent is a perfect host. He met us and showed us everything we needed to know for our stay. He offered recommended places to see, eat in the area (to include a charming diner nearby), and responded immediately upon our arrival and prior to our stay. Gerald's place is open, clean, and nicely decorated. We liked the lamps that charged our phones and the bed was super comfy. We would recommend staying here to our friends and family."
2018-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My second stay here, highly recommend it if you, like me, need a quiet touchdown somewhere in between Cincy and Indianapolis. Clean, private, and well-appointed."

2018-01-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Great place to stay
2018-01-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"The studio apt. is perfect for long term or short stays. The space is set up to make you feel like it is your home away from home. The apt. looks exactly like it is pictured. Perfect location for quiet time and relaxation. I would highly recommend this space to future travelers, you won't be disappointed."
2017-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We would highly recommend Gerald Brent's studio. It is very nicely appointed, immaculate and exceeded our expectations. The only downside would be if stairs are a problem for someone since it is a 2nd story studio."
2017-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"What great hosts! Their interactions were above and beyond nice. My wife was feeling under the weather and they left a little care package for us, and the morning we were leaving our car battery was dead, and they came out got our car running! We couldn't have asked for better. Above and beyond our expectations!!!!"
2017-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,You will not be disappointed! This apartment is the perfect blend of comfort and style. The personal touches make it feel like home. Brent went out of his way to make us feel welcomed. We would recommend this place to anyone and hope to return in the future.
2017-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Spacious studio apartment with lots of light backing up onto a lovely wooded area. Thoughtful placement of comfortable furniture made every need a delight. Brent came out to meet me when my exit was closed and had me follow him in to the destination, then helped me get around town -- a huge help! Stayed two nights and was extremely comfortable. There was a train one night (the apartment is about 40 feet from the track) but it was early enough that it didn't bother me, but I wore earplugs just in case. One tiny thing is there is bright light on the left and in the front of the bathroom mirror, which made it hard to see my makeup on my right side. Could use a light to the right. Other than that, perfect stay. Highly recommended!"
2017-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Our stay was perfect...wish we‚Äôd have planned for a longer visit. The apartment is set up conveniently and feels big. It had everything we needed and more! The bed was so comfortable and the view from our room was lovely. We‚Äôll definitely be back!
2017-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful and immaculate studio apartment that was in a very lovely and quiet neighborhood.

2017-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Amazing place to stay, everything was all we could ask for. They do a great job with being available for late check in, and checking out is extremely easy. The space is above his work studio in the garage and is 20 steps away from his house if anyone was wondering. I will stay again if work brings me this way."
2017-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"If you are looking for a quiet, very clean, well appointed place, this Airbnb fits the bill! Gerald greated us promptly upon arrival, showed us our space and answered our questions. Very comfortable bed, well lit room and a fully stocked kitchen and bathroom. This is a 5-star private place and perfect for weary travelers. Highly recommended."
2017-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,An awesome studio apartment in a great neighborhood. Mr. Brent was very accommodating with our late arrival. The studio was immaculate and we were very impressed with the attention to detail within the studio. My wife forgot her hair dryer but no worries she spotted a hair dryer in the bathroom. Loved the fact there was wifi available. Mr. Brent's place is a gem and a must stay if you are looking in the area.
2017-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,The place was terrific we would stay there again.
2017-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Brent's place is so beautiful, new, and clean. Lots of light. And he was there to greet us and show us around. He also checked in with us a day later to be sure we had everything we needed. We had a sense of being well cared for and welcomed. I highly recommend his place. (Yes, train tracks are real close, but after the first one, didn't really notice it anymore. And I'm really sensitive to noise ordinarily.) We'd stay here again, definitely!"
2017-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"A great private stay! This apartment is seperate from the main house and in a very nice and safe neighborhood. The apartment was immaculately clean and all appliances and utilities looked to be brand new! Susan and Brent were very communicative when needed and were helpful with last minute changes we had. Comfortable bed and chairs, with a good shower and wifi made for a great stay. Thank you!"

2017-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Anyone booking at this location will be extremely satisfied with everything! Brent and Susan have done a great job at offering a private studio and all the amenities that are included. The furnishings, decorating, and cleanliness was impeccable. We checked in late and it was a breeze communicating with Brent to get access to the apartment. Susan makes delicious cookies!! We would recommend this to anyone in the area."
2017-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Gerald's listing was the perfect stopping point for me and my fianc√© ""babymoon"". Gerald and his wife were welcoming and lovely people to speak with. The suggestions they gave made our stay and trip a Homerun, such as the restaurant suggestions in New Point. The listing felt very safe and secluded, and the neighborhood was absolutely gorgeous and quiet. For anyone traveling the Batesville area, I would highly recommend Gerald's place as a must stop!"
2017-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Immaculate little 2nd floor walk up apartment, in a separate building. Woodsy setting is like a rural get away. Lovely modern furnishings, great AC. Best Airbnb we've experienced so far."

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We were on a road trip and ported in to Richard's lovely apartment for the night. The host thinks of every detail for a comfortable stay! We loved the deck with its shady maple tree and bucolic view, a perfect place for a relaxing evening after a long journey. It's close to highways yet peaceful. If you are ok with one flight of stairs (which Rick, of course, discloses), don't even think twice. l"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Host was great, very good recommendations and information. Would definitely stay there again , the unit is super nice."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is truly a first class Airbnb with great energy. Everything was perfect from the well equipped kitchen, to the pristine bathroom, the great deck etc. We could not have been happier. Stayed 3 nights. Could have stayed more.

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Richard‚Äôs apartment Airbnb was very clean and had all the amenities and extras that I would not expect. Refrigerator was stocked with water, cokes, etc. bread"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Our first impression is: your home is beautiful! It's impeccably clean, fresh and new! We love it! Some people in our age group, 64/80, may have difficulty with the stairs, but we live in an older home and climb stairs everyday of our lives! Great exercise!
We did eat at Lil' Charlie's. We were under impressed at first. however, we ordered and the food was outstanding!!!
This is a fabulous start to our Charlotte Trip! The village is charming and filled with history. Thank you for offering this lovely property on Airbnb! We'll definitely recommend it to family and friends!

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Richard‚Äôs place exceeded my expectations. The decor and furnishings are first class. It is spacious, comfortable, and equipped with everything you could want or need‚Ä¶ surrounded by the charm of this quaint little town. This is an exceptional value! I will be back."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We only stayed one night on our way to Kansas but would definitely stay again if given the chance ! The place was easy to find, plenty of parking, very quiet and safe area. The inside was clean, Richard kept it well stocked with everything we would have needed."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This is a wonderful place to stay in the quaint town of Oldenburg. The host included many special touches. You will enjoy your time here.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Very nice place!! Clean and comfy! Enjoyed sitting out on the deck after we went to recommend eatery, Pearl Street Pub! Fun place!! Before checking out the next morning, enjoyed bagels and coffee that was provided! Very sweet and much appreciated!! Would highly recommend this place!! Nice town, friendly people!! Beautiful location!"

2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Very clean and organized. Peaceful vibes, lovely place!"
2024-03-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"Very picturesque scenery, and very quiet. The host outdid himself by stocking the fridge with cold drinks, and supplied everything needed to make a nice breakfast! Everything was squeaky clean and the bed was very comfortable. Despite the cordless blind in the master bedroom refusing to pull down, we slept well. Washer & dryer was also handy to have, and it washed everything up nicely.
We took the host's dinner recommendation and went to Lil Charlie's, and we LOVED IT! I recommend the Tuscan pasta.
The Keurig unfortunately didn't work for us, and we have been Keurig users for years, so I don't think it user error. Not having my morning coffee set things off to a slow start, but thankfully, there was a Scooters Coffee in town. Also, there's no privacy in the living room with the patio door not having any curtains or blinds. I felt like I was in a fish bowl.
Overall, Ricks place definitely has its perks and the host pulled out all the stops to make sure our stay was comfortable."
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Excellent host! Would stay again for sure.
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Located in a small town. It was easy to find , and the host was polite and accommodating. It had everything we needed."
2024-04-01,5.0,Group trip,"This was an amazing spot! The game room is awesome, there are TVs everywhere, and the pond was fun to fish in! This spot if perfect if having a guys weekend!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Group trip,"Perfect for nature lovers! Even able to watch nature from the living room couch! Or the porch couch. Or the swing. Or the screened-in picnic place by the firepit. Pictures can't catch the beauty of the redbuds blooming around the pond or the birds that flit about, serenading us. Nor are pictures accurate inside...the comfy feel in the chairs, the handy room arrangement for a family, the shower in addition to the bathtub in the master bath!
Not far from main roads, but along a quiet, good-paved, country road in a wooded area. A home away from home in every sense! A place to spend top-quality family time!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The pictures do not do this property justice- it has an absolutely tranquil setting. What you can't see in the pictures- is the sounds of nature that surround you. We really enjoyed paddle boating and many actives that are available.
The home was very clean and the host responsive, welcoming and gracious. We rented this property due to its location being in the totality of the 2024 solar eclipse- but hope to return again in the future just to enjoy this hidden gem ."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Nice place. Quiet and secluded. You have to travel for big stores, but there are plenty of restaurants nearby. Really close to nice parks and walking trails. Would recommend"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,I will stay there again. I loved everything about it. A five star place to live while visiting my family. I can say it was an excellent place to stay. Love it. Thank you. Suellen Stamps

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Seven springs hideaway was the perfect weekend getaway! It was the first time our entire family has been away together in 9 years! There was plenty of room for all 15 of us! The property was beautiful and peaceful! The house was stunning! So glad we chose Susan's home to celebrate our Mom's 70th birthday together! We would love to come back for another visit! We will be telling all our family/friends about it!
2024-06-01,5.0,Group trip,"WE LOVE THIS PLACE!! 9 of us friends stayed here. Peaceful, yet packed with fun is the only way to describe this place. We enjoyed the hot tub surrounded by nature, caught bass, bluegill, and catfish in the pond, and played pool. Plenty of room for everyone. The property was extremely clean and well taken care of. The kitchen in the basement was so convenient! We loved our stay so much that our group will be returning from now on for a yearly fishing retreat! (If we can wait another year!) highly recommend! Thanks, Susan!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Group trip,"This place was amazing, would definitely come back again to stay! It‚Äôs beautiful, peaceful & you feel right at home. Susan was also very helpful & responsive if we had a question! Thank you so much for having us! :)"
2024-04-01,5.0,Group trip,"I cannot say enough great things about the stay at this gorgeous home and Susan as a host. We went for the eclipse, and to avoid traffic on the way, I asked to arrive a bit early. Susan was more than accommodating although we were an eager bunch.
The house, grounds and view are stunning. There were only 8 of us, but the house would be absolutely perfect for a larger gathering. All the beds were comfortable, the entire house we spotless and we loved the reclining couches and pool table.
Can‚Äôt rave enough- if you‚Äôre considering booking this spot do it NOW!"

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Me and my family rented this beautiful place for Easter weekend and trust me, it did not disappoint. My family is already planning on going back.
The house inside is well decorated and very spacious. The kitchen has almost everything you could ever need( well stocked). Bedrooms were comfortable. Master suite has a jetted tub (very relaxing) and a very nice stand up shower. There is plenty of space in this house.
Outside the house has a hot tub and a pond. The hot tub area is nice. It has a little area to sit and start a small fire.( small fire pit). Wife loved it. Has lights and a blue tooth stereo. Also has a unique swing that everyone liked getting on.
The pond was my favorite place. It is off the basement level of the house. Has a medium fire pit. Burnt a lot of wood there. You can cook steaks over the flame using this fire pit. The pond itself is stocked with Catfish and Bass.
I definitely recommend this place to anyone !!!"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Was a great place,roomy,quiet and relaxing.Our children weren't ready to leaveüíØ.Even got to see deer around pond.Was a chilly weekend so we didn't get a chance to go outside,as it got great area to wonder around....."

The house was very clean and kept up. We love sitting out on the back deck just visiting with family and enjoying the peacefulness of the property. I would highly recommend this place to anyone. The host was very responsive the few times that I texted him."

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"This was a great stay! The view off the decks was amazing! The welcome basket with things we may have forgotten, cozy blankets next to the couch, cookies on the stove, fresh flowers, and stocked kitchen made us feel welcome right from the start. The house was so well-planned for families or friend groups, and the host was so responsive with a quick answer. Thank you for sharing this place with others!!"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We loved this spacious river get away! It was homey and the outside was beautiful! This was a much needed getaway back into nature. We are already planning our trip back!
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Tom's place was a very comfortable home for our mini-family reunion of adult siblings and spouses. The view was amazing and the smells of nature envelope you. The main deck was our venue of choice where we grilled steaks and enjoyed each other's company.
Each of the 3 couples had a level of their own with their own bathroom as well. So privacy was there when needed, but plenty of time for togetherness. The house itself has everything you could imagine needing and then some. The massage chair - big bonus. And the homemade cookies upon arrival - nice touch- Yum!
Tom was quick to respond and help when he could, which was so appreciated. It was very clear our comfortable and successful stay was a priority to him."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Evolve and Tom have a great place in North Vernon, IN. Three business associates traveling to the area for meetings. Highly recommend a stay here when visiting the area. Excellent communication. Very clean, comfortable, beautiful and spacious home!!

2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Tom was a great host and the house was perfect for our stay in Indiana. The house easily accommodated our family of four with two teenagers. The basement was a great place for the kids to lounge and relax after a long day of visiting family. The house was clean and we loved having 3 full bathrooms. Although we didn‚Äôt use the kitchen much, it was well stocked. Overall it was a great stay and I anticipate staying there again the next time we are in the area."

I like to cook more than most when we travel, and it had everything I needed - even a crockpot! We had lots of space and everything was very clean. Although we didn't get to explore much, the property was beautiful and peaceful. Communication with the property owner was great - proactive, helpful and friendly."

Great host and a great place!!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,The cabin was perfect for our family of 7 (plus our puppy). The host was always prompt to respond and made sure we had everything we needed. The river was great for the kids and we all loved the massage chair!!
2023-05-01,5.0,Group trip,"Tom was a wonderful host. Had an excellent time here. Working out of town can be difficult sometime however staying in this home away from home such as this, makes all the difference. Thank you for sharing your beautiful slice of heaven!"

2023-03-01,5.0,Group trip,Tom was a terrific host and stayed in contact with us from the day before our arrival until the day we checked out. There were warm cookies in the jar waiting for us! Very beautiful and serene river views. Lots of decks for outdoor enjoyment. It was well kept and the massage chair downstairs quickly became everyone in our groups favorite thing! It was perfect having bedrooms and full bathrooms on all 3 floors. There are a couple of great state parks nearby and the town of Vernon and North Vernon are both very quaint and fun to look around in. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay and will likely book again in warmer weather! Thanks again Tom for your hospitality and kindness.

Instructions are throughout the house exactly where you need them to make your stay comfortable and smooth! Mary Kay made sure I had information just as I needed it and responded quickly to any questions.

2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Mary Kay‚Äôs beautiful home in Oldenburg is a peaceful stop and full of interesting history. We enjoyed staying in this charming home with comfortable beds and many amenities. There were puzzles and activities for our kids to enjoy as we lazily enjoyed a long morning before continuing our road trip. We enjoyed breakfast on the front porch overlooking the small and quiet town of Oldenburg. The hosts were very accommodating as we got into town in the late evening. We would definitely return to this charming home.

2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Such a great place to stay! You simply couldn't ask for a nicer host than Mary Kay.

We were in town visiting family, and staying here was such a blessing. This home is so much nicer than staying in a hotel! Our favorite part was sitting out on the porch in the evenings and listening to the church bells!
A grocery store is a short walk down the hill, so it is easy and convenient to cook a quick meal. There are also several restaurants (and pubs) in walking distance if you prefer not to cook. Oldenburg is a great place to walk around (and safe!).
Thank you Mary Kay (and kitty ... Benny)!"
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Mary Kay is gracious host who thinks of everything and communicates very well. Her home is cozy and well equipped. The view is worth the price alone. What a fantastic value!
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Mary Kay's home was perfect for our quick overnight stay on the way to the Smokies! Oldenburg is the loveliest small town, and the house and views were beautiful. Benny the black cat came to greet us upon arrival- so sweet. The beds were so comfy and everything was very clean. The steam shower was great for our sinuses and our teen son enjoyed the huge upstairs bedroom. She gave super detailed instructions and local restaurant advice, which we took her up on and had a great lunch the next day at Big Four Cafe.
We will 100% be back when coming through the area again."

Mary Kay was friendly and helpful; she had everything we needed to know in a binder.

2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Our stay was wonderful. The house was perfect for our needs and very comfortable. The location was also great with a lovely view of the town. Oldenburg is a beautiful little town and since some of our other destinations were closed due to weather, we got to spend some time just walking around town which was very enjoyable. Mary Kay was very clear with her instructions for check-in and check-out. Overall a great place and a great stay. We hope to return again very soon!"

2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"CLEANEST and MOST PEACEFUL AirBnB I‚Äôve EVER stayed in. I stay in many wonderful Airbnb‚Äôs all over the country. This one actually felt as if it refreshed me:) lol Is that possible? Immaculate!!! Quiet! Comfortable Bed and deep jacuzzi tub. The town reminded me of a small Salt Lake City, because of how clean and well manicured it was. I walked all over that little town and hit a cafe and a little shop in town.
I just can‚Äôt brag on this place enough. I WILL be back. My first time ever meeting the hosts and they are wonderful.
They were caring and communicative but totally give you privacy:)"

2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"If your going to be near Oldenburg, this is definitely the place to stay. The house is beautiful and clean. Mary Kay's description is spot on. There are some low door heights due to the age of the house, but she has warnings on them and my 6' 2"" husband managed fine. Take time to enjoy the village below. The people are friendly and the food is great."

2022-07-01,5.0,Group trip,"this place is awesome. looks straight over the town and what a view. sat on the porch and morning coffee and watched the hummingbirds. bed was comfy upstairs and place was emaculant.

2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Amazing hosts and awesome property. I came for a business trip and would absolutely stay here again!
2022-05-01,5.0,Group trip,"I came from California with a group of friends from all over the country for a camping trip. This house has been an absolute pleasure to stay in, and in my humble opinion has been the best Airbnb I have ever stayed at in my whole life. The host lives within feet of the house in an adjacent property, and was extremely hospitable and kind.
The house was more comfortable than we could have ever hoped for, and despite being on vacation from a profession of cooking, I could not resist but to walk across the street to the local grocery store to prepare a meal for all of my friends as they came separately throughout the evening as I saw how well stocked the kitchen was.*
There was a ground floor bedroom with a half-bath, an upstairs bedroom with an extra futon + covers and extra pillows as well as an extra twin mattress that can be pulled out of a closet. Despite it being intended for 4 guests, our group of 5 managed to stay so comfortably that we all agreed we would be happy to live there permanently.
The kitchen is fully stocked with oils, spices, pots, pans, lids, baking trays, metal mixing bowls, blenders, toasters, 2 coffee machines, coffee, creamer, sugar, basic condiments, a few water bottles to last you long enough to hit the grocery store across the street for more, you name it. It really feels like a lived-in home, and the host makes every effort to ask their guests for input on how to further improve their experience here.
The stove is induction. The sink is an old school one-and-a-half compartment with garbage disposal chute in the smaller compartment. The shower also functions as a steam bath, a bathtub and a jacuzzi. The view of the town below the hill it's on is impossibly gorgeous, especially in the early morning. There are plenty of wine and cocktail glassware. Every common home kitchen tool imaginable is there.
I love this place and 100% am planning to come here again, yes FROM CALIFORNIA, and would love to say hello and pay visit to the host.
One warning I might give, however, is if you are traveling here without a car, Lyft and Uber are nonexistent in Oldenburg, so get a rental or consider arranging transportation ahead of time before stranding yourself with your luggage like I did.
The people in this town are some of the nicest people I've met, and the host is no exception. Please enjoy your stay here at the Haupthaus, it's become the place that housed one of the best nights that will live in my memory forever."
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Great experience!
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The house was very clean, inviting and cozy. The view off the front porch has to be the best view in Oldenburg! The next time we are in the area we will stay here again!"

2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"This was the ideal place to stay for our week-long visit to Oldenburg. The house was very comfortable and well-equipped, and located in a quiet part of the beautiful and peaceful village, a stone's throw from the grocery store and good local eateries. We particularly enjoyed sitting out on the stoop when the weather allowed, and enjoying the view down the hill and towards Oldenburg's famous spires (and feline company!). However, what really made the place special was the kindness and generosity of hosts Mary Kay and Joe, who went out of their way to make sure we had everything we needed and to provide a warm welcome."
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Mary Kay was a great host!

2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"A really nice place to stay! Mary Kay takes such good care of the house and when we were there, even though it was 8 degrees one night, the house was very comfortable. Oldenburg is a neat old town and this house sits in such a perfect location. It was built in 1926 and it's solid!

The host has thought of everything you could possibly need."
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Mary was wonderful. Very informative, responded quickly and was just an overall sweet person.

Can‚Äôt wait to visit again!"
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Beautiful house to stay in. Even better then the description. Wonderful view of the town and in walking distance to everything. Even has a basketball court down the road which my daughter loved to walk to. Even though we had a slight issue with ac unit during our stay we had great communication between Mary and Robert. Everyone was super helpful. Can‚Äôt wait to stay again soon. Thank you.
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This is a wonderful place to stay! Everything was so clean and comfortable. I came to visit for a few days and spent most of the time on the comfy front porch. It is the best view in Oldenburg! Mary Kay is a welcoming hostess and adds little touches to welcome you and makes you feel right at home. Definitely would recommend this little house on the hill for a getaway--I will stay again!
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Mary Kay and Joe are superb hosts. Their house is beautifully decorated with a nautical theme, well stocked with bottled water and many condiments in the refrigerator; toiletries including toothpaste, toothbrushes, soap; hand sanitizer, antibacterial wipes, masks, as well as a kitchen loaded with many spices, and herbs to cook with.
It's a great home for toddlers with the pack n play, high chair and toddler bed included. 
Chips and fresh salsa were waiting for us on the kitchen table. 
In town is Wagner's Village Inn's famous fried chicken, just 2 blocks away. THe Brau Haus with tasty German favorites, such as bratwurst and schnitzel is a close 3 block walk. The house overlooks Oldenberg, and sitting on the front porch we had a beautiful view of the town. 
They live right behind the rental and Joe was readily available with an extra key when our napping grandson was accidentally locked in the house! 
All in all, we had a fantastic stay at Mary Kay and Joe's home. This is THE place to stay if you're in the Oldenberg/ Batesville area!"
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Cute, comfy place with a well-stocked kitchen and walking distance to a couple local German restaurants and pubs. Mary Kay and her husband were very friendly and helpful. Lots of thoughtful touches that made our stay comfortable."

2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"A sweet house with an absolutely lovely view of the town. I spent a week in Oldenburg and spent half of my time sitting outside, working from my laptop and watching the town- it‚Äôs such a picturesque location.
Mary Kay and Joe are very available and kind, we chatted and I even came back from exploring to find a slice of pie and a note on the doorstep. They live behind the rental so if I had any issues (I didn‚Äôt) they could be over in a heartbeat.
I will say there were lots of spiders and bugs outdoors- not unexpected as I visited in the middle of summer- but not a single one indoors. The home itself is spotless and very comfortable. They have thought of everything! From nightlights to fans to the kitchen being fully stocked.
Definitely worth the stop. Thank you both!"
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"What a lovely property! This home was perfectly maintained and full of every essential and amenity you could need, including tons of kids activities.
The charming view over the town was perfect for relaxing. We enjoyed playing a board game and watching a summer storm over the Spires. The jacuzzi tub was a nice bonus!

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Our stay was amazing. The cabin is so impressive, pristine and beyond clean. We are from chicago and would return in a heartbeat.

2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This was the perfect cabin to fit our family of 5 and help us enjoy the peace and quiet of the country! Seeing and knowing the history of this hand-hewn log cabin from the 1800's and being able to enjoy it with some of today's amenities made for the best of both worlds. The kiddos loved the bunk beds, and my wife and I enjoyed the space upstairs. Wonderful firepit out back with prepared chairs made smores night super easy and enjoyable. Joe was always super responsive and helpful with any questions we had. Would gladly book with him again if we're able to get back to the Greensburg area."

Love the main wood burning stove and all the other stoves through out the cabin. I wish we could have been able to also enjoy the outdoor pit and make the smores that Joe had left as a welcome to the cabin. Unfortunately the weather did not allow.
The cabin is so nice and roomy and has many different seating areas to visit, play games, or even watch TV. We enjoyed the beautiful sunsets when possible from the front porch and star gazing from the back porch. They have thought of any and every amenity you could possibly need.
Can't wait to come back! Thank you for the wonderful hospitality. Joe is a wonderful host!"
2022-04-01,5.0,Group trip,"The Red Rose Ranch is a stunning property, with all of the amenities to make your stay pleasant. The bathrooms and kitchen are well-stocked.

2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Johnathan and Renae went ABOVE and BEYOND to make our stay a great one! I have never left a review as good as the one you are about to see here!
They brought in some TV trays for us since I was concerned that the kitchen table wouldn't be large enough for an elaborate game (it was). I had asked if we needed to pick up creamer before arrival since many places provide the powdered stuff. They got us two types of CoffeMate creamer, a fresh bottle of 2% milk, orange juice and even FRESH apple fritters for the morning!
We were thrilled üòÑ!
The refrigerator was full of yogurts, fresh fruits, assorted canned drinks, and a little alcohol. The array of breakfast and snacks provided was impressive.
The bathroom had extra toothbrushes and toothpaste, soaps, shampoos, wet wipes...pretty much anything you might need.
Being a shutterbug, I decided to take a bunch of photos for them to add to their listing if they want.
We will definitely stay again!"
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The house had everything we needed for our trip to Indiana for the MDT Frostbite match. We will definitely look for this place again next year!
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,I can't say enough about Jonathan and his flexibility and hospitality! Due to unfortunate circumstances I had to reschedule what felt like 10 times and Jonathan was totally understand of each time I pushes my stay back and never charged me extra.

First stay we've had that provided toothbrush and toothpaste which is amazing because somehow someone always forgets it at home. Osgood is a small quiet town and it was a treat to stay in the town my mother in law was born and raised. We played the games that were provided and if we needed something the dollar store was in walking distance. We will be back, Johnathan had the best response when we asked about bringing our pets. He understood they were family too and now we have a home away from home üòç."

2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Great spot to stay! We really enjoyed our time!
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,We stayed here for the weekend while we visited with my husband‚Äôs family to celebrate Thanksgiving. They live in Milan so Dilsboro was a great location for us. This house was stocked with EVERYTHING. I would describe this air bnb as better stocked with everything we needed better than our own home. XD This is a great place to stay with kids as the home is super kid friendly. There isn‚Äôt much for our kids to get into. Some air bnb properties have been stressful to bring our kids to with decor or a layout that tempts the kids into damaging items. They had a cute little table with toys for our kids and even left little dog bowls and food for our pets that we brought with us. We felt completely comfortable here. Our favorite family-friendly property we‚Äôve stay so far. We will be back!
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Great clean place with everything you need. Host was very responsive and helpful to accommodate. Thanks again!

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,great host. house was great had everything we couldn't ever need or think of. for sure better then staying in hotel. Jonathan house went extra mile with having shampoos in the shower and other thing you are covered with Incase you forgot something on your trip.

2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"This is the 2nd time Ihave stayed at Jonathan place as I was volunteering for a mountain bike festival at Versailles State Park (hassmerfestival) and the location was very close.
the use if the 2 garage is a big bonus since I could store 4 bicycles and truck inside.
the neighborhood is very quiet and neighbors are respectful.
this is my only choice to stay in this area!
Shopping:
The local meat market Reihls and deli had great ground chuck 80/20 and reasonable price.
Restaurants:
Highly recommend: 1.Crossroads in Versailles and get the tenderloin sandwich. Tenderloin breaded and as big as your head!
2. Wagners in Oldenberg IN. Fried chicken at its best! Fried in cast iron skillets and served family style. Don't expect quick meal as it takes time to get chicken like your grandmother used to make!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,I stayed for a couple of months while my new construction home was being completed. Osgood is a great little community. My dog and I enjoyed the Osgood Trails just a couple miles away and we ventured down to Versailles and Clifty Falls State Parks which are both just beautiful. The house is comfortable and in a nice neighborhood. Jonathan was a great host and I would stay here again.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Great place to stay if you have family around Versailles, Batesville, and Osgood. The yard and quiet road are perfect for pups.

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We have never been to Osgood, we came for a wedding. Jon responded to my questions immediately when planning my trip. We were absolutely delighted with the house.

2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Jonathan was very helpful and responsive. We were coming in late, and he prepared the futon and air mattress for us. That was one less thing to worry about after a long drive. We were glad there was food for breakfast as well. All in all, it was what I expected, and I was glad we were able to rest before we moved on in our travels."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Jonathans place to stay was amazing. It was well kept and he even stocked it with some food for us to eat. He was very easy to work with and responsive to any qyestions we had. Staying there made our trip so much better. Also, he doesnt leave you with a chore list before you leave. Like all Airbnb's should be, he includes the complete cleaning in the price and cleaning fee.
I would highly recommend staying in his crash pad if you are in that area. It was well worth it!"

Jonathan had several breakfast & snack options in the kitchen like yogurt, bananas, coffee & creamer & treats. The house is in a small town just north of Versailles State Park. It was easy to drive to local restaurants & small grocery stores. The house was comfortable & had a nice back porch to relax on. When we forgot an item after check out, Jonathan knew exactly where it was & also found a shirt we left & had washed it for us! We were grateful for this rental option near our work & would stay again if in the area."

2023-11-01,5.0,Group trip,Katrina‚Äôs place was great! Cozy country cottage!
2023-10-01,5.0,Group trip,"Beautiful house, nice location, owner quickly responds to any questions"

2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Peaceful weekday getaway close to Flat Rock River camp where I was working. Beautiful surroundings. Katrina was friendly, quick to respond to questions and flexible. I would stay here again in a heartbeat."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was truely an amazing stay, worth every penny, such a beautiful place and surroundings. Was so peaceful and quiet and a wonderful breeze almost nonstop from when we got there till we left. I look forward to our next vacation here."
2023-05-01,5.0,Group trip,peaceful country setting.
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Katrina's place was a nice stop for us for the night as my family and I were passing through the area. Clean and cozy space. Katrina was very responsive and kind. She provided the right level of instructions and assistance.
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The house was so cute. Pretty large kitchen that allowed four of us to cook all meals with plenty of room. There is only one bathroom, but it is very spacious and it was no problem sharing it. The surroundings were beautiful and very private. Beautiful view of sunrise from front porch. The home decorations were just enough to be charming and not cluttered. I slept in the master bed and I found it very comfortable. House is extremely easy to get to."
2023-04-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"One thing to keep in mind when staying here: the location is very remote, away from the busy city. It‚Äôs next to impossible to get an Uber. For me, I had to hire a taxi from Indianapolis to come get me, and I paid through the roof for a ride. The atmosphere requires some getting accustomed to before it feels welcoming. I‚Äôll list all the bad: the toilet sucks, and gets clogged very easily, there was no shampoo, and ants infest any sugary items left out (even an empty cup that had pop). Don‚Äôt let that take away from the positives, though. The neighbouring farm is a beauty, and in the morning you can see a striking moon across from a beaming sun. It‚Äôs a big property, and walking on the grass to think is fun. The reason I chose this place is because it is near hidden paradise, a beautiful campground nearby, just out of Greensburg. Pizza does get delivered, so it‚Äôs possible to survive without a car. I accomplished a lot inside this property, so will have fond memories of my stay. Thank you!"
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,This would be a great place for a family get away. Beautiful view and very peaceful with host that will be happy to help with whatever you need . 10/10 for sure
2023-02-01,5.0,Group trip,The farm cottage was exactly what we needed for our family of 6. Beautiful house and surroundings. Great host.

2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Great stay, simple, clean and beautiful property. Would absolutely stay again.
Stayed with another couple and having only one bathroom in the main bedroom was tough but manageable.
Only dinning seating was outside, which we loved but thankfully we had beautiful weather
Hosts were very great! See you soon!"
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Wonderful tranquil location and great hosts.
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"A little piece of paradise. You will love this place. It is quiet and peaceful, very relaxing."
2022-06-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"Nice, quiet little place in the country. House is a little quirky since the bathroom is off the bedroom. If you are staying with more than a couple folks, that means they have to traverse past sleepers to get to the toilet. But no different in that respect to sharing a hotel room. Kitchen seating is limited to two chairs. However, there is a nice deck to sit on and I would recommend it for sunrise coffee enjoyment. Very peaceful. Hosts live nearby and are quick responders. I would certainly consider staying again if I am ever in this part of the country again."
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,A wonderful stay

2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Stayed for a month for home renovations and we all enjoyed the stay! Very cute small farmhouse. Wish there was WiFi to stream Netflix or Disney+ for the kids
2021-12-01,4.0,Stayed one night,Ok place. The sheets were dirty in beds though.
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Unwind Haven is exactly that, a perfect getaway to relax and just take in the peacefulness that surrounds the house. Plenty of space to relax whether at the fire pit or comfortably on the deck drinking coffee. Inside was beautiful, spacious and comfortable just like being in your own home, a very welcoming environment. Plenty of amenities to make your stay easy and stress free. My group was so comfortable relaxing and just seeing local sites that we wish we would have stayed longer. Barn cats were a plus and also very welcoming ü•∞. We enjoyed every second and would definitely go back."

The setting is beautiful. Super clean. Peaceful. Close to little nice towns to explore and enjoy nature.
We went there to see the eclipse, drove to Greensburg and spent the day.
Next day we explored different covered bridges around the area, went to Versailles Park for some hiking and went to Madison to eat and shop before heading to the airport.
PERFECT! PERFECT! PERFECT!!!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"I appreciated that the price was affordable despite the eclipse, we were in a unique space with everything we needed to cook. Quick response by text, got to see her artwork and meet some family. A great spot!"

2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The barn was clean and nicely decorated. The location in the middle of farm land would have been very quiet except for a dog on the premises that barked and whined from almost sun up to sun down. At least one small box of tissues would have been nice. Not sure where the strong smell of moth balls was coming from inside and not sure the reason. Overall would stay there again when in the area.
2023-09-01,5.0,Group trip,"This was a great place to stay for our family reunion at Versailles State park. It was close enough that a quick run back was not a burden. Even though we didn‚Äôt camp with other family members this place allowed us comfort, close proximity, air conditioning, and private shower for the extended Holiday weekend‚Äî all while feeling like we were a part of the camping group. Everything was as expected and the stay was nice."

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"A cozy stay!
I only needed a place to sleep, but the cabin provided everything comfortably.
Getting there was fine and entering the barn was just as noted, no difficulties.
Kitchen was well stocked, including spices and various condiments, so you could cook whatever you needed.
The yard and outdoor spaces were lovely.
I felt safe and comfortable and would stay there again.
Thank you!"

2023-06-01,4.0,Group trip,"We stayed over a week.
Positives:
The place was beautiful
There was a fire pit that gave us opportunity to spend time outside.
We could bring 1 of our dogs
The outside porch had a Locked gate
There were plenty of pillows and blankets
There were starter items available such as trash bags, laundry detergent, and dishwashing detergent
Cooking ware was amazing and not perfect
There was a grill that we were able to use
The location was very close to the state park and amazing flea market
Opportunities for improvement:
Noisy at times due to nearby highway - More trees would help w/ sound and did not negatively impact stay.
We brought our dog because site said pet friendly. Unfortunately, a pet charge didn‚Äôt populate on the site when booking so did not know until arrival that bringing him required a charge. - but the charge was only $50 and issue was resolved quickly.
Overall - it was beautiful and amazing. Would definitely stay again."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is a very comfortable and family friendly place. The linens and home are clean. It has a great open family/dining/kitchen area for eating together and lots of room to play games, visit, or watch a movie. Nice reading lamps in family area and private rooms. We look forward to another, longer visit.
This is a nice place to centrally stay between many areas to visit. It's in a great antiquing vicinity ... be sure to check out Madison and Seymour."
2023-06-01,5.0,Group trip,"Melinda‚Äôs place is a gem in the heart of Ripley County, Indiana near Versailles. Check in was smooth. Her place was pristine, spacious, and had numerous amenities. It‚Äôs close to so many great local attractions and some great locally owned restaurants. It‚Äôs very scenic. You definitely feel as if your home. Melinda was very responsive to any questions we had and is a great host. We definitely will be back again."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The Barn was spacious and beautiful. The location is just far enough away from town to be peaceful and relaxing but not too far that you can‚Äôt get what you need from a store. Loved the location.
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This cozy cottage stay was very peaceful. It was spacious and had plenty of amenities. I loved having a washer and dryer! It is a short ride to town, stores, and MUTC. The host was super responsive and proactive, which came in handy when one of our group locked us out by accident while leaving for dinner. I would absolutely stay here again!"
2023-05-01,3.0,Stayed with a pet,"Melinda's place was beautiful and exactly what we expected for the location. It was located very close to the town of Versailles and the State Park, which was perfect for us. The beds were comfy and the kitchen was fully stocked. Unfortunately, there was a dog who was kept in a pen right beside the Airbnb that barked almost constantly. At first, we didn't mind, but then the barking seemed to get worse, and it really put a dent in our peaceful weekend. Our own dog seemed stressed about it and was anxious to leave the property. While the cabin was lovely, and in a good spot for us, we wouldn't choose to stay again."
2023-05-01,5.0,Group trip,Very nice. Place was very clean and as promised. Melinda‚Äôs communication was great. Would stay again.

2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,We really enjoyed our stay at Melinda‚Äôs place. Grilling on the deck and listening to all the song birds made for very relaxing evenings. We will definitely book with Melinda again when we are in Indiana!
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We loved our visit to the barn! The home has a lot of the starter items you need like flour, sugar, salt, ketchup, etc. The area surrounding the barn was so peaceful. We enjoyed our mornings hiking in the nearby national parks and the evenings by the fire pit and playing in nature on the property. We even made a day trip to nearby Madison. The barn is beautiful and the property has two other historical buildings Melinda is fixing up. We can't wait to come back and see how wonderful it will be!"
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Ideal setup for traveler with dog. Really clean place and appliances were new or like new.
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Melindas place was incredibly peaceful and quite possibly the cleanest accommodations ever. Everything was as described. We had a great stay and so grateful for such a lovely host!
2023-03-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,"This is a quaint and comfortable stay. The town of our Versailles is nearby and is beautiful with cute places to stop on the Square. Madison is nearby and is a gorgeous town on the Ohio river.
My single complaint is that the Wi-Fi was down and I was not aware of that prior to coming. I had to use a hotspot to connect to the Internet to work. Unfortunately, cell service is not strong and so I could not maintain web conference calls in the Airbnb and ended up having to sit in my car at the Square where I had better service. It would have been helpful to know of this issue prior to the stay. I brought my puppy with me and did not bring his travel crate, as I was not expecting to be away from him, but did end up having to leave him to do a couple of work calls downtown."
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Very cozy, comfortable place to stay. Very clean and well maintained."

She also left muffins and chocolate for us upon arriving. We were so touched and amazed. The place itself is so cozy and inviting and beautifully decorated. It had all the amenities of home. The cookware was top of the line. We loved cooking dinners and eating at the dining table each night. There were book and games to choose from. The beds were comfortable. The kitchen was well stocked. The bedrooms were adorable. It was so nice having a washer and dryer also to use. This place felt so welcoming and cozy. If you find yourself traveling in this area, give yourself a treat and stay here. You will feel right at home!"
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,I loved all the little touches this place had to make you comfortable. The bedrooms were a great way to be together and have some space to ourselves ! I had a fresh blueberry muffin each morning left by the host ..yum! The shower with amazing water pressure and the tub with robes in the closet were the best way to relax! Would Definitely Recommend..Thanks for a great stay Melinda!

Thanks Roger"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"First, the Sunshine Bungalow. Country quiet (aka peaceful), clean and comfortable with all the amenities. We loved all the coffee making choices too. We enjoyed the fire pit out back, movies each night and socializing with our family in the open space living room and kitchen. Adorable place!
Second, Carlee is the type of host everyone wants! She is great at communicating and has set up the place with little notes, a helpful guide book and more.
When in Greensburg, the Sunshine Bungalow is the place to stay!"

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"I had an amazing stay for Mother‚Äôs Day weekend! I made a last minute reservation and Jordan and Carlee were very responsive and on top of it! The place was spotless and even better than the photos! Close enough to town but just perfect in the country to be private and peaceful. I awoke to the cutest morning chickens, saw some horses across the way, and the most beautiful stars. The coffee making selection was top notch. I loooove plants and was amazed at the real decor of live plants! Everything was beautiful. The accommodations were great, I had everything I needed for a great weekend. I will have to return."
2024-04-01,5.0,Group trip,"The place was very cute. We came to watch the 2024 eclipse and they had left us several eclipse glasses in case we forgot to bring our own, which was very sweet. They also left out a vase of fresh cut daffodils for us when we arrived, which helped to make the place feel very welcoming. Being able to use the kitchen and laundry as needed was great."

2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"This is such a beautiful place to stay and the Hosts were very kind, responsive, and accommodated all of our needs. They went above and beyond to make sure our stay was fantastic, and thus was possibly the best AirBNB experience we've ever had!!"
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Our family loved our stay at the Sunshine Bungalow! The home was cozy and inviting, and everything was clean and easy to find what we needed. It has a full kitchen if you like to cook while you‚Äôre away like we do, or there were some restaurants close by in town. The bedrooms were perfect for our family of 5. Very friendly hosts. We would definitely stay again!"
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great place to stay! I left my earbuds at their house and they shipped them back to me after leaving them in one of the most painless processes I have had to undertake to get a lost item returned. Great hosts great place 5 stars all the way around.
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The Sunshine Bungalow is a quaint little house with beautiful country views, which we enjoyed with our morning coffee.

2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,this Lustron home was very quaint and exactly wht we needed. had some original charm with updated amenities. comfortable beds and seating to make relaxing simple. I would recommend staying here and will likely stay here again.
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We are return guests to this lovely historic home . The location is great with easy access to town , restaurants and historic sites.

2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,The house was great! We loved our time!
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This was our second time staying here. For an area without a lot of lodging options, this house is a great alternative to a hotel for a family. It‚Äôs a short walk to a couple of great restaurants and a grocery store.
Ruthie is very responsive and a great all-around host."
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,My wife and I very much enjoyed our stay in Oldenburg. The house is centrally located and is furnished beautifully. Thank you for the wonderful weekend!
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The perfect location to engulf yourself in the pristine ambiance of Oldenburg. A discreet treasure that never ceases to amaze. Numerous return visits and I'm still enthralled with the history of this home. The steeple clock through the south living room window has become a welcome friend.
I love the watercolors Ruthie had displayed in the home."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,This was my 2nd time staying here and I enjoyed it as much as the first time. Adorable house filled with everything I needed for the week and within walking distance to two restaurants and shops. Ruthie is an excellent hostess and worked with me to extend my stay when my plans changed. I definitely recommend this cute little house to anyone who is looking for a place in Oldenburg; you won‚Äôt regret it.
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The home was charming and clean. We felt at home and thoroughly enjoyed our stay. Ruthie was wonderful and kind. We will book with Ruthie again!
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"The place was very peaceful to come to after a busy day. The house was very well kept and she even left out a playpen for our toddler. The style is vintage but modern amenities. There is a small park right next door, local restaurants, etc. Easy parking and friendly host.
The back porch light did go out so it was hard to see the lock without our phones and two of the guests were too tall for the upstairs bedroom.
But overall no complaints at all and we will definitely check in the availability whenever we are needing somewhere to stay with family. Highly recommend."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The place was beautiful with a lot of old and new mixed with great taste. Bathroom shower is a piece of art. We will try to come back again in the spring and enjoy the outside area . Great stay thanks for your interaction booking and arriving.
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Lovely home!! Spacious and comfortable home that met all our families needs while in town. The playground next door was an added bonus. Cute lil town with great food. Ruthie was a fabulous host, very kind and responsive. Would definitely stay again"
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My sister and I thoroughly enjoyed our stay at Drees Haus. It‚Äôs a beautiful, warm, and welcoming home with comfortable accommodations and interesting historical artwork and furnishings. It was spotless and in a great location for walking around town. Really appreciated the binder with helpful info about the house and things to do in the area. Would absolutely stay here again in the future!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"It was a lovely, comfortable old home, recently remodeled and updated with lots of antiques, very comfortable furnishings, very adequate kitchen amenities for cooking for guests, and very quiet. Ruthie was very gracious, stayed in touch frequently and we had a lovely visit in the yard one afternoon.
The only potential issue I could see would be if you had problems with steep steps as the 2nd bedroom was upstairs and, as this is classic in any older home, the stairs are steep and the bathroom is on the main floor.
I would heartly recommend this airbnb home and hope to have another visit in the next year or so.
Mary and Weber"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"As always, Ruthie delivers! We feel like we are at home. There are so many thoughtful amenities, can't wait to come back next year!"

2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay. We will be back.
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,My wife and I are both familiar with the village of Oldenburg and the Batesville area. This is our 1st time staying in the village. It was exactly what we were anticipating based on Ruthie‚Äôs comments of the house and the restful/peaceful surroundings of the village. The house had many small details to make the experience from good to great. The place is located on a very quiet street. The coziness of the home makes this a place for us to request the next time we come back to the area.
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The house is very well appointed and comfortable, especially for an older historic home. Loved the modern shower and the beds were very comfortable. Everything we needed was there.
The town is historic and lovely. If you like to walk, this is a great place. Ruthie provides lots of information if you want to know about the home, the town and the area.
We were visiting relatives nearby and will definitely stay again whenever we come again.
Thanks, Ruthie."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Absolutely lovely home. truly felt at home saying there, cozy bedrooms, perfect kitchen and so clean. will definitely be back!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Such a charming home in a very charming town! We loved Ruthie‚Äôs place and all she has done to make it a welcoming stay. The beds were so comfortable. There was more than enough room for the four of us. We enjoyed our coffee out on the covered patio and garden area while my grandkids played in the adjacent playground. She had some games and toys in the upstairs sitting room, which they enjoyed. The kitchen had the basic spices and coffee, which was so nice. The village of Oldenburg is walkable and there is a market around the corner. Ruthie has the home furnished with antiques and historic artwork, which fits the home‚Äôs character. We just felt right at home and will definitely plan to stay here again. Thank you so much!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Ruthie is very responsive, accommodating and helpful. The house is really clean and peaceful."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Many wonderful reviews have been said about the Drees Haus and all I can say is.. amen to that!! There is an old world charm to the place yet complete with modern amenities, fresh and clean space that you easily become comfortable with, just like it's your own... perhaps better! it's a well-appointed home. Ruthie was quick to respond... and I always appreciate a host who is meticulous with details...she even provided a photo of how to use the remote and Hulu. it's no surprise she's a super host! We hope to be back! Thank you, Ruthie and David for opening your home to the Airbnb community."

2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I took a weekend getaway for myself. after looking for locations a few hours from home, I saved Ruthie's place. I just felt it was perfect for what I wanted to do for a weekend. Ruthie was extremely proactive, inviting, and communicated well. I drove up in inclement weather, and she asked me to let her know I made it safely. I really cannot say enough about my positive experience with the location, but most importantly, Ruthie."

2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"It's a nice place in a quiet neighborhood. Ruthie's place is nice place to get away for a retreat, but still close enough that you can still communicate with the outside world. That's pretty important for a non-country girl like me!
We arrived while it was still daylight, which is helpful for getting your bearings that first evening. All-in-all, if and when we return to Oldenburg, I will look to see if Ruthie's place is available again!"
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This house is in a great location, clean, and has so much charm. It met all of our family's needs. I will definitely stay there again!"
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Even though I didn't meet Ruthie in person, she was a very great host and communicated effectively.

2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Comfortable and spacious historical home , wonderfully situated in Oldenburg. Host has stocked kitchen wonderfully and decorated with fascinating artifacts. Great cotton bedding ‚Äîslept well. Lovely garden with peonies and lilac, where we enjoyed a glass of wine each evening. Such fun to watch children and families at the colorful public playground which was well lit and monitored‚Äînot intrusive at all. Host was friendly and helpful , and respects your privacy. Easy access to shops and pubs. Very walkable area. Best fried chicken and shredded pork sliders around. Such an amazing place for the price . We will definitely be back . Just one note that the upstair steps are pretty steep , but well lit for access to bathroom on first floor. If you have bad knees you definitely want to stay downstairs!"
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,My second stay at the Drees House. Ruthie pays attention to detail which makes each stay very comfortable. The house and location is very family oriented. Such a wonderful place.

I even commented to her that I was moving her house to my State because it's exactly what we were looking for!"
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Ruthie made it so easy to enjoy our stay. The house has been cleverly updated while maintaining its history. We enjoyed discovering all of the artistic touches in each room. We even enjoyed some games of backgammon thanks to a collection of games available for guests. Plenty of dishes and towels, comfortable beds, lots of room to sit and read or talk, and an overall feeling of comfort made for a great stay!"

2021-12-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Very lovely place, very clean. Not handicap accessible and shower not handicap accessible"
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The Drees house in Oldenburg, IN, is a charming home in a quaint little town. The house is beautifully decorated, well appointed, very clean and full of character. My sisters and I (4 women in our 60's) stayed there for a getaway weekend a couple of weeks before Christmas. This was our first experience with Airbnb and we were pleasantly surprised. We were very comfortable and can't think of anything Ruthie (our host) could do differently. She and I communicated several times before our stay. She was quick to respond and answered all my questions. The house is in walking distance to everything in town. We did some Christmas shopping at a couple of the cute little shops. At the two restaurants we visited, Pearl Street Pub and Wagner's Village Inn, the food was good, the service was great and all the people we met were friendly. Betsy, Tiffany and Patricia at Wagner's were a hoot. We had so much fun with them and left there feeling like part of the family.
Overall, our experience with the Drees house, Ruthie and the town of Oldenburg was beyond our expectations. We hope to return in warmer weather and explore a little more."
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,I cannot say enough about this cute and comfy Airbnb. When I booked this house we had never been to Oldenburg before and I was hoping that we could have that small town Christmas memory that I would be able to share with my mom and step dad. When I arrived and walked in I was so excited that the house was actually decorated for the Holiday's. The house is just perfect! With the hints of the towns history in the beautifully decorated home I knew that we were going to really enjoy spending time together in this home. The Christmas decorations made our stay even more special. The house was spotless and I am going to have to hit up Ruthie on her recipe for the most clean windows I have ever seen. Thank you so much Ruthie and David for making our stay such a memorable experience with Drees Haus! We will be coming back again soon!
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"This home is beautiful alone, Oldensburgs aesthetics just adds more fuel to that fire. It is surrounded by a quiet neighborhood with plenty of parking space and a park right next door."
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The house is so cozy and quaint; it adds so well to the experience of being in Oldenburg. We had a great stay and hope to return soon.
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The second time we have visited Drees Haus in Oldenberg, a true delight. It's hard to believe towns like Oldenberg still exist and Drees Haus is a quintessential destination, worthy of enjoying tranquil days in the ambiance of a quiet, spiritual, community!"
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Absolutely loved the house. Such a cute place. Oldenburg is a cute and friendly town and with in minutes of other towns. House had everything we needed plus more. Very welcoming!!!! Definitely will be returning.

2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is the cutest home with everything we needed within walking distance. The home is very well decorated and immaculately clean. The gardens are gorgeous and the outdoor seating with the park right next door made it the perfect get away. There are many things to see and do with a cozy retreat to return to. Everything was perfect. Thank you, Ruthie!"
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We loved this place so much that we came back again. And will do so again. Thanks!
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Really beautiful home and adorable town!
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My husband and I had previously stayed at Drees Haus in May 2021. While we had little time to spend in Oldenburg due to other commitments on our first visit, we fell in love with the little town and vowed to go back when we could spend some time exploring the Village of Spires. Our return visit in mid-July 2021 was just as we expected it would be - relaxing, interesting and fun. Ruthie, the host, was very responsive in our communications with her and the self check-in was a breeze. Drees Haus, very clean and well-kept, has everything one needs for a few nights' stay or longer. The kitchen offers full-size appliances, the shower is large enough with good water pressure and the bed in the first-floor bedroom is quite comfortable. There are well-maintained gardens surrounding the Haus and the small covered patio in the back yard - complete with lighting and an overhead fan - was a lovely spot for having dinner and drinks in the evening. The location of Drees Haus is perfect for exploring - within walking distance of several restaurants, a full-service market, a beverage store, the post office, an antique and ice cream store, a gift shop (open limited hours) and a gas station. The town feels quite safe for walking, even after dark - we had a chat with a local police officer who said that there is virtually no crime in Oldenburg! The town's common spaces, including a small park right next door to Drees Haus, are clean and welcoming. We would recommend taking the walking tour of historic Oldenburg - lots of interesting local history to explore. As we noted in our earlier review, there is no place in town where one can get breakfast (though Ruthie started us off with some fresh brown eggs so we were able to prepare a good morning meal at 'home'). Also, we found that healthy menu choices at the area restaurants are hard to find, so be prepared for (delicious) fried chicken and pork schnitzel when dining out. We so enjoyed our time in Oldenburg and we highly recommend a stay at Drees Haus - there couldn't possibly be a better place to stay in the area! - Terry and Don, Sheffield Village OH"
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Lovely cottage in a quaint little town. The cottage is extremely clean and decorated very nicely. Great for a romantic getaway or a getaway for a small family. Restaurants are in walking distance that have delicious food that has a German slant to it. The town has a European feel. It is very quiet and tidy and is dominated by the convent in the middle of town. Bottom line is this; if you want to go to a town that has a raucous nightlife, this ain't it. But is you want tranquility, peace, good food, lots of beer, and a great place to stay, don't pass this up!"
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Oldenburg is such a cool little village and The Drees Haus is a great place to stay to enjoy it. Everything in town is short walking distance (really short!), and the house itself is part of the town's history. We enjoyed learning about the house and visiting the Drees Shrine. What a story!
The house doesn't feel old inside however, it's been well modernized and is clean and well kept. The backyard sitting area is very nice too. We'll be telling other people about this hidden gem."
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This place was amazing! We stayed here while visiting family in a nearby farm town. The house was clean and as pictured. The kitchen was a dream! The small park next door was beautiful, and a welcomed activity for my small daughter. We loved the walking tour, and will for sure be back to stay for hopefully even longer. Thank you for such an amazing experience!"
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I love Drees House. The historic house is so beautiful, inviting and welcoming--has all the modern conveniences plus character! It also has a LOVELY garden and in the morning you can walk about, sit out on the patio, admire the flowers and birds and drink your coffee! It is very pleasantly situated in the village - fun people watching, close to two good restaurants and a small grocery. A great place from which to walk and stroll, bike, and visit the countryside."
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We LOVED this home! The house was so clean and spacious for our family of five (2 adults, 2 small children, and a babe). The grounds area immaculately maintained: a wide variety of blooming plants as well as other beautiful greenery, and the small yard was so tidy, and the street front with its beautiful little window planters). The puzzles and games were a hit as was the amazing park/playground right next door. The kitchen had everything we needed--even the random syrup not provided with a takeout meal! We enjoyed walking several square blocks around Oldenburg using the map the host provided. I loved the architecture and realizing how old many buildings in this village are compared to many places we've lived or visited. Less than two blocks away was a beautiful old cemetery, and visiting on Memorial Day weekend only made this history that much more appreciated. Staying at Drees Haus has made me realize how different our stay would have been if we'd just opted for a hotel in Batesville--not nearly as good! And this house was more affordable given the size of our family. We hope to come back soon."
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place is beautifully decorated.
Very clean. Cozy. Perfectly situated in the heart of Oldenburg. I‚Äôve stayed here at least 3 times - a perfect girls weekend getaway or a romantic getaway.
I‚Äôve rented the home to be able to work with my team on business. The wifi is excellent.
Ruthie makes check in and out easy, always replies quickly to questions, and even shipped me some items I left.
Can wait to come back!"
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,I've stayed at Drees House multiple times now. It's an amazing house in a great location. Walking distance from restaurants and the local grocery store. Highly recommend. Ruthie is an exceptional host.
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"What a beautiful and comfortable little house is Drees Haus and what a great location! With numerous older, but well-maintained buildings, we felt a bit like we were in a small German village. My husband and I spent three nights at Drees Haus and wish we could have spent more time enjoying the lovely gardens surrounding the house and the private little patio area in the back. We found the house to be more spacious than we expected and better stocked with essential food and toiletry items than we imagined. The house was so clean and the bed so comfortable! Every window offered a lovely view - the old brick wall surrounding the convent across the street, the next-door playground (where we enjoyed watching area children play a baseball game one night), even the window that looked out over the neighbor's privacy fence was well landscaped with a ""secret garden."" I was impressed with the high-end Adora gas range/oven and the full-sized refrigerator (sparkling clean!) in the kitchen area. Drees Haus is within a very short walk to nearly everything we needed - three restaurants (truly healthy food choices are a bit of a challenge to find), a coffee shop, a small (but well stocked) grocery store, several churches (you'll hear their soft bells ringing regularly throughout the day), a beverage store and a gas station. The small, quiet (except for the nearby garage band one night which made us chuckle) town is very walk-able and we felt safe at all times even when strolling after dark. We were a bit disappointed that there is no place in town to get breakfast, but Izzy's is located about three miles away in Batesville, an easy drive, and our breakfast there was very good and reasonably priced. Ruthie was extremely prompt in answering any questions we had and was quite thorough in giving us needed travel directions. We were privileged to briefly meet both Ruthie and her husband during our visit and they even sent us home with some canna flower 'starts' so we will always have a bit of Drees House with us in our gardens at home. We highly recommend a stay at Drees Haus and we can't wait to visit again - next time we'll stay a little longer! - Terry and Don (Sheffield Village OH)"
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Ruthie's home is a gem in the midst of a modern day fairytale. The ambiance of a carefully crafted historic home with all of the conveniences is not to be missed. Oldenburg is a true treasure, a walk back in time to a peace and tranquility rarely experienced in today's world."
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Thank you for putting your heart and soul to the renovation Of the drees house. It is the perfect little get away. Hoping to come back in the fall. Thank you, Ruthie!"
2021-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This is the coziest house in the best spot. We were walking distance from everything we wanted to do. The place was very clean and accommodating. Two thumbs up!
2021-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Ruthie's house is adorable! We enjoyed every minute there! She has thought everything you will need. It's within walking distance to everything in Oldenburg and a quick drive to everywhere else you'll want to visit. If you have kids they will love the park right next door! We had a wonderful time and will stay here anytime we visit.
2021-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,we will be going back in may
2021-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We enjoyed our stay and found the house to he clean, comfortable, and spacious! We stayed while visiting relatives nearby amd would definitely stay again."

2021-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Solid place.
2021-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"A perfectly adorable house in one of the quaintest towns in Indiana. Ruthie went above and beyond to make me feel welcome and answered all of my questions before I got there. I attended school in Oldenburg waaaaayyyyy back but now currently live in GA and my best friend and her family still live there so I drove up to visit for the week. First, I didn't want to stay in a hotel ALL week and secondly, I had no idea that there was even a Airbnb in Oldenburg, so imagine my surprise when I see one and it's available the week I was traveling. I could not have asked for a more clean and comfortable place to stay for the week. I appreciated how responsive Ruthie was and even left me cookies and notable information about the town for my arrival. The house is located right next to a park which is perfect for people traveling with small children, it's a little more than a block away from The Brau Haus which has excellent German food (Their sauerkraut balls are the best, hands down!), it's a block away from The Pub which also has excellent food and service, and other little shops, coffee cafes, and restaurants. You will NOT be disappointed if you choose to stay here because it was a completely wonderful experience; quiet, relaxing, and just like home. If GA wasn't so far away, I'd come stay more often."
2021-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Ruthie was great to work with and very kind. The house was perfect.
2021-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Perfect little place to stay in a perfect little town. Ruthie‚Äôs house is so charming and cozy. It definitely feels like home. We have stayed here a couple of times now, and definitely would love to again in the future!"

The house was extremely clean and well maintained, and within walking distance to several restaurants and a small grocery store.

My fianc√© (at the time) and I had last minute cancelled our large wedding and opted for a private family ceremony in response to the pandemic. It was a stressful time but Ruthie treated us with such kindness we truly felt like a bride and groom! Our stay was so perfect, that we‚Äôve recommended this place to all of our friends and family who often return to the area and need some more space. Ruthie, we can‚Äôt thank you enough!!!"

2020-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,This place is perfectly situated in Oldenburg. You can walk everywhere and it's quieter than being on the main road.

2020-03-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"Great place to stay, beautiful, detailed and a super host."
2020-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This house was a beautiful place to relax while in town for a family celebration. Oldenburg is a really amazing historic village - a ""Little Germany"" tucked in Indiana. The house was warm and cozy, well-appointed, and quiet."
2020-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is the second time that my husband and I stayed at Ruthie‚Äôs place. It is so clean and comfortable that it is almost as if you are staying at a close friend‚Äôs place. Hands down the best place to stay in the area, and my favorite air bnb."

2020-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Ruthie is the best host ! Her place was the perfect size for us three and she was always quick to respond to any questions.
What was usually a stressful cramped week in a hotel for us turned into a awesome working vacation where we looked forward to getting back to a house each day rather than a sketchy hotel. Looking forward to doing it again in a couple of months."
2019-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Awesome place and host. 5 Stars all around.
2019-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Great little house. Walking distance to quite a few things.
2019-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Drees Haus is a beautiful home away from home. The furnishings are stunning antiques, the kitchen was perfect for cooking, the beds comfortable and the shower was wonderful. And the church bells and hymns were so enchanting (it was cold out, but we had a window open so we could hear them). We enjoyed exploring the town of Oldenburg and the surrounding areas. We definitely recommend this home and we will absolutely stay here again if it is available for our next visit. Thanks so much for ALL you did to make our stay comfortable and easy. PS The snickerdoodle cookies were delicious!"

2019-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"If you've ever dreamed of staying in a lovely fairy book cottage, well, here ya go! This little house is absolutely charming, and everything about it is perfect. The ground floor holds a master bedroom, living room, and beautifully updated bathroom and kitchen. Upstairs is another bedroom and sitting room. Out the back door is a back yard filled with gorgeous flowers and an idyllic little garden house with a patio under a trellis of wisteria. The town of Oldenberg is as charming as the house. Within a few footsteps are at least three good restaurants and a grocery store if needed. This would be a great place to stay for a romantic weekend away, as you could hang out in Oldenberg or take a field trip to Cincinnati, which is less than an hour away. Batesville is also a great little town. I just can't say enough good things about this house, though - it's perfect!"
2019-08-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Drees House was a delightful place to stay for a week. It was exceptionally clean and had everything we needed. We felt very much at home there and would be happy to stay again.
2019-07-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Staying at Drees Haus was such a pleasurable experience. All the necessary amenities are available and the home's charm is in it's history and uniqueness. We loved hearing the church bells, the beautiful flowers and landscaping, and the convenience of walking to local pubs/eateries. A/C was good. We hope to have an opportunity to return."
2019-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Ruthie's house is lovely. The house was clean & comfortable, and we immediately felt at home. It's the perfect size, filled with warmth for a relaxing stay. The city of Oldenburg is ripe for exploration and worth a walk around town. The house is also a quick drive from Cincinnati, OH and Columbus, IN -- the perfect space for someone looking to explore multiple cities in one trip. Ruthie is friendly and communicative, and we thoroughly enjoyed our stay. Would absolutely come again."
2019-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,I highly recommend Ruthie's place. We hope to stay again. The location is wonderful and the house is perfect for our family of four.

2019-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Drees Haus is clean, comfortable, charming!! We enjoyed the peaceful setting, and beautiful gardens/landscape!!"
2019-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Our visit to this beautiful home in this quaint little German town right outside Indianapolis was outstanding! The only problem we had was we didn't have enough time in town. Ruthie was an amazing hostess and made us feel so welcome! This was an amazing first time Airbnb experience! Loved it!
2019-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Ruthie's house was wonderful. Quiet, clean, so charming and comfortable. We would definitely stay there again."
2019-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Beautifully updated historic home is a great alternative to an off-highway hotel. We travelled with a toddler and an infant and really loved the space. Baby-gates and a pack-n-play made it kid-friendly and it's walking distance to good food and a couple of pubs.
2019-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,I have stayed at Ruthie's house in Oldenburg 6 times now. She is an extraordinarily gracious host and the house is a delightful experience that reflects Oldenburg's historic charm. I will continue to stay at Ruthie's house!
2019-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was our (wife and I) first time to use AirBnB. Ruthies place was magnificent. The home was built in 1870 but you‚Äôd never know from the inside. It is decorated perfectly, remodeled flawlessly and is absolutely beautiful. Everything we needed was ready and waiting from basic toiletries to breakfast items due to our VERY late (3:00am) check in which went perfectly easy and without effort. The house is set up to feel like a historic cottage but it is modernized with great subtlety. The Beds were comfortable as was all the furniture. The heat worked exactly as it should have and was not overwhelming. The location was absolutely ideal Batesville is a 5 minute drive if you need it. Food is walking distance- like 50 yards. Beautiful church and convent across the street. Extremely Safe and quiet neighborhood. Truly, if you have to stay anywhere within 30miles this is the place to stay. We had to attend a funeral service in Batesville and feel so lucky and blessed to have found this option. There are 2 coffee makers, a walk in shower with great water pressure and awesome shower head, a refrigerator stocked with basic necessities, even the toilet is a high end quiet Kohler. I could just go on and on. I wish I could give 10 stars."
2019-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This house is amazing. It is so cozy and had everything needed to feel just like home. The location is perfect and you can walk to just about everything in town. I highly recommend staying here, and can‚Äôt wait to come back!"
2019-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Ruthie was a delightful host and the house and town was great. The historic house and bedrooms are very well maintained, clean and warm. Also hearing the Convent bells gives the area a wonderfully Germanic and historic feel. I look forward to staying there many times."
2018-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This was a great place for my family and a very nice host. It is a small house, but we were pleasantly surprised that it felt larger than it looked in pictures. It has the charm of an old house but modern appliances and bathroom. The Christmas decorations (kid-friendly!) were a nice touch."
2018-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Ruthie's little house in Oldenburg blew us away! Every little detail in the house was so beautiful. We loved the little antique treasures all over house that made us feel a bit like we were stepping back in time but without losing all the comforts of modern times. The kitchen is absolutely gorgeous and has everything you need to make meals at the house but there are several restaurants in walking distance. We tried Brau Haus and the pretzel was surprisingly one of the best things I've had to eat in a while. And the Reuben was exceptional as well! Ruthie provided suggestions catered to what we were looking for in our weekend stay and was a pleasure to communicate with! This is probably my favorite air b&b experience to date. You will love this place! The little town of Oldenburg is so quaint. I enjoyed a sunset walk around town and the architecture is fantastic. So fun to be part of the little community for a couple days! Be sure to take a drive around to see some of the nearby covered bridges!!
2018-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place is very special. Everything about it, from location to beauty to comfort is outstanding. You are in for a treat!"
2018-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,If you are looking for an exceptionally charming and comfortable place to stay this is it! Ruthie has the house very well equipped and the garden is beautiful. I could not say enough good things about this place.
2018-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Ruthie has a lovely, lovely home in a lovely, lovely town. We enjoyed all it had to offer: solid home, furnishings, spaciousness and quiet and peaceful. Enjoyed the outdoor space and the park next door. Local coffee shop was open M-F and not on weekends. Oldenburg is a beautiful town. My husband and I stayed two nights and would love to come back. To date we've stayed in 7 AirBnBs (Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, West Virginia), and Ruthie's place is our favorite so far."
2018-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"From the pictures and earlier reviews, we expected a nice, well-appointed stay. It was that, and more. Walking distance to all the restaurants in town. Quiet and restful. Practical and thoughtful details, like menus from the restaurants and fresh flowers. I highly recommend this place."
2018-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Wonderful place to stay quite, clean would recommend to anyone to visit"
2018-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My husband, sister in law and brother in law had the pleasure of staying here recently and it was wonderful. Great location, and was clean and cozy - exactly as pictured here. Couldn't have asked for anything more. Highly recommend!"
2018-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This gorgeous historic home ‚Äî so thoughtfully furnished and decorated ‚Äî makes a very lovely and quiet getaway spot. It‚Äôs so peaceful next to a small park and surrounded by impressive architecture and walking distance to great home-style cooking and a very nice little coffee shop. Fast Wi-Fi, comfy bed, cool on hot days (they thought of everything). Ruthie is an excellent host ‚Äî friendly and helpful. I look forward to future visits in this quiet and comfortable place in a very unique small-town-Indiana meets European-style village."
2018-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Home comfort while away from home. Full kitchen including dishwasher. My family loved it. Great outdoor space including a playground/Park next door. A lovely cottage.
2018-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Ruthie and David were wonderful hosts. The house was spacious and very clean, and was in walking distance to shops and restaurants. Communication was prompt, and they were at the house, ready to meet us for check in and to offer recommendations for local attractions and eateries. We would highly recommend this Air Bnb for anyone considering the area!"
,,,"This was my first experience with Evolve and it will be my last. I am a guest, but also a host with airbnb and I was very disappointed with several items with this booking. Upon arrival, we couldn't get into the house with the code that should have been set up for our booking. After multiple attempts the owner contacted us back and sent a neighbor over to let us in and give us a code that wasn't as per the directions in the listing and this neighbor also knew our code which to me was a risk. We did not know this person to trust them. Upon entering we found multiple personal items in the home, including a used razor in the bathroom and medications in the fridge and bathroom. I contacted Evolve regarding my concerns, including cleanliness, sanitation, and safety, I was told that I would not get a refund without a full investigation and if I felt unsafe to call the police. This has never been an airbnb type of response. I am very dissatisfied."
