2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Our stay in the loft was amazing. If you look at other reviews it does address the traffic noise.

2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had an amazing experience at the Loft. Great location.
I would like to make a STRONG recommendation, that you place black out curtains in the master bedroom. I was not able to sleep in that room the entire trip due t the BLAIRING lights that come into the room all night and morning. Having an option to close a curtain would have been extremely helpful as it is so bright in that room."
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Wonderful location right on the square! Loads of extra amenities were provided. Hosts were friendly and responsive! Thanks so much

To both of you and this Hallmark town, Thank you!"
2022-10-01,5.0,Group trip,"I stayed at the Lafayette Loft with my 4 closest friends. We explored the Biblical History Center and FDR state park using the Loft as our space to rest, eat, and connect.

2022-08-01,5.0,Group trip,"What a place! Beautiful decor, excellent location, and really comfy beds… Lafayette Loft has it figured out. Beautiful views of the square and walking distance to some of our favorite Lagrange spots was the icing on the cake. Hosts were quick to respond to any questions we had and provided so many little luxuries. We will definitely return."
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The Loft was a great place to stay, right on the main square in downtown LaGrange. The Loft has an open floor plan with high ceilings and plenty of space to spread out and relax. A note for those who are light sleepers (and not in any way a negative review on the our stay). Trash pickup on the Square occurred at 4 am one morning. On another morning, street sweepers went by 4x at 3 am and then the gardening staff mowed and edged the lawn as well as cut the hedges in the Square at 4 am on the same morning. Despite this, we enjoyed our stay in the Loft and would definitely stay there again."
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Such a great location! The loft was very clean and cozy! The owners have thought of every detail. We had everything we needed and would definitely choose this property again.

Need and more! They even had awesome personal touches and we will return!"
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The Lafayette Loft is s wonderful place to stay! It’s right in the center of town with the Lafayette Fountain in view from the large bedroom windows. Spacious rooms, high ceilings and beautiful furniture and decorating make this a place you’ll want to come back to. It was spotless and had little touches like the many selections of Keurig coffee pods and snacks. Highly recommend!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Group trip,"Stayed here with my family on the way down to a wedding, it was the perfect place for all of us, had exactly what we needed, super easy and convenient, and the host was wonderful!"

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"Caleb's cute, modern home was very clean and comfy. The covered porch and fire pit area were great outdoor spaces. The home is decorated with a modern twist and the space was inviting and a pleasure to stay in. We would highly recommend a stay here!"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,The place is gorgeous! Everything could be in walking distance restaurant wise. My family got to do a tech free small vacation and it was wonderful.

2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We had a perfect experience
2024-03-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"The place was fine. It was very clean and well decorated.
The house does not have a TV. Granted a TV was not listed in the amenities, but in 2024 I feel like at least one TV is a given. Also the hot water heater is too small for the house two out of three of us took unexpected cold plunges in the morning. Very trendy right now I know, but not the experience I was hoping for in my Airbnb shower. Lastly the linens, towels, sheets, and pillows, were very poor quality.
It fit our needs for the night, but we will not be back for our next stay."
2024-03-01,5.0,Group trip,It was a nice place we had a great stay
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Caleb’s place was absolutely amazing. The space was decorated so nicely and just had the best vibes to it. Inside it was immaculately clean and had everything we needed. We were an easy drive away from Callaway Gardens where we had a race the next morning and check in and out was nice and easy. We would stay here again anytime, highly recommend!"
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Great location for what we wanted, great set up as far as the interior and exterior of the home. The furniture and decor was very nice and modern, would be great for a photo shoot. ONLY COMPLAINTS- there is not blinds or curtains for all the windows; it’s in a good location but still on a main road and has neighbors, there is a slight step up to the front entrance that can be dangerous for clumsy people or someone not paying attention; maybe paint it orange or black to make it noticeable, and no tv; I get it getting away and relaxing leaving technology behind but it would have been nice to have one even if small and wall mounted. Other than that, we enjoyed ourselves; bed was super comfy and the couch in the living room as well. Parking was easy and the outside fire pit really adds a nice touch."
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I felt 100x more creative just sitting in the living room
Really well put together space"

2023-12-01,5.0,Group trip,Extremely accommodating host and nice space. Very quick to respond when reaching out. Left a great info packet along with some snacks and drinks. Highly recommend if you only need a smaller place for a stay.
2024-06-01,5.0,Group trip,"The house was absolutely perfect. We had a great weekend. We were in town for a wedding. You had thought of every details. Those details included snacks, waters, blankets, iron & board, toiletries, phone chargers and more."

We had a dog with us and the fenced yard was a welcome play area for him! The house was well stocked with all the necessities and we had absolutely no complaints. The owner reached out to when we arrived to welcome us and be available for anything we might need…they are truly outstanding hosts. I highly recommend this Airbnb if your travels take you to Lagrange GA."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,We book this home to take our daughter on a day trip to Great Wolf Lodge. What a gem! So close to the water park and other great things to do. The house was roomy! So unbelievably clean and comfortable. The bed in the master bedroom was fantastic. The house is private with a fantastic large fence in yard. I would absolutely recommend staying here. The kitchen has everything you need and beyond; including an instant pot and air fryer. Robert was extremely attentive and responsive.

2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We stayed over the Christmas holiday. The host had decorated the home for Christmas complete with a lighted tree. It made us feel at home. We would stay here again.
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Super Host quality! The house is beautiful and decorated so lovely. The bed in the master bedroom is worth the price of the rental alone. The games they provided in the children’s room kept my busy toddler occupied and she loved sitting at the kid sized table.
Now I’ve stayed in pet friendly homes before and there’s normally smell like there’s been an animal in the home but this place smelled amazing. It was super clean and they had items in the house I didn’t even know I needed. Plus it’s less than 5 minutes away from Great Wolf Lodge so 10/10
Our host was sweet and responded timely"
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We thoroughly enjoyed our weekend in Lagrange. The house was perfect for our family. It was just minutes away from everything we wanted to do. I love all the amenities that were offered. They had everything you might need from laundry detergent, personal hygiene items, games for kids and a fully stocked kitchen. Which made cooking breakfast and meals for the kids so easy. The fenced in back yard was great too. It gave the kids a safe place to run and play and everyone loved sitting by the fire pit. Overall one of our best experiences yet!"

Very helpful and insightful tips given of restaurants to try and things to do. Everything one would hope and expect from an Airbnb host!

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was a lovely location and stay.
The deck out front is a comfortable spot to have coffee and enjoy the view. The dock is peaceful: I sat in a chair and read a book and listened to the fish jumping.
The lake and surroundings are beautiful.
The host, Vivian, has provided ample amenities: coffee and all that is needed to suit your tastes, mini-fridge, bottles of chilled water, TV with Roku that signs you out of your accounts at the end of your stay, microwave, towels (including for a swim in the lake), and more.
IMPORTANT: The bed is comfy. (I have back problems, and I was comfy.)
In short, you certainly will enjoy your stay."

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Very nice guest house with a beautiful view. The lake was peaceful and the bed was amazing.
We saw there was no kitchen but missed the part where guests could not bring their own stove or grill. We packed a stove and all our food so when we checked in and went to cook, we were pretty bummed. Every meal we had to pack up, drive somewhere, cook and eat. The host made this clear, it was just buried down in the house rules and I missed it. Wish it had been posted higher up but it’s my fault!
Hosts were very kind and welcoming and would recommend this place to anyone looking for a quick, quiet getaway."

As a first time ab&b stay we weren’t sure what to expect but Vivian and Bryan were great host, always available for questions without losing any of our privacy.

2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Vivian has gone above and beyond to make her guest house the perfect weekend getaway. The room has all the luxuries you might need and was spotlessly clean.

From the scenery, cozy and inviting atmosphere to Vivian’s attentiveness and many helpful tips on what to do and where to go (wish I could’ve toured but we were traveling for business).

2024-06-01,5.0,Group trip,The house was beautiful and very well kept. We enjoyed all the games that were provided. We shared lots of laughs. Typical Downtown location.

2024-04-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,Maya has a beautiful home and it is very well maintained with plenty of linens and things to do. It was great having the games and ping pong table for the children. My only complaint was the noise. Apparently there was some event in a park area which was almost directly behind the home and it started early. There were also trains running all night long using their horns coming through the intersections. It made for sleepless nights. But if this doesn't bother you - it is a great place to stay.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Really calm and nice spot to stay
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"An absolutely perfect house for a family or for couples to get away. Great location and only a short walk to Wild Leap Brewery and Nutwood Cafe. The outdoor space is amazing and the ping pong room is so fun!

2024-01-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,"The house was extremely nice. The only issue was a strange noise that could be heard in the master bedroom. It rained and sounded like some kind of loud pump that woke me up multiple times one night. That and all the trains blowing the horns all night. There were also people walking up and down the road at all hours of the night. There was nothing taken from our vehicle or the house. For the price, I would rent again"

2023-12-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Overall nice place. Bedrooms are big with large comfortable beds. One bath makes it a little hard to get ready with family.

2023-07-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Nice and clean house. The game room and backyard are awesome for family fun. We were going to a party at brewery and couldn’t have had a better location.

The only thing is that during these hot days of Summer the air conditioning does not cool as well as it should. During the day it gets up to 76 in the house even though the thermostat is on 67."

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"The house was spotless and well organized.
It was clear the host had put a lot of time and effort into making guests feel comfortable. Everything was catered for and we really appreciated this.
The instructions were clear and well communicated and checkin was a breeze.
The only slight negative, isn’t something the host can control. At night we could hear the horns of freight trains in the distance. It only seemed to affect very light sleepers in our group. I slept fine.
Would definitely recommend!"

2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Maya’s place was very welcoming! My family and I could not have been more pleased! Definitely would book again.
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"I started planning a trip for the Great Wolf Waterpark but we wanted full amenities- mainly full kitchen. I found this lovely home located less than 10 minutes away so we booked it after seeing the reviews for this location and Maya’s as a super host. She was in fact awesome. Sent us all details needed for the trip in advance. Our first day we played ping pong/other games at the property. We spent the next day at the water park, came back for lunch and then finished off with a lovely dinner outside. The neighborhood didn’t have a lot of traffic. It is located near a railway but It wasn’t obnoxiously loud. We had two adults, two teens, and a 6 year old for this trip. We were so comfortable and relaxed. Beds slept amazing. It was colder temps when we arrived and the heat/ac was perfect. Communication is key with one restroom and we made it work. It was half the cost of staying at the GW lodge plus we saved with food cost. Over all this was a major hit. 10/10 Maya and Property"
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This stay was one of the best I have encountered so far. Spotless, private, peaceful, and felt like home. Will book again!"

2023-03-01,5.0,Group trip,"The house was within walking distance to downtown where the best restaurants are located. The hose had the most modern LED, dimmable lighting. The house was well appointed with modern accents. Maya was very responsive and friendly. The only negative is that there is only one bathroom. If you have a group of more than three adults, that can be a bit challenging at times; otherwise, the house was very comfortable and inviting."
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Gorgeous house with a great location close to skatepark and playground. House was spotless and we loved the games!
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We really enjoyed our stay. Every room in the house was squeaky-clean. All spaces matched the photos and were even better that we expected.
I would highly recommend this AirBnB to anyone."
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Maya's home is super awesome!! I recommend this place to anyone who plans to visit Lagrange GA.

2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Maya’s listing was exactly as pictured. Maya was quick to respond! She was really helpful with any concerns and quick to take action. Brand new appliances, Fully equipped kitchen for someone who likes to cook- compact but loaded, big fridge/freezer, nice sized rooms, Big flat screen TVs in the front room and the master, and my favorite, the “coffee bar!” Keurig, ground coffee, creamer, tea, and coffee pods, beautiful decor and thoughtful details- lots of lighting. The neighborhood was quiet. Our family had an absolutely wonderful stay in Maya’s home. I mostly appreciated her quick communication. The linens and pillows were fabulous. The home has a very well stocked kitchen. The board games was a family favorite. I can’t recommend this place highly enough. A stay to remember! Thank you so much! 😊"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This stay was the first of our family’s planned annual gatherings and the house was perfect. Pong pong and pool tables inside, the lake outside, Great wolf Water Park, Callaway gardens. Everyone enjoyed."

2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Had a great stay. Really nice layout and comfortable. Convenient to Great Wolf Lodge.
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"So many good things to say! But mostly I want to thank David for the beautiful home that my family & I got to make everlasting memories in. We could've spent all day inside with the many amenities it has for entertainment but the tennis/pickleball court, firepit, the beautiful area where you can sit & look at the lake in the backyard! IT WAS PERFECT. I have to say my kids did not want to leave & honestly we were all a little sad to have to go. David was very attentive. Just knowing how responsive he was gave me so much peace of mind. I wouldn't change a thing about the time we had there. Thank you David!"
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"David was a very responsive host. The house was as described and pictured. It was very peaceful, had a beautiful view of the lake, and fit 2 familes comfortably. The master bathroom was amazing and the pool table, ping pong table, and tennis court (you do have to bring your own rackets) kept us busy. Definitely recommend this house for a nice getaway."
2023-12-01,5.0,Group trip,"It is a beautiful and comfortable property! The house is lovely - secluded and private, but still close to town. David is a wonderful host, is proactive with communication, and his attention to detail in providing amenities throughout the house made our family feel completely at home. From the lovely selection of tea/coffee and equipment in the kitchen cabinets to the books and toys for children, everything we could need was provided. The house was perfect for hosting Christmas! This was one of the most laid-back and relaxing Airbnb experiences we've had and our family can't wait to return."
2023-12-01,5.0,Group trip,Perfect place for a family retreat.
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We were in LaGrange for a week, hosting our daughter’s wedding. We used David’s home as our family’s central spot for lodging, brunches and dinners, wedding prep and relaxing moments in between the chaos. I simply cannot say enough about how wonderful our visit was! David was very responsive, even came to help us within 5 minutes upon our arrival, and super accommodating to our requests.
The house was spotless, with a kitchen equipped for all of our needs. The bottle of wine waiting for us upon arrival was an excellent touch after a 12 hour drive to get from Texas! My favorite spots in the house were the screened in porch (coffee in the mornings with a beautiful view of the lake ❤️), the master bathroom (amazing space and the shower was everyone’s favorite) and finally the billiard room (lots of use from our family!).
We would absolutely stay here again!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This place was fantastic, my daughter got married on October 20th and it was in a perfect location and spacious enough for my family and myself and enough for us to do and relax after traveling from the distances that we came from. This place was simply gorgeous and my family was greatly impressed and loved our stay just wasn’t long enough."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We as a family have stayed at several homes and this one is on the top of the list. We had a wonderful time. The photos were perfect but that view was better than expected. I wish we could have stayed longer. Thanks for everything.

2023-05-01,5.0,Group trip,"David’s place is amazing! Reminded me of being in the Ozarks. The lake is beautiful, the house is beautiful as well as the property. On a whim instead of hosting a group of customers at a local hotel I got on Airbnb and David’s house came up with five stars. Short Drive from the house to the factory we were visiting. Brand new barbecue, inside of the house was immaculate. I will be staying here for every customer visit moving forward. Thank you so much for letting us use your house. I have stayed at quite a few Airbnb’s over the last few years and this is by far the best. I highly recommend."
2023-04-01,5.0,Group trip,David was a fantastic host and I would definitely want to work with him again if I return to the area. The house met our needs and was nestled in beautiful shady trees. Our group enjoyed the pool table and sitting around the dining table. The location was perfect for us and we had plenty of space and rooms to roam. The house was almost too big for our group of 7. 😀

2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We had a wonderful time at this amazing place! The house was even bigger than it looked in the photos, every room was pristine, and the views of the lake were incredible. My wife and I stayed here with our two kids and another family, and it was the perfect blend of having relaxing mornings at home and then going into town for afternoon activities and dinner, which is only 10 minutes away. David was a great host and was very quick to respond when we had questions. I highly recommend this house, and we would definitely stay here again!"
2023-01-01,5.0,Group trip,"The lakehouse was perfect for our Winter girls trip. There was plenty of space for us 6 gals. The house was inviting right when we walked in the door. It was very clean and well stocked with the essentials. We stayed in and made dinner every night and the kitchen had everything we needed. Playing pool and ping pong were lots of laughs. The view was wonderful and even though it was cold and we weren't outside much, it looked like the outside spaces were great. David was super helpful and the instructions were so thorough that everything went very smoothly. We will definitely look into staying here again without hesitation."

2022-10-01,5.0,Group trip,"The pictures do not do this property justice! It’s truly a gem! It was the perfect arrangement for all my family to comfortably be together to celebrate my son’s wedding. The master suite is delightful; comfortable bed, impressive shower, and vanities. Again, it was so nice to have such a lovely place to prepare for wedding festivities. The entire house was clean, spacious and so comfortable. I would highly recommend this venue and hope to return one day for a vacation.

2022-09-01,5.0,Group trip,David was an exceptional host. He responded almost immediately with the few questions we had and gave some great tips for cool spots to check out in the town. Next time we need a place in the LaGrange area we will certainly go back to David.
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The property was gorgeous! David was respectful and responsive. I would definitely stay here again!
2022-08-01,5.0,Group trip,"I originally booked this place because it was easy to get to from Atlanta (less than an hour and a half from midtown), spacious (3 king beds, 1 queen bed, all in separate rooms) and had easy access to a private dock sitting on the lake, as well as downtown LaGrange. Not only did all of these features turn out to be true, the home was also lovely with giant windows viewing the lake, huge with 3 separate sitting areas and a kitchen that comfortably hosted me and my seven guests as we took turns cooking and chatting, luxurious with a master bedroom that had an apartment sized bathroom with both a giant tub and a shower/sauna that could house a football team, and filled with amenities from a full sized tennis court to a billiards room that is bigger than most people's living room. In addition, the host was super easy to work with, very responsive, and generally easy to talk to. Could not recommend this place more!"

Our annual veterans trip was a success and we were blown away with the homes amenities! David is so kind, helpful and a pleasure to work with. 3 days was not enough to enjoy what this place has to offer for all ages!
A quiet cove, ideal fishing, well appointed kitchen for large meals, the billiards room and optional other rooms gave everyone space to be comfortable all day. We spent a great deal of time exploring wildlife and rocks around the cove, swinging on the porch while grilling, enjoying stories with belly aching laugher to resolve with a comfortable night's rest after amazing custom showers! A+, 100%, This home does not disappoint!!!!"

2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Very nice, comfortable and quiet. Dock with the upper deck is a plus, although the hike down to the dock is somewhat steep, it was not a problem for me, but if you have problems walking hills, you want to make sure you bring everything you may need with you in one trip, to save going back and forth. We enjoyed our stay, and if we were to be in the area again, we would stay here again. Bill"

One thing to note is that the walk down to the lake is steep and hard to navigate if you’re not too good of a walker seeing as it’s more of a hike. Not bad for us but important to note! Overall, highly recommend!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"The home and property was great. It was clean, very comfortable, and truly beautiful with multiple places to sit, relax and congregate. Maya was promptly helpful and went out of her way to answer questions. Check out was easy. Yes, the path to the lake is steep in places but that was clear going into it, and it was so worth it to have a private dock for swimming and kayaking. This was an overall wonderful experience. Our first time using an air bnb and we would look forward to Maya’s place again!"

Maya was great from the beginning, she was so friendly and answered all questions we had as well as sent out clear details for check in and check out.
We can’t wait to come back!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Maya was a great host and super responsive with any questions I had! The house was adorable and the perfect little spot for my little family! I loved that she had a high chair and a sleeping spot for my 14 month old so that was less we had to pack! The walk back up from the dock is a little steep so make sure to bring good shoes!
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We had the best time relaxing at the lake and enjoying the privacy. Hostess was very responsive and friendly. Will definitely be coming back!

The weather hindered our lake plans....but the quiet woods filled with deer....still made the stay relaxing!"
2023-06-01,4.0,Group trip,We had a great time just wished we could have went to lake more.
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"I would 100% stay at Maya’s place again! The home was perfect. Everything my family and I had everything we needed and wanted for our trip. The day we arrived I noticed there was one paddle for the two kayaks and she quickly ordered TWO more that arrived the very next day. Lots of games to play indoors. Loved the flamingo play room. The deck and kayaks we wonderful! We spent most of our time on the water and it was beautiful! The area is beautiful, the walk to the dock is beautiful with all the trees ( a little steep in one area but if you pace yourself it’s not too bad) the sunrise and sunset were amazing from the dock! We just really enjoyed our stay!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The cleanest Airbnb I’ve ever stayed in! Truly pristine and I am picky. So very cute and Maya was immediately responsive when we needed something. Would absolutely stay here again and again!

2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Adorable home! My adultish kids enjoyed the ping pong table. The view is so pretty and it's not a super busy lake. I even got my kids to play a family game from all the games provided. We all enjoyed ourselves.

2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Great Lake house on West Point lake. A wonderful property that is well appointed for entertaining and littles! The separate game room was a wonderful bonus. We also got plenty of use out of the fire pit and grill. The walk to the lake is in the forest on a well maintained and lit path. The double decker dock was also a bonus. When trying to decide on a lake house at West Point lake, take comfort in knowing that Maya is a great host and the house itself is wonderful, staying here is a no-brainer!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful home and peaceful stay. Had everything we needed. Definitely recommend !
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Wonderful home! Super clean and tastefully decorated. Large deck, backyard firepit, and bonus outdoor lounge for playing ping-pong. My husband and daughter also enjoyed the well-stocked game shelf in the living room. Bedrooms are large with walk-in closets and comfortable beds. The bathrooms were beautiful. The kitchen is well appointed. I must give special attention to the design and lighting scheme along the concrete driveway and outside the home. This required vision (and a lot of work) to create such an inviting ambience! Even the walk path down to the dock (by far the finest we saw) has been carefully and thoughtfully maintained. It is steep in some areas so wear good shoes. It's well worth the walk to see and enjoy the lake, which was blissfully quiet. An osprey stopped by to showoff his aerial skills before snatching its prey from the cool water and flying off to enjoy his lunch. Highly recommend this lovely home and peaceful setting!"
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Definitely a great stay! Only like 15 minutes away from great wolf lodge and a little over an hour from six flags ! Would definitely return
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was my first time staying in an AirBnB and I will definitely do this again. The house was beautiful, clean and well stocked with necessities.

House is really clean and everything is new. We brought our two kids and they loved it!"

2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Really enjoyed our stay! Our friends and I had two little ones under 1, felt comfortable and safe, tub big enough for bath time, pack n play provided and kids books (great touch!). So many things provided from laundry pods to dishwasher pods! Very very clean! The dock is a pretty steep walk, but it rained all weekend so we enjoyed the “flamingo lounge” during nap time without worry of waking the babies! We tried out the grill and do feel the outdoor space is deserving of a good grill, compared to what’s there- but it did the job! Maya was fantastic with responding and being so helpful!"
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"The property was so beautiful, the house was cozy, warm and inviting and so spacious at the same time. Super clean and sticker with everything you need for a calming chill getaway. You can tell Maya puts so much into this home with every little detail.
A bit of a hike to the dock but so worth it.
We can't wait to be back and wish we could move in😊
Thank you Maya!"

the lake."

2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"nice, interesting place. Charles was helpful, friendly and responsive. the building is some 10 yards fromthe main house and other homes on the street, whichis on the drive to the Hills and Dale's gardens, making it lovely and also near the college campus so quote walkable. we were glad to have our little dogs with us. The media room is full of curious and historical family treasures and there are plenty of tvs and furniture. Things were clean and the very small ""kitchen"" stocked with water and coffee. I would have liked more kitchen counter space and a sink in the same room, so we wound up eating out more than we planned.
Overall, quite novel and fascinating while clean and comfortable. The small, historical building gives a farmhouse feel to the experience of being on someone's manor."

My girlfriend and I felt safe and comfortable here, and Charles was the most responsive and accommodative host we could have asked for. Clearly, much effort and consideration went into designing each room in the guest cottage, and everything was very clean and all appliances were functional. No issues or trouble whatsoever, and nothing more to be asked for. I could not imagine staying elsewhere upon our return to Lagrange. Ten out of ten in every way."

Plenty of green space and sidewalks to walk them, and enough room for us to stretch out. Charles was a great host.

2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"All of the superlatives!!
We absolutely feel blessed for this being our first time using AirBnB and encountering this gem. For a ""Couple+small senior dog"", this is a drive-plus10-hrs-destination-for-a-5-day-stay MUST experience. We spent hours admiring the place when we first arrived, we felt both at-home but also on a movie set (no other way to describe it). I honestly wished I could spend a week, dare I say month, here. Remember the proper light switch for the Keurig, be sure to set aside time for moments for yourself at the piano, bring your favorite chilled beverages (there is plenty of room), and absolutely spend 8 minutes in ""the chair"" on setting B while watching an episode of Everybody Loves Raymond. You will leave better than you arrived.
Heaven, will do again, 10 out of 10."

We especially appreciated being able to prepare simple meals and bring in local takeout during our stay.

2019-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Staying in Charles' guest house is like staying in a thoughtfully curated history and art museum. His place is beautiful and spacious yet cozy and intimate.

2018-12-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"The place was very unique and in a wonderful area. It worked well for our one- night stay, but I would recommend bringing extra blankets or asking Charles to turn up the heat before you arrive... the space seems to take a while to heat up. He was very nice, and quick to respond every time we messaged him."
2018-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great place to stay!
2018-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The cottage was better in-person than in photos. Bed was comfortable and there was a fridge and freezer available to use. The living room area to the back of the cottage was quite large and very nicely decorated; a great space to sit, talk, and relax. Everything was very clean and tidy. Convenient location within walking distance of the downtown square. Would definitely rent again!"

You'll want to return, as do I."
2017-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,A superbly fascinating place to stay. Phenomenal guest home in a great location for downtown LaGrange!
2017-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Very unique place. Really enjoyed it.
2017-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Charles’s cottage is exactly as described and shown in pictures, but even more artistic and charming in person. It’s located in a beautiful neighborhood and only steps away from the historic Hills and Dales estate which is well worth a visit. The cottage offers a clean and interesting setting with a comfortable bed, good WiFi, and several tv options including Netflix.
It’s also a quiet neighborhood so peaceful sleep is likely!
Charles provides bottled water, sodas, and coffee in the dorm style kitchen which has a microwave and small refrigerator. He also responds promptly to any questions. One of his tips I followed was dining at Mare Sol on Main Street. Delicious meal of braised pork shanks and a great beer selection. The menu offered many good choices.
My dog and I had a fine visit and enjoyed the friendliness of everyone we met in LaGrange."
2017-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This was our second stay at Charles and Florence's place. And we had an equally satisfying experience as the first time! We continue to recommend these hosts and their home.
2017-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The eclectic character along with the history you can feel, made this a gem of a place to stay. The photos on Airbnb are accurate, but they don't measure up to what you're really getting.
The cold drinks and coffee materials were greatly appreciated.
We've already booked our next visit!"
2017-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This little cottage is so cute!! It is decorated with the coolest memorabilia that makes your stay very entertaining. Charles is a great communicator so you feel very comfortable staying there because you know all of the necessary information and he answers your questions within minutes-an hour. He is also extremely accommodating and makes your stay as easy as possible.
2017-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"It was my first time doing an Airbnb so I was a little nervous. But this cottage was perfect! It had the most INTERESTING antiques and pieces of family history scattered throughout the quaint little place.
The neighborhood was very quiet so my family and I were able to sleep and relax as we pleased. But when we wanted to go out there was plenty to do and see. The perfect balance.
The part I found most comforting was that Charles was VERY responsive. Whenever I messaged him he answered quickly and was VERY kind! I also very much appreciated the flexibility of the check in and more importantly the check out times. I traveled with my elderly parents and checking out at 11am is difficult to do with them. The flexibility of checkout gave me one less thing to stress about.
Overall, I would HIGHLY recommend this place."
2017-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"What a wonderful Charming Guest Cottage. Pictures are great but even better in person. Be sure to indulge in the massaging chair which is a nice treat after a long day of hiking or biking. Charles had great communication and was very accommodating.

Thanks so much...

This stay was perfect for my friends and me and better than expected! -Highly recommend-"
2017-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Wonderful cottage steps from the beautiful Hills and Dales estate. Private home with wonderful amenities and neat curated antiques throughout. Would stay Here again in a heart beat. The stocked fridge and comfortable bed were a plus! Thanks Charles!

I highly recommend this place to anyone traveling to La Grange.
2017-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,The charming cottage was a very unique accommodation. The pictures do not do it justice. The bed slept comfortably and the shower felt wonderful. There was coffee and other munchies supplied by the host which was such a thoughtful touch. There is a very large walk in closet and plenty of drawer space. We very much enjoyed our stay and look forward to returning when we have more time to explore the LaGrange area.
2017-02-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"Charles' home was perfect for the nature of our trip- a quick and spontaneous weekend adventure. It was about an easy, hour-long drive to Atlanta, which we did the first day. The second day we went hiking in Pine Mountain (FDR State Park) and that was about a 45 minute commute as well. The location of Charles' home is ideal for someone looking for a quaint and beautiful place to stay for 2-3 people, but be prepared to drive a bit if you plan on going anywhere outside of LaGrange. The only drawback was that it was quite dusty on the inside and not very clean in the living room, but I will say that the bedroom and bathroom were very clean and neat. We would definitely stay here again if we ever ventured back to LaGrange!"
2017-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Loved the cottage with so many art objects to enjoy, and the nearby walkable Hills & Dales Estate."
2024-06-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,Jacqueline was very responsive to any questions or concerns I had. The home was as described. It was clean inside and you can tell they are working on upgrading the home.
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The house was clean, and the beds and couch were comfortable. The location is very rural and quiet and feels safe. There was hospitality like snacks in the kitchen, shampoo/conditioner/body wash in the showers, reading material, a hairdryer, and blankets. The fire pit was a nice touch. It is a work in progress, which we knew going in. This AirBnb is a good option if you are looking in this area for a quiet, uncluttered place to get a good night's sleep."
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,Really enjoyed to privacy. We will be staying here again.
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,It was absolutely great
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,What a great place to stay!
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Great location! Was in country as it was described but you can reach town with then 15 minutes. We were able to visit Callaway, Lagrange, Roanoke, Alabama and West Point. If we had any questions, they were answered quickly. We also had neighbors behind us but never heard anything from them. Thinking about going back next year."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,The house was very welcoming. We appreciate the Christmas decoration. It was a very cheerful atmosphere and we needed it to lift our spirits.
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We highly enjoyed our stay! The place was clean and had a very warm, home-like feel to it. The host was great and communicated well with me! She explained that the home was located a little further out and was very honest about what to expect as soon as I booked so if it wasn’t what I thought I could find something else, which was really nice. Being a few minutes away from everything was okay with us and we would definitely stay there again in the future!!"

2023-11-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,"This space is nice if you have something in the area and want to avoid some of the expensive hotel costs. As a note: the house is ~10min from the expressway on mostly unlit roads so it is hard to find at night, and the space is definitely a work-in-progress as there are several spaces where there is chipped paint or messy caulking."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We felt right at home. She is a very helpful and responsive host. Everything was as pictured. We would definitely stay again if ever in the area.

2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"This place was perfect. Friday I went to a concert at Sweetland Amphitheater, which was about 20 minutes away. The rest of the trip was for relaxing and being away from things. It is not in the city, but close to it. The porch was great and relaxing. As a solo female traveler I felt very safe, even coming back at around 10pm by myself.
Note that the guest rooms do not have TVs and the yard is not fenced in (if that matters for you and your guests)."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We stayed here for 2 nights after leaving Florida during a hurricane and it was perfect for us. We were able to bring our dog, which we needed to do in this case.

2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This location is serene and peaceful. If you need to “check out” for a few days, and be removed from the bustle of daily life,this is the place for you. I enjoyed my stay of 5 days and hope to return. Quiet and off the beaten path. The hosts were extremely responsive to a few minor issues; the place is clean, neat, and I had everything I needed for a work/vacation stay. If the weather was cooler during my stay, I would have used the porch and fire pit area. Thank you for a great stay!"

We were in for my son’s graduation from Auburn and was an easy 30 min drive to town. Jacqueline is quick to respond to any questions or concerns. As a Superhost myself, I love staying with Superhosts to compare accommodations and see how others are finding success. Jacqueline is definitely doing it right. I would definitely stay at any of her properties based on my experience with her and highly recommend her place to others!"
2023-04-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Exactly as described and pictured. Front porch is inviting. VERY comfortable beds. Host responded quickly to inquiries.

The bottle of wine, fire log, and snacks were a nice touch and were fully consumed! We renewed our marriage vows under the canopy of trees near the lake and it was the perfect setting. We definitely plan on returning next year - perhaps in the spring. Our stay there exceeded our expectations. It was a wonderful weekend."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"What a great escape for a single seeking a personal retreat, a couple wanting a cozy setting or an active family seeking adventure! Roy and Sara were perfect hosts and had their cabin prepared for a red carpet welcome. So many extra little touches!

The cabin felt brand new, had everything we needed, beds were comfortable, the decor was tasteful, the kayaks were such a blessing. I could live there. I highly recommend it! Roy thought of everything. The wine, mini toiletries, chocolate, coffee and popcorn. He left a starter fire log in case we needed it but we had plenty of pine needles, twigs and wood to have a nice fire in the fire pit to have our s’mores. Fabulous place! So clean, odor free. Answered all of my questions, and I can be annoying.
We hated to leave. Please stay at Roy’s! If we are ever back in the area we will! Thank you!"

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Carol's place should be renamed Pearson Pines Perfection. It surpassed all our expectations. The property is better in person than in the photos, with beautifully maintained grounds and a tastefully decorated interior. Every room was immaculate and thoughtfully appointed.
The beds were comfy, and everyone slept great. We cooked several full meals for the family, and the kitchen had everything we needed. Thoughtful touches like clearly labeled switches and appliances made the home easy to navigate. The wifi was strong and consistent. They do request that you leave your shoes at the door, so it might be a good idea to pack some slippers in cooler months.
Carol was a joy to work with. Her proactive approach was evident when she swiftly resolved a minor booking issue for us (from the Airbnb side), displaying grace and professionalism.

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,The location was great and the house was beautiful.
2024-04-01,5.0,Group trip,"It would be hard to write a good enough review to describe our experience at Pearson’s Pines. The place was immaculate. There’s not a detail overlooked. It is decorated beautifully, extremely well-stocked, spotlessly cleaned and Carol is ultra-responsive to any need. If you’re looking for a place close to Calloway Gardens, Pine Mountain, or Bogle Farms (which is what we stayed here for)…you’d be hard pressed to find a better spot. Awesome place and host!!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We loved our stay at Carol’s home. We rode our bikes to Callaway Gardens during the day and enjoyed the peace and tranquility in the evening sitting outside at night. The architecture – inside and out - was a blend of modern sophistication and rustic charm. All rooms had comfortable furniture with colorful paintings on the walls and beautiful rugs on the floors. It was easy to prepare all our meals in the well-appointed kitchen. The laundry closet had a state-of-the-art washer/dryer as well. The bathrooms are luxurious with everything we needed. Every detail of the interior and exterior had been meticulously arranged to make a wonderful getaway.

Carol was a terrific host – gracious and friendly. We loved her home and we can’t wait to return."
2024-04-01,5.0,Group trip,"This home is gorgeous inside and out. The layout, the location, the setting, the impeccable furnishings… I just can’t say enough. Carol is an amazing host - proactive, approachable, kind - I enjoyed every interaction! If you’re visiting Pine Mountain, stay here - you’ll be so glad you did!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The two days that I stayed at Carol's place were very refreshing and relaxing. I really felt pampered. Every room was luxurious, well stocked and designed with such thoughtfullness and precision. The art work was beautiful and the place looked like something out of a magazine. I stayed by myself and left feeling very tranquil from the breathtaking views. There was plenty of room for my family which I plan to bring next time that I come. Day 1: I ordered food and on day 2: I drove a few minutes up the road to Calloway Gardens for the Spring Festival and take out and came back as quickly as possible in order to continue to enjoy the space.
This is a stay that I will not soon forget!"

We will probably stay again next Christmas."
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"We could not have asked for a more relaxing and cozy home to get away from the stress of moving. David was an exceptional host and responded immediately to any question during our stay. The neighbor and their darling pups were a great addition, as well. I would suggest that the WIFI password be posted in the instructions or on the cute little chalk board in the kitchen. We will recommend this wonderful home to family when they come to visit us!

Our family of six fit comfortably in the home. The master suite and common area is very spacious. Our favorite part of this stay was the lake. It is approximately a 300' short walk from the house. There is a beach area where you can access the water. During our stay, the water was warm but clean. My family enjoyed floating and swimming. There is a useful outdoor shower to rinse off after swimming."

2020-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"David's home is specious and clean with well equipped kitchen, lots of extra towels/linens and small details around the house to make you feel welcomed. What makes this place SUPER special is the BACK YARD with the beautiful wooded area and a private access to the lake. Pictures of the listing do not justify this beauty, so you have to come here and personally experience it. To describe his back yard with one word - SERENITY (from the dusk to the dawn). Pure heaven!!! David was extremely quick to respond to our questions (via SMS) about the grocery shopping etc. I am grateful to the previous reviewer who mentioned the neighbor's large unleashed dogs because they surrounded our car when we first arrived at David's house. They are so cute and friendly, so please do NOT be afraid of them bc they only crave to be pat by anybody After sniffing you upon arrival, they will definitely not bother you again; you will even feel secured knowing that they are near you to protect you. My 8 year son was so trilled to see them around."

I’d definitely recommend David’s place!!"

The home is spacious, clean, homelike, and nestled in a lovely wooded area with a view of the lake. You are truly one with nature! The path leading to the lake is so pretty - at the first of the path are stones and landscaping. I loved sitting on the little private beach area listening to the birds sing - so relaxing!! Also enjoyed exploring the lake with my son, on the kayak. David's place has special touches that make you feel at home - we loved lighting the candles, and loved the decorative lights on the deck. The kitchen is extremely well stocked - perfect for cooking all your meals while there. There are also 2 very sweet dogs that came to visit us routinely (from next door) and accompanied us on our walks to the lake. These dogs are large, but so gentle! The checkim-in / out process We will definitely be going back"
2020-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place is breath taking ! The lake is unexplainable . It’s so relaxing, so calming and a much needed get away

The home had countless thoughtful touches like: fishing poles, spotlight, blankets, fluffy towels for both the shower and the lake, paper plates, coffee, trash bags… It would take a long time to list all the extra touches that we were grateful for and not expecting to find. The home is beautiful, clean, and pet friendly. We hope to stay again soon."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Very quaint house on the lake. Anything you could possibly think you might need was provided from beach towels to life jackets. Unfortunately, it was too cold for us to really enjoy the wonderful surroundings."

,,,She is a liar !!accused of many things tried to charge $200 for cake icing
,,,"There was no AC. It was almost 80 degrees when we got there at 4pm, so we turned it to 70 and went to dinner. We also cleaned up a bunch of dead bugs on the carpet. The host came and said nothing was wrong with the AC, but it kept sitting at 77 to 75 for hrs, & we felt no air from the vents. I assumed it only cooled a few degrees because it was night time. So, we called AirBNB. The host then said it would be sometime the next day, and we could wait on workmen to fix it. We then packed up and left driving 4hrs home to Columbia SC, covered in heat rash, at 10pm at night. The final temp was 77°. Callaway Gardens still is refusing to refund our tickets we purchased online (roughly 78$), & AirBNB could not find us comparable accomodations. They did inform us that the AC not working had been mentioned by another person staying at this location (after the fact in a complaint), so check that the AC is working before unpacking, & call AIRBNB immediately, or you won't get your money back."
