Went to AirBNB on a whim and was SO lucky to find this place still available for the night! Deborah made the reservation process easy and gave us the door code so we could let ourselves in since we knew we would arrive late. The layout was great for our family with two teenage boys: One master with a queen sized bed, two bedrooms with two twin beds each."

2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"My family and I thoroughly enjoyed this property. It was absolutely serene and exactly as described in listing.

2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,We had a wonderful stay here at Johnathan and Gail’s cabin. Johnathan was very friendly and showed us around is properly. He clarified any questions we had and proactively anticipated aspects of the stay we might’ve not known to ask. We stayed here after visiting the Sylvan Bird Park (highly recommend) and it was a great place to stay for the night before we headed home.
2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,I feel lucky to have found such a wonderful location on my travels from NJ to FL. This was the perfect halfway-point for us to relax and enjoy the peace & quiet. I’m looking forward to returning in the future!

We stayed only one night. Hopefully we will come back again when it is warmer!"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I needed a quiet place with Wifi to finish a project… this worked out perfectly for me. Cabin even had a small desk and chair- basic, not anything fancy, but it was all I needed. I’d stay there again, Maybe bring the family next time!"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Gail and John are perfect host in a serene and peaceful setting. Make sure you add the farm tour and go into her studio and buy her art. If you’re interested in homesteading this is the place to check out as well!
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We enjoyed our time at OwlTree Acres Homestead. Everything was so thoughtfully put together and managed. It was cold for our December visit, but the cabin was warm and the shower was hot. We had everything we needed for our one night stay along our long drive, between PA and FL. We enjoyed talking with Jonathan. He really has a beautiful property and has implemented sustainable practices that are admirable!"

Would be nice to stay for any amount of time as it accommodates all of the basic needs nicely."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great hospitality, location and communication, would highly recommend"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"Loved the setting!! Very quiet with nothing but the sounds of nature. The cabin is roomy and well-stocked. Yes, I will be back! I can’t imagine how the stay would be with a fire in the fire pit on a cool night!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"ok, this is the 4th time I stay at Gail & Jon's cabin. :D It's always a great comfy rest spot. Very comfy bed. Peaceful. Where else can you bring a guitar or ukulele? Well, I guess you could bring it to an hotel, but here yo can actually play it in peace. :D On the way back out to the main highway I stopped and took a picture of some big cotton fields. Nice down-to-earth friendly folks. This is a great affordable clean place to reset between destinations. I plan to be back many more times! All the very best!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"Gail & Jon's place is my FAVOURITE midway point stop on my business trips between New Jersey and Charleston South Carolina. Comfy, peaceful and serene. I even brought my ukulele. If you're an astronomer, bring your telescope because the sky is very clear and free of contamination from smog or city lights. Gail & Jon are very nice folks too. Everything I needed. Feels like a mini vacation in the middle of a business trip. If you're into yoga or Pilates, bring your mat. Plenty of spots on the property where you can exercise outdoors and in nature. This is the 3rd time I'm here."

If I could I would review this place above 5 stars. Gail and Jonathan are very good people. Really glad I got to stay at their sunflower cabin. Cabin and bathroom were very clean as described and all amenities listed were provided. The cabin has beautiful surroundings and perfect place for a relaxing getaway."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,We loved staying at the farm shack! We felt like we were staying with family. The setting was so picturesque. We loved sitting on the porch and watching the songbirds steal food from the chickens.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,Such a cute little farm! The hosts were very friendly and available! They showed us around and made sure we had everything we needed for our stay! Very sweet and considerate!

2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Nice place fantastic people
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We had a great time!
My children had a blast feeding the animals. We got to check on them everyday. They have a cute trail on the property, perfect for morning or evening strolls. The outdoor kitchen worked great for us. We actually received some fresh eggs from the host that we used for breakfast. The outdoor shower is a life saver on a hot day.
We got to visit the gift shop. They have a really cool concept, self sufficient farm, both creative people. Just overall a good time.
Thank you for having us !"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,super cute. would stay again
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,I had a great experience staying at Gail & Jonathan’s! They were proactive with great communication and very friendly. The farm is so peaceful and beautiful! Will recommend to family and friends. Thanks for everything!
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"Loved the stay. Very nice couple. Had a nice conversation with one of the owners, and got to hear a couple hunting stories! Great place!!!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,We had a lovely time! Our toddler had a blast seeing the animals and exploring the farm. The beds were comfy and the whole place was quiet and felt very safe! Thank you Gail and Jonathan - y’all are very inspiring!
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We are definitely planning a trip to this area so we can stay at Gail’s place longer than we were able to this time! Our family enjoyed being able to learn more about the property, animals, and surrounding areas thanks to Gail and John’s kindness & hospitality. This was a great way to feel the fun of being in an outdoor setting, but with lots of upgrades to also feel the comforts of home."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,Wonderful peaceful stay! A little piece of heaven in the country. Cabin was adorable. Very clean. They have everything you need to feel comfortable. Beautiful homestead. Charming and friendly couple that welcomes you like family!
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"I wish we could have spent several days here instead of just one night! I was a little worried since the bathhouse isn't attached to the cabin but it wasn't an issue at all. The bathhouse was probably the nicest detached bathroom/shower I've ever been in and the cabin was extremely comfy. Too comfy actually- we completely over slept and woke up 10 min before checkout. But they were so nice about it and still gave us a 40 min tour of their property and the different things they do to be self sustainable.
I would HIGHLY recommend!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Loved our 4-day weekend at the sunflower cabin! Got a full tour and a little farm education from Jonathan, and enjoyed a stroll in the woods behind the farm. Gail's garden is gorgeous and the whole property is very quiet and peaceful. We were even able to make a meal in their outdoor kitchen and spend an evening playing cards and games by the bonfire :)
Highly recommend reading the local recommendations for food and activities as well - Medoc mountain, the cryptozoology museum, Lynch's BBQ, etc. make good nearby destinations.
Thanks for a lovely stay!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,We had such a lovely time. Very peaceful and beautiful farm. The cabin was perfect for our needs. It is a bit of a walk to the bathroom but we didn’t mind. Hosts were very responsive and helpful. They have the kids a tour of the farm and shared stories about their lives. We would recommend and stay again if we are in the area.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very peaceful!!! Relaxing!!! Pet friendly!!!
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,Great location off the beaten path! The outdoor shower (next to the indoor shower) and the outdoor kitchen (as a second option) were perfect. Will be back if I am in the area.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Very quaint little area that felt just like home! I had to check in around midnight due to travel issues, but she said that was no problem and it all worked out. Close enough to 95 for travelers, far enough from main roads for those seeking a peaceful staycation!
My visit was very short due to my agenda so I wasn’t able to interact with Ms. Gail or her husband, but they seemed very sweet and welcoming. Would certainly recommend to anyone considering this location!
I will certainly be back if the opportunity is presented!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"It's places like Owl Tree Acres that are the reason I use AirBnB. So much character! Cozy, clean, charming. I came here for a trip to Medoc Mountain, which is just a couple minutes down the road. Gail and Jon gave me a tour of their lovely farm and told me about their life and their philosophy, and I am grateful for the time and attention they gave me."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Gail's Cabin and Farm ended up being more than we expected. The hosts were amazing. The property was well kept and nicely put together. Cabin was cozy, quiet, and peaceful. The farm was great. It was a wonderful experience. Would definitely stay here again."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,Such a great place. Wish we had a little more time to explore the farm more. My kids especially like the hens and rabbits.
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,Great spot!

2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,such a wonderful stay on a beautiful farm! I'm excited to come back and visit in the future!
2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,Cute spot
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This past weekend was fantastic. I did not get to speak with Gail too much, but her husband was very kind, respectful, and checking in when needed. He is full of stories too. Loved it! Their place is beautiful, the animals were a bonus, and it was very peaceful. I highly recommend. 🙂"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,Very quaint and peaceful working farm.
2023-04-01,4,Stayed one night,Listing as described. Very nice hosts

2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"The hosts were really friendly and helpful. everything went off without a hitch. I've stayed at a number of airbnbs and the photos are often glamor shots or edited. The photos for this listing are identical to what it actually looks like. My bed was surprisingly very comfortable, It was a pleasant surprise. wouldn't hesitate to stay here again"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,The Gail’s place was an excellent choice. I definitely recommend it to everyone.
2023-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"quiet, peaceful, homey. Jonathon and Gail were incredibly kind and generous. they gave us a tour of their property . it was so fascinating to see all their animals and learn howthey started and why. Not only was it cozy and cute butwe learned a lot. I would definitely stay here again and recommend it to other travelers."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed one night,Cute place a must stay!
2023-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We came to town for a Bday party and stayed here for 2 nights. It was a very convenient location to where the party was in Roanoke Rapids. I didn’t get a chance to meet Gail but I did speak to her husband John both mornings and he is a very nice man. The cabin and bathhouse are very nicely built.
One of the chicken pens is situated fairly close to the cabin. If you are not familiar with Roosters be prepared to wake up to his crowing at the crack of dawn….I have them myself so it was a normally part of my day that I love.
Very cute place, would definitely stay here again."
2023-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"Cozy, comfortable and quiet. Although the roosters will wake you up at dawn. 😀"
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Gail’s farm is a beautiful and relaxing place to stay. It’s the perfect place for a weekend getaway or an extended stay. We would highly recommend visiting. Thanks for a great weekend!!
2023-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"Please note! There is no bathroom within the cabin, it is a walk away and not far but something I hadn’t realized initially. The location is extremely well kept and fairly quiet for it being so near a road. The roosters will wake you up early if you need it too haha. The whole cabin is so quaint and stocked with many appliances. We only stayed for a rest stop but it was memorable and pleasant."
2023-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"Wow! One the best, if not the best Airbnb I’ve stayed at- clean and absolutely adorable😍"
2023-01-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Such a cute place and nice hosts. Very clean and cozy. Stopped by for just 1 night, traveling from FL to PA. Would have loved to have stayed longer (and experienced it during warmer weather).
Got to talk with Jonathan about some of the many things they do on their homestead. So interesting. Will likely stay again."
2023-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,We stopped at this Airbnb along our road trip home and it was so cozy and comfortable. The property was beautiful and quite inspiring for a dreaming future homesteader like us. We enjoyed a good conversation with the owner before we left and even got to purchase a couple items from the store. All around- we loved it here and would love to return in the future!
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Where do I start….
This place is a slice of heaven. The hosts of this property, Jonathan and Gail are the most kind-hearted people. They welcome you like family. During my stay, I gained so much knowledge on the farm from the both of them.
I honestly had a hard time leaving!!!!
I found so much peace & serenity walking the property. The best hosts hands down. I have now been able to stop talking about my visit since leaving. I will 100% be back.
The space had everything one could need and then some!
Such a warm, loving couple.
You have got to stop at the store and check out the amazing jewelry, gnomes and wooden cutting boards by both Jonathan, Gail, and Denise. I have received so many compliments on my earring made by Denise!
Such an amazingly refreshing stay. A very special one i will always remember!!!
There is so much more I could add but you should just experiencing it for yourself!! It will be blessed!
So much gratitude to you!"
2023-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,"My family loved this stay. We only stayed for the night but they were more than accommodating of our last minute reservation. We were given some event information to return, which we definitely will. Loved the conversation we had with John! Can’t wait to come back!"
2023-01-01,5,Stayed one night,This spot is a gem! Great stay if you’re in the area!
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"great visit! greeted with a tour of the farm, spent the night around a nice camp fire, and got to visit their little store!"
2022-12-01,5,Stayed one night,Sunflower cabin is cozy and warm.
2022-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,"It was an excellent experience, living on a farm, away from modern life. It's a safe and clean residence. The only thing that could bother some people is the bathroom being away from the cabin but it is not a big deal. I would highly recommend it 👍
Living on a farm is a beautiful experience, far from the noise of cities and modernity. Clean and secure space. The only thing that might bother some is having the restroom away from the cabin. Highly recommend"
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Gail and Jonathon are gracious host who make you feel like a member of their family. Have a beatiful prpertu that is well maintained and accomodating to my needs.
I will definitely come back and recommend them to friends"
2022-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Exactly as advertised. We found the beds to be comfortable …dog beds were a nice touch! Very clean!
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My stay at Sunflower Cabin was incredible. The cabin and bathhouse had a close-to-nature coziness while also being modern and incredibly comfortable (with plenty of electrical outlets, hot water in the shower, and heaters for my wintertime stay).
Gail was extremely kind and accommodating when I needed to make last-minute changes to plans. I briefly ran into both Gail and Johnathan during my stay, and they were very friendly and helpful when I asked for good trails or restaurant recommendations nearby.
Owl Tree Acres is a beautiful property, and lovely, quiet stay. I cannot recommend this place enough!"
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We very much enjoyed Gail and Jon’s hospitality during our stay. We spent time hiking the local state park and visiting some restaurants in Littleton and Halifax, North Carolina. Really enjoyed living on a farm for a few days, and the hosts both took time to explain all the features and functionality of the facility. We were impressed with the large group fire pit area along with covered seating, ice maker and cooking facilities nearby. The farm was nicely decorated for Christmas and bathroom facilities were warm and cozy, including lots of toiletry supplies in case you forgot to bring yours. John and Gail have a wonderful home made artisan shop that we took advantage of – purchased some necklaces for the kids and a cutting board for home. We enjoyed lots of good conversation and felt right at home in this cozy beautiful cabin, with comfortable furniture and reliable light and heat. Heard Owls too. We will definitely visit again, and encourage others to do the same! Seasons, greetings!"
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"As someone who lives on a farm, this was like a home away from home! Gail & John are super hosts and their place is unique, quite, and quaint. I’ll gladly stay here again!"
2022-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"So many things I could say about my stay with John and Gale, all AMAZING! 5/5 experience. Road-tripping with a dog is challenging, especially on long days. Staying at a place like this is exactly the kinda thing we needed! Checked in around 3 and was entertained, had time to relax and rest, and got to check out local restaurants recommended by John. The storefront is a must check out, i got some amazing earrings made by Gale and a one of kind cutting board made by John! :) Also ask for a bonfire, you won’t regret it. I’ll be back, and telling everyone I know about this place. Thanks guys! See you next time :)"
2022-11-01,5,Stayed one night,Awesome country stay. Relaxing...
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I’ll try to keep this short and sweet and to the point. My wife and I arrived a little later then we hope but none the less John Gail’s husband came out to greet us and make sure we knew were to go as well as the amenities the property offered as we unfortunately did not part take in all the amenities they had to offer however they were very fun If you have kids,feeding chickens and rabbits etc. Our cabin the “sunflower” cabin was ideal for what my wife were looking for the cabin was toasty warm and had all amenities needed inside the cabin and out however at the time it was very dry out so we were not able to have a fire by the cabin but the property does have a communal fire pit which John was able to lite as well as provide fire wood for our stay. Overall our experience with Gail ad John was nothing short of amazing and warm these two have done an amazing job with the dream and we look forward to coming back. Thank you Gail and John for the warm hospitality"
2022-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Gail's place was a wonderful pit stop for our way down 95. Johnathan had lit the fire pit right upon our arrival and communication leading up was excellent. Their farm is very unique with a lot to do and see! Our cabin was clean and cozy and had everything we needed. Highly recommended!!
2022-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"We had such a beautiful stay here. Gail was so responsive and flexible with our late check in and the space was so cozy in nature. It was such a unique spot, and we were able to stay warm during a cold night too. Will definitely be back if I’m in the area again to enjoy the fire pits, gardens, animals, and grill! Very grateful for the hospitality ❤️ p.s. the stars were AMAZING!"
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful spot, we loved the cabin! It was well insulated and cozy. The hosts had the communal fire pit going which kept us warm even with freezing temps. Love this spot and the hosts were so helpful and friendly! We will be back!"
2022-11-01,5,Stayed one night,Such a cute little farm and such nice hosts!
2022-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,A convenient stay for our event at Medoc Mountain State Park. The owners were very friendly and accommodating. We enjoyed chatting with them around the communal fire pit and hearing about their farm.
2022-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"What a fantastic place! The cabin was super cozy w a comfortable bed, plenty of privacy, and the farm is beautiful. Gail is a great host and I fully enjoyed the farm tour as well. Absolutely would stay here again"

2022-10-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Cute place, nice couple!"
2022-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"I had a short but very enjoyable stay. I ended up getting in much later than expected and the hosts were so kind and still met me when I got in. The cabin itself is quaint and cozy, but the property itself is beautiful both during the day and at night. I will definitely be back!"
2022-09-01,5,Stayed one night,Jonathan and Gail were absolutely amazing. They accommodated every need we had and went so far beyond! We enjoyed farm fresh eggs every morning thanks to the lovely chickens. The farm is such a great location for Medoc Mountain State Park! If the weather is nice make sure to enjoy a good campfire! And the outdoor shower! I would stay here again 10/10.
2022-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"What an unexpected surprise we had staying at Owl Tree Farm! The little cabin is brand new and very clean, the bathhouse really cute too! Loved the outdoor shower, endless hot water!
If you stay here definitely ask for the farm tour, there is a $45 fee for a one hour overview of the homestead… worth it! I learned about rain water harvesting, gardening, growing meat rabbits and canning… even how to store canned goods!
The little farm store is a must! Definitely stop in and buy the pain balm. Everything is made by Gail and inexpensive.
Overall this place is a super unique, educational, clean airbnb! I just wish I could have stayed longer. Next time I will definitely utilize the fire pit and I’m taking an art class with Gail (the host!) she is a brilliant artist!
Thank you Gail and John! We will be back!"
2024-06-01,3,Stayed a few nights,"Unfortunately it was not very clean. There was old food left in the microwave, hair on the sheets, and mouse droppings on cooking pans. Will not be staying here again."
2024-06-01,4,Stayed one night,"Host was very responsive. The place was clean and homey. A couple of small cleaning issues, but nothing major and host responded quickly."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Gavin's place was exactly as described and just what we needed. We were fishing down at Lake Gaston and needed a place to park and charge the boat. This house had a nice easy driveway to back into, outlet right along drive, and even a covered place to put the boat. The inside was spotless and comfortable. Definitely a great place to stay if you are visiting Lake Gaston."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great home, comfortable and pleasant! 5 stars, recommend"

2024-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We had a brief but pleasant stay. The house was very comfortable and spacious and the grounds were beautifully maintained. We were so thankful to be able to bring our dog! She loved running in the yard. I was glad that Gavin advised us to plan our meals prior to getting into town, as there was no restaurant or take-out option after we arrived. We would love to stay again and hope we have more time to spend. Thank you Gavin!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The house was very clean and the location was convenient. Gavin responded quickly to my questions.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"house was clean and as described
a little to hotelish for our taste lacked homeyness
after washing hands in bathroom had to walk around looking for towels
received email about making sure dogs not on furniture or beds
and they would know and charge me $30 cleanup fee as they dont normally charge a fee for pets
i appreciated the poop bags but as a responsible pet owner i had my own and was afreaid to let me pets do anything there.
i did like the house and its location, the outside light was great for letting dogs out at night. the recomendation about the pizza place was spot on they were very good."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My sister and I LOVED staying here and look forward to returning. My future wishlist would be to increase the temperature of the shower and better pillows. Neither would keep me from returning. Cute, clean and comfortable!! Thanks Gavin!!"

2022-10-01,3,Stayed with kids,"Very clean and directions were very clear, but bring extra blankets as the thermostat does not adjust and everyone was freezing. Communication with Airbnb and guest was terrible. Messages would not open and Airbnb was not helpful either. I was spending more time trying to tell Airbnb that the hosts messages kept cutting off. Also , the back yard has many fire ant hills."
2022-10-01,5,Stayed with a pet,great place to stay. Gavin is very responsive to questions and give you all needed info even if you don't ask
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"From start to end everything was great. His communication with me was excellent. I asked for some recommendations in the area, all his picks were right n point.

2022-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Great
2022-08-01,4,Stayed with a pet,"We stayed here overnight to break up a long road trip. It was a decent distance from 1-95 but once we got there (late at night) it was very well lit outside which was much appreciated. Inside was clean. Gave us a safe place to sleep, thank you!"
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay in. Very clean and well kept. Everything was organized and labeled for convenience of the guests which was very thoughtful and helpful. Would certainly recommend to everyone who needs a place to stay in that area.
2022-07-01,5,Stayed one night,The house was exactly what we had hoped for. It was convenient to both Lake Gaston and downtown Littleton and the value was better than a hotel room. Everything was well marked and Gavin's communication was excellent. Would definitely stay again.
2022-07-01,5,Stayed over a week,Home was clean and nice place to stay for the month we spent in the area.
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Had a question initially and Gavin was quick to respond. The home was simple, clean, comfortable and well stocked with what we needed and more.

2022-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Good place to stay!
2022-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Gavin’s place was perfect for our family to stay overnight on our long trip to NY. The house was spotless and the beds were comfortable. New fluffy pillows and a coffee station were great. Also, having a dog we really appreciated the doggie bags, bowl, and even a treat for our pup. Overall ideal!"
2022-06-01,4,Stayed with a pet,Nice clean place . About 10-15 minutes off I-95. Excellent host.

As soon as you enter the home it smelled and looked so nice and clean !There where helpful directions throughout the home . Was stocked with a lot of necessities. This was probably one of the best air b&bs we stood at! And PET FRIENDLY!We can’t thank Gavin enough for letting us book this beautiful home!"
2022-05-01,5,Stayed with a pet,We had a great time! Thanks for everything!
2022-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,This was prefect for our stop over while travelling up 95. House was great and host was very responsive/helpful (especially with tips for local activities and facilities).
2022-05-01,5,Stayed over a week,The host was wonderful. The house was clean and accommodating. My family and I stayed there for over 7mths due to a job assignment. We never had to worry about anything. They were friendly and welcoming. I DEFINITELY recommend this Host.

2021-08-01,5,Stayed one night,This is a smaller home that is that is all brick and a little older but is super clean and extremely well maintained. I found it to be a very good value for the money.
2021-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This house was a great place to stay for a night on our way to Maryland. It was very clean and we had a super easy check in/out process. The hosts were very informative, though it felt like all the messages were scheduled or copy/pasted as I messaged a few times and never actually got a response specific to my messages. Everything about this place was good but I don’t think it was worth the price we paid to stay there - for almost $200 for the night with added Airbnb fees etc ($120ish without fees) I had higher expectations for quality of bedding, towels, kitchen amenities, furniture. It’s a cute, clean place, but a bit pricey for what you get."
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Exactly the same as the photos. Gavin was very responsive and helpful. The home is loaded with everything you could need. And the lake was 10min away an absolutely delightful
2021-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,Clean and tucked away from the road. The beds were super cozy! Gavin was very easy to communicate with and kind..We took our small children and they enjoyed walking around the backyard and sitting outside with us on the patio furniture. It was comfortable and just what we needed for our 1 night stay!! Thanks Gavin!!
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We enjoyed our time at Gavin’s place. It was very quiet and clean. The description was accurate. Check in was easy and communication was exceptional. It is close to Lake Gaston and a grocery store in Littleton. The property is so reasonably priced for the accommodations. In the future, we’d like to return or stay in another one of Gavin’s properties."
2021-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,As always we had a great time and look forward to going back!
2021-07-01,5,Stayed about a week,Always a good communication with the Host!
2021-07-01,5,Group trip,Great place to stay and very open and private! Gavin was great at communication and being responsive to calls.
2021-06-01,4,Stayed with kids,"Beautiful tranquil property! Property owner Gavin was kind and responded fast. This property Has enough land for kids to run around. If you want a place to unwind from a long road trip of from living in a city this is perfect. Piggly wiggly supermarket 3 minutes away. Only thing is that the washing machine wouldn’t start. It turns on but does not disperse the water.
Overall great place!"
2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"No complaints, everything was great"
2021-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,My daughter and I needed a place to stay close by after a quick visit to Lake Gaston. This was just what we needed. The host communicated well with me and made it an easy process to stay the night at this location. Thanks!
2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The house was spacious, clean and very comfortable. It was easy to fine right on the main highway.. We will use it again."
2021-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"This was my second stay at one of Gavin’s locations. This house was clean, looked just like the pictures, and had a large yard which was great for my dog. I love the thoughtfulness put in as well - he not only has things for humans to enjoy but also left a biscuit for my dog as well. Check in and out was very simple and his communication is fantastic. Thanks for another great stay!"
2021-06-01,5,Group trip,Impeccably Clean - great deal to stay close to 95 for our family for a night.
2021-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Exactly as pictured and more. Finding this gem was like a dream for me as I had one night between visiting friends in Asheville and Richmond. As soon as I booked, I immediately received a very comprehensive check-in message from Gavin that answered any question I could have had. Even being able to do a load of laundry was supremely helpful. Truly the perfect respite. Highly recommended!"
2021-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,Great place!! Super clean with all amenities we needed. Would definitely recommend this place to anyone. Has a large lot and if you have children could come in handy. We enjoyed our stay and would definitely stay again.
2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We enjoy this property. We have stayed here 2 times and have booked again for July.

2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"good location, very nice place and great communication with the host"
2021-05-01,4,Stayed one night,A great place out in a country setting. Gavin was very quick to respond on very short notice.
2024-04-01,4,Stayed a few nights,It was relaxing and peaceful.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Pros:
Very clean and peaceful place.
Beautiful views.
Absolutely helpful and responsive host.
Cons:
Not a problem for us but a better description of the narrow spiral staircase leading to the upstairs bedroom might be helpful to make a decision for the elderly and physically impaired folks."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"My family and I spent Easter weekend at this location, it was everything we wanted. Beautiful scenery, quiet getaway, and relaxing. Love all the decks and places to enjoy outside. We hope to go back in the summer when we can enjoy the lake. Will definitely rent again."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was the perfect getaway for our family. The games, yard, lots of sleeping spaces, and lake access was perfect. We definitely look forward to come back again."
2024-01-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"A beautifully located lake house. A very reasonable size for a group of 2, and Great Lake views from all windows. A good size kitchen for the house, and very comfortable for the weekend."
2024-01-01,4,Stayed with a pet,We loved the setting and the freedom for our dog to be outside and go for nice long walks. The view of the water was great! Kitchen was adequate and the bed was comfortable. The fireplace can heat the place up in no time! I would go back in a heartbeat
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,This is a great spot if you want somewhere private on a lake with an amazing view. Some of the nicest sunsets my wife and I have seen. We want to come back in the summer when it's warmer to really enjoy the lake next time.
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,Great place to getaway. Beautiful views. Hosts are responsive to any needs.
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,Pictures don’t do it justice. It’s a private retreat in the woods with so many available outdoor amenities and activities. We had a wonderful weekend and only regret we didn’t book an extra night!
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The house was beautiful!!! It was a little scary first night because there are no blinds on the windows and it was pretty dark but it was wonderful after that. I wish there were private bedrooms but other then that it was great. I don’t go to the gym at all but I wish I did after walking up and down those stairs to get to the water.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"It was the most perfect place and town for our anniversary!!! The local town was so cute, great antique shops found some great things!! House was peaceful we didn’t even want to leave the house! Def will be back"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Great little house with beautiful view
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,very nice
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"My wife and I had a wonderful weekend get away. Kayaking was very peaceful. You may have some trouble getting the kayaks down to the water. Heads up if you have dogs that they let free roam, the neighbors also have dogs and their house is only about 50 feet away. Also just a bit odd to me that the only blinds/curtains in the home were in the bathroom. Besides that, wonderful setting."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with a pet,If you are seeking peaceful airbnb this is the place. Home is nice and clean but it is little overly decorated for our taste but that would not stop us from coming back. Our kids loved it. Outdoor space is beautiful and surrounded with nature. It is a quiet a hike to get to the lake so if you have any knee issues this might not be for you. Host is very responsive and wonderful with directions.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,We had a great time and it was just what we were looking for. The house was very clean and it had some nice decor around that made it feel like a home. It is a very quiet location on the lake with only a couple houses around. But it felt as if we were there by ourselves. We had a great time spinding time on the lake swimming and going down the slide. Also did some fishing in the canoe and kayak catching a few bass. Tje host made it easy to access the house and answered any questions and were available for us. We would definitely recommend this house!
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Our family of 4 and our dog had such a great time at Jeremy’s place. The property is one of the most beautiful we’ve seen with so much to do and explore.
We spent most of our time swimming and kayaking in the lake. Loved being able to eat our meals out on the dock with a view. We even saw fireflies one evening which was a first for us!
The house was spotless and cozy with everything we needed( including an awesome collection of DVDs).
We loved our stay so much that we had to book an extra night!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Such a great stay! Beautiful area and home. We loved being on the water for a few days with our pups. Hope to return in the future!!
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The hosts were fantastic! Great place to stay! Definitely lots of steps to the water but so worth it. Would recommend and will be going back.
2023-07-01,5,Group trip,Fantastic house on a beautiful lake for a great price!
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This is the perfect lake getaway for a small family or couple. The house is comfortable and well stocked. Our dog loved the big back yard and tennis balls, and my kid declared it the ""best house ever,"" even before he tried the water slide! The dock is peaceful and we enjoyed swimming and canoeing. The hosts were very responsive. We also enjoyed some mini golf, the Canal Museum (a real gem), trail biking, and Fairwood lanes and arcade. There's plenty to do between the lake itself and nearby attractions. We'll be back for sure!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Loved our time at the lake! The dock was perfect, and the slide was a fun surprise. We also really enjoyed being able to use the kayaks. The communication was great. The house was clean. We also appreciated the fact that we could bring our dog."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Had an amazing weekend! The place was beautiful and it was so relaxing very much worth the price and the hosts were absolutely terrific will definitely be staying again!
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We had an amazing time! The views were beautiful. Awesome outside space layout and decks. Layout was a good fit for our needs. Lots of dvds to choose from. Beds super comfortable. Lots of steps down to water, but we are in better shape now after our time there 😊. Just have to make sure you take everything you want to have at the water down with you when you go, because you don’t want to go back and forth from the house a lot of times. You will be worn out!
Kayaks were super fun and our kids loved the slide! Definitely want to stay here again!"
2023-06-01,4,Stayed with kids,it was a nice home but very small doesn’t match details in the picture
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,Amazing!! The kids loved the water slide. Beds were so comfortable. Host were so helpful through every step of the way. Will definitely book again🥰
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,A very quaint location. I felt right at home and everything exceeded expectations. would 10/10 stay again.

2023-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Beautiful place by the lake.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,This is a well-appointed vacation home in a gorgeous location in the woods on a lake! Description is completely accurate and the hosts have provided everything you need and more - this is their home. Everything was easy and smooth. We spent most of our time enjoying the multi-level deck. Great place for a family. Just wish we could have stayed longer!
2023-05-01,4,Stayed with a pet,"Great house for a couple or small family! Lots of lake activities, overall the house was clean."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,A super fun home
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Our family of four (including two kiddos plus our dog) had a wonderful experience at the Weekend Hooker. The house is situated in a perfect location to get away and enjoy nature. We were grateful for how clean and accessible the house was upon our arrival. There is plenty to do at the house, including fishing off the dock, kayaking, spending time on the large deck soaking in the view, grilling, fire pit, etc. Inside, they have many board games, dvds, comfortable beds, and efficient air condition units. We were all a little sad to leave. This was a trip to remember and we are already thinking about when we can visit next! Thank you to the hosts for always responding promptly to our questions. They made sure every need was met."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Wonderful little place in the woods with a great view! It was really quiet as the neighbors didn't appear to be around - so we really didn't see anyone else while we were there. The hosts have just about everything you need to enjoy your time at the house and on the water. And our big dog always felt welcome.
2023-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,We had a very relaxing weekend. The dogs had a blast down by the water. Sunsets are beautiful here.
2023-02-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Peaceful! Exactly what we were working for.
2023-02-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Great communication and super friendly. Beautiful view onto the water too!
2022-12-01,4,Stayed with kids,Beautiful sunsets over the lake.
2022-11-01,4,Stayed with kids,We thoroughly enjoyed our stay. Was a great place to go and decompress. We will probably come again!
2022-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Stayed here for a weekend during the Fall season, and the view of the lake is nice. I would stay here again."
2022-10-01,5,Stayed with a pet,The house was amazing! It was secluded and had amazing views! Everything we needed was there and the hosts were great with communication
2022-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"One the best air B&B's we've stayed in! The house itself was cozy and clean and well stocked with snacks,toys,towels,etc! The hosts were extremely responsive and answered all questions!"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The place was fantastic. Zero complaints. Incredible view. Worth the price of admission for the view of the sunset alone. The owners were really easy to get a hold of if we needed anything. Besides the acorns falling, the place was very quiet haha."
2022-09-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We had an awesome time on the Lake in a beautiful home! Easy access to the water, plenty of accommodations, and super dog friendly and convenient. The dock and water toys were really nice - kayaks, canoes, fishing rods, floats, etc. The grill and entertaining space on the decks were perfect. Jeremy and Samantha were amazing hosts and thought of everything!"
2022-09-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Amazing! Gorgeous views, very responsive host, and being able to kayak was incredible!"
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We really enjoyed our stay. Your home was comfortable and just what we needed. Communication was great. Thank you so much!
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a great stay! It was, by far, our favorite Airbnb rental so far. You’ll have everything you need and more while staying at this quiet lake house with a view. The home is clean and is decorated with a nice lake/outdoorsy theme. Amenities above and beyond are provided - we really loved all the decking, grill, washer and dryer (lol), kayaks, extra bedding, and stocked kitchen. The location is secluded, peaceful, and has a fantastic lake view. We saw (and heard) a huge variety of birds - an osprey even hung out on the swing bench. FYI: to get to the dock there is a dirt/gravel path and then wooden stairs. The dock area can get very sunny, so be prepared (hats, sunblock). There is a Food Lion grocery store about 12 minutes away for any necessities. If you’re deciding on whether or not to stay here - do it! You won’t regret it (you’ll love it!)."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We GREATLY enjoyed our stay at the Weekend Hooker! Sam and Jeremy’s lake home was both clean and simple. We didn’t need to look for things, had everything we needed, and nothing that we didn’t need. No clutter was very relaxing!
We loved that the beds were made up and ready for us, the bathrooms were well stocked with clean towels; washcloths, and toilet paper, and we enjoyed full access to the deck, grill, and dock.
Sam and Jeremy answered every message and question very quickly, thoroughly, and with excitement. Their guide within the Airbnb app gave great information about the local region as well.
We see why Sam and Jeremy are super hosts! We truly had a very relaxing and comfortable week enjoying swimming in the lake, fishing from the dock and from our boat which we were able to keep on their dock, relaxing in the swing, grilling on the deck, and playing cards. While there was a TV and DVD available we didn’t even need to turn it on. What a great first Airbnb experience for us . We highly recommend Weekend Hooker and plan on returning!"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We love it our experience. Location and the view are amazing. House is spacious and they have everything we could possibly need. If you love being close to water (kayak, fishing, etc) this is the place to stay. Very dog friendly, our pups loved it! Only comment loft does not have curtains. Would be a nice to add for privacy."
2022-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,My children and I had a great time. the kids had The most fun swimming and boating. The house had everything we needed. The decks were a perfect area to grill out with friends and family.
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Wonderful place to stay! Highly recommend!
2022-05-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Beautiful beautiful and private. Perfect for a small family or couple and very dog friendly. The hosts were super helpful and communicative and we had a great time
2022-05-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Lovely little lake house with great access to the water, a beautiful yard set up and a quiet relaxing vibe. We plan to come back and stay again sometime soon."
2022-05-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Our family had such a wonderful time at this lake house! We celebrated Mother's Day being a family and making fond memories here. We kayaked, swam in the lake, fishing, played board games and enjoyed cool nights alongside the fire. The host was very welcoming and made our stay so comfortable. We will definitely be back!"
2022-05-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We enjoyed the stay at The Weekend Hooker very much. My family is six (and our dog) came here to celebrate my mother's 81st birthday.
The fire pit, decks and grill were such a pleasure for us! The overhanging trees made us feel quite secluded. The little touches of having dog treats, human treats and games was great. The indoor gas fireplace was more than ample heat and lovely to look at. While chatting by the fire, we played a game of ""how many ducks are in this room"" based on the decor (spoiler alert, it's 87).
A couple of things to note, as is clear in the description and photos: the bedroom is an upper loft with two queen beds and a circular staircase to the first floor (mom happily slept on the couch). The walk to the water is a lovely 200 steps. We knew mom wouldn't be able to do it, but the rest of us were fine (and more fit when we left than when we arrived, haha).
It was a great trip, we had the best communication with the host that we've ever had with Airbnb. looking forward to returning!"
2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place is amazing! We literally had everything we needed while we were there! The hosts are so gracious and attentive and were available to us all weekend with friendly responses to all of our questions! The house had SO many amenities! From toys, movies, and board games for the kids to a fully stocked kitchen and a usable laundry room for this mama and a wonderful outside grilling space for my husband! The home was in impeccable condition and everything was very clean and well decorated. We love to fish so we were so delighted to only have to buy a little bait as everything else we needed was provided for us! When they say dog friendly they mean it! My pup was greeted with treats, toys, food/water bowls and her very own linens so she could still enjoy couch cuddles with the kids! I could write a book on this place but instead I encourage you to visit and see this special you place for yourself! We’ve found our “place” for sure and we will definitely be back!!! ❤️❤️❤️"
2022-04-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Great place for kids to explore, paddle on the lake and sit on the wonderful decks."
2022-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Loved everything! Best place we’ve stayed through AidBnB by far!
2022-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Great place! Easy check in! They had great communication for every question I had. Lol. The view is gorgeous. The walk to the dock is kinda steep so be careful. The dog things were a wonderful touch. Loved the porch and all the seating. Great time! Wonderful place!
2022-03-01,3,Stayed a few nights,Great access to lake and clean place.
2022-02-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Such a great relaxing stay. Had everything you needed and communication was a1!DoorDash worked there, couple things available during the day (the area itself shuts down early). No blinds/curtains on windows so not as much privacy as some may want, blinds only in bathroom but … there’s only one neighbor so unless there’s an issue … you shouldn’t really Cross paths or have anyone outside your windows/doors. Don’t forget your house slippers, carpet only upstairs where you’ll sleep. The fire-pit outside is excellent, you may have to buy wood at a local store. Can’t forget the dog amenities, that was truly appreciated! (Dog bowls, toys, snacks, towels, blankets). My dog Xena had a ball. These types of stays are definitely more enjoyable for us during the summer so we plan on returning, maybe with a few friends. So worth the trip! And very thankful for the price. It’s somewhere I can see us going to at least yearly, it’s added to my air BNB finds/gems. The view alone won us!
Thank you
- Jeremy ‘Navy Vet’ ; Melissa ‘Army Vet’ & Xena ‘the warrior Princess’"
2022-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great place to spend some time , they were very friendly , place was a nice fresh breath of air"

2022-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Love this house! Beautiful location right on the lake. So peaceful and wonderful hosts!
2022-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place on the lake with wonderful views from the house as well as the dock. Hosts extremely communicative and helpful with directions and recommendations. Great stay!
2021-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We had a wonderful stay. All the little touches were great!! We highly recommend this house Samantha was very attentive. The view is amazing Thanks so much for sharing your home.
2021-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Highly recommended! We stayed in December so it was chilly out but the house is very cozy and warm. The neighborhood is very quiet. There is a house next door but privacy is not compromised at all, even without foliage on the trees. The water pressure and water temperature are both superb. The owners are very responsive to questions but respectful of space—top notch hosts!! This is easily one of the better AirBnB’s we’ve stayed in and would recommend it to anyone."
2021-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,Very cool lakeside house nice and private with beautiful vews
2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Had an amazing stay over Thanksgiving! The location is great and easy to get to, with only one other house in view - very peaceful!"
2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This house is fantastic. The sunset over the lake is amazing. The walk back from the dock is a bit steep, but well worth it! The house is private, clean and spacious with comfortable beds. We didnt use the kitchen for cooking but it seemed to be well stocked with supplies. The coffee and oatmeal was a nice touch. Would stay here again!"
2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Best Airbnb we’ve experienced so far. Fully stocked movies & games. Amazing communication. Insane views. HUGE dock. WIFI. Dog friendly. Can’t recommend this enough. I only hope to be back! FIVE STARS!
2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful lake location for a relaxing vacation!
2021-10-01,5,Group trip,"It’s was absolutely amazing and beautiful, just being able to be with friends and family was a god send,the view was spectacular and didn’t get bored at all, so thank you for the opportunity to get away and have a stress free vacation"
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place is a gem! Adorable, cozy home and amazing location! Not far from 95 but incredibly peaceful and serene! Beautiful, clean, spacious home with gorgeous views! The owners were very sweet and the entire home is so accommodating, everything you need for a memorable getaway! Humans and dogs both agree BEST WEEKEND ever!"
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We rented this home for a guys hunting trip. It is a great little lake house! We loved the view & location. Really enjoyed grilling out & using the decks. Owners have provided lots of extras! Lake toys, dog blankets and toys, games etc.. Samantha was an excellent communicator & went out of her way to accommodate our needs. The beds upstairs are comfortable. It worked for our guys & would work for families but the open concept may not work for couples. We hope to rent this home again in hunting season or definitely in the summer!"
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"amazing amazing home, super friendly and answer any and all questions super fast. amazing views and great weekend gettaway, will definitely be back!"
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This home and location has everything you need for a relaxing and memorable getaway. Literally everything we needed and wanted was right there, so we never even left the property during our 4 night stay except for walks along the road with our pooch. Based on the beautiful pictures online, we had packed food in case we decided to eat in, and Samantha and Jeremy had breakfast snacks and plenty of coffee - the one thing I had forgotten. Communication was fast and pleasant from booking to checking out, and they have created a wonderful getaway, even providing everything the dog needed too. They are SUPERHOSTS in every sense of the word, and we are so happy to have found their place. The mattresses were comfortable and shower had good pressure - 2 very nice details you don't always get or expect. The views from the decks and the dock were so serene and peaceful, we spent most of our time outside soaking it all in. One of the most enjoyable and restorative vacations we've had in a long time!"
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Our stay at this house could not have been any better. The hosts were on top of everything from the beginning, and were always easy to reach. They provided detailed info about the house and our stay, but answered any questions we had quickly. The house itself was super cute, and had more than enough space for our party of 4 (plus 2 doggies). We had great weather, so we spent way more time on the home's 2 story deck, than actually in the home, but that's just another plus! The loft has a deck off of it that made sleeping with the door open (screen door shut!), so much more comfortable given the breeze. The view from both of the decks was beautiful and the space was very private. Waterfront, with a huge dock that we were able to spread out on. There honestly isn't anything negative to say about this home, and we'd definitely return!"
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Had a fantastic few days together on our “babymoon” before the arrival of our first daughter! The dogs enjoyed the lake so much and it was so quiet. We didn’t see another human while on the property—only the forest critters like birds, fish, frogs, a snake, and a praying mantis bid us goodbye as we were packing up. Really needed a good reset in nature and this is perfect for nature lovers.
Hosts Jeremy/Samantha were so sweet and generous with their amenities for us and the doggies and even some gifts for baby Liana when she arrives to the world. There was plenty of space indoors and outdoors for us and our 3 pups and we enjoyed our time from eating breakfast on the deck as the sun rose, splashing in the lake, trying our luck at fishing, playing board games, playing horseshoes outside, watching/streaming movies on the tv (we brought a laptop and hdmi cord and the hotspot wifi was plenty strong to watch!), and exploring the great outdoors. You can’t go wrong with this place if you love nature with some comforts of back home!"
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Cant say enough about this place! The hosts were awesome and made sure we had what we needed and the place was a little slice of Heaven by the lake.
2021-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Peaceful, clean, and comfortable. The lake is beautiful. We enjoyed having the kayaks available to explore the lake. Dog and family friendly. Great communication from the host!"
2021-09-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Great house with a beautiful view of Roanoke Rapids Lake. Owners are very responsive and provided great information. Very dog friendly!
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Fantastic views! Great house! Jeremy and Samantha were excellent hosts!
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had great weekend at weekend hooker. The host were very responsive. The house was cute, clean and welcoming. Loved the rustic decor. Our kids and dog had a wonderful time at lake playing in the water and kayaking in the boats!
Our favorite spot was the swing looking out towards lake - enjoyed having tea there :-).
We will back again!!!"
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We loved staying here! The location is quiet and private. Our dogs had so much fun running around, swimming, and lounging on the dock and decks! We enjoyed using their kayaks (bring your own life jackets), swimming, running on the nearby Roanoke Rapids Trail, grilling, and relaxing! There is a huge amount of deck space and a wonderful outdoor shower! We really appreciated the easy, fast communication and the fact that the place is very dog-friendly!"
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,10/10 would stay again. Perfect for a weekend getaway
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Place is great, very clean and dog friendly. They even had tennis balls for the pup. Really quiet place on the water, very relaxing."
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Expect a peaceful vacation
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Looking for an incredible place to stay by the lake. Well, look no further. This hidden gem has everything you need for the perfect lake vacation-lake front, kayaks, canoe, swimming, fishing, firepit, horse shoes, swing, and more. The place is amazing!"
2021-07-01,5,Group trip,"This was our 1st time using an AIRBNB, and all I can say is I hope that all other host and facilities are as nice as these. We have a family of 5 and we all fit comfortably into the cabin/house. The Weekend Hooker offers a great view of the lake, with a great dock for your boat, a huge deck, fire pit, horse shoe pit and many other amenities. All you need to bring other than clothing and personal items is food. Everything else is provided. There is over 150 DVD's for you to utilize if you are into staying indoors. I rated them 5 stars because that is the highest rating I could give. I will stay at the Weekend Hooker again, and yes i would recommend this place to friends and family!!!!!!!"
2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great house with a beautiful location along with a great host.
2021-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Other travelers can expect a very clean home, with specific instructions for each area (dock, fire pit, kayaking, use of grill…. to name just a few) A serene, calming, and peaceful setting created a wonderful ambiance to spend our 44th anniversary and Father’s Day with each other and family. We enjoyed peace and quiet, with occasional sound(s) of motorboat(s), ours included. The strategically placed sitting areas enhanced our view of the lake."
2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great spot!!!!
Tranquil and beautiful!!!!!"
2021-05-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"A quaint house on the lakefront. A beautiful view to wake up to and lovely to stargaze in the evenings. The house has everything you need for a beach weekend getaway. Access to the kayaks and canoes was a great bonus of this house! The only downfall was no enclosed bedrooms - both full beds are in a shared lofted space, but we utilized the pullout couch downstairs to have some separation. Would definitely stay again!"
2021-05-01,4,Stayed over a week,"This home has a great view. The house was very clean. The decks were very peaceful. We spent most of our time outdoors while at the house. The kitchen had the necessities for cooking, nothing fancy but what I needed was there. It was nice having a clean nice gas grill to use.
If you have difficulty with stairs and or uneven ground this is not the place for you. If you love the outdoors, birds singing, and a peaceful environment, access to the water, and very few people this is definitely your place."
2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My fiancee and I had a wonderful time at Jeremy and Samantha's place. The house has an enormous two-level deck, a great dock, and beautiful views of the lake. We took full advantage of the supplied canoe and fire pit, and our pup loved swimming in the lake. It was peaceful, remote, perfect."
2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This is a great place to stay for a quiet getaway.
2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The location here is simply beautiful. The walk up from the lake frontage is a bit rigorous, but good exercise. The frontage has a cute little sandy beach and a wonderful view. While I was there (early May) it was very private and quiet. The deck on the house is lovely and had a wonderful breeze, and perfect quiet view. The house interior is “lake rustic”; was clean. While I am not a “rustic” person I would stay there again happily; the setting was very peaceful and beautiful. I brought three dogs and the location was wonderful for them. The value for me was just perfect."
2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Bunk style sleeping arrangements made life simple to get the herd motivated. Adequate kitchen and great outdoor cooking facilities. This place has simply awesome views and nature. We will comeback.
2021-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My two cousins, dog, and I spent a wonderful four days at this lake house. The views from the wrap-around deck were spectacular; the walk down the stairs to the dock was long but peaceful, and access to kayaks were a great bonus. The house was clean, the beds were comfy, the kitchen was stocked with all the essentials for cooking, the DVD collection was diverse and watching movies were a perfect ending to our nights. I would recommend and would love to come back."
2021-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great getaway spot, Private and really cute. We spent our days hanging on the dock, me fishing and my girlfriend sunbathing. We sat out on the back deck in the evening grilling and then with a fire pit.
Jeremy and Sam were very gracious and responsive to any question we had.
Awesome time."
2021-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"By far the beat Air Bnb experience I’ve ever had. Extremely friendly and hospitable owners, they were easily reached and kept in constant communication with us. This house literally has everything you need, kayaks, got em, canoes, got em, fishing poles, got em, grill, horseshoes,dock access, got em. This place is extremely fun and relaxing and has everything in place for you to have a good time. We look forward to coming back very soon."
2021-04-01,5,Stayed one night,Jeremy & Samantha are excellent host. We only stayed one night but will definitely be back. Their backyard view is amazing.
2021-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"As soon as you turn off the paved road onto the road leading to the house, you know you are headed to a sportsman's retreat- from the stunning views (including starry nights on cloudless nights) and access to fishing to the duck themed living room, deer skulls in the loft and NRA koozies. This place is just as the pictures describe-- a beautiful lake view from a fabulous series of decks offering a great outdoor space, including a fire pit and hike down to the dock. Your hosts are super attentive and want you to enjoy your stay- there are lots of good recommendations of things to do and see. We hiked in Medoc Mountain State Park and the Roanoke Rapids Trail, in addition to driving to historic Halifax and venturing out onto the lake in the canoe and kayaks."
2021-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The place is really great for a short getaway. It’s very quiet and has beauty views. My son caught some catfishes there, he really enjoyed the trip. Also, Samantha responded very quickly when we had a question. I would recommend this place for anyone who wants to get away for the noisy world and enjoy some quiet family time."
2021-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,It was a beautiful adventure! The house has Amazing veiws and lovely touches everywhere throughout the house! The walk to the lake was a bit more than expected just a heads up the stairs were a real hike!
2021-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Great cabin, we loved everything about it. We would definitely recommend to our family and friends."
2021-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The house was very clean and comfortable. ""Fun on the lake"" is a perfect caption for this getaway, as everything you need to have a good time is provided for you. Our trip was just a two person retreat, but it would be a nice place for a small family. I would love to come back again when the weather is a bit warmer to really enjoy the outdoor space more."
2021-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"THIS PLACE WAS AWESOME. I went there with my partner and 3 pups for a relaxing weekend away and it was exactly what I wanted. First of all Samantha was so fast at responding ( i mean literally within minutes I would get a message back) but that was just the icing on top of a great place. The place is really private. There is one neighbor but never even knew they were there. They made the place SO cozy. A super comfortable living room with a nice fire place and an awesome view. The loft was so cozy too, but the main feature of the house was a multilayer deck in the back of the house that would be perfect for the summer. There was comfortable patio furniture on each level, which would have been great for entertaining. there was horseshoes set up outside a nice relaxing swing that looked over the lake . There was also full access to the lake just steps away.
The best part for me was it was dog friendly. the pups had a great time and they even provided blankets, bowls, and toys.
I cant wait to stay there again.
Chris"
2021-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"A beautiful spot high on the hill over the lake. This place feels designed for summer group outings where you are wet from the lake or from running around the lawn at all times until you crash inside. We were there in late February, so we just had to grab a jacket to get outside, but it was still a nice place to be near to nature while also being comfortable."
2021-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,The location and property is amazing. The layout of the home is what we were looking for in a lake retreat. We really enjoyed time with the fireplace going and relaxing with the family.. Our family will be back to visit. The Linton Family thanks you for the experience we had on our mini winter get away.
2021-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My husband and I really enjoyed this house! It was a great getaway. We enjoyed some much needed down time. Unfortunately the weather was not the best, so we weren’t able to enjoy the outdoor space due to the rain and sleet. But this is definitely a place we plan to come back to when its a little warmer!"
2021-01-01,5,Group trip,"Sam and Jeremy were wonderful hosts!! We went here for my boyfriend’s birthday and had a great time. They were so thoughtful and had birthday balloons and snacks awaiting us. They were very realistic and accommodating with the dogs as well, and even left them dentastix as a little gift!!"
2020-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We loved the place. Thank you Jeremy and Sam for sharing your place. The house is exactly like the pictures. We spent Christmas at the lake house, we were there for 5 days, even though it was cold we still had a great time, it’s a very quiet and peaceful place. Beautiful lake view from the decks outside, I would definitely go back on summer time."
2024-06-01,4,Stayed with kids,Me and My family enjoyed our selves they was very helpful and quick to respond when we had issue I would recommend

2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Great family trip to the lake, home was extremely clean. Great time fishing, kayaking and relaxing. Host was very responsive and helpful. Kitchen had nice dishes, cookware, etc. More then enough towels and the hand soap in every bathroom was a great touch as well as providing laundry detergent. All the extra touches the host added in we’re a very nice surprise and appreciated."
2023-08-01,5,Group trip,Very nice place to stay.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Beautiful, well kept home that was perfect for our family trip!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"Our stay at this lake-side home was nothing short of magical. The feeling you get when you walk in is indescribable. It smells good, the lighting is warm & welcoming. It’s easy to imagine what kind of amazing memories will be made in your future vacation days. The home feels as though it belongs to you. Nothing beats the lakeside view from the top balcony. You can take a dip in the beautiful & warm water or even catch yourself something nice for dinner. We loved our stay and guarantee you will too!"
2023-07-01,5,Group trip,"5*! An incredibly fun lake house. Our kids absolutely loved the lake, and we loved watching them from the dock and the house decks. Fishing rods, a kayak and blow up floats were available . Too hot for a fire while we were there, but the fire pit is nicely situated and would be fun in the fall, winter or spring. The open floor plan of the kitchen, the dining room and the living room made family time both easy and nice. Some excellent bbq places 15 minutes away."
2023-07-01,5,Group trip,We had a great time here. The house had everything we needed and location can’t be beat
2023-06-01,5,Group trip,Great Lake House!!! Rooms and communal areas were very clean and tidy. The host is friendly and communicative. Easy lake access and the dock is perfect to bring a boat. Would definitely recommend this spot! Plan to return in the future :)
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This house was beautiful! We really enjoyed our time away. The house was secluded, quite, but close enough to the “real world”. We ate at Haggertys after it was suggested by Hayley and it did not disappoint!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"The lake house was the BEST week getaway for us. The host had thought of everything and the house is in an incredible location with great views and a variety of fun things to do for any age! We loved how it was tucked away from the main part of the lake, but easy to access. The house and yard are very well kept, and everything was true to the pictures. We will definitely be coming back and bringing our friends next time! We also appreciated the easy access to the home. Thank y’all so much for being prompt to respond to questions and for an amazing week. :)"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"Wow, we loved this place! Such a fantastic time; we’ll be back for sure! The location surprised us, and we loved how Hayley made this apartment her own. Highly recommend this to anyone looking for a comfortable stay. My favorite part about our experience was being right on the lake and taking out the kayaks they had for us."
2023-05-01,5,Group trip,Haley was extremely responsive when we asked for instructions. The place was extremely clean and there was enough space
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,The lake house in comfortable and well taken care of. The view of the lake doesn't get any better. Hayley's instructions and recommendations made everything easy and accessible. We may have to make this lake trip an annual thing!
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Loved this little get away. Wanted a trip out of town (we live a few hours away) and was able to get up there, and spend a quiet weekend, while it seems like on maps you’re close to a lot of other people, it didn’t really feel that way because oh where the house sits. A beautiful bridge is within sight you
Can go under and access the main lake.
Took paddle boards out myself and enjoyed the calm of their secluded arm of the lake, but if you were motorized, you’re still *very close* to the main lake.
Definitely not walkable to a store or anything like that, but didn’t expect it, they left us a cute note to welcome us and were very responsive. We had a couple friends with us and enjoyed using the fire pit out back as well before sunset. Didn’t even see that many people on the lake, but there are some barking dogs on the other side of the lake.
Kitchen was clean, was able to make our small dinner. Steps were a little steep on the stairs but otherwise no complaints."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,A cute little cottage that was tucked in a beautiful cove. It had the most amazing view of an old railroad trestle. Very peaceful. We loved waking up and looking out at the lake. We especially enjoyed using the kayaks and paddle board for being on the water. If you just want to get away to find peace and tranquillity this is a great place to visit. Our host was very responsive in communication and needs. Highly recommend and would go again.
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Nicely appointed, very clean, and peaceful with a responsive host. Highly recommend for those looking for a restful place to stay off of I 95."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Another great stay in Halifax. Thanks for the perfect place for our family to stay as we continue our journey north for the summer. This is a wonderful cottage close to 95 that has everything we need and the Glenn is always very responsive and helpful.
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"What a peaceful, wonderful, and cozy place. As soon as we walked in, we felt so welcomed. Seeing the antique items makes you take a step back in time. There are several nice restaurants within walking distance and a historic site.
Glenn was very responsive and communicated with us before and during our stay.
What a peaceful place and area. I think I heard no more than 10 cars pass by the entire weekend. We will definitely book again."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Fantastic spot to stop for the night on our move from Maryland to South Carolina. Very peaceful quaint cottage. Great details, decor, comfort.

2024-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"My second stay here and I'm sure I'll be back! Halifax is charming and rich with history. The Sylvan Bird Park is a must as are the historic buildings and placards in town. Glenn is a fabulous host and her cottage is beautiful l, clean, and comfortable."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My mom was raised in nearby Roanoke Rapids & has fond memories of Halifax. I was visiting town to take my parents to their Dr appts. & travel to Gasburg to see her sister. They both were very comfortable in Glenn's cottage. The property is beautiful, the house smells old (in a nostalgically good way) like it used to staying at my Grandma's house, & the mattresses were SOO soft & supportive! We also ate a late lunch at Two Doors Down (which is less than a 3 min walk) where we were promptly greeted my every local we passed.
Thank you for making our brief visit to town so remarkable!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"A wonderful cottage that was comfortable and peaceful for us and our pups. The owner was so helpful with directions, instructions and local restaurants. A great place to stay!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Glenn is a wonderful host!
2024-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We enjoyed our stay at Glenn's home. Glenn's decorating talents really are on display. Nice comfortable beds and the rain on the tin roof sounds wonderful.
2024-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Enjoyed the stay and Glenn was great to work with. She offered solutions for our parking requirements but would advise that parking multiple vehicles at this location is very difficult. Nice little cottage if you are passing through town.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Great place to stop on way from FL heading north. Didn’t get to stay long enough to explore much, but hope to be back! Lovely place to stay and super clean. Coffee was delicious too!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,Another perfect stay in this cute cottage. Very comfortable and spotlessly clean . Love the historical nature of Halifax. Peaceful area yet convenient to 95. Great communication with Glenn in regard to the booking.

2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"Staying at Glenn’s place was an absolute delight! The house was stylish, immaculately clean, and had all the amenities we needed. The location was just wanted a needed for an easier commute to training the next day, Communication with Glenn was seamless, she was super responsive and helpful throughout the stay.

2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We loved our 3-day stay. The Cottage is a perfect location for exploring Halifax and its history. I had no idea how important this area was for both NC and US history! We will definitely be back!
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,Great communication
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Glenn’s home was a great place to stay for the night to break up our trip from FL to NJ with our pup. So much better than the hotel options. The home is a few minutes walk to the main street, where we found the Trophy Room bar where we were able to unwind a bit and have a drink or two with some of the very friendly locals. Glenn was very responsive and her home was clean and comfortable."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"Perfect place for us to stay when we are in the area hunting or fishing.
Would be a perfect place for a group fishing with a guide on the Roanoke in Weldon.
The only draw back I see was there is limited parking ( I did not see a area to park a boat) ..
Glenn was great to work with and I can't wait to go back and try their restaurant."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"GREAT place, great stay! thus little home was perfectly appointed, clean, and smelled great! Sometimes these charming old houses smell musty, but this place was perfect! we felt right at home, slept comfortably, and enjoyed the beautiful place while we unwound from driving. Glen was super helpful with directions and suggestions for places to eat. I'd definitely stay here again!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Our regular stopping place on the way south and north. We love the historic area, great place to relax after a days drive."

2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Great for an overnight stay not far off of route 95.
Thank you!!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Glenn's place represents the historic area it is located in.
Regrettably, we were unable to peruse the area due to time constraints. We did pass some of the highlighted places on the way in. Our later check-in prevented our meeting Glenn in person, which was a disappointment as he appears to be very enthusiastic of the area amd community.
The cottage reflects the atmosphere of the locale. We are hoping to be able to visit again and take time for exploration."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Stayedhere just one night on our way back from Florida. Great choice. Wish it wasn't a Sunday evening so we could have tried the local restaurants which are closed on Sunday.
2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"Lovely, peaceful, and sizable cottage in a great town. Walkable to terrific shops and so many cool historic sites. Host (Glenn) was wonderful - responsive, gave great recommendations, and clear instructions."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Halifax is a beautiful town, the people are welcoming and friendly. we look forward to visiting again."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This quaint cottage in historical Halifax is a treasure. We arrived in a cold spell and found the place pleasantly warm and cozy. Loved the location, quiet, peaceful, clean. The big back yard was a plus for our pup to get a little exercise; and he enjoyed seeing the many deer back there in the morning. Our bed was wonderful. Overall we thoroughly enjoyed the original features of this place that have been well preserved by Glenn. Felt like living in a piece of history and we love that. The modern touches ( the microwave and coffee pot made a great breakfast) were nice, too. The second bedroom would be super for a family with kids. And a walk or drive around nearby town is fantastic. So much packed into this little place. We will be returning."
2024-03-01,4,Stayed one night,"We enjoyed our stay, not far off our major highway!!"
2024-03-01,4,Stayed one night,This place was handy for a quick stop on our way home.

2024-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Great stay with charm. Exactly as described, clean, comfortable, and pride in historic details. Bed and linens were comfy too. Walkable small town steeped in historic buildings and info plaques. The 5 miles off 95 is well worth it."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,Enjoyed the short stay at Glenn’s place
2024-02-01,5,Stayed with a pet,We had another great stay at Glenn’s place!! We’ve stopped here before on our way from NY to GA and returned again this year. Glenn is thoughtful in how the house is set up and makes it very comfortable for the guests! It is always very clean. There is also a large back yard for the pups to run around in. We initially picked it because it was an easy off/on to I-95. The town has a lot of history and a great restaurant the Hen and the Hog. We will be back again next year!
2024-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"The cottage was great. It was super clean, and the twin beds with their foam mattresses were very comfortable. Kitchen had everything we needed, but we missed a stove. We microwaved our eggs for breakfast. Super quiet location and close to I 95. Host was very responsive."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"My husband and I were just able to get away for one night. (It’s hard to do when you have 3 kids!) Glenn’s place is beautiful and exactly as described. Quaint . Very clean. It offered us peace, quiet, and a beautiful little town to walk through! We enjoyed our stay and LOVED the complimentary coffee from The Hen and The Hog. (Can we order this online somewhere?!?!) Next time, we want to try the restaurant out, too! Thank you for being such a gracious host!"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed with a pet,My husband and I stopped in Halifax as it was a half way point on our travel home. The cottage was adorable and very clean. Glenn recommended a cafe down the road which was perfect in every way. We will definitely book again!

2024-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Great little place. We only spent the night so we didn’t get the whole experience of the area, but the house was a cute little cottage.

2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Perfect house
2024-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,Don’t waste your money on one room in a hotel. That’s not the answer these days with such appealing options available. Families are in for a treat
2024-01-01,5,Stayed with a pet,This place is soooo cute and clean. You can really tell how much love they put into this place. My mom pup and I stayed just overnight breaking up the long drive home from Florida - but we were so impressed with the cottage and town that we’re planning to go back for a weekend! Thank you Glenn!
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,A fantastic find. We enjoyed staying here while visiting Halifax County. Quaint cottage with everything you may need for your stay. Walkable to downtown for dinner and lunch. Glenn was a great communicator. Hope to come back.

2023-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Such a unique and historically fun visit with an awesome host. We loved our overnight visit to Halifax and would highly recommend this quaint cottage.

2023-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,The cottage was exactly as described - pristine and comfortable. It is truly a great place to stay. Light sleepers should just be aware of the nearby train whistles.
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Beautiful rustic cottage in historic Halifax, NC. More spacious than what it appears to be from outside view. Well kept property."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed one night,Great getaway for a 3 generation trip. My third time staying here and I will return!
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,We stayed at this home on our way down the coast with our two large dogs. The house was not far off of I-95 and was easy to get to. It was spacious and clearly newly renovated. It had all of the amenities we needed. There is a lot of property in the back and we were able to walk our dogs on leash there and around the very small town of Halifax. Glenn was easy to communicate with and we had no problems. This was a great stay at a very reasonable price!
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Always a lovely stay!
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We love homes from others eras and this approximately 1920’s house filled the bill. It was obvious the care Glenn took to appoint the house with all that f the furniture and the various other objects . We loved spending the two nights there and trying the restaurant suggestion.
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,I needed something close to I95 to accommodate my drive from Florida to New York. This fit the bill. The place was clean and very cozy. The neighborhood was quiet which was important since I had to get up early for the second leg of the trip. Bed was very comfy. Will definitely stay again.
2023-12-01,5,Stayed one night,Great place to stay. We will be back there later.
2023-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"Glenn’s place is conveniently located. It is an older home with lots of character. If you are not expecting new construction, you will be just fine. The home is clean and in a quiet location. The queen bed is on the firmer side, but comfortable."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed one night,Such a lovely and quaint cottage. Just what we needed after a long day of travel. Would love to stay again!
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This was our 2nd overnight stay here. Lovely cottage, great location right off 95. Everything was clean and comfortable for our family of 4. Thank so much Glenn."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,We loved our stay in Halifax. We did not realize the history there and enjoyed getting to walk around and learn about the town. We enjoyed a few local restaurants. The house is beautifully decorated and comfortable. The kids played football in the backyard. We had to go to urgent care during our stay (unrelated to the football) and Glenn was super helpful getting us directed to the right place.
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Glenn’s place had a very old America/small town feel as advertised. The bedrooms were large, and the linens were fresh. If you’re a light sleeper, like me, the train may keep you up through the night as it seemed to blow the horn every hour. Glenn was a responsive host, and gave great recommendations."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,We were just passing thru driving from FL to NY. This was a perfect place for a quick over-night stay.
2023-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"a very nice stay if you want a peaceful getaway. if you love a firm matress you'll sleep very comfortably. The house was comfortable and peaceful, very clean. it was accross from a very old graveyard, walking distance from the restaurant, visitors center, and historic sites. would definitely stay here again.
Make sure to make reservations at the Hen and Hog if you want to do dinner there!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We stayed overnight at Glenn's place and it was lovely. We brought our two dogs and they enjoyed running around in the yard. The house is cute, we stayed warm, and it has everything we needed for one night."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Very cozy, comfortable cottage full of old character"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Glenn’s place was a perfect spot for us to stop for a nights rest from our drive down to Florida. The cottage and the large grassy back yard worked perfect for us and our fur babies. The place is located very easily off of 95 and in a quaint historic little town with a great farm to table restaurant which was walking distance. Would definitely stay here again.
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"My family and I love Glenn's house. it is so much superior to any hotels. The house is immaculately clean, preserving the style of the old South, while spacious and comfortable and dog friendly! It was our second stay in the house, and hopefully, not the last one"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed one night,Third stay here on way to or from SC to the Northeast. Love this house and town. So much better than a hotel. Totally comfortable and the cutest most welcoming town. Highly recommend!
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,I really enjoyed my stay! It's such a beautiful (and much more spacious than I thought) cottage.

2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"I’ve stayed here now several times over the past year, and it was a wonderful stay as always. Glenn is a gracious host, and always very responsive and helpful. One of my all-time favorite Airbnb properties and hosts."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We were just in for the night as a halfway point on a longer trip, but this more than met our needs. Not only was Glenn very proactive and responsive, the house was adorable. I wish we could’ve stayed longer!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"I’ve stayed at many Airbnb’s and this was by far the cleanest. Adorable, cozy, comfortable cottage! Would stay again!"

2023-10-01,5,Stayed with a pet,I can’t say enough good things about this town and the Airbnb! Glenn has such a huge impact on this town and local businesses. The house was very cozy and extremely peaceful. This town is practically one Main Street with a couple of options for food/drinks and shopping. This historic town is beautiful and the locals are awesome. Thank you for allowing us to create priceless memories this weekend!
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very nice place.
2023-10-01,4,Stayed one night,"This is a very quaint cottage with neat decorations. Very easy to find and within walking distance to the little downtown area. If you are over 6 feet tall, you might have an issue with the footboard on the beds, and make sure you duck going into the bathroom. The only negative for me was the very, very weak water pressure for the shower. Other than that it was exactly as advertised."
2023-10-01,4,Stayed one night,Great for a short stay. Glenn was very thorough and helpful with directions and suggestions.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"We've stayed at this wonderful home before, and each visit leaves us with lasting memories. The familiar warmth of the space and the thoughtfulness of the host make it an absolute favorite.
The home is impeccably maintained, offering a perfect balance of cozy, rustic charm. , every corner exudes a welcoming and homey vibe."

Will definitely stay there again on our travels!!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Glenn's place is such a quaint cottage home feel! We felt at home instantly when we walked in the door. It was only an overnight stay before we continued on our road trip so I can't speak for much of the area. However, when we road through we kept mentioning how nice it was and historic it felt. Glenn is very communicative and kept us up to date on everything, even when a problem arose it was resolved immediately. We would love to stay for a longer period of time to explore the surrounding area and would recommend this place to everyone"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with a pet,This is our second time staying here and we love it. It’s a great spot for us as we travel down 95 to spend the night. Nice quiet town with nice restaurants. We will stay again in the future.

2023-09-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Glenn was an amazing host, and her cottage was super comfortable and convenient to get to off 95. we were driving back home to FL from NY and spent the night here with my 4 fur babies, and they also enjoyed the stay. comfortable bed, great clawtub, and for the first time, one of my pups that never eats when we stay at any other Air bnb actually felt comfortable to have his dinner when we arrived last night. Was shocked! he was really comfortable and the entire experience was great! thanks again! we will be back on our next trip to NY or back in the next few month :)
Glenn is the best!!!"

2023-09-01,4,Stayed with a pet,"Cute home! Stopped for the night on our 20 hour drive and didn’t get to check out the town. It is across the street from a cemetery! Spooky vibes were kind of fun. Would be 5 stars, but the bed isn’t super comfortable and we only stayed to get a good nights rest."

2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"Good stop for a long drive rest. Place is cute and quiet, beds are very comfortable.

2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"I adored my stay in this sweet town! Glenn’s place was perfectly located to pull off 95 and take a peaceful break on my travels. The cottage was precious with the luxuries of home, including travel toiletries and fresh linens. I stopped by the recommended restaurant Glenn mentioned and the food was fabulous and the people so sweet! I’ve already recommended Halifax and this Airbnb to my fellow travel friends and will continue to do so. You won’t regret staying here, thank you Glenn for being a great host and opening this space to travelers! :)"

2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Our family had a wonderful overnight at Glenn's place in Halifax on our way to the beach. The town was quiet at night, making it the perfect, peaceful stay...a great way to recharge before the second half of our trip. The Hen & The Hog restaurant was fantastic. The staff was so friendly, and they accommodated dietary restrictions well. Also, possibly the smoothest Old Fashioned and the tastiest flourless chocolate cake I've had! The cottage offered a charming step back in time, but updated with modern luxuries, like comfortable mattresses and locally-roasted ground coffee. The cleanliness and organization was particularly outstanding."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This is one of the most charming places we have stayed at ! A last minute find traveling up 95 , it was a treasure!! The neighborhood and town are historic and quaint ! Very safe vibes and off street parking! We slept so good ! It was very easy to find ! I’ve already recommended to a couple of friends that love places like this like we do. Hope to return in the fall !"

Rustic
Porch allowed two seats but no screens from bugs"
2023-07-01,4,Stayed with kids,The house was very historic and great place to stay for a night! We passed thru on our way to Myrtle Beach. Only thing I didn’t like was the town was almost too quiet for us. One small place to get food. Food was good tho. Again it was a lovely place to stay for a night and Glenn was extremely pleasant to talk to and she responded quickly!
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,We loved everything about our stay. Glenn is an awesome host and the cottage is one of the best places we have stayed.

As someone who loves interior design, Glenn’s space is so incredibly clean and charming.
Glenn left us some bottles of water in the fridge and some locally bagged coffee.
We loved the chance to stay and would definitely recommend to others. The town is walkable and pet friendly and it was the perfect pit stop on our road-trip north."

She's not been able to safely have a tub for ovwr 2 years since she broke her hip. The beds were very comfortable and havw the yard for the pups was perfect. If we ever have to travel that way again Everyone we encountered was so friendly and the neighbors were so nice"

2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Excellent stay at Glen’s house in historic Halifax. Was the perfect home base for the weekend fishing trip - within walking distance of the historic district and great restaurants/ hangouts and easy commute to the dock and distillery.

Glen was also the best host - proactive about instructions and recommendations for the local area and answered all questions very quickly. Will definitely be coming back!"

2023-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,Quaint little place in a quaint little town. Was the peaceful place my family of foot was looking for to break up our road trip!
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The trip was for hunting and the central location made the accommodations quickly available to fishing the Roanoke Lake and the game lands. The house had exactly what we needed for our stay. We did not spend much time in the house but for when we did, the beds were cozy, the shower refreshing and the kitchen had all the amenities we needed (microwave, utensils etc). We will definitely save Glenn’s place as a favorite for when we return again in the future! The only regret was not booking an extra day!"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"I was looking for a place to stop on the way to Charleston. I am so happy that I came across this cottage. It was easy to find and close to I95. The cottage was clean and so charming. The beds were very comfortable and loved sitting on the porch. An added bonus was that you could walk to a little downtown area with an amazing restaurant. If in the area again, we would definitely stay here. Glenn was a great host."

2023-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"Glenn is a perfect host. Super kind, informative and helpful. Thank you, Glenn!"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This is a gem of a house in a gem of an historic town. The Halifax Resolves, a precursor to the Declaration of Independence, were adopted here. There are lots of nicely restored historic buildings and some beauties just waiting to be taken on as a project. Glenn has created a very welcoming space with lots of nice touches, such as antiques, the table set for a meal, a new bag of coffee next to the coffee maker and a fresh sponge next to the sink. The backyard is very large and our dog loved it. The were thrilled the house still has the feel of a vintage property. It is all on one level and easy to access. The floors are a little uneven, as might be expected, but could be an issue for some. N.B. If I had read the listing more carefully, I might have realized there is no stove. There is a microwave and toaster oven, as well as a slow cooker. We were only there for one night, but we enjoyed a couple of walks around the town. Glenn is a very responsive host. We hope to be back one day."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"I found this was the perfect spot for a tired traveller going from Florida to Canada. Everything was as expected and it was a very comfortable stay. Glenn was excellent to deal with, very responsive and proactive. Unfortunately I did not have the opportunity to stay longer, the next time I will stay a couple of days to visit the area and enjoy the restaurant. I will certainly return."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed one night,The home is very cozy & quaint. Easy walk into town & the visitors center. You can do tours of historical sites which are within easy walking of the house. We loved the home & the accessibility into town!
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Excellent place to stay at and will definitely stay there again with my travels, the host was excellent with communication, loved it."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Perfect for an overnight stay on our i95 travels, much more comfortable than a hotel room for our family. Loved that our boys had a space to run around and play outback before getting back in the car for another long drive.
The house is adorable with so much character!"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"Beautiful cottage and surroundings. Conveniently located near 95. Communication with Glenn was perfect, very responsive. If in the area we would hope to stay with Glenn."

2022-12-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Very neat, clean and quiet. Jim is the best host and is easy to contact if you are in need of anything!"
2022-12-01,5,Stayed over a week,Great place to stay for work in the area. Clean and as described. Nothing fancy but everything works and is adequate. Whole-house cleaning is done every week and is done well. Wouldn't recommend going out late at night but that's what this area is like and it's absolutely fine most of the time. Host is very responsive to any issues and quick to address them. I was satisfied with what I got.
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Loved staying here felt like home away from home cant wait to book again
2022-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,Nice quiet neighborhood mintues away from local hospital where I had a short contract. Very clean and spacious house and any questions or concern I had my host Jim was able to respond to within minutes. I would re-book again if I'm ever in the area again.
2022-05-01,5,Stayed over a week,"Located close to the hospital, in a quiet residential area. Jim was quick to respond to my questions. He also scheduled the cleaning service around my work schedule, which was greatly appreciated."
2021-12-01,4,Stayed over a week,Not bad savings for family or friends.
2021-09-01,5,Stayed over a week,Place was kept up well in my opinion. Very fast to respond to requests and questions.
2021-08-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"This place is clean and accurate to the pictures. Jim is very friendly and answered messages promptly. The kitchen is great to make your own meals. I didn't bring salt and there wasn't any, so maybe that could be a nice thing to add for the future. It is not a big deal because there is a grocery store at walking distance. Overall we were very happy with the place."
2021-07-01,5,Stayed over a week,"Wonderful, house is just like the pictures. Cleaning comes in once a week, does a wonderful job. Quiet neighborhood, great host!"

2021-01-01,5,Stayed over a week,Jim was great and the house was perfect for what we needed it for. Also very affordable!
2020-08-01,2,Stayed a few nights,"*Communication is terrible*
Very little responses after you book. After that you're on your own.
Instructions on how to get in the house were not on air bnb and I had to ask..
Because i came from NY late i didn't have a tour or anything but that was not an issue at all. Its pretty much self-explanatory inside.
Cold water didn't work and wasn't fixed until days after I got there. Not a big deal but I had to buy bottled water to drink.
This place is nice. However, its in the middle of nowhere and meant for short stays given the location.
* I felt like I was living in the country ghetto.*
The red couch had multiple springs that were stabbing me.. they need to throw that thing out and get a new one.
** They have a mandatory cleaning service WEEKLY.** Someone comes in and cleans or whatever. I didn't get any response on the details and I asked if that was necessary and he said yes because he already paid her. I asked if she could come there when im off work since I only work 3 days a week. NO response... i don't want someone touching my personal belongings or washing my 300$ comforter that can't be machine washed..
I ended up leaving my reservation early due to work circumstances. So I still don't know what exactly the cleaner does when she cleans. I didnt get clear instructions on what she does. Trash removal? Vacuuming? I just don't know what else she would be doing. I think its unnecessary and uncomfortable when I can't lock my things up when she's there.
**In a nut shell.. this was the worst airbnb I've ever been to and worse communication by far. **"
2020-08-01,5,Stayed over a week,Great place to stay
2020-04-01,5,Stayed over a week,"Great place to stay, extremely friendly host and housekeeper, everything you need!"

2024-06-01,4,Stayed one night,"Great stay. I really could’ve used the washing machine, but it either wasn’t working or on standby. The washer had dirty towels sitting in it already as well.

2024-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,This little cottage was perfect. The dogs loved having a space that they could run around. We loved the outside sitting area with games and TV. I wish we could have stayed longer to enjoy it more. We will definitely save this for future trips.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This by far was my families favorite Airbnb stay! So sad it was only for one night. The home is absolutely perfect. Spacious, beautifully decorated, and super cozy. The kitchen is well stocked and the beds are comfortable. The backyard is amazing!!! If you want to enjoy star gazing at night this is your place! The area is so peaceful, we truly did not want to leave. We will 100% be staying again. Thank you David & Jessica for being such amazing hosts!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,Convenient location right off the highway and the perfect location to stop between our destinations. Cute decor and clean home.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,Great location if you want to get away from the city And the noise. The TV outdoors was a nice touch. Had a great time with friends.
2024-04-01,3,Stayed with a pet,"Good location just off 95. We stayed just 1 night on our way home from Florida.
Seems like a newer home and the decor is cute. I was disappointed to find several things dirty and apparently missed by the house cleaners."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,Absolutely a beautiful place inside and out! Very private and peaceful. Also the place was easy to get to and close to town. All in all a 5 star location indeed.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,We have stayed numerous times and each time was perfect for us. We have it on our list as #1 favorite.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Adorable and everything you need! Highly recommend!

2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,Great place in a perfect location. Nice and quiet even though it’s only a few miles off of 95. Wish I could have stayed longer.
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Wonderful stay. Quiet, private area and if you absolutely need to go somewhere stores and restaurants are just 13 minutes away. Would stay here again."

2024-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Very beautiful and secluded. Exactly what we wanted for a weekend getaway!
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,beautiful place. we enjoyed our stay.
2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"Look….remote location. Nothing is very close. So, if that’s what you are looking for then there it is. It’s not the mountains and the property doesn’t really have trails etc. And that drive to town is 20ish minutes. The decor is on POINT! Very impressed with the decor. Outside space is vast. However, there was no firewood (no biggie…we assumed there would be) and the string lights didn’t work (don’t know if owner is aware). Overall, I’d go back for a night or two. It’s quiet and the stars are amazing l!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Great spot to stop with a dog traveling down 95. It is very quiet spot and not far from 95 at all. Jessica and David are very responsive, available, and quick to address any questions or needs. Highly recommend."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Smith's cottage was beautifully decorated with high-end finishes. The location was quiet yet close by I95 exit. Very comfortable stay. Very friendly hosts.
2024-02-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"The cleanest Airbnb ever. Great place to spend the night, I-95 is only 2 miles away yet this place feels a very long way from the stress of the interstate. The tree frogs entertained in harmony. It was cloudy so we missed the stars. The puppy loved exploring the big yard. We forgot a pair of glasses which they gladly mailed back to us. Great place great hosts. With places like this if they are available I doubt we will ever stay at a motel again."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Peaceful and cozy. Exactly what we were looking for!
2024-02-01,5,Stayed one night,The house was even nice than portrayed in pictures and even more spacious. Many comfortable blankets were provided as well which was a big plus.

2024-02-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Clean and comfortable place to stop on our way from Canada to Florida. Lots of room for dog to get his energy out and pack and play for our 6 month old to sleep. Very peaceful and quiet. Host were very responsive and helpful. Will be back during future travels.
2024-02-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"So close to 95 yet miles away from noise and lights. Well stocked, very clean, and open concept was inviting and didn't feel crowded."
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"A wonderful place to stay, a private home that is extremely beautiful and cozy, very modern and welcoming"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Really cool location and very private.
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"A lovely space, beautifully arranged. Highly Recommend!"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"David and Jessica’s place, was a perfect place to go for a little getaway. Everything about the property was very pleasant and peaceful. The environment was beautiful and perfect we loved everything about it. The only issue we had was there were ants in our bag the next day we had woken up and a line of them going under the carpet in the bedroom. But other than that everything about David and Jessica’s place was PERFECT!"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Beautiful home. Highly recommended A+++
2024-01-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Felt at home as soon as we got there, even though it was 30-40 degrees outside we found ourselves around the fire watching movies on the outdoor tv for hours while the dogs got all their energy out in the huge yard with all the privacy you could want."
2024-01-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Great place right off 95. Perfectly placed between our locations. Very nice house!

2024-01-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Awesome place! Open floor plan and comfortable. Loved the 60”+ tv outside for football. Best star gazing in a long time without much light pollution. The only tough part about this spot is that we didn’t find it sooner.
2024-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Frequent the area often to hunt it was great being able to bring the family and feel at home.
Thanks!!"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We needed a place to layover for a night , we were moving long distance with 3 dogs. Jessica and David were gracious about the dogs staying too"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This was a wonderful stay , the host was super friendly & responsive when i couldn’t understand the lockbox. Will stay again 10/10 recommend"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Great place to stay. Well stocked, clean and modern. Lots of space inside and great space out back for dogs to run and no immediate neighbours. Fairly close to the road but it’s quiet.
The hosts went all out with Christmas decorations (12 Christmas trees of various sizes!). Would definitely stay again."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,WOW! We have stayed at Smith’s Cottage a number of times and always had a wonderful experience. We loved that cottage was beautifully decorated for the holidays.
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"The cottage was hands down one of the nicest places we've stayed! It was cozy, spotless, and filled with adorable Christmas decorations that made it feel homey and comfortable. We were traveling for the holidays and the proximately to the interstate was fantastic, and it made our travel experience so much better. Check in was easy, check out with simple, and we couldn't have been happier. We were happy to find such a nice dog-friendly place where our pups could recoup from the long car ride."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This home is lovely and peaceful. The hosts decorated for Christmas which made our holiday stay even more enjoyable. We hope to visit again.
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Loved our stay! We were traveling up to PA from SC, and this was a great resting spot for the night. It was so beautifully decorated and lots of cozy touches. The backyard was the best- we had a fire and enjoyed the outdoor tv. My dog also loved all the space to stretch his legs after a long car ride!"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We received our family from Michigan and they were delighted with the accommodations. It was extremely homey and they wanted to extend their stay :)
We will absolutely recommend Smith's Cottage and will book it again in the future.
Thank you!"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,My partner and I enjoyed staying at Jessica and David’s place. We for sure felt right at home and loved all the Christmas decor. It was very cozy! We wished we stayed longer than the one night cause of how beautiful the place was. Will just have to go back to relax!
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,We stayed for 2 days for some solitude and relaxation. The cottage was exactly what we were looking for. Well equipped with more than you need and the place stayed so warm during the cold nights. The kids watched The Grinch on the outdoor TV while sipping hot cocoa. Its really beautiful inside and out. Thanks again!
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We felt like we were walking into a Christmas story. The decorations were awesome! Beautiful home, clean and neat and very private setting. We spent only one night but would have more if we could have."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Gorgeous home and so cozy! 😊
2023-11-01,4,Stayed with kids,"The cottage is adorable, spacious and private. We loved that Christmas decorations were up to welcome us the weekend after Thanksgiving -- the tree was a perfect nightlight for my son! The yard and back porch were great to unwind after a long drive; our kids loved playing darts and watching the huge TV! Master bed was comfy, the outside light only shone of the side of the house with no windows and there was nearly no traffic. We were disappointed with the cleanliness however: kitchen counters had food spills, mirrors were splattered with toothpaste, hair in sink, etc. With a deep clean, this would be the perfect gem!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Great short visit! Liked the open layout. Nicely decorated, we loved the Christmas decorations! Took advantage of fire-pit to make s'mores with my son. Enjoyed our visit. Just know that hunters are active across the street."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Absolutely beautiful home, peaceful quiet surroundings. Traveling through and it was very easy off 95 access. My kids wanted to stay instead of going to Florida! Which says a lot! My dogs were very comfortable. The decor is just amazing!! We all loved it!! My only complaint was the bathroom could have been cleaner. There were splatters on the mirrors, and some pink grime in the shower. But it was minimal, and I would come back in a heart beat!! Really ,love , loved it!!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We had a great stay at Jessica and David's place. Great location. Was very quiet and peaceful. Such a beautiful home. Wish we had more time to stay and that we had better weather to enjoy their amazing backyard. Thanks for the stay, we will be back!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Beautiful farm style home across from cotton fields in peaceful serenity.
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Perfect place to relax! Very clean and had everything I needed.
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I would love to come back with firewood and enjoy the outdoor area.
2023-11-01,4,Stayed with a pet,It is a very nice house and well decorated. It was perfect for our overnight stay.
2023-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"This was an amazing gem in the middle of nowhere. So quiet.. must be the cotton fields. There is no one around and very little traffic. I think we saw 2 cars drive by the whole night.
The house itself is beautiful and comfortable. It looks small outside but feels big inside. One bed was softer and the other pretty firm. I had the firm one, which I didn’t love, but was fine for one night.
We liked the place so much that we are trying to come up with excuses to go back! We were only there the night so we didn’t get to enjoy it long. It is by far our favorite house on our road-trip so far. It’s set a pretty high bar for the rest of our accommodations.
Loved the stay. Thank you for having us!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Wow -- what a location. My family and I were looking for a quiet place to stop over on a road trip from Philly to Orlando. Jessica and David's house was absolutely perfect for what we needed. My wife and I both remarked that we have never stayed in such a nice Airbnb. We almost extended our vacation by a day just so that we could enjoy the place for longer than the 14 hours (minus 8 for sleep) we were there so that we could take full advantage of the awesome back yard area (firepit, games, outdoor TV). What a beautiful setting, too, with large cottonfields across the street and trees everywhere -- no other houses in sight. If we ever do another trip down 95 I know where we'll be staying!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed one night,Very nice place away from everything ! But still close enough to anything you need!
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The place was amazing ! I loved the stay there. I would recommend this place to everyone ! The only thing i would like better is tv’s in the bedroom but i didn’t mind that at all! Loved my stay
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,Beautiful home. This is a home I’d like to retire too. Decorations perfect. Close to 95 for a quick over night stay. Peaceful and quiet. Has everything you need.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Comfy, clean and super close to the highway. What more could you ask for? We were so grateful to have a pack and play so we didn’t have to brig our own. The shower was especially awesome!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,The most cutest Airbnb!!!
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,An absolutely beautiful home in a very beautiful and peaceful area. Easy on and off I-95. Just the perfect spot to stop for weary traveler’s.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,We loved our stay and will definitely be back! No neighbors in sight and the backyard was perfect for entertaining. Truly get the country living feel!
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"One of the best Airbnb stays. A few miles off the highway. Perfect pit stop for a drive up the east coast. Super clean home, and beautiful and peaceful setting. Parking in the driveway. Plenty of kitchen utensils and cookware. Comfy furniture. Washer and dryer available, too. Felt right at home and already looking forward to our next visit."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We stayed overnight just passing through on our way to Massachusetts from Flordia. I wish we had more time to enjoy and relax in this beautiful little cottage. Such a beautiful, clean and cozy cottage!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,Our stay was amazing! We have made long drives like this before and their place was one of the best ones yet. It was clean comfortable and in a good location. The scenery around the home was also very beautiful. I plan to book again next time I take this trip! Would recommend to anyone.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Jessica and David's cottage is a hidden gem near the interstate. We were in the area for our scuba certification and this really worked out great as a warm place to stay. The decor was beautiful and the house had everything we needed to be comfy. Unfortunately, we stayed during the Tropical Storm, Ophelia, and we were not able to enjoy the beautiful patio out back. We will have to come back again when the weather is better!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,Great place to stay for some country peace and quiet. It was just what we needed as we traveled home from the Northeast. Space was clean and exactly as pictured.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Wonderful, charming home!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"We booked to stay on our way home from our wedding week so that we had one night to ourselves - it did not disappoint! We wanted a quiet place that also didn’t take us too far off the route. It was perfect. Nature sounds in the background, a fire in the fire pit, our first home cooked meal made in a well equipped kitchen and a great nights sleep. All of the details have been considered in this clean cottage. We wish we had more time and would absolutely stay again!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place!
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with a pet,This place is the cutest Airbnb I have stayed in. Everything about it was relaxing and adorable. It’s like a hidden gem. 10 stars if I could!!! This is what I expect when getting a place through Airbnb and they do not disappoint!!
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,Probably the best AirBnB that I have stayed in! This is such a fabulous property and perfect for breaking up a long road trip. I wish we could have stayed another night!
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,Beautiful location with an incredible front porch and string light lit backyard. We were sad it was only one night. Very comfy and homey!
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,This place is great. After 9 hours on the road it was an oasis to relax in. Plenty of space and comfortable. We had a short stay due to travel plans but it would be ideal for a longer stay. This will be our go to on future trips south.
2023-09-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Nice tranquil rural area. Host was accommodating to my request prior to my check-in date. Was not responsive when a minor issue arrived. Therefore, we were unable to complete one of the task written in the house rules. We try to make sure to leave someone's home in accordance to host rules. Overall, the place is nice."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed about a week,Amazing place if you’re looking to get away have some private time and
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The house was amazing. We will definitely be back
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,Smiths cottage was an absolute beautiful location. It matched the pictures and was a much needed change in scenery. Will definitely be returning another time for some relaxation!
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,This was probably the nicest Airbnb I’ve ever been too AND in close proximity to i95. I’d go back just for the rest and relaxation part! My dogs felt like they had their own private park and the secluded location was such a nice break!
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We loved to mew small additions to the house since our last stay. My family was so in love!!!
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Comfortable and quiet stay. Will return!
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Loved our stay! House was beautiful, clean, and just as described. We would absolutely stay again and/or recommend to anyone traveling."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,This is a beautiful country retreat home. It is very relaxing and the home is furnished with all the essentials snd whatever else you might need. This is definitely worth the trip.
2023-08-01,4,Stayed with a pet,"Very accessible to 95
Private and quiet
Very bright light public street light stays on all night that is seen in bedrooms - no blackout curtains unfortunately. Maybe consider bringing your own eye masks.
Really homey and comfortable."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"Beautiful place, thank you!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Really amazing place that was even better than what we expected.

Highly recommend if you want some peace and quiet."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,we loved how secluded the house was. it was a peaceful and quiet trip. we really enjoyed spending time in the backyard and looking at the stars at night.

2023-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We really enjoyed our stay and will definitely stay here again.
It truly is a great house with an amazing outdoor patio."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,Such a sweet and beautiful place! Very quaint and private that made it feel even more homey. I wish we could have stayed longer.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,Our trip was very short but very beneficial. Jessica and David were awesome hosts and very communicative and helpful in regards to check in. Highly recommend this location for people looking for a private and peaceful getaway.
2023-07-01,4,Stayed with a pet,"I loved this location. My favorite was sitting on the front porch with my coffee every morning. The house was gorgeous. Very unique. I would love to stay again, as I visit my daughter often."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We loved the stay! The house was beautiful as well as clean. The surroundings were very peaceful, and the house was well illuminated at nighttime. The only downside is the master bedroom mattress, which was extremely hard in my opinion, but couch was super comfy. Wish we had a longer stay to enjoy the house. I would recommend :)"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This place is perfect for a peaceful retreat or in our case, a nice stopover on a long drive that’s close to 95. Very clean house that was beautifully renovated. Would recommend!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"What a beautiful home to stay in! Pictures did not do it justice. Jessica & David were wonderful hosts, they left the light on for us outside when we mentioned we would be arriving late. The house was clean and welcoming. We would absolutely stay again!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Absolutely delightful place!
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"First thing that comes to mind is Amazing. Better in person than photos. If you enjoy peace and quiet and not much else around, this is the place for you. It’s unfortunate we could not stay longer but look forward to our next trip down south so we can stay here. Well kept. Clean as can be. Very accommodating. Highly highly recommended. Outdoor amenities are awesome as well!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Everything was amazing!
We were on a long road trip from Boston to Florida with two kids and two dogs. Needless to say, we wanted space, quiet and to relax. Jessica and David’s place was perfect. We’re out in the country far enough that we could really see the stars, the house is beautiful, and the outdoor space is perfectly curated with outdoor tv, darts and a fire pit.
We were so pleasantly surprised that we wish we had more days to stay.
I will also note that you are out by yourself with very little around. So - we were thrilled when we rolled the dice on one of the hosts recommendations for dinner and it was very good.
All in all, we will go back if we’re ever in the area."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,It was great!
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We greatly enjoyed our time at Jessica’s and David’s little retreat. It’s off the beaten path, peaceful and quite. The house was in great shape and very clean. Highly recommend staying at this location."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,A perfect little getaway spot! Definitely booking again when passing through the area.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,Beautiful
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"The place is lovely and we loved it. Nothing around unless you drive about 15 minutes, so come prepared. We were happy to see that because that is what we were looking for. Peace and calm with privacy for our doggie kids. There are plenty of activities to do at the house.
The hosts never answered any of our messages, even asking about the surprise fish in the house plant bowl, but luckily we never needed anything major. Once we realized they did not respond we did not send any more communication except letting them know when we checked out.
Mobility Awareness: There is no clear path leading from the back pad area to the grass yard through the rocks. Steady yourself or get a hand to help you over them. They can shift and be slick."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Beautifully decorated and very clean. Just off I95. The residence is a true oasis surrounded by vacant land. It is extremely peaceful. The landscaping in the back with the rocks is amazing. The only suggestion for improvement is the bed in the main bedroom. It is very loud and not comfortable.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,This was by far the best air bnb we have stayed in! Even better than the pictures with many extras! We only wish we could have stayed longer. We will be back.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Everything was incredible. Fire ants snuck up on us and Jessica was incredibly responsive and resolved the issue quickly!
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"I was blown away by this house! I loved every little detail about it. We’re always looking for stops on our trips to and from Philly. This was cozy, beautiful, quiet, and perfect for our kids and dogs. I really appreciated the coffee, laundry detergent, and other thoughtful provisions left for guests. There are plenty of stores and food within 10 minutes.
We will definitely be back; wish we could have stayed more than a day!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"House is a short 5 min drive from I-95 and tucked into a nice private area. Hosts were exceptional-responsive, timely, and good to work with. The place was phenomenal! Pristine clean, spacious, peaceful, great western themes, and comfortable. The back porch had a great firepit, string lights, dart board and set a great environment. Hats off to the hosts who went to great lengths on every detail of the house from spacious showers, awesome coffee station, to spacious kitchen. Even the rocking chairs on the front porch were a brilliant ending to my morning coffee as I saw a deer across an open field grazing while I sipped on my 1st cup of coffee this morning. One of the best AirBNBs we have ever stayed at!!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Best Airbnb we’ve ever stayed in. Incredibly clean. Beautiful, peaceful surroundings. Great front porch with rocking chairs. Huge yard for pets (or humans) to run around. Great outdoor space out back with seating, a fire pit and grill. 2 miles off the interstate. Perfect stop for the evening, and only wish we had more time to enjoy the space. Highly recommend, and hope to return in the future."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Great stay. Thanks.
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Adorable house. Super easy to get to and the hosts were awesome at communicating. Will definitely revisit next trip!
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with a pet,We enjoyed our stay. The place was very nicely done. Loved the Kitchen and Outdoor patio.
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"A little gem of an airbnb. Perfect for a stop off on travel North or South on 95, it's just two miles off the highway and suddenly you're in another world! Built with loving care and attention to detail, beautifully decorated. Jessica and David were responsive and friendly, the house is lovely. Beautiful countryside, great for early morning walk with our dog."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Always a great stay.
Restful country setting.
Very clean and cozy!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Extremely clean, spacious and peaceful! We only stayed for one night, so we didn’t get to enjoy the games and incredible outside space. Everything in this home is updated and clean - and the decor is awesome (love the use of wood!) The mattress on the bed is so loud.. I kept waking up my baby whenever I moved. Everything else was perfect!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Exactly what we needed. Super quiet. Close to 95. our dogs loved loved the surroundings.
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"All I can say is WOW! We booked this for us to stay at while moving cross country. My parents had never stayed at an Airbnb before and they said “we want this to be our real home.” It is so charming, so welcoming, and had everything you could need. The backyard was so much fun and it felt secluded. Very peaceful!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,Great place! I very much enjoyed my stay.
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Host was very responsive to any needs. Super helpful! Quiet, clean beautiful home!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great place, peaceful and quiet. We have stayed at a number of properties over the years and this was in the top 3, easily. Super clean, modern farm house that is well done."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"Of all the Airbnb properties I've ever visited, THIS BY FAR, is NUMBER ONE! I just couldn't stop extending our stay! We really did not want to leave! After checking out, we even returned once again for 2 days before heading home. Ooookay where to start.....
so first of all.... THE SCENERY! Wide Open spaces all around! You'll drive down a long dirt road (cause who doesn't love that!!!) and then BAM! THIS big, beautiful white house!!!
It's just stunning! The landscaping and pebble-lined walkway just give you that feeling that you're about to encounter something special!
OPEN THE DOOR.... Beautiful decor! I MEAN GORGEOUS! Huge OPEN floor plan and the most BEAUTIFUL KITCHEN stocked with EVERYTHING one would need to cook the perfect meal! The BACK YARD would probably be my favorite! HUMONGOUS FIRE-PIT beyond the beautifully paved patio! AND A BIG SCREEN TV ! OUTSIDE! This place is just SO SO special. I could go on! PLEASE CHECK IT OUT! You will not be disappointed!!!!!!"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This home is beautiful. It was designed and decorated perfectly. We loved looking at every special detail. It was a perfect choice for a little weekend getaway, a much needed break from the hustle and bustle of NOVA!"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,we just love this place
2023-04-01,3,Stayed a few nights,"It’s was a great stay, I only wish the water was hotter, and stayed warm
Longer. Other than that it was a great time."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,The place was really nice. Spacious and very clean. We arrived at 9:30pm. I had trouble with the lock box so I called. Even though it was late they answered right away and walked me through the process. I was grateful for that and a beautiful stay for the night.
2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,Great place - quiet and relaxing. Clean and easy to find. Thanks!
2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"You definitely want to book here!
I can't speak highly enough of this place. We absolutely loved our stay here. Everything was clean, there was every amenity we needed, there was a super cozy living room, there were board games and WiFi, and a grill and fire pit outback (and even a dart board and a huge TV!). It was the perfect place to spend our afternoon/evening. I'd even rent this place to literally just hang out there for the weekend as a getaway from home.
The only ""cons"" were the beds- the spring mattresses had us tossing and turning, but I wouldn't let that stop me from going back. Maybe I'd bring my mattress topper and my own pillows or something. I also wasn't a fan of the Betta bowl on the counter; I've been a pet care provider for about 12 years and I always hate to see pets with outdated care (Betta's need full tanks and filters like every other fish!).
All that being said, I would return here a million times as a halfway point to spend time with my parents!"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Definitely a great place to stay and relax!!!
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This is our favorite place to stay. Peaceful, Private, Clean, Spacious.
We were able to view a beautiful sunrise and the call of a Whipper-will."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Great house in a beautiful setting. Just wish we had more time to enjoy the peepers at night and have a bonfire. Highly recommend!
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This is a great place to stay! It was clean, comfortable, and spacious which was perfect for us as we were doing a long drive and stopping over for the night. Very easy to communicate with Jessica and David and check in was easy. I would definitely stay again!"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,love it
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We stopped at Jessica and David’s house on our way down to Charleston. It was conveniently located, beautifully decorated and extremely comfortable. We were so happy to be able to stay at this lovely home and wish we could have stayed longer!"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We enjoyed Jessica and David’s place. It was a quiet and clean. Just what we were looking for for a nice peaceful weekend
2023-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Great place & fun decor! Will definitely stay again when traveling along Rt. I-95.
2023-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Beautiful house, conveniently located right off 95 - very peaceful and private location."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"The cutest little house with a beautiful and cozy interior, we felt right at home! The views are beautiful and you can tell Jessica and David put a lot of work into making this place a comfortable place to stay. We loved it! Would definitely come stay again. :)"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Smith’s cabin had everything we needed for a cozy, comfortable, and peaceful stay. Definitely on our repeat list!"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"Beautiful home in a quiet, peaceful area. A great place to unwind and relax."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Adorable place
2023-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"A lovely home that was perfect for our needs. Jessica and David made us feel at home and welcoming of our dogs (with responsible ownership and care of their home). We needed a quiet, clean place to relax after a busy day... this place was a gem."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,Amazing place! Wish we could have stayed longer.
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Always a pleasure
2023-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"Wilt Chamberlain would have felt right at home, with the 12 foot ceilings and outrageously beutiful kitchen and amenities. The quality and character put into this home makes it a reviving stay. I am blown away--never seen any other airbnb like this one for the money. Inside and out, these people spent big bucks in all the right places. I pray they recieve it back 10 fold. What a pleasure it was to stay here along the grueling 16 hour trip we have."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,This was the best Airbnb experience we’ve ever had. We’ve stayed at nearly a dozen airbnbs and this one was number one. I wish we had more than one day. This will be our first choice when we come this way again.
2023-03-01,5,Stayed one night,Perfect play to stay and relax during a long road trip. The home is in an quiet location and is absolutely immaculate. We enjoyed the amenities and wish we could have stayed longer to enjoy the firepit and great back porch. Would definitely stay again and highly recommend.
2023-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Really nice place, the vibes hit. Thank you for having us"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This was a lovely place to stay, especially if you are traveling on 95!! It was 2 miles off the highway. It was perfect for us while on our road trip! The house was gorgeous!!"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,.
2023-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Really beautiful and quiet place to unwind after a long day on I95. The house feels brand new with a lot of effort spent on decorating and extras to make it the perfect stay!
2023-02-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Great place! Super modern, awesome back porch for hanging out with friends and family. Fire pit was great, darts were fun! The kitchen was beautiful and great for gathering. Awesome place - we will be back!"
2023-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"It was a nice stay after driving for so long. My only complaint was there wasn't any dry wood or materials to start a fire, so I couldn't utilize the firepit as planned. Other than that, the cottage was very nice!"
2023-02-01,5,Stayed one night,I needed a place to stay overnight on my way to Hilton Head for a work conference and this was the absolute PERFECT spot to rest and take a break! The house is absolutely gorgeous and comfortable and the outside is beautiful! We wishes we had more time!
2023-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Such a cute property! Everything was nice, decorated so farmhouse modern cute! Even though I95 is just on the other side of the tree line, felt super secluded...would be a great spot for our littles' first camp out. Kids loved all the cow decor, tractor seat barstools, and the roomy and ultra comfy sectional. Host was responsive upon check in and check out, and that's the only time we communication was necessary. Would definitely stay here again when we're in the area!"
2023-01-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Brand new place, nice decor and out for space"
2023-01-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Loved how clean everything was. The home felt like something we had built for ourselves!
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very nice and cozy! Fire pit was perfect for a cold wintery night.
2023-01-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Beautiful cottage! Everything was new and spotless and The decor was super cozy . We are looking forward to returning.
2023-01-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This is a beautiful place to stay - so peaceful and everything you need. We were driving through Virginia on a two-day road trip and appreciated the responsiveness of the host to allow us to book same-day, last-minute. We only wish we could have stayed longer to enjoy this beautiful retreat."
2023-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great little big little getaway, the full moon and the starts are amazing, while sitting next to the warmth of the fire pit. This little house is beautifully decorated with Western and Country theme with a touch of industrial. We felt at home the minute we arrived. The details in the home gave the perfect finishing touch. Keep in mind that the house is about 70 ft off of the road so you will have cars passing by, and if you are staying on a weekend during hunting season, there is a group of hunters that will park across the street to hunt in the hunting club land near by. We went to a local barbecue place, brought it back and enjoyed dinner around the fire pit. Some may think that the price point after additional fees might be a bit high but the house is immaculately decorated and it's a perfect seclusion getaway, and if that's what matters to you then this place is perfect! The only thing missing is a hot tub to soak in under the stars."
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The craftsmanship of this place is fantastic, every detail is meticulous. We were more than impressed with the what the house had to offer. The kitchen is spectacular. The bedrooms are comfy and spacious. You really get a lot of bang for your buck here. The only complaint we had is the proximity of the house to the road. The house is maybe 50 yards off of the road and therefore feels a little bit more exposed to the road than other houses in the area. Overall this is a great place to get away and experience nature."
2022-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,We stayed overnight on a long drive and everything was great!
2022-12-01,4,Stayed with a pet,The house is close to 95 and easy to get into. The space is very open and the decor was well done. The house was clean and had a lot of cool features outside that we weren't able to check out as we were there for only 14 hours. The description says they have wifi but I wasn't able to get the password to work and the sign says it was only supposed to be for the TV (which to me would mean they don't have wifi).
2022-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,I love the place. The only thing negative that I could complain is that the check out is at 10am and the wifi was not working that day. I didn’t bother to get a hold of Jessica to the fact we did our check in at 8:30pm and it was already kind of getting late to watch tv. But other then that I will definitely book here again. A++++++
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"We stayed at this BNB as apart of a road trip from Florida to Pennsylvania. It’s located conveniently close to 95 just before Virginia. I didn’t realize how close the lake is to the house! The view is breathtaking and relaxing! My husband woke up the next morning at 5:45AM looking for me and of course I was by the lake! I was setting up a cozy bon fire to enjoy breakfast around. I saw fisherman on the lake as the steam fog engulfed their surroundings. I got beautiful pictures! The house was very tidy and cozy. Blankets and bed were so soft and comfortable. The kitchen was fully stocked and we were welcomed with snacks, bottled water and a card upon arrival. We will keep this place on our list to revisit in the future."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Loved this place. We stayed on the huge screened in porch and enjoyed the view most of the weekend. It was peaceful and relaxing. The beds were also very comfy. Renee even reached out via text a couple of times to see if we needed anything.
2024-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What an amazing house to stay in for a nice and relaxing weekend. The home has everything you need - just bring your food, drinks and snacks and the rest is taken care of. We enjoyed the back porch all weekend, cooked on the grill (charcoal was provided) and also fishing off of the bank. At night, we used the fire pit (wood provided) to gaze at the stars. Renee was an amazing host that was there when we needed her and to check in to make sure we had everything we needed. Communication was excellent all around! Details of the house that she provided was exact and she allowed us to know where things were - even the volume button on the side of the remote! lol. I highly recommend this location for the nice, clean home and the wonderful views that goes along with it. Thanks Renee for taking care of us!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,great place and Renee was wonderful
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Renee was a GREAT host! She was on top of everything. We relaxed each night fishing off the shore and caught a few catfish!
Home was very welcoming, loved the screened in back porch. Can’t wait to go back!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This place was perfect. So very peaceful and relaxing. We will be booking for future trips. Would love to come back to swim and fish. Renee was very helpful and responded everytime. I couldn’t think of a better place to have a few relaxing days away
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Words can not explain just how beautiful and peaceful this stay was. Renee was super helpful and accommodating. I definitely recommend.
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,As soon as I pulled up the view of the lake took my breath away. Two carports were readily available for my convenience. The home was spotless and extremly comfortable. I most enjoyed sitting out back on the screened in porch and deck overlooking the lake. Renee was an exceptional host and provided all of the amenities that I needed. I will definitely book this home again in the near future.
2024-06-01,3,Stayed with a pet,"The host did a wonderful job letting us know about the great local spots. We enjoyed the local playground, lake, and pizza shop. The house was private, and it was an okay stay overall. A good set up without too much clutter."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Great, cozy and clean place. We enjoyed our stay for the weekend .Location was very ideal and close to Lake Gaston. Me and my fiancé stayed for the weekend to join family and friends on the lake and this place was perfect. I would definitely book again."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Absolutely lived it..Its located within walking distance to most of everything..will stay here anytime..Gavin is a awesome host.
2024-06-01,4,Stayed with a pet,It was nice

2024-05-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Great spot to stop at while traveling! The house was nicer than the pictures and the backyard along the woods was very nice!
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,An excellent place to stay. I was pleasantly surprised and impressed.

2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Exactly what we wanted. Pictures and description matched. Easy check-in, clean, great parking, well kept property. I would totally recommend."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This host was so informative and very kind. This place was absolutely perfect for me as I was stopping through with my small dog on my way back to New Jersey from Georgia. I didn’t need the 3 bedrooms since it was just me, but it was a comfortably sized house for one person to not be too scared alone 😅.
The yard is so spacious for my dog to potty and stretch her legs. They even provide a few doggie bags which was thoughtful. I always have my own but it was a nice extra touch.
I stayed in the room on the first floor right next to the driveway so that I could be near my car (which was packed to the brim) in case of an emergency.
The kitchen is the equivalent to what you’d expect at a hotel that offers a continental breakfast. Equipped with the basics of disposable materials, coffee machine, microwave, and fridge.
The linen was laid out perfectly upstairs and the shower was so nice and hot. Everything was great. Thanks again!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We enjoyed our stay. The house was exactly what we needed for a few nights. It's within reasonable driving distance to many cool places to explore and see.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"Thank you so much, great place!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,Thank you! Great stay.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Gavin is a fantastic host for this little gem of a house in Littleton, NC. Gavin is clear and responsive in all communication. The house was perfect meet my needs for a stay of a few days. I will definitely stay hear again when I am in the area."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,our second time staying here.... love it here.... easy access.... clean....
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Nice quiet place, Gavin was very understanding when I needed more time for a later check out. Would stay there again. highly recommended!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We had a great time. House was clean and comfortable.
2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,Amazing stay! Even though it was for a short time !!
2024-03-01,4,Stayed one night,Just in town for 12 hours.
2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,Very nice and clean home. The location worked perfectly for my quick last minute trip to the area.
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,The little cottage in Littleton was perfect for our needs and we felt very comfortable. I worked from the house on Monday and Tuesday and the office space worked well. We will definitely plan to stay here again when we’re in the area.
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Place was great. Clean and comfortable. We were there for a competition not a vacation. Perfect for all we needed. Better than any hotel I stayed at. Not much to do in town at night. I would definitely stay there again.
2024-02-01,5,Stayed one night,Great host and great place. Clear communication and great experience. Very happy with this airbnb.
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Place was in a great condition in a convenient location for my travel needs. i will definitely be reaching out again whenever I am in town!!
2024-02-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This is the second time we have stayed here, and we are looking forward to a third. The older house has great charm and has been restored with care and decorated elegantly. The beds and pillows are outstandingly comfortable, and the house is spotless. Littleton is a lovely, peaceful and interesting small town to stroll in; our dogs just love it as well. I can't recommend it highly enough."
2024-02-01,2,Group trip,Everything went ok until our bed frame collapsed at 1:30AM. Both of us could have been injured as our heads ended up under the headboard. We had great difficulty getting our bodies out of this situation. We ended up sliding the mattress down the steps and putting it on the floor in the den to sleep. One of the persons has a back problem and was very uncomfortable. The worse part was not getting any kind of a response from the owners when I reported the incidence. Needless to say we will not be staying at broken bed air bnb again.
2024-01-01,4,Stayed one night,was good
2024-01-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Everything about Gavin’s place was perfect and what we’d expect!

2024-01-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Nice place!
2024-01-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Gavin’s place was very clean and the beds were comfortable. The kitchen was not a full kitchen, but had a microwave and toaster if you needed to heat something up. We were really happy that we could bring our dog along."
2024-01-01,5,Stayed one night,Great place to stay if passing through. Very cozy.
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,My husband and friends stayed here as they were doing work on Lake Gaston and it was the perfect place for the three of them to stay and wind down after a long day of work!
2024-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"Nice place for an overnight getaway like we did. Lots of extra little things. Like soaps, shampoo, great little kitchenette, especially enjoyed the coffee bar. Would definitely stay again."
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I do routine consulting work in this region of North Carolina and always look to see if Gavin's place is available whenever I have an overnight stay. The place is a perfect remote office and accommodation, with easy access to local restaurants. Highly recommended!"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Thank you!
2024-01-01,5,Group trip,We really enjoyed our stay.
2024-01-01,5,Stayed with a pet,House as promised. Very clean. Beds were comfy and clean! Very relaxing and Gavin had great communication! Would stay there again. Thank you
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great place clean, comfortable and convenient."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"perfect little spot for a quick stay, clean and peaceful"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Gavin’s place was great. Everything as expected and was a great, clean space. Will definitely stay here again."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This pleasant Cape Cod has been nicely updated and was very pristine. It is conveniently located within walking distance of the lovely little shops and eateries in Littleton, NC. We loved the layout and the kitchen was perfect for light snacks and meals. The only drawback for us (at 70 years old) was having only one bathroom on the second floor. However, we made it work and it is still, overall, a lovely place to stay. We do plan to return.
There is also a nice deck and barbecue grill in the backyard. Parking is a breeze with a wide driveway next to the house. A great value for the price!"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great place to stay, have used it multiple times. Always clean, neat, and organized. Gavin communicates relevant information about local offering."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed one night,👍🏽
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Gavin,
What a wonderful place you. Just right for our stay and our sweet Toto. Loved the house."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This home is super cute and a true hidden gem. Sadly we were only there for one night but I would definitely stay again.
Home is exactly as pictured. Clean and comfortable."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"We loved staying at this location. It was incredible easy to find, entrance instructions were easy and concise, the house was in outstanding condition, instructions on how to use the TV/Wifi and other things were clearly spelled out, the bedrooms were clean, the beds were freshly made and very comfortable, and the price was amazing.
We ate dinner at a fun Italian restaurant that we walked to from the house.
Checkout was just as easy as checking in.
Overall, a wonderful experience and we look forward to returning."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great as usual
2023-11-01,4,Stayed with kids,"Overall the stay was fine. It was supposed to be my husband, daughter and I for a work event he had going on, but I ended up having something come up so it was just him. He arrived a little early so I messaged to see if he could check in, I also sent the photos of the exterior damage like Gavin had asked. I never got a response from anyone. I got automated messages about check out towards the end of the stay, but never did I get a message from someone on the other end. The stay itself was fine he said other than the house could use a mirror downstairs as well and that it is not very private- very out in the open, but otherwise it was fine. Glad he didn’t have any issues since we were unable to reach the host. As a host myself, I try to be very responsive to guests knowing that this is an important aspect of the hosting process."
2023-11-01,4,Stayed one night,"We chose Gavin’s place as it was close to relatives we were planning to visit. It was comfortable enough and very clean but had an impersonal feel to it. Minimal kitchen which was made clear, but only paper plates and plastic eating utensil dispensers on the wall. My biggest problem was that the queen bed was on the first floor, but the only bathroom was on the second floor. I would have liked to have known the bathroom was upstairs. Just be aware. If was fine for a short stay."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"House was clean and comfortable and had everything we needed for a short stay. Check-in was easy. Gavin provided lots of helpful information. Loved that the place was pet friendly, and the grassy area outside was perfect for our dog to run around. This was the first airbnb I've stayed at (and there have been many) that provided paper plates and plastic utensils instead of actual dishware. I think having coffee mugs, plates, wine glasses, etc. (and also a sponge, dish soap, and a kitchen towel to help keep the place clean) would greatly enhance the experience. Also, I found the kitchenette area and the shower to be quite dark. Other than that, the place worked out well for an overnight stay, and I would book again if I'm in the area!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great stay, comfortable, clean, and convenient"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I always stay at one of Gavin's properties anytime im in nc..always get exactly whats on the pictures...feels like home...very convenient location.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"This was my first time using Airb&b and was an excellent experience, and was extremely convenient to a job we were working on.
Thanks!"
2023-10-01,5,Group trip,Absolutely loved this place. it was in a great location and it was exactly as described.

2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great home. Clean, comfortable and cozy. Easy accessibility to restaurants."
2023-10-01,5,Group trip,This cottage met our needs perfectly. I appreciated all of the detailed information that was provided about our accommodations and the local area. We were very pleased with our experience here.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This space was perfect for a quick weekend trip with the guys. Easy to find and close to a few restaurants. It was everything we needed and nothing we didn't.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Check-in was a breeze! Gavin sent great recommendations for the area and instructions with the house.
The only issue was with the cleaning service. I cleaned the tub and advised Gavin of the issues to which he immediately corrected.
Overall my stay was fantastic and you won’t be disappointed with the accommodations! Gavin was a pleasure to work with! Thanks so much for providing a nice place to lay my head! ☺️"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We had an out of town pastor candidate and his family visiting for the weekend. This was a perfect, convenient, base location for the family of 5. Able to walk to the local shops and park for the kids. Very comfortable. I highly recommend it."

2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,Choose Gavin
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"This listing was perfect for our family of 4. We have family in town and travel to Littleton often. My husband and I along with our 2 adult sons were fine in this home. Very clean and the host, Gavin is so communicative. We got tips about where to eat and things to do in the area before arrival. The place is quiet and easily accessible. Our son left his bag and Gavin was great about letting us know and arranging for us to get the bag back. We did not bring our dog this trip but will in the future. The place was pet friendly but did not smell like it was a home with pets. The home has one bathroom which worked for 3 males and a female. We will definitely stay again! Do try the new Mexican restaurant just down the street. The steak asada fries were delicious and it stays open until 10! Great place, great host."

2023-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,This house was a great spot for an overnight stay while traveling to Myrtle Beach. It's a short drive off 95 and had everything we needed for our overnight. We were able to unwind after a full days drive and grab a hot shower before getting a good night's sleep in before we headed out in the AM. The house was clean and quiet and a nice value.
2023-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Family of 4 travelled 20 plus hours to visit family for 7 days. Our days were spent with family, and evenings/nights were spent at the house, which was immaculate and beautifully decorated. We managed quite well with the amenities provided. Littleton is a great little town with lots to do. Mornings were spent going for walks exploring the neighborhood and surroundings. There was a little mishap with some important documents which were accidentally left behind on our trip home. Gavin made arrangements to return documents to us and we were very grateful. Quite an enjoyable experience for our first time staying in an Airbnb."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Loved this cute little house. Super clean and everything you could possibly need was provided. After 12+ hrs in the car with 3 kids and a dog, this worked out so much better for us than a hotel. Everyone had their space and nice outdoor space for the dog and our boys.
Not a fan of the disposable dishes - so much garbage. Maybe just add a small dishwasher and real dishes."

House is private and set back but right in the middle of everything! We will be back for sure thank you so much for sharing your home 💜🦋

2023-02-01,5,Stayed with a pet,We had a nice weekend here! The house was clean and had good Wi-Fi and smart tvs. Very walkable to the Main Street in Littleton and short drive to the lake. I would recommend to people traveling with pets.
2023-02-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Me and my family felt right at home! Husband had to finish up a job in Conway so the kids dogs and me joined him. Very comfortable and cute place! Husband said it was the cleanest Airbnb he’s ever stayed in! Gavin was helpful and friendly!

2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The only complaint I had is there is no stove. It does say that in the description but I over looked that part. Not Gavin’s fault but may want to add that in the written description for future guests. Other than that the place was perfect! Thank you.
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Gavin - we loved Amanda and her info/ coming so quickly. The pasta down the street was fantastic! The home was perfect! 5.0 rating!
2022-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"What a lifesaver! had to make a trip to Littleton, NC to see family and drive back to Maryland. It was finger crossed as I know Littleton, NC is a small place. I was grateful to find this lovely place. From the constant communication with Gavin who was very descriptive on where everything was. It was 2 mins from my family which I loved they even mentioned using the place when other family visits. Overall very accommodating and everything you need in one place. If you need something to do Gavin will give you the rundown of the town events. Endless knowledge was a definite bonus. We definitely will be visit again 💖"
2022-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Gavin's home was really what we needed for a stop to rest on the way home from FL to PA . Gavin provided us with local information about the town we were staying in, and his home was set up well with towels, soaps, as well as a Keurig. The beds were comfy and we were so glad to be able to bring our pups with . It's a nice area and I loved being close to nature ( I saw some deer run by in the early a.m.) We would definitely stay here again and really appreciate how informative Gavin was !"
2022-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,We really enjoyed our stay. The home was clean and in a convenient location! The hosts were very communicative and helpful. Would stay again if ever in the area.

2022-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Very clean, comfortable and cute! Fit our family of five + dogs perfectly! Would definitely recommend for a weekend getaway to the lake."
2022-07-01,4,Stayed one night,"Truly excellent communication and service. Knowing Gavin was available 24/7 provided peace of mind. The owners have included thoughtful touches throughout to make you feel like a true guest. The place is spacious and was spotless. It was so clean that you wouldn’t have known they allow pets. As other reviewers have noted, the only bathroom is upstairs and it’s small, but we didn’t mind. The location wasn’t quite as situated in the neighborhood as we thought. Otherwise, everything was well represented, and check-in/check-out was a breeze. I gave it 4 stars on value, but I assume our price reflected that we visited during the high season at nearby Lake Gaston. Very good stay overall, and we will likely return."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"This house is clean, orderly, nicely decorated, private, quiet, comfortable, and cute. Great parking and and a nice
Outdoor space not near neighbors. It’s also a really nice option if you want to walk a couple minutes or less into Littleton for some good food. A very nice way to break up a trip! We’ve stayed at another property form same Owner and it was equally well put together and cared for. He communicates quickly also and has little treats and info inside if you are new to area."

2022-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Loved this house - great location, clean, and great for families. Steps from all the restaurants, shops, and amenities of historical Littleton, including a great playground our kids loved. Also a very quick drive to Lake Gaston and restaurants there like The Point. We really enjoyed our stay!"
2022-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,This is the perfect little place in Littleton for a quick trip. The host promptly communicated throughout the entire process and the descriptions and pictures were accurate. From the outside the house seems small but the layout and room sizes were perfect for a small family. The house is located in the center of town so it's easily accessible to Main Street.
2022-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,Cozy little home with super comfy beds!
2022-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"This rental was my first Air BnB experience and it was incredible. The house was in clean and pristine condition, the host, GAVIN, stayed in constant communication and was more than accommodating to ensure our stay was great… he’s exceptional! If this is what Air BnB rental is like, SIGN ME UP!… Oh yea, if you’re traveling/staying for business - THEY EVEN HAVE A PRINTER! - Had they not, our trip would’ve been a bit more interesting and delayed 🖐🏽 ⭐️s."

2022-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"This home was easy to access, clean, and had comfortable beds! I would stay here again."
2022-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Definitely a stop to make! The hosts are awesome and keep a beautiful home. This cottage has everything you need for a great stay!

2022-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"For small families looking to secure a quiet, hometown feel that’s away from the interstate, this is by far the perfect spot! About 20 Mins west of 95 off Roanoke Rapids, the home was Immaculately kept, super convenient, and right next to a cute downtown area with local family restaurants, crafters and locally operated quality gift shops. The house is well-equipped and expertly designed which for us to made this an excellent choice over any chain hotel. We would stay here again anytime we are heading through NC!"
2022-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Very clean house! Has been an amazing host. Messages you and keeps in touch. Would definitely recommend.

2022-02-01,4,Stayed over a week,"The Suite Retreat was a very cozy and quiet stay in the quaint town of Littleton. I enjoyed the cleanliness, the wood floors, the simple style of furnishing, the fluffy towels, and big back yard and deck. If you are staying long, bring a hotplate or a grill. As well as pots and pans, plates and bowls, spatulas, serving spoons etc. And if you don't like to cook, don't fret bc there are a couple nice restaurants within 1 minute of driving/3 minute walk. The restaurants have bubbly staff and everyone I met in Littleton treated me like a friendly neighbor. This area has a very special local history so go out, meet the locals, and enjoy the upcoming lake season!"
2022-01-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We really enjoyed our stay and appreciated how the house was thoughtfully set up — welcome candy/dog treat, coffee, showering materials/items, tissues, trash bins in each room, and plastic utensils. This would definitely be a house we would like to stop at again in the future.
The house was just as pictured. There was plenty of parking and a nice yard space.
I especially loved that our dogs were welcome at this location."
2022-01-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"After some 30 Airbnbs during the past two years, the Suite Retreat is the first Airbnb where we had no concern about Covid. The entire unit is immaculately clean and the use of high quality disposable utensils, including coffee cups and dishes, minimizes the risk of transmitting bacteria. Sanitizing products, including, wipes and hand cleaners, are also readily available. Not only did the unit exceed our discriminating standards for cleanliness, but everything else was five star - including high end comfortable beds and furniture and fluffy towels. Finally, the unit is easy to find and in a quiet area. Our host was great - very accommodating and attentive to our needs. We know Super Hosts work hard to achieve their rating and we appreciated the personal attention, such as texts to inform us of places to eat and shop. Way to go Gavin! Thanks for making your rental available to us. Ray and Debby"

2021-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We stayed one night here on a long car ride to NJ from Florida with our two dogs. The check in was easy and the house was super clean and updated. We walked to a restaurant the first night after seeing the menus in the kitchen. The downtown is literally two seconds walk from the front door. Just one note is there is one bathroom and it is upstairs so if you stay downstairs you have to walk the stairs to get there. Not a complaint, just a note for future travelers. We would definitely stay here again for future long trips! Gavin was a great host and super communicative."

2021-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"I can't imagine a more perfect stop on our way to the Outer Banks. The elegantly restored home is spotless and convenient, in a small town peaceful enough to safely take long walks with the dogs. Gavin is an attentive and communicative host. We will certainly be back."
2021-11-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Highly recommend this property to travelers; however, a few simple touches would improve the experience -- for example, providing sponges for cleaning the kitchen countertop and sink and trash bags. We had to buy these items. Be aware, the mattresses are memory foam rather than innerspring, which could be a pro or a con based on your preference."
2021-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"Very spacious, conveniently located, first rate"
2021-11-01,4,Stayed one night,"We’ve had very nice stay at Gavin’s place. Nice soft beds, clean rooms and a good shower. Just what we needed after a long drive!

2024-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Very cozy place, super nice hosts.
Check out is at 11am, but I had an appointment and asked if I could leave my dogs in their crates at the house until a bit after 11, and it was not an issue at all.
The large fenced backyard was also great for the dogs.
The bed was extremely comfortable. I rarely sleep through the whole night when I’m at a new place, but there I slept like a baby lol"
2024-05-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Close to 95 which was nice. The yard was really big and fenced which was good because I had my dog with me. Comfortable stay
2024-05-01,4,Stayed one night,The price was right as we just used it for a stopover to sleep on our travels. It was nice enough for that and we had no complaints. It is an older house that likely was a fixer upper but you can see work was put into it to make it comfortable
2024-05-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Perfect location! Loved the large fenced in yard for our dog!
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Cute and cozy lil place with a lovely backyard
2024-04-01,3,Stayed a few nights," A very comfortable Queen bed for our Fri-Sun  stay.  Leslie's  prompt messaging was impressive, esp. learning of family funeral Sat.
So, didnt  alert him of other concerns- none he could resolve then,anyway.
As Airbnb hosts & as guests ourselves, below reflects OUR  PREFERENCES for guests' ease/comfort. Most future guests may find L's house meets their needs.Others may benefit from our notes BELOW:
No guest guide for suggestions, 'where stuff is', POI, use of roku/appliances.   
the  2023  reviews  re: unfinished queen room/full bath still unresolved. A work-in-progess, as is the pleated plastic ill sliding door to bedr; +both toilet seats wobble.
a syrupy overpowering  scent.  Found/removed plug-ins in each room, opened doors;still evident when we left 
 
Old clumped leaves/oak 'worms' covered deck/furniture, despite brisk winds.
L-room lacks lamps  at either end of either of the two sofas. Only overhead-same w/ kitchen/dining table.Soft lighting more inviting!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,Great place to stay! Thank you!
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Right off I-95, close to a Sheetz, and located in a decent neighborhood."
2024-04-01,4,Group trip,Leslie is an extremely wonderful host.
2024-04-01,4,Stayed with a pet,the airbnb was clean and spacious

2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,We travelled from Rochester NY to Myrtle Beach and chose here to stay on way down instead of a hotel. It’s was perfect for our family. We have three young kids and the huge fenced in backyard was a hit! After 9.5 hours in the car- they got to run around and we got to sit on the deck and relax. My 2.5 year old loved the little tent and blocks in the children’s room. We very much appreciated the coffee and waters.
2024-03-01,4,Stayed with a pet,Great for a quick stay.
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Very cozy, cute, and clean. We had everything we needed, and the beds were very comfortable. The home was in a nice and quiet neighborhood. Thank you for everything, Leslie!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Very comfy! Had a vintage taste to the style and layout of the place, definitely worth the buck."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,The house had everything we needed for a one night stay on our way through town. Very conveniently located and a HUGE yard my dogs loved. Leslie was very helpful and I would definitely stay again!
2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"Nice quaint home located within Roanoke Rapids. Quiet and peaceful surroundings and enjoyed sitting next to the fire pit while taking in nature and the stars. Clean and pleasant interior with SmartTVs in each room that allows syncing with your own personal entertainment streaming apps. Access and checkin was a breeze, as well as checkouts. Will return again as it feels like my home away from home!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Suited me and my crew very well. We would definitely stay here again!
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Nice little home prior reviews were accurate

2024-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"Leslie’s place was well-located, comfy, quiet, and clean, and she was an excellent communicator. I would stay again!"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Great place to stay. Nice neighborhood and easy to find. Bed was super comfortable.
2024-01-01,4,Stayed with a pet,"Good value however the house needs some TLC. The leaves in the back yard should have been raked-up, mainly for the dogs. Very clean and well stocked. We liked it enough to stay again on our return trip but could not as it was taken for the dates we needed."
2024-01-01,5,Stayed one night,Great place to stay. I wouldn’t hesitate to stay here again.
2024-01-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Cute place. Nicely decorated. Back yard was great for our traveling Goldens.
2024-01-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We stayed at Leslie's home for the second time, and she has made many improvements to the property since our last stay. It's nice when hosts take recommendations to heart and strive to improve. The home was clean, beds comfortable, and big backyard for dogs was awesome. We will be back!"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Clean and nice stay
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Was very nice and would definitely stay there again. Nice we could bring dogs with fenced in yard for them to play in!
2023-12-01,4,Stayed with a pet,We stopped for the night in Roanoke Falls on our trip from Florida to NJ and the place was as advertised and what we needed. We arrived pretty late so didn’t have a chance to check out the neighborhood but it was a quiet block and we all got a good nights sleep. Leslie and Brian were very responsive and helpful before and during our stay.
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Comfortable home closely located to the 95 corridor, making it a useful location to stop on our drive from Florida to New Jersey. Quaint and homey, with a large backyard!"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"easy in easy out...2 miles from rt 95
Gas,food...and Starbucks all easy to reach"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Perfect place to stay close to I95. Leslie was an excellent host.
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Our stay was a last minute plan and Leslie was great! Unfortunately we had to travel with our dogs and she had no problem with it. She was a pleasure to deal with, very responsive and stayed in touch, made sure we arrived safely. We didn't have any issues with our stay, there was soda, coffee and water for us and the place was beautifully decorated for Christmas, it was a very nice touch. Also, very important, the bed was so comfortable, we slept so good while there.
Thank you Leslie and Brian, we really enjoyed our stay."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"My husband and I definitely appreciate the hospitality of our stay! Leslie was very responsive and accommodating. We checked in pretty late in the evening; it was very dark and rainy. The host stayed in great communication throughout our stay. We were very happy to find the place easily, and the place was well lit, so it made it very visible. The place felt like home and even decorated for the holidays. We definitely appreciate we were allowed to have our family dogs there, especially having a large fenced-in yard for them to be in. We would love to stay here again!"
2023-12-01,4,Stayed with a pet,"The house is in a quiet and safe-feeling neighborhood. There is a large fenced-in backyard that would be great if you're traveling with dogs. You can tell that a lot of work was put into this house, but like other reviewers have said it feels a little unfinished. Especially the back bedroom. For example, the paint job is really splotchy and there is no baseboard / floor moulding so you can see the space between the wall and the floor. There were a few other minor things like that. Those things aside, the hosts did a great job decorating and the bed was comfy and clean. A tip for the door lock keypad: First press the bottom right area where the # sign is and the keypad will light up. then type in your code and press # again."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,Leslie's place was exactly what we were looking for. We decided to try an Airbnb this year to break up a long road trip vice getting a hotel for one night for a family of five. Leslie's place had plenty of room and the kids enjoyed having different bedrooms. Recommend to anyone looking for something different and we will probably be back.
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"The house was super comfortable, and the fenced in back yard allowed our dogs to get out the pent-up energy from being in the car for a long trip! Leslie was extremely accommodating, accepting our last-minute reservation request and having the house thoroughly cleaned within only a couple hours, the evening before Thanksgiving, for our arrival. Definitely recommend!"
2023-11-01,4,Stayed one night,"Leslie's place was just what we needed for the night. We arrived late, and left early. It was raining heavy throughout the drive down, and when we arrived, and there was ponding on the front lawn, but this would not be a problem if not for the unusually heavy amount of rain. The beds were comfortable, and the fenced in backyard was huge and much appreciated. We would stay here again."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed one night,Great place to stay easy.
2023-11-01,3,Stayed one night,"Positives: Hosts responsive. Comfortable beds. Strong shower head. Easy to find. Quiet neighborhood.
Room for growth: Feels like full bath and back bedroom are partway through being remodeled. Keyless lock has a delay after each number is pressed making getting in a bit of a challenge but not impossible.
ALSO, and I hesitate to put this because it could happen to any of us and hopefully will be quickly resolved, there was a very active and very loud critter in the walls and ceiling of the home that woke us up early in the morning. I’m hoping Leslie and Brian will be able to resolve that soon.
Overall, we’re grateful this property is available for the area!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Perfect place for us to stop with our two dogs on the way home from Florida. Great yard, clean, and quiet. We did not have time to explore the area."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Had a great time at this location. A lot to do and see around the area. The host was great and responsive.
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,We loved the place. Exactly as described and great for my dogs as well. We are actually going to stay there again on our way back north in a few weeks. Definitely recommend.
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Jessica and David built a beautiful cabin for their guests with such excellent attentions to details including pet friendly amenities. Do yourself a favor and stay at the cabin over staying at a hotel. You will be delighted with fireflies in the woods and beautiful nesting birds on the porch. This is the ultimate in cabin life for a guest with pets.
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Congrats to Jessica and David for a fabulous place. My family and I were passing through, and the entire experience was perfect for our needs."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place.
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,We came back after our first stay two years ago. Very much enjoy this cabin.
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,We were so pleased with our stay we wished we would have booked another night! Our favorite part of the cabin was the outdoor space. The back porch is adorable and there is a TON of green space in the back. It was more than we were anticipating! Also the kitchen counters were beautiful and everything was clean when we arrived. Will be coming back one day if we are ever in Virginia again🙏🏼
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Jessica and David were great hosts! When I mentioned I would be checking in late at night, they were kind enough to stop in to turn the lights on for me. I also loved that they not only allowed dogs, but made them feel wanted with the extra touches such as dog snacks."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This was the perfect place to stay after driving for 10 hours with 3 dogs. It was peaceful, private and clean. The dogs were able to run around and explore without us having to worry that they were going to bother anybody. The house was rustic but was modern and tastefully decorated. I would highly recommend for anyone who is looking to get away from the hustle and bustle especially if you are travelling with four-legged family members!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,Beautiful place with quiet surroundings!! An amazing getaway to get away from it all. Second time staying here and will not be our last!
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"great place to stay, thanks"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Very quiet & peaceful. Had problem with very low water pressure in kitchen. But shower water pressure was good. Hosts were very responsive and dropped off a new shower curtain.
2024-05-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Dav8d and Jessica's place is the perfect spot for our stays in Courtland
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,This was my second time staying at the cabin and it was as wonderful as the first! The cabin is a perfect peaceful getaway.

2024-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We had a great stay at the cabin. We only stayed for one night on our way back north but it was perfect spot to stop for the night. We had our dog so it nice to have the yard to walk around in. The cabin is very secluded, quiet but yet convenient."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,We only stayed for one night but it was worth it! We felt really comfortable and happy we found this place. Everything was clean and organized. We would definitely come back again.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Beautiful rustic cabin. We only stayed a night but I would have loved to stay longer. It was so peaceful, you could hear the wind coming through the trees. We weren’t able to use the fire pit but would have enjoyed it. We had our dogs with us and they loved it too. Huge back yard and front yard. It is very secluded so if you’re looking for a not creepy cabin in the woods then this is your place. Well worth the money. They had great amenities and the inside is begged than expected. ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This cabin is so great, clean, cozy, perfect private area, and close to I 95. We wish we were able to stay longer and enjoy more time here. We would definitely stay again. Great hosts!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,The cabin is well equipped with a full kitchen & spacious bathroom with a large tub & shower. Amazing use of space for the square footage. The beds are comfortable & the coffee bar is a nice touch! The fire pit area is a cozy spot to enjoy the property especially overlooking a beautiful church on the neighboring property. Check-in and check-out is self sufficient & driveway can fit more than 1 car. Beautifully decorated cabin a few miles off of I-95 is convenient & perfect for peaceful rest! Thank you for a wonderful stay.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Quiet, comfortable and private place just a few minutes off I95. Great if you’re traveling with dogs."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,We will be back. So peaceful
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Good price for a good location and clean apartment
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,We had a great stay in the cabin! We were traveling through and this was the perfect stop with our puppy.
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This place is lovely! Quiet, serene, and comfortable."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"As others stated the property is about 15min from stores & such so you may want to stop before arriving. The place was super cute with all the right touches of games, movies, outdoor seating, etc. The water pressure is low but to be expected with well water & couldn't figure out the hot water on the kitchen sink even though I let it run on cold (sign says cold is hot) for about 5min & even tried switching it to hot for a little bit with no luck but the bathroom had hot water so I'm not sure what the issue was. Other than the minor hiccup the place was great & would definitely visit again."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"Jessica and David’s place was great! The cabin is in a quiet, peaceful spot and is decorated beautifully. It has all the listed amenities and more! We were very comfortable there."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,This stop was the perfect stop over off 95. It’s such a cute cabin and set up is very kid friendly. There were tons of games as well. I will definitely be using this stop again! Awesome place!
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Second place we have stayed at of Jessica and David’s and loved it just like first time always perfect matches description and very responsive, will definitely be back."

2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great stay
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Perfect getaway spot for a weekend. Secluded, private and everything you need to have a fun time. Great spot for a fire. The back porch has a nice bench swing to relax on in the evening. They had horseshoes, cornhole boards and board games. I’ll definitely be going back."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Far am away the best B&B my wife and I have stayed at. No place will give you as much value as this serene cabin, placed quaintly in woods of Virginia.
Check in was completely flexible, communication was very clear and punctual, and all the amenities were amazing. There’s plenty of hot water to be able to actually draw yourself a bath, heaters galore in each of the room, and they were Vene thoughtful enough to turn on the lights for us when we let them know we’d be checking in late.
We stayed cozy through our trip, and let our pups roam the yard. There’s lots of space and plenty to keep yourselves entertained, and lots of incentive to relax and unwind.
My only complaint is that I could t stay longer!
10/10 recommend and I would absolutely go back!"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Great stay.
2024-02-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Another great repeat stay for us. Glad it was available for our visit to the area. Thank you for being excellent hosts. We hope to try out your new place next visit.

2024-02-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Jessica and Dave's cabin was a great stop for us and our dogs on our trip south. Clean, spacious, nicely equipped kitchen, although we didn't get to make use of it. Favorite was coffee bar, everything in one place for an easy cup of coffee. Our little chihuahua is sometimes a little loud, so this was a great place for us! We will definitely stay here again on our migration south. Thanks again Jessica and Dave."
2024-01-01,5,Stayed about a week,Extremely peaceful location. Enjoyed the time there.

2023-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Jessica and David were responsive hosts and their cabin was a perfect stop on our road trip! Conveniently tucked right off I-95, their cabin provided warmth and comfort for us and our fur babies after a very long day of traveling. Clear instructions, easy to find, clean space, matches pictures/description, responsive hosts - what more could you ask for? We'd absolutely stay again, especially in warmer months to enjoy the incredible outdoor areas too!"
2023-12-01,4,Stayed with a pet,"Wonderful little gem, clean and comfortable! Very private and peaceful."

2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Donna and I simply wanted a place that we could rest at and be at peace. Didn't want to be around a lot of people. Just wanted to get away from the hustle and bustle of our busy lives and rest. And Harrell's Cabin was just what the doctor ordered. Perfectly what we wanted. It is nicely arranged and and cozy.
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Great place to stay/ private, would be awesome for a gathering/ I would def stay again & 100% recommend it to anyone traveling throughout"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,We appreciated the warm welcome and lovely surroundings.
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Wonderful stay. Easy in and easy out. We had dogs and there was plenty of grass and plenty of room inside for multiple crates with plenty of room for them to not be in the way. Thank you for your hospitality. We will be using you at least yearly for the dog show in South Hampton.
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Jessica and David’s place was a great place for us to stop and stay for the night with our fur babies on our drive back home from FL. The place was very nice and quaint with peaceful surroundings and only couple miles from hwy 95 which worked out really well for us. Would definitely book again.
2023-11-01,5,Stayed one night,Our second visit to this cute cabin. Just right for peaceful privacy and a lovely fire in the fire pit! We'll be back! :)
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,We loved our stay at this cabin and plan to come back soon!! Very peaceful & beautiful!
2023-11-01,4,Stayed with a pet,"My husband and I loved the area of the cabin. It was quiet and beautiful. We also thoroughly enjoyed the cabin itself. It’s so nicely decorated and is stocked with games and movies and cute little touches that made the stay better (such as the coffee bar). There were a couple things we would have changed though. The floors and refrigerator were dirty upon arrival. The Wi-Fi also didn’t work very well, so if you are hoping to watch Netflix you’ll be out of luck. Overall, we had a great stay and I’m glad we went!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,"I booked this for my friend and her kids. They loved it! There was popcorn, stuff for s’mores, coffee, etc. all there when they got there. They also loved being outside in the swing and by the fire pit!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I booked Harrell’s cabin for a mom-cation. I wanted to be in the woods, with a swing & my books. This was the perfect location. I will be coming back for another mom-cation!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This was a great place to rest our heads during our honeymoon roadtrip to Maine. It was peaceful and private, which our puppy dogs loved. It is conveniently located close to I-95, making it easy to get back on the road. Would definitely book here again in the future!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Great place for a stop while traveling south!
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Very cozy cabin, our dogs loved the backyard"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Jessica & David’s Airbnb was the PERFECT overnight stop for my spouse and our 3 large dogs. We loved waking up to the beautiful, fall-covered, short drive back to the highway the next morning. We are putting this on our list for anytime we’re driving up/down 95. The dogs had space to run around outside and get some exercise, and the cabin was so well designed and decorated for a peaceful night to wind down after a long day. Thanks, guys! You really have a hidden gem, here!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Loved it ! Had the best little getaway .
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with a pet,We used this spot for splitting up our drive up north and the same for coming back down south. It was nice! Better than a hotel. It was peaceful and was just perfect for a quick overnight stay.
2023-10-01,2,Stayed one night,Jessica and David’s place was very stylish. Loved the look. Unfortunately there was pet hair covering the couch and human hair and fluid stains found on the beds.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This was our second time staying at this property and we absolutely love it! So quiet and peaceful, highly recommend the porch swing out back. Our dogs loved all the space to run around. Perfect size space for a couple and some pups. Very comfortable bed and all the amenities you could need."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,We really enjoyed our night there!!! It was quiet and out of the way. loved the swing on the back porch with we had booked another night just so we could nap on it.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at Harrell’s cabin. We live at the beach and went for some much needed quiet time in the country. The location is private, very little traffic, yet only a few minutes drive to town. We didn’t need any assistance during our stay, but the hosts are right up the road. The bed was very comfortable. Great fire pit which we used every night. Beautifully decorated for the season. The outdoor lights on the back porch and around the fire pit allow you to enjoy the outdoors into the night. Nice bed swing on the back porch. Variety of coffees and teas available. Very pet friendly with bowls and toys available. Our dog enjoyed her stay as well with plenty of room to run and play. We will stay again in the future. Thank you for your hospitality!"
2023-10-01,4,Stayed with a pet,I came into town for a wedding and stayed at the cabin for a nice little weekend getaway. It’s bare bones but very pet friendly!
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Jessica and David’s cabin was just lovely. Very private which I appreciated, seamless checkin and the bathroom tub is glorious! I also had a minor wifi issue (literally just needed to unplug and plug but I’m not tech savvy and was attempting on the incorrect device). And Jess and David were super response in spite of the fact that it was late at night. The bed was very comfortable which is always worth noting in my book. There’s not much around closeby but I was just looking for a quiet private space and drove about 30-45 minutes to find some light hiking trails so it worked great for me. Would recommend!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"I was very pleased with everything. I just wish the lights around fire pit had a drop cord and switch to utilize our last night. Would have enjoyed a lot more. Also heater on left at back door would not light or work , no gas in tank . 🤷🏼‍♀️ only down fall. But was space heater to accommodate somewhat. Would definitely stay again."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,The “cabin” is adorable! It is huge and beautifully decorated. We loved the fall touches found everywhere. Great stay. Only downside to no fault of theirs is it is a travel for food etc. easily solved by planning ahead.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Loved our quiet break from everything.

2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"2nd time here, love the place"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with a pet,great place to stay for a nice quiet getaway.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Harrell’s Cabin was a great stop on our way down south. The house was extremely clean. Jessica and David‘s description of the property was very accurate. It’s a very nice, cozy, quiet, space, priced more than reasonably, and we look forward to using it again."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with a pet,had a great stay!
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with a pet,The house is an old country store? Converted into a spacious home. Very clean and open concept. Lots of activities like games and movies and a fire pit. Very private and peaceful.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"I can’t say enough good things about this charming cabin cottage. Don’t hesitate to book it! We were driving from south Florida to NWPA and booked it very last minute with our dogs, because we were initially just going to stay at a hotel overnight, but after 12 hours in the car, we wanted our dogs to be able to stretch their legs and run a bit off lead. This home was perfect! The back porch was so charming and the swing was comfy. I only wish we could’ve stayed longer.
We got in at 8pm and left by 6am, but the dogs had a blast doing zoomies in the sizable living space and outside, before going to bed. When I had a question, I felt bad texting after 8pm, but they got back to me right away without hesitation. If I’m ever in that part of Virginia for a couple of days, I hope to stay there again. It’s simply lovely. Thank you for letting us stay!"

2023-08-01,4,Stayed with a pet,"This was a great stopping place on our trip north- way better than a hotel! Owners were extremely quick to respond when we had a question! The cabin was clean, quiet (loved the crickets at night) and so easy to get to from 95. Bring groceries/meals as there are no quick markets nearby, owners suggested stopping in Roanoke Rapids which worked for us. The inside is exactly as pictured, kitchen is well equipped, beds are comfy with lots of pillows available. The yard is huge and great for dogs. We would definitely stay again on our travels!"

2023-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Had a quick stay at The Cabin on a long road trip with my cat. We were both so thrilled with the space, and the beautiful surroundings. It was a much needed respite after a long day on the road. The baby birds nesting, and being fed by their parents, on the front porch were an amazing, and lucky, addition. Wish we could have stayed longer."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,It was great! We really liked the place. It's great for kids.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The place was very special. The dogs loved running around outside, and the we loved the comfy beds, high quality and tasteful decor, and the feeling of spaciousness.

2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Easy location right off of I-95 and perfect for a halfway resting point for our family.

2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,Great little house in the middle of nowhere with a great property to relax for a few days.
2023-07-01,4,Stayed with kids,"Great place for your family and dog. The accommodations were remodeled nicely however the premises is in serious need of a deep clean, take your finger and wipe across the top of the refrigerator and you’ll see what I mean.
The floor is in need of a serious deep clean as well.
They have all the accommodations for a five-star locale but the grime just needs to be dealt with.
.
One last thing that Might be disgusting is the request that when you leave to put the garbage in the garbage pail, no problem, but when I opened the garbage pail there were other bags of garbage there it smelled of maggots and seemed as though the garbage hadn’t been removed in weeks.
Other than that, we like the place. Jessica and David were very helpful being available for questions."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Wow I wish we could of stayed longer! This cabin was so beautiful and peaceful. The dogs loved running around the huge property exploring! The cabin was clean and had everything we could of needed! Will definitely be back and stay for longer. Thank you for having us!

2023-05-01,5,Stayed with a pet,What a beautiful little cabin!! Hubby and I were traveling through and arrived at night but we wished we could’ve been there earlier to enjoy all the amenities! Will definitely book that location again next time we’re in Jarratt!

2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Place was very cute, relaxing and comfortable. Just a few minutes off of I95, but would never know it. Could count on one hand the number of cars that went by each day.

2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Wonderful get away from a big city. Nice in quiet in a beautiful cabin. Family friendly. Internet and phone sketchy and spotty, but I found that a blessing to get away from the phone for a bit. Great stay. Must visit."

2023-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This was our second stay at the cabin. We enjoyed it thoroughly, and once again found it comfortable, clean, and relaxing. A lovely location with everything you need to escape D.C., Richmond, Baltimore, or whichever big city you're coming from."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Jessica and David were extremely responsive and friendly. We felt well taken care of and the place was beautiful.

Would definitely stay again!"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"An absolute ""hidden peace of beauty."" Harrells cabin was so cozy, peaceful, and inviting. We only stayed one night but plan to make another visit. Everything about the house and hosts was perfect!!"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,This is our third time staying overnight at Harrell’s Cabin on our way to and from Florida. What makes this cabin special is its private location and its comfort. The land surrounding the cabin is ideal for walking our two dogs. The cabin is a great place to relax after a long drive. It has all amenities you’d need for an extensive stay. Jessica and David are accessible and responsive.
2023-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Thanks again.
2023-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Beautifully designed space, made you feel right at home. When we walked in it was nice and warm which only added to home like feeling. Beds were comfortable, we slept like babies. Bathroom was beautiful. We didn’t get to try the tub, but the shower was enjoyable; however, my personal preference would be slightly better shower pressure. Absolutely loved the porch swing, probably my favorite feature next to the large outdoor fire pit. Wood is graciously provided, but be sure to grab the other necessities. We had an absolutely amazing time, only complaint is we didn’t get to stay longer."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"I absolutely loved the aesthetic of this cabin. Quiet surroundings, private outdoor common areas, several outdoor “chilling” options. We especially loved the porch hung bench… we sat on that thing until 3am and just swayed with the wind. I really appreciated the hosts quick responses also!"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Very nice cabin, well equipped, lots of space outside, no neighbours close by. Just as described but better than expected. Can’t wait to go back."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Their restoration of the cabin was fantastic, and the property around it beautiful.

Lots of games, amenities, decent internet, giant swing, fire pit and Edison lights made for a great atmosphere."

2023-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Very peaceful cabin! The dogs had so much fun playing in the yard. Quiet and relaxing. We messaged david saying we were going to get there late due to getting stuck working late/traffic and he went to the cabin and turned lights on for our late arrival! We enjoyed this beautiful cabin very much.
2023-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Great place, loved it"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,If you want to recharge your soul this is the place to do it. The silence on this country road is healing. I loved driving by the cows & fields on the way in & looking at the stars at night. The cabin is gorgeous and pristine which is an added bonus.
2023-03-01,5,Stayed one night,The tub and big shower with bench were amazing to relax in!! It was so peaceful at their cabin!!
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Always amazing!
2023-02-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We (2 adults and 3 dogs) spent a night en route a long distance move. The place is super clean and welcoming. We got there bit before 3 pm, but Jessica and David were very kind to let us check in early. It was raining and cold when we stayed so we weren’t able to enjoy the outdoors too much, but we saw a deer while walking our pups. The area is very quiet, beautiful, and peaceful. I can’t wait to come back for a longer stay!!"

Overall had a nice stay."
2023-01-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We absolutely loved the Cabin! It was so relaxing, we felt right at home. The cabin was so open and airy.
We loved the yard too! There was so much room for our dogs to run and the road is quiet with not much traffic.
We can’t wait to come back again when it is warmer to enjoy the back porch!
We were so relaxed when we left. It truly is a special little gem.😃"
2023-01-01,5,Stayed one night,My wife and I loved the place! We will be back!

There is SOOO MUCH PEACE AND QUIET YOU NEVER KNEW EXISTED HERE AT HARRELLS CABIN!!! I went for the tub and NOTHING AT THIS LOCATION let me down!!!

2023-01-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Feels peaceful and serene. Very cozy vibes. Love the outdoor covered porch and snuggled in the swing with my guitar for a couple hours/ perfect weather for the cabin!
I’ve stayed a few times. Perfect for my southbound travels just off I95 in VA. Next time maybe I’ll light up the fire pit…. My traveling Animals LOVE this place."

2022-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,This was a beautiful place to visit. We had so much fun. Would love to return when it’s warmer
2022-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Thanks for hosting us! Pros were comfy beds, great kitchen and bathroom, and place all to ourselves. Cons were bed sheets had not been washed, we arrived at night so there were a lot of dark roads when getting to the airbnb, it’s located not too far from a jail, and broken blinds did not allow for privacy."
2022-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"My stay was great, place was clean, dog friendly and quaint. I did not have time to enjoy the fire pit but it looked very relaxing.
A little further out from the interstate than I expected, but that added to the charm.
Restaurant or stores are not very close, which also added to the adventure.
Wish I had more time, great stay and my dogs loved it."
2022-12-01,3,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful, calm, quiet. Fire pit was wonderful. Warm bathroom was amazing in the cold weather. It wasn’t nearly as clean as we expected, and the cabin didn’t keep much heat inside, but the location made it very much worth it. Owners responded quickly and were very polite. Definitely want to come back in warmer weather."
2022-12-01,5,Stayed one night,So cute and fun!
2022-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Cabin and location were just what we wanted. Peaceful location and plenty of yard space for the dogs to run around. The Christmas decorations were an added bonus.

2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Such a beautiful spot! The outside swing was my favorite!! Nice place to take a nap. Tub was amazing, the trick to the tub turn the shower on as well. Wish we could have stayed longer! Definitely be back!"
2022-11-01,5,Stayed one night,Great as always!
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,loved everything loved the campfire and swing! wished we had more time
2022-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Jessica and David's place is a hidden gem. We arrived at night, so it was dark as we drove off 95 toward's their cabin. When we woke up we found it quiet and tucked away near the local church. There wasn't any neighbors within view so we had our privacy. Our pup (which Jessica and David allowed) had a fun sniffari in the backyard. The cabin is great for a family with two huge beds side by side and a large open area to lounge around in and chat. We would stop and stay here again if the need arose."
