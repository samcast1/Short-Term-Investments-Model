2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Everything was great from how to check-in to checking in on us to making sure everything was good. Daniel made bread and it was delicious.

2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Staying at Dans place was perfect. He gave clear instructions and plenty of suggestions for activities. The fresh Rosemary sourdough loaf was delicious and. Wry thoughtful. We also got to try his sourdough pizza at Pioneer Park, highly recommend trying it. WE will I’ll definitely tell our friends to stay there! Can’t say enough about the quality of stay and great nights rest to rejuvenate us daily for long hours of touristing."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,If I could give more than 5 stars I would…we thought this was a once in a lifetime trip… next time (lol) we’ll skip the resort/cruise part and spend a lot more time with this as our “home base”. Thank you for your hospitality !! And the bread is excellent!!
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great host, great person. Cannot speak highly enough of the service and quality. A bit out of town which we were looking for. Recommend to everyone. Thanks Daniel for the sourdough as well"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Daniel's place was comfortable, clean and had great views off the back deck. The apartment was well stocked with everything you could need including groceries for our breakfast!! Daniel was an amazing host treating us to his freshly baked bread and sharing spot-on recommendations for things to do in Fairbanks. He definitely went above and beyond. We would definitely love to stay here again if we make it back to Fairbanks!"

Alaska"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed over a week,"Me and my new wife decided on a 12 day honeymoon to Alaska- she was responsible for planning the wedding; I planned the honeymoon. After looking through reviews and comparing prices I decided on Daniels Airbnb. We arrived around 1:30am exhausted from the flight- clear instructions to get in no hassle. Place was clean and looked exactly as shown, nothing super fancy, but all we needed while we were there. Dans place provided us a central location to tour Fairbanks, get to Chena Hot Springs for a days fun, travel to Denali park for a hike, and go for a flight tour in Talkeetna. Believe me we got the entire Alaska experience and never had to travel more than 3 1/2 hours from Fairbanks. We even got to see the Aurora from Chena Lakes- about a 35 minute drive! It was visible from Dans place too but the city lights from Fairbanks hinder the view in April- late in the Aurora season. Dan provided us 3 loaves of his homemade bread for free and was always very friendly!Would 100% stay here again!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed about a week,Staying at Dan’s place was fantastically. The extra amenities were so thoughtful and appreciated. Dan was very helpful and friendly. A really great place to stay. I will definitely recommend it to anyone going to Fairbanks!!!!
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Such an incredible time! Dan made us feel right at home and greeted us with a loaf of his personal sourdough bread (Absolutely Divine!). The bread was so good, I even bought a loaf to go. The view was spectacular giving us plenty of windows to try and view the aurora lights. We were able to get some beautiful pictures of the lights over Dans house and off the balcony. If you have ever dreamed of seeing the northern lights, Dan place is worth every penny. It was such peaceful getaway with a generous amount of amenities. Fairbanks was a blast and had a variety of options of things to do ranging from free to very affordable. I would highly recommend Dans place for an experience of a life time."

2023-08-01,5,Stayed over a week,"I have visited Dan's Airbnb several times. I am always impressed with Dan's friendliness and his attention to details in preparation for my arrival. The scenery is outstanding and the location is excellent. The location is in the mountains; but, you are also within minutes of downtown Fairbanks and any items you might need. While I was there, I visited Chena Hot Springs, the Denali National Park, North Pole, Golden Heart Plaza, and many other noteworthy locations. I even saw 2 moose within 3 hours one day. You will be very glad that you chose Sourdough Dan's Airbnb for your visit to Fairbanks! I plan to return."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What an awesome place! The location is close to town but feels very remote. The view from the private porch is awesome and the house is immaculate.

2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Top to bottom, our experience with Dan was absolutely amazing! if we could give him more than 5 stars, we would. From the beginning he made life easier for us. For instance, our flight arrived very late, but Dan had a fully stocked fridge waiting for us when we got to Fairbanks. He even texted us to welcome us to his place! The next morning, he met us as we were getting ready to leave for Denali. We had a great chat and he offered to make us a loaf of bread. While driving he reached out to Dan for evening dinner recommendations and questions about the solstice celebration. He texted a few ideas, but then called to share more recommendations. To say that Dan was superior is an understatement. He is truly fantastic. If you are ever in Fairbanks, you must stay with Dan."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The most outstanding place I have stayed in my Airbnb experiences. The space was very quiet spotless and plenty of space. Dan was proactive and took care of any needs. Truly a first class experience from a first class person. The Jalapeno Sourdough bread was delicious.

As we arrived late at the property on the day of arrival, we were very happy that Daniel had provided with a well-stocked fridge. We were also well supplied with coffee, tea and pancakes for breakfast, among other things. Daniel has been really very attentive, surprised us with his homemade bread, gave us tips for excursions in the area, and questions were always answered within a very short time. If we travel to Fairbanks again, we would book his place again."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed about a week,"I LOVED staying at Dan’s place. His apartment is beautifully furnished and has lots of windows. Dan included lots of staples in his kitchen that were really appreciated. —and the sourdough bread he makes was amazing. The bed was super comfortable and he had lots of different thicknesses of pillows which is always a plus. Nice hot shower.
Dan recommended a lot of places and things to do in Fairbanks including The Crepery. Awesome breakfast crepes and good coffee. He knows a lot about Alaska and even drove me over to see the Pipeline, something I hadn’t planned on doing but was very glad I did.
I got to see the aurora on Wednesday and Thursday night. Dan’s place is perfect for aurora sightings and it was something I’ll never forget.
Thanks for a great stay Dan. Hope I get to come back.

2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We loved our stay with Sourdough Dan! It was pretty close to everything and remote enough to be peaceful and see the northern lights at the same time! Dan was a wonderful host - reaching out with checkin instructions the day of, stocking the fridge, and giving local recommendations!"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Wow, what a platinum experience! Host was very responsive on all occassions!
How we were welcomed: A kitchen stocked with coffee, tea, oatmeal, eggs, and waffles- and Dan shared a loaf of his incredible homemade sourdough bread! So nice to be able to get settled in without immediately having to stock up.
Appreciated extras like handwarmers, a handy first aid kit, and tons of extra linens and blankets.
The bathroom was fully stocked with great shower supplies and plenty of towels.
Wonderful coming in several days on to our trip to have a W/D to catch up on laundry, and dry clothes for repacking.
The view from the balcony and windows was magnificent. Beautiful snow covered trees and mountains all the way to the horizon.
The property is about a 5 min drive from town, and located in a quiet neighborhood of hilltop homes. The roads were well maintained and easily navigable.
Got to see the Northern Lights the day we arrived!
By far, the best AirBNB experience ever.
Book here!"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed about a week,We had an amazing stay at sourdough dan‘s place. The location is perfect to get into Fairbanks quickly but not so close that it takes away from the wildlife. There are close by viewing spots for the Aurora and we were able to catch some pretty active shows multiple nights of our stay. Dan was always available for help and we cannot thank him enough for coming over when we had trouble with a frozen door. He was always a call away and willing to give suggestions on how to make the most of our stay. We cant wait to visit again!

The accommodation is very comfortable, clean and well stocked with everything you need, including warm, cozy beds and fresh breakfast Items. Dan’s own sourdough bread is delicious!
Spectacular views and perfectly positioned for Northern Lights viewing. Close to town to eat out but far enough away to get away from the ‘busy’ downtown feel.
Dan himself was absolutely ready and willing to go way above and beyond for us when we locked ourselves out in the freezing cold late night hours!"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The place was cozy and convenient. The stocked kitchen including Dan's delicious bread saved us from having to spend money on breakfast. The location is close to town yet far enough away that we saw the Aurora from the balcony. All the views from the windows were amazing as well. It was nice having a bathroom and shower indoors. Coming from Texas, I know we couldn't have survived in -28 degree temps using an outhouse. The 2nd bedroom which connects to the main bedroom has a single bed with a trundle bed underneath. Would be a great room for kids. The bathroom was also stocked with toiletries. Overall well worth the memories we created. Thanks for sharing your place with us Dan!"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What a fantastic stay! Dan is beyond accommodating and the apartment was great! Ideal place to stay during your adventure in Fairbanks.

He was extremely responsive to our questions, had great restaurant suggestions and his place was such a beautiful location for our first visit to the area. The view across the valley is good for your soul. His bread is amazing and we enjoyed several grilled cheese sandwiches during the week based on his suggestion. The kitchen is well stocked, better than most places we've stayed. We had 10 inches of snow the day before we left and he assured me he would help us get out, which he did. He plowed the street and cleared the walkway for us. Great service, great host, great vacation."
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Sourdough dans apt was super quaint. Everything was really clean and organized, Dan himself was very nice and helpful. The windows all pointed to the sky making it really easy to see the northern lights. I absolutely loved my stay here."

This is definitely a good place to stay, well worth the price."

2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Dan is a literal angel. He made our stay one to remember by going above & beyond for us. I will only ever book with him when in Alaska.
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great place to stay the night...or the week, on this amazing spot. close to the city but far enough to let you see the sky without many surrounding artificial lights. Daniel is a great host, very responsive to any of your questions or concerns, friendly and awesome baker, try his sourdough bread!"
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Daniel’s apartment in Fairbanks was the perfect cozy getaway that we needed on our trip to Alaska during the freezing cold! The apartment is a perfect fit for three people, with all the amenities in great condition.

My husband and I work on the North Slope of AK and traveled to Fairbanks for some much needed R&R. Upon arrival , we were met with delicious fresh sourdough bread made by the host! The bed was so comfortable, the place was clean, and our stay was so lovely!
Daniel gave amazing recommendations for things to do and places to eat around Fairbanks.
His kindness was above and beyond.
We’d happily return and stay any time we’re in the area."
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Dan's apartment is perfect for viewing the Northern Lights. There is a full wall of northwest facing windows, so you can turn out all the lights, and just watch for the Aurora Borealis.
The apartment is exactly as described. It is VERY well stocked with everything you need to cook. And, if you are smart enough to arrive on a Sunday or a Thursday, Dan will give you a loaf of fresh baked sourdough bread. If you are from Alaska, then you are likely already familiar with Sourdough Dan's bread. They are sold in the Carr's around Alaska.
The one thing that you should know is there are 15 steps up to the apartment, but if you get past this fact, then you will have the best view of the Alaska sky.
You are going to love this place!"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"Dans place is absolutely amazing. We will never stay any other place. If you are looking for a clean, comfortable place to stay this is it. I have never met someone more accommodating and considerate."
2022-10-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Dan is an amazing host, he gave great suggestions. This place was great and I would stay again."
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Daniel’s place was amazing. It’s on the first floor, is super clean and is a perfect place to stay if your main goal for visiting Fairbanks is to view the northern lights. We were able to see the lights all 3 nights we stayed there (from the balcony as well as from the bedroom window)!
The place looks exactly like the pictures and Dan gave us a few recommendations for restaurants and places to go which were great! Dan’s sourdough bread was also awesome! I would highly recommend this apartment!"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is a great place. It was very well-equipped. Good attention to detail and user experience were evident in a number of thoughtful touches, including well-placed instructions for nonobvious features and useful safety features and signage. The covered deck had a great view and was even clean enough to go out on without shoes. The host Daniel was very friendly."
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Daniel was fantastic! His place was so cozy and the view was amazing. I had to leave early due to a family emergency but I will definitely be coming back and staying at Daniel’s place!
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Daniel was a great host. We asked him for suggestions on things to do and places to eat. His recomondations were for places we never would have known about unless we were local. The place we stayed was not only beutiful but safe. The apt is on the second floor which makes the views breath taking. Sourdooug Dans place is a place I would definatly stay at again if I have the chance to visit Fairbanks in the future. Close to everything. Best location we could have picked. Thank you!
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Was an absolute great stay! Quiet, peaceful and away from the city, you can really get a good Alaskan feel!"
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Daniel & Nisha were super hosts. From the awesome country setting with a view to the breakfast items in the kitchen so we didn't have to buy breakfast. His sourdough bread was awesome. Easy check in, called me the day before and he gave excellent restaurant choices. This was my first Airbnb rental & he set the bar really high for others to follow."
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We highly recommend Sourdough Dan's apartment! It was comfortable and fully stocked with everything needed for our stay. He even has breakfast food and graciously offered us a loaf of his homemade sourdough bread. It was delicious! Daniel was great at communicating with us and offering suggestions on where to go in Fairbanks. We would definitely return on a future trip to Fairbanks.
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Best Airbnb I stayed in on my 3-week Alaskan trip. Clean, well-stocked kitchen, washer/dryer. Dan was very courteous and responsive. Location is 10 mins from downtown Fairbanks. We saw the northern lights from the porch. Highly recommended."
2022-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Daniel’s place met our expectations in all fields. Comfort, amenities, furnishings, wifi, location, great communication and all for the great price! Fridge was stocked with eggs, fresh bread and great choices of coffee.., on top of varieties of hot teas and oatmeal! Such a cool touch. Highly recommend to anybody planning their trip to Fairbanks. Truly, nothing to complain about!"
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is a great location as a base of operations or just a place to relax and take in the views. The host was ready and willing to take care of any needs that came up. Also, the host was proactive in reaching out to make sure we were set. I have been to many AirBnBs and have not met a more engaged host. I will be back."
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place to relax after long days exploring Alaska during the summer. The place has everything anyone could need and the view is great. Lots of cranes flying over the whole week
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"10/10 would stay here again in a heartbeat. Absolutely beautiful space with a great host! Clean, safe, comfortable, and a great view… everything you could ask for. Thanks for the tea Dan!"
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Dan is a gracious and most generous host. Enjoy his hospitality and your expectations will be exceeded!
2022-07-01,5,Stayed over a week,"Daniel not only has a beautiful Airbnb overlooking the Chena River area, but, he also provides the best fresh-baked sourdough bread. Dan is very courteous and friendly and you immediately feel welcome. You could not ask for a better place to stay; the Airbnb is in a wonderful location in the mountains and is also close to Fairbanks. Surprisingly, you do not have to travel far to find food, fuel, and other necessities."
2022-06-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Dan is a fabulous host. His place is everything he says it is. If he offers you sourdough bread take it its fantastic. He has a lot of info in the place for you and is willing to give you recommendations for attractions and dining. If you need a place to stay in Fairbanks i highly recommend Sourdough Dans Air B&B. Will look to stay there again when traveling back to Fairbanks,."
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I highly recommend this place for your stay in Fairbanks. Dan communicated with me several times before the check in date and gave clear instructions on how to get access to the place. My friend and I stayed 3 nights, would’ve preferred longer but this place gets booked out pretty quickly. Good sized modern kitchen and well equipped with sauces, spices, eggs, waffles, tea, coffee, etc. Large laundry appliances, handy if you need to do a load. As I’m a tea drinker, I was thrilled to see a kettle (most places don’t offer this). Stunning view, I can imagine what it would be like during winter, especially with the northern lights. Loved the garlic sourdough bread, personally made by Dan (thickness of bread was perfect too!) Super nice guy, very approachable. We were sad to leave this lovely place."
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Entire apartment outfitted with everything you would need for a short or long stay. Quiet area but not too far from fairbanks for day trips.
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Very enjoyable place, nice view of the valley. Very clean, put-together, and comfortable. Would definitely recommend!"
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We liked the place a lot. No problems at all, and Dan is a great informative host. Enjoy this listing and Dan's sourdough bread!"
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Comfortable and clean place to hang out in or rest between adventures. Pretty and roomy. His garlic sourdough was delicious. Great communication and easy check in.
2022-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Loved everything about Dan's place! It was perfect for our stay (the kids want to move in now lol)
Dan is an amazing host, very easy to communicate with, and went above and beyond to make sure our stay was perfect."
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We really enjoyed our 2 night stay here. It was such a well stocked place- above and beyond our expectations. The beds were very comfortable. You couldn’t beat the location or the view for our Fairbanks stay. Daniel was an amazing communicator. We would definitely stay here again.
2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Dan was such a great host! He was super communicative and went out of his way to share locations and restaurants. We had almost an hour long conversation to give us ideas on what to do based on our interests. The fridge was stocked with the basics which was amazing and he shared some of his baked sourdough bread which is super delicious— hoping it doesn’t get squished on the way back to Chicago. Not enough words to describe the great experience. Beautiful location and beautiful views. Definitely booking with Dan again if we’re in the area again. 🙂
2022-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Great location to see Aurora, close enough to airport and grocery stores, and remote enough to not get city light influence. Dan also provided supplies like egg, waffle, cereal etc. it is a great value for place like this!"
2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Dan’s place was perfect. It was cozy yet had all the necessities of everyday life. There was small touches that other airbnbs we have been to didn’t. He was a great host with recommendations of where to go and what to see. The porch is perfect for aurora sightings and the windows work to if you don’t want to be in the cold. We truly enjoyed our stay here. We seen the northern lights twice in our 3 night stay. Dan also made us hot and fresh garlic sourdough bread which we had made into grilled cheese and a side for spaghetti. So good! Thanks for everything Dan!
2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Dan's place was incredible! It was super clean and comfortable, and he included nice finishing touches like eggs in the fridge & kitchen essentials for cooking. Communication was easy/clear and he provided excellent recommendations for food & things to do around Fairbanks. Will definitely stay here again!"
2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Dan was the best Airbnb host. He checked in throughout our stay in Fairbanks to make sure we had everything we needed and to provide recommendations. He also provided food for breakfast and some of his amazing sourdough. We came to Fairbanks primarily to see the lights, and being able to see them right from Dan's deck without having to drive somewhere in the early morning was ideal. We will definitely stay with Dan again next time we're in Fairbanks."
2022-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Dan's place was super nice. We were there for 2 nights and enjoyed every moment of it. He left a sourdough bread, lots of eggs and other food for us. He even left a snow sled for my kids to slide in the snow. We really thank him for all that. Specially my kids wanted to stay longer. Initially I thought that place was really remote. But in reality, it's no where near what I was imagining before getting to his place. We felt like home in his house. As a person as well, Dan is super great. If I ever in the Fairbanks are, I will try to stay at his place again if it's available."
2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place!
2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Daniel goes out of way to treat us to his best and he made special garlic sourdough bread that was amazing
2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"If you plan on visiting Fairbanks and surrounding areas, this Airbnb is the one to get! Dan is amazing and truly wants his guests to have the best experience possible. He even gave us some of his homemade sourdough bread, as well as some of the best places to visit while in Fairbanks! Truly the best Airbnb I have stayed in."
2022-02-01,5,Stayed about a week,"If I could give Dan and his apartment 10 stars I would! My husband and I really enjoyed our stay. The apartment is spacious for 2 people, lots of room for luggage. Dan really made sure that we had everything we needed and recommended the greatest places to eat the week we were in Fairbanks. He keeps his apartment very clean and we were extremely comfortable. Honestly, it was hard to leave. The view from his private deck was beautiful. It snowed quite a bit during our stay but Dan kept the driveway plowed for us and even provided a sled so we could have some fun! Thank you again for the delicious homemade bread. Will 100% be booking with Dan again when we come back to Alaska."
2022-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Wow, wow, wow. I don't know what else to say other than that. Dan and his place were both amazing during our five day stay here over Valentine's Day. We lucked out and got to see the Northern Lights from the balcony our first night there. Everything about the place was excellent: the location, remoteness, cleanliness, and ease of access. Dan was super communicative and easy to talk to as well. The one time we mentioned some trouble getting out of the driveway, he took some time off his day off to come and plow for us. I wouldn't hesitate to stay here again and can't recommend the place highly enough."
2022-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Amazing host, great communication. Made for a memorable stay. And the bread was amazing too!
The unit was well equipped with everything you could need while staying. Daniel was very responsive, had great suggestions to help us with the stay.
Thanks for everything again Dan,
My dad and I really appreciated it!"
2022-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Five stars are not enough for the experience you will get staying with Dan. This is by far the best Airbnb I have ever stayed in. From the location to the accommodations to all of the small touches that he adds. Hands-down the best sourdough bread I have ever had. He is so thoughtful and what he provides. I could go on forever. You can see the lights from his living room. All of the recommendations that he gives for places to go and eat are top notch!!! If you have a car and want a spectacular place to see the lights go to Chena Lake recreation area, you won’t be disappointed!"
2022-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Dan’s place was absolutely perfect. It was well stocked, very clean, comfortable, and has everything you need to feel like a mini “home away from home”. It had a beautiful view and dan himself was extremely kind, thoughtful, and made our stay feel warm and comfortable. Highly suggest staying here!!"
2022-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This Airbnb is INCREDIBLE. Everything you can think of and more to stay during an Alaskan winter. Can’t recommend this place enough!
2022-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Daniels place was just what we were looking for. Clean, quiet, private, and the perfect spot for aurora watching! He also offered us some yummy homemade bread. We would stay here again."
2022-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Daniel was a truly dedicated host!
We came in on the heels of what was described as ice ""icemageddon"" by local media as over an inch of freezing rain covered the region followed by feet of snow, creating the snowiest December on record for Fairbanks. Daniel plowed the road to the house and parking spaces himself, presumably taking many hours of his own time to ensure we could make it in our first night. To provide a comparison for Daniel's efforts, we were not able to pick up our rental car for two days after our initial arrival because they needed the time to retrieve the buried vehicles (it was a lot of snow).
In sum, the accommodations were cozy, comfortable, and had a great view of the valley (and northern lights). When snow shut down much of the city of Fairbanks, Daniel made sure we still could make the trip and achieve our dream of seeing the aurora, and for that we are very grateful :)."
2021-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Dan is hands down the best Airbnb host I and my wife have ever encountered.
This Airbnb has a lot of amenities and is very cozy and clean. The location has very little light pollution - making it a good spot to view the Aurora Borealis.
We recommend booking with him to anyone considering a trip to Fairbanks!"
2021-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Daniel’s place is quiet, clean, cozy, and conveniently located. He has everything we need and went above and beyond to make sure we have everything we need. We would recommend stay at his place for everything visiting Fairbanks."
2021-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great host, gave local recommendations, apartment was stocked. Great all around."
2021-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"If I could give more stars I would!! Not only is the location PERFECT, but Dan was so hospitable and nice. It’s a perfect setting for an amazing Alaskan experience. Far enough from the city to see the lights and some amazing scenery but close to everything as well. Dans recommended places to eat were perfect! The Crepery and Pump House are musts. Dan left us some fresh groceries which was beyond expectations and his homemade bread is the BEST! The view is impeccable and seems almost like a fantasy. Thanks again for the amazing experience!"
2021-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Dan deserves all of the stellar reviews, you can’t get much better than his place.
It’s clean, comfortable, cosy and well appointed with amenities that go beyond the typical Airbnb.
Seeing the northern lights from the comfort of his living room was also a bonus!"
2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Daniel is an amazing host! The place was very clean and was exactly as described. Daniel also provided some breakfast items, which was an added bonus. He suggested some great food places nearby. He checked in with us if we needed anything. We also got a freshly backed bread made by Dan! A great place to stay if you’re in Fairbanks!"
2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Do yourself a favor and stay here!! Best spot in Alaska. The upstairs apt was spacious and provided us everything we needed (and then some). Dan is an amazing host and helped us out when we were stuck in the snow. Also, the bread he gave us was delicious!! He helped made our trip so special and memorable. We will definitely be back!"
2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Upon arriving to Dan’s home, it is immediately noticeable that he truly enjoys hosting. Dan provides an above average amount of amenities, food, and supplies which greatly enhance the comfort of your stay. Dan’s home has everything one needs and more! The location is great and easy to find. Lucky guests will arrive to find some of his delicious home baked Sourdough bread and/or other baked goods. If you had any hesitation whether to stay here or not, let those worries go and book immediately! Thanks again for everything Dan. -Alex"
2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I can't say enough GREAT things about our experience here! Daniel made sure everything was as easy and straight forward as possible. The place is well-insulated, so warmth was never an issue. The deck was incredibly helpful to constantly check for aurora visibility, and there were way more amenities than I expected! Daniel was awesome and I HIGHLY recommend picking up some of his sourdough bread at the Roaming Root down the road. He gave us a lot of very helpful information and was flexible with the somewhat disheveled nature of people who have never been to Alaska before! The two rooms are arranged attached in a shotgun style. The apartment was very clean and I have no complaints! I appreciate everything, Daniel!"
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is a great place with a great view across the valley. Daniel keeps it clean and stocked with a small amount of food, tea, and coffee. This made it great for our first night/morning before we grabbed groceries to cook with. There are plenty of pans and cooking utensils available to cook in or you can ask Daniel for some local places to eat out. In addition to sharing some restaurant suggestions, he gave some suggestions for sights to see and places to visit. If he offers to give you a loaf of his sourdough bread or some of his pizza crusts, be sure to take him up on it; they are amazing!"
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,It’s really a lovely place to stay. The kitchen has everything if you need to cook. I love the big windows in living room and bedroom. It’s amazing to see the sunrise if you wake up in the early morning.
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful views and amazing host, very friendly and communicative. All the amenities from home and perfect for seeing the northern lights! Close to the airport. Can't wait to return!"

I would definitely stay here again in the future - thanks Dan!"
2021-09-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Dan’s place was amazing! If you’re looking for a great view of the northern lights look no further.

Thank you!"
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is a perfect place to stay in Fairbanks! The first priority for me is that it is clean and well maintained. Dan’s place is super nice. It is very clean and very comfortable. The bed was comfy, best night sleep during our Alaska stay! Nice pillows, bedding, towels, a full kitchen, bath, comfy living room, smart TV…. Very nice everything! Many helpful amenities as well. If you are looking for a great place — Sourdough Dan’s is the place. It really is the perfect place for 2-3 people. Thank you for sharing your place. We loved it!"
2021-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We really enjoyed our stay at Sourdough Dans. The apt was nice and clean and supplied with extras such as eggs, oatmeal, waffles, coffee, and tea which made it easy to have breakfast every morning. There is nice balcony with view of anchorage and great place to see northern lights if they are out. Daniel was great host and super helpful with tips of things to do and places to eat. He even left us fresh batch of bread. Definitely one of the best host we stayed with - we highly recommend. For things to do in Fairbanks - we would recommend Riverboat Cruise, Gold Dredge 9 tour, and visiting various breweries. We were also lucky and got to see amazing display of northern lights at Murphy’s dome one night (check explore Fairbanks for conditions)."
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Sourdough Dan’s apartment was fabulous. The space was well laid out and the bed was super comfy. The kitchen was well appointed and useful for all our cooking needs.

We loved Chena Hot Springs!
If we’re ever back in Fairbanks it will be at Dan’s! ♥️"
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Your place was wonderful and so were you. Thank you for meeting us at the Crepery to give us ideas about what to see on our trip. You thought of everything at the house. Your attention to details was amazing and the place was super clean. The location was also very handy for getting into Fairbanks quickly. We enjoyed toasting the bread you provided and appreciated the eggs, too. I hope I can come back to Fairbanks and stay in your place again."
2021-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Daniel’s place is FANTASTIC. Look no further than this listing. Incredible value. Clean, very well maintained appliances and furniture (appliances appear brand new). Abundant bedding/pillows. Well appointed with lots of extras (food items, laundry needs, shower supplies). Daniel is welcoming and takes a genuine interest in his guests. Communication is quick and thorough. If you are lucky, you’ll catch him in his bakery (on the property) and maybe you’ll get to enjoy his homemade sourdough bread - thank you, Dan!
** We saw a moose at the corner of the street!!"

2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Although we didn't get to meet Dan in person, he was easy to get ahold of and very accommodating. He obviously loves hosting, so he has everything you can think of including tourist brochures.
The apartment was clean, spacious, and well taken care of. We really appreciated having some foods available to us the first morning we arrived as it was late and we didn't have time to grocery shop. The simplicity of having eggs and oatmeal was perfect. We appreciated the blackout curtains during the summer months.
Next time we'll come back in the winter, as I'm sure the Aurora vies are spectacular."
2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Dan is a gracious host, very comfortable lodging, couldn't be more pleased we chose to stay here."
2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Daniel's place is very comfortable and super clean! We couldn't see the northern lights because we came in May, but I'm sure that this is the best location ever to see them during winter! The plus was definetely his bread..i think that we never had a bread as good as his before, and we never finished one so fast as we did it there. Thank you Dan!!!"
2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Stayed here 2 nights on a 18 day car tour of AK. Dan is a super friendly host, with great communication and making sure all is fine throughout our time there. Place is very modern well furnished, and spotlessly clean. Kitchen/Fridge was stocked with eggs/oatmeal/pancakes/snacks/tea/coffee/etc. Was able to catch up on laundry after traveling 5 days. Nice hillside views east from the apartment. Wish all my AirBNB experiences were this nice. Dan runs a small bakery and his fresh sourdough bread is yummy."

SPOILIER ALERT!! Daniel bakes the most amazing sourdough bread! 😍.... One of the many extras that come with the stay. Daniel offers a very clean place to stay with extra towels and toiletries. Both of the sleeping areas are very comfortable and has extra blankets and sheets if needed. Daniel has an amazing balcony with absolutely amazing views. If you're lucky you'll be able to see the lights just from his balcony. Daniels place made my Alaskan trip truly an absolute experience. Thank you so much.🙂"

I will never stay anywhere else as long as I’m in Fairbanks.
2021-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What an absolute gem of a place! Close enough to drive into city, but tucked away enough making it absolutely perfect for viewing Aurora! Breathtaking scenery, & Dan was an amazing host! Had everything you needed to have the comfort of being at home while on vacation, plus many great extras (oatmeal, coffee, eggs, kitchen/bathroom supplies, ect).
Dan gave the best recommendations from local activities to check out, best places to eat (the crepes place is a must), wonderful hikes, everything! Was very quick & helpful answering all my questions; plus went above & beyond in being an extremely hospitable host!
If get a chance to stay at Dan's, would HIGHLY recommend it!"

The room was very clean and everything was fully prepared before we arrived. Had a great chat with Dan on the first day of arrival and the local travel tips he shared with us made our trip much easier! Also, every question was answered quickly even it’s late night and we are so grateful to try his home-made garlic sourdough bread, which tastes so good.
We were lucky to stay with Dan in Fairbanks and will definitely come back in the future!"
2021-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Dan and his place are amazing. We have stayed in several AirBnB’s and by far this was the best experience. We will recommend to anyone coming to Fairbanks. Thank you Dan for thinking of everything.
2021-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"ABSOLUTELY the best Air Bnb out there! We definitely felt at home and will be recommending this location to everyone! All of Dan’s attention to detail and wonderful suggestions made our trip the perfect. The accommodations are hands down above and beyond what we expected. The views from the balcony were so spectacular my boyfriend chose it to propose there, we will never forget our AMAZING stay Dan’s! Don’t look any further and book it! Make sure to wake up and watch the sunrise from the balcony, it is truly magical!"
2021-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Dan was such a great host. We took all his local tips and enjoyed every single one!
2021-02-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Best experience! Everything about staying at Dan’s Airbnb was amazing. To start, Dan was incredibly hospitable and kind. He shared with us some bread, pizza dough and hummus that he made which were all delicious! The Airbnb was very clean and felt very cozy. The bed and couch were both comfortable. We mainly wanted to see the northern lights, and if that is what you also want, this is an amazing place to stay! The location was perfect to view them right out the window. The place is also close to restaurants and stores, while still being quiet.
I can’t say enough good things about this Airbnb and would definitely go back!"
2021-02-01,5,Stayed about a week,"If you want to stay in a beautiful, well-stocked Airbnb, you could find none better. The lodging is always well-stocked and very clean. You have the opportunity to stay close to Downtown Fairbanks, but when you stand on the Airbnb balcony or look out the windows, you have a Wonderful View of the Chena River Valley."
2021-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Excellent location, so amazing that you can see the northern lights from the deck. Quick responses and great local tips, would definitely stay here again!"

2021-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"5 stars isn’t enough for this AirBNB!! It was everything I expected and much much more. First, the location is spectacular. I loved my views from the porch. I even got to see the Aurora some! He was so kind on giving me tips for local places and I appreciated that so much. Dan made my experience in Fairbanks better than I could have imagined."
2021-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Dan was an incredible host. From his quick responses to his homemade loaf of bread that he left for us on the day we arrived, we couldn’t have asked for better. His helpful tips saved us and he was so kind. 100% recommend and cannot wait to go back"
2021-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We really enjoyed our time staying at Daniel’s place. The place had anything we could have wanted breakfast, coffee, and teas. Daniel was gracious enough to share some of his rosemary sourdough, pizza crusts, and hummus with us. His family is just all around awesome. We really enjoyed spending a little time with them on New Years Eve for fireworks. We definitely hope to stay with him again."
2020-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Had a high expectations after reading all the reviews and boy it lived up to it! Dan was very responsive to any questions we had and offered great suggestions.

2020-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Daniel’s place was “perfect”. I came for the snow and northern lights. Dan had great amenities in the kitchen with some stocked food options. There is a Smart TV to watch movies at night. The apartment kept warm in spite of the below zero tempts. Dan offered us his jalapeño sourdough bread and it was amazing! He also had lots of tips of places to visit and eat. The lifesaver was the hand warmers on hand since I somehow didn’t pack mine! I would definitely stay here again if I came back to Fairbanks!
2020-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,Very hospitable and would definitely use again.
2020-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great location’ great coffee, great tea plus Dan bakes the most amazing bread 🥖!!!
The place is definitely Super private and sooo quiet."
2020-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"When we visit Fairbanks again, we can only think of staying at Dan's. I have never met a host as wonderful, kind and hospitable as Dan. There is everything in the apartment you could need during your stay. Dan will help you with anything you might need whether it is suggestions on places to go or restaurants to visit. The location is perfect and the apartment is very cozy. The view from the living area, patio and rooms is amazing. You have a full view of the valley. Dan was so kind to offer us his delicious sourdough and humus. If you are visiting Fairbanks, I highly suggest you to stay at Dan's, because you will feel right at home. Myself and my family can't wait to come back. Also, Fairbanks is so so beautiful!"
2020-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Sourdough Dans is the place to be! The location is great. Not right in the middle of everything so it's peaceful with a beautiful view, and its not far from the action. The place is super clean with that home feel to it. Dan is a wonderful host and makes sure that you have everything you need. He goes above and beyond for his guest. He's also very informative of local things you can do and should try. If you get a chance you have to try the smoked paprika hummus he makes....its to die for!"

2020-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Dan's place is by far my favorite place I have stayed. The house was the perfect size for us, cozy without ever feeling cramped. Every morning, the smell of fresh sourdough fills the house from the bakery downstairs. The view is unbeatable and we were even able to catch the Northern Lights on one of the clear nights. In all, a perfect Alaskan getaway. :)"
2020-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This place was great. If I could give Dan six stars I would. The views are amazing. The location is close to everything - 10 to 15 minutes away. Peaceful & quiet. The house was supplied with all kinds of goodies. Loved it here and will be definitely coming back again!!! We could not have asked for a better host!!! Dan is great!!!

2020-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Dan’s place is absolutely wonderful. And when he says spectacular views, he means it. The full kitchen was stocked with everything we needed, so we ended up making most meals in the apartment and just enjoying the Alaskan beauty. I highly recommend!"
2020-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"If you’re trying to decide where to stay in Fairbanks, don’t look any further. Dan is amazing. Thoughtful, accommodating, and makes delicious bread! The place was sparkling clean and had more amenities than most air bnbs. Can’t wait to come back!"
2020-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Dan’s place is a true amazing find!!! The home is cozy, very clean, and has everything you need to feel like you are at home.

Daniel was super helpful with directions and recommended some great places to see. 10/10 would recommend staying here!!"
2020-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Dan’s place was nothing short of amazing! It was very clean and in a nice quiet area, where we were able to catch the northern lights on our first night from the deck. He had everything you could need for a comfortable stay (coffees, teas, waffles, oatmeals, card games, poker set, extra towels, sheets, etc.) and was very helpful and easily accessible for advice and tips. Only thing I can say is I wish we stayed a bit longer."
2024-06-01,5,Group trip,"Breath taking Home!
One of the best views I ever seen, extremely clean and cozy home so many amenities, everything you need to cook a lovely meal in a vacation.

2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This place was amazing! Would highly recommend!! Plenty of room and activities within the home, and kitchen had more than you could ever need. We had the beautiful scenery of snow and the sauna and heaters in the room were perfect to keep everyone warm. Recommend restaurants from the host were a hit with my family :)"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The house is great. The view was outstanding. The heated floors felt great on cold mornings. Perfect out of the way spot for an Alaska adventure.
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,Amazing place in a beautiful location. My family and I loved it.
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,It was so beautiful and peaceful! Loved the large windows! We enjoyed the sauna and the view from there also! Very family friendly.
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,The Aurora house was amazing! The view is stunning and it held true to its name. We finally caught a clear night and got to see the northern lights! We loved everything about our stay and didn’t want to leave. Misti had clear instructions every step of the way and has clearly thought of everything.
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Misti was extremely responsive and attentive with any questions we had. The location is private and peaceful. On the right night you can see the aurora's from the back porch. The kitchen was fully stocked that enabled us to have meals every day for all 7 adults in the house. The sauna was a wonderful addition and added to the relaxation.
As an avid hiker and outdoors person I found many local trails to hike and even went to Moose Mountain to ski (only 35 minutes away). Also took day trips to Chena Hotsprings and downtown Fairbanks."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Thank you for a comfortable, clean stay with gorgeous views. The kitchen and living room were homey and cozy. We actually did see a wee bit of Aurora through the huge wall of windows, despite heavy clouds. The place was spacious, and the upstairs master bath and suite was great. The sauna was clean and luxurious. We had a wonderful time."
2024-03-01,5,Group trip,"All 3 nights we saw and photographed the aurora. The 3rd night was the best and they were exploding all over the sky, with red and green colors. The view from this home is awesome! We are experienced aurora chasers from Anchorage, and our images were freaking fabulous from the front deck of this beautiful home.
There were 5 in our group, and we rented a large 4wd SUV, which is a good idea in the winter. We kept 4H engaged the whole time, and it was just fine. But I do not recommend a small car with no 4WD.
The hosts of this home are incredibly kind, responsive, and have paid attention to detail in the home. We cooked breakfast and noticed how well appointed the kitchen is, there are even spices and loads of coffee K cup options. There was even tea and tiny little creamers.
There is also an electrical outlet near the door so we were able to plug in our vehicle as the temps were -22F and we could keep our engine block heated.
We HIGHLY recommend this home.
Thank you Curt !!!!"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"Beautiful cabin with amazing views! Extremely Clean, Comfortable and cozy. Would have loved to stay longer!"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful home. Didn’t get to see the aurora but will definitely stay again.
2024-02-01,5,Group trip,"Our stay at the house was very pleasant. We needed to leave our luggage at the house before the official check-in time because we had an excursion, and they and they were very understanding. The house has everything you might need; it's a perfect place to rest and have a good time with friends, as was our case. Our excursions lasted until late at night, so we didn't see the aurora from the house because it was cloudy the only day we stayed there to relax and watch the sunset.
Communication with Misti was excellent; she even helped us search for a car rental company since the ones we knew didn't have cars available for 7 people anymore. We would definitely choose this house again, without a doubt. It's a shame we couldn't stay longer."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed one night,We were looking for a place to end our driving trip around Alaska to allow us to relax and rest at the end of our trip and the house couldn’t have been any better for what we needed. You walked in and felt like you were at home with beautiful surroundings for a peaceful stay.
2024-02-01,5,Group trip,"The Aurora House was beautiful, just like the pictures. It is in a very private, peaceful setting with gorgeous views. Our AWD van did just fine getting in and out, even with fresh snow on. The home is far enough away from the lights of town that we had a great view of the aurora lights right from the deck. The home was well stocked with plenty of towels, etc. ( that is sometimes hard to find in a rental.) The hosts were very responsive to any questions that we had about the home and the town in general. There is a wide variety of activities offered in the area within a reasonable driving distance. Our family had a wonderful time!"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Absolutely breathtaking! The House is so comfortable and cozy. Had everything we needed. You won’t want to leave once you’re there. The Directions were great and very happy we had a AWD vehicle.
We will be back!
Thank you, Misti!"
2024-01-01,5,Group trip,Absolutely beautiful but remote cabin. Added the perfect level of escape to our Alaskan trip.
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,A great place to stay. Saw the northern lights from the house. The home is incredibly welcoming and warming. The heated floors were a total bonus! We loved our entire stay. Misty and hosts were at our fingertips whenever we had a question or needed information. They even let us know when the northern lights were out. 😎
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We love the cabin. It was gorgeous inside and out. A bit scary the first time driving off the freeway because it was dark and snowing. But once we got into the place. We all were stunned by the cabin.
I will definitely come back to Fairbanks and stayed here again."
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"If you are waffling on where to stay in Fairbanks, look no further and book the Aurora House. You won't regret it! From amazing views to heated floors, this home provides sets the stage for magical trip. We appreciated the have basic kitchen amenities, which came in handy the evenings we decided to eat in and cook.
This place is about the views, and oh boy they don't disappoint! We were able to view the Aurora without having to leave the comfort of the cabin, we downloaded the Aurora app and turned on notifications to help us time anticipate the timing of the light shows. Our only regret was that we didn't stay longer - so we will be back!
Thank you to our hosts, you were all so kind and responsive :)"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Thank you for the great stay!

2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Absolutely breath taking views and so peaceful. The sauna is also a nice touch to the place.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is a nice place outside of town. Beautiful snow capped trees. It is a very peaceful surroundings.
Keep in mind it is outside of town and you will need 4 wheel drive when it starts snowing. This will add to your commute time to Fairbanks or other areas. It was worth it to us to be outside of town in the beauty of Alaska.
The rooms and beds are comfy with just enough space to relax. The amenities available were perfect!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We had the most amazing time. We felt like we were living inside a postcard. The house was gorgeous and comfortable and the Co-hosts were very responsive and accommodating. Will definitely come back!

2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This has to be the best place in Fairbanks. The views are incredible, the house is amazing, and the kitchen has everything you would need. This trip was just my wife and I but this place would be great for up to 3 couples/families. We canceled most of our plans to stay in and take in the views. This house is one of the best places to see the northern lights, you have 180 degree view of the sky."
2023-09-01,5,Group trip,"It is a beautiful house with a great view from the living room. We have enjoyed our stay, couldn’t expect better. We were lucky to see the Aurora. Misti is a great host, easy to communicate and very cooperative. If we ever visit Fairbanks again will definitely look for this house to stay."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful place, very relaxing."
2023-08-01,5,Group trip,"Really good place to stay and a friendly host. we didn't get to see the Northern lights, but the place was really good and cozy. lots of space, and the best part was the little sauna. we had the best time in this airbnb . I would definitely recommend this place and would love to come in the future. 💯"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We absolutely loved staying at the Aurora House! Everything was sparkling clean and the responsiveness of the host is top notch. They offered many suggestions on things to do and local restaurants which were great recommendations.
There isn’t a long list of to-dos to check out either, which we appreciated!
Overall this was absolutely one of our favorite stays and we travel a lot. I would recommend staying here to anyone!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We had a great time here! The kids loved the house, we loved the sauna and the surroundings. We enjoyed ourselves immensely and can’t say enough good things about Mistis house."
2023-08-01,5,Group trip,"Wonderful Stay!
Our family wanted to stay at a property that was scenic and felt like the Alaska experience, and this home definitely met that expectation. The deck was one of our favorite places to gather, and we enjoyed family game nights in the terrific living room. The kitchen was well-stocked. The bedrooms were nicely appointed and comfortable. Best of all were the gorgeous views which could be enjoyed from both upstairs and downstairs. The booking process was seamless and we appreciated the quick responsiveness of the owner regarding our questions. We are so grateful for the excellent experience we had at this property. We created family memories that will last a lifetime. Thanks!!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful property with gorgeous views and great amenities. The location is bit remote, but very serene place and surroundings"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I very much liked the Birch Perch. This was a spring time visit, great weather, snow gone and almost 24hr day lite. Beautiful, almost summer like conditions, for summer like adventure. The house and grounds were well maintained, modern furnishings, well stocked of basics (spices and the like), organized, clean and it was evident that the hosts had done a lot to curate the space. Art, live plants, record player, book shelves, and a Nintendo from the 80's that was a blast from the past!
Well functioning BBQ, and the kitchen had all the pots and pans needed. Great deck spaces on the second level.
Out the back door is the O' Connor ridge trail system. Consisting of a bunch of non motorized hiking trails. We did the Cranberry trail loop with some extra out and backs, and would recommend that as a start. Murphy dome is close, Angel Rocks about an hour.
About 10 minutes from the University, the airport, the antique auto museum, farmers market, and town.
10 out of 10 would recommended."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed over a week,"The home and the hosts were exceptional!
It was beautiful, comfortable and stocked with everything you could need while on vacation. Including fresh coffee beans for the morning after a long day of travel!
The short drive out of town was just what we were looking for, to get that Alaskan wilderness vibe.
After a 12 day stay, we still couldn't find anything that the property lacked.
Amber and Dan get a 10/10 from us for an awesome experience. They could charge more and it would still be a good deal. It was perfect!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great house in a birch forest. Just outside of town but not to far. Great walking trails nearby. Very responsive and helpful host. Host provided lots of recommendations (great locations to view the aurora, places to go, and good restaurants). House had plenty of amenities which made it feel like home. Highly recommend"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Such an amazing place to stay. As soon as we got there it felt like home. Far enough from the city to feel like your own private getaway but close enough to experience everything that Fairbanks has to offer. The house was clean, modern and very well maintained. It had all the amenities you could hope for and a lot of small touches that were very much appreciated. Amber was a great host and was very communicative prior to and during our stay. Instructions for check in were clear and easy. Amber also provided great suggestions for activities and places to visit, eat, etc. The nightly aurora update was appreciated. Overall a 10/10 and somewhere I will definitely look to stay again on my next visit to Fairbanks. I would recommend to anyone planning their trip to Fairbanks!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The Birch Perch was absolutely amazing. You feel right at home, and it was perfectly warm and cozy. It is in a private, safe location which is optimal for a great weekend getaway. It has everything you need from a warm inviting fire place to a fridge and cabinets filled with snacks and drinks. I rate the physical place 10/10, however the real reason you should stay here is because of the incomparable hosts. From time I booked the place Amber and Dan have made 100% certain we had everything we needed to have a fantastic getaway. Amber is so warm, detailed, and responsive. Incredibly amicable from the onset, she provided me with multiple guiding tips on where to eat and how to see the northern lights. Without even being asked, she even made sure we had fresh desserts and a wonderful bottle of champagne to help us celebrate our special occasion. If the place is a 10/10, the hosts are an 11/10. If you're coming to Fairbanks, you want to stay here."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We stayed at the Birch Perch house for a week, everything was wonderful and unforgetable , the house is pretty beautiful, comfortable, has everything you need, it's very warm in the winter.
Amber and Dan gave us all the information about the house and the locals restaurant and recent activities, and they sent us the weather and aurora reports daily, that's very very helpful, we finally saw the beautiful aurora.
We will definitely recommend this place to our friends and we will stay here again when we come to Fairbanks next time."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Do yourself a favor and book this stay. Everything about the home is great. Kitchen is stocked. Location is beautiful. They provided local recommendations and was very responsive. Would love to stay here again!
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is by far the best Airbnb we have ever stayed in! The view from the house is breathtaking and the house itself is absolutely beautiful! The hosts ,Amber and Dan,thought of everything that we needed to make our stay comfortable! They built a fire for us to come in to, left all kinds of goodies in the fridge for us and snacks in the pantry. It was beyond what we could have ever imagined! The beds were so comfortable, the shower had everything we needed for our stay, (shampoo ,conditioner, soap) I cannot say enough about this place! If you are visiting Alaska this is the place to stay!"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Amber exceeded expectations, providing excellent care with valuable trip tips. Communication was seamless, and their kindness added to the overall positive experience. Responding super fast! Highly recommended!"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed about a week,"One of the best BnBs we stayed in, Amber and Dan are easily the best hosts! The house was shiny-clean, stylishly decorated and had everything one would need (even a luggage scale). The location is tranquil neighborhood situated in a beautiful birch forest just 20 minutes outside of Fairbanks. If you’re traveling to Alaska to reconnect with nature without loosing amenities of modern life we would definitely recommend this place.
Amber and Dan were outstanding hosts! Check-in was flawless, hosts made sure we have everything we need and promptly answered our questions. It was surprise to find that hosts even prepared a list of local activities available during our stay and also provided daily updates on aurora viewing conditions which was super helpful.
We will definitely be back!"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Amber and Dan were always helpful, friendly and professional. The Birch Perch is an amazing place!! So much to appreciate, and made easier to enjoy thanks to the thoughtful touches such as leaving a few treats and groceries for us, advising us on local snowshoe trails, aurora watching. And seriously: keeping a place like that thriving through the Alaska winter takes dedication, hard work and ingenuity -- well done, Amber and Dan! I hope we will be back.
They are the best Airbnb hosts I've encountered (and that is many)."
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Cannot begin to say how amazing both the space was and how friendly and helpful Dan and Amber were!
The cabin and locations were truly a dream/ every day they provided great aurora forecast updates/ and proactively suggested places to go, things to see, and things to eat! Kitchen was stocked with helpful items/ record player was a wonderful evening addition to the ambiance/ and the toasty wooden fire topped it all off!
Being 4 folks from New Orleans, an Alaskan winter trip felt like a huge leap, but the space and pro-tips from the hosts made it easy and wonderful!
10/10 would recommend!!!"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great cozy place to stay for vacation! It’s nice and warm, with great snow views in the winter. The house is cute and close to the nature. Wonderful experience and I’m glad that we stayed here!"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Dan and Amber’s place is by far the best Airbnb I’ve ever stayed in! I stayed here with my family for Christmas and it had everything we needed and more! The kitchen was perfect for cooking family dinners and was the most well stocked kitchen I’ve ever seen in an Airbnb. There’s a fantastic stereo system (bluetooth, CDs, AND a record player!), and a smart tv downstairs for a nice movie night. They clearly put so much care into making this home feel cozy, with little reading nooks and fluffy blankets. They are incredible hosts and I will definitely want to stay here again next time the family is in town!"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a fantastic stay! Amber and Dan were very welcoming, and their place was wonderful. They provided us with valuable local tips, including some great advice for aurora chasing. Their attention to detail really stood out, with thoughtful touches such as:
- Pre-booking communication about road conditions and car requirements.
- Every switch is labeled!
- Luminous stickers on the stairs for added safety in the dark.
- Stocked pantry with food, water, and cleaning supplies, in case you forget anything.
This was one of the best accommodation experiences I've ever had. We even canceled our reindeer tour just to spend more time in this lovely house. Thank you both so much!"
2023-12-01,5,Group trip,"Birch Perch was everything we were looking for and more! The location is gorgeous, quiet and peaceful! The house is lovely with many added touches and surprises! Check-in was smooth and the treats in the fridge were an added bonus! Birch Perch isn't too far from town, has lots of trails nearby and is close to many Aurora viewing locations! While we did not see the lights - it snowed - our trip was still amazing and we highly recommend Birch Perch! We would stay there again!"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Our stay in Fairbanks, AK at Amber's place was an absolute delight! From start to finish, they truly went above and beyond to ensure our visit was extraordinary.
They welcomed us with warmth andgenuine care, making us feel right at home from the moment we arrived. Not only did they provide uswith a beautifully decorated and cozy house, but their attention to detail was outstanding.
Amber made our stay incredibly convenient by furnishing the Airbnbwith everything we could possibly need. From an array of snacks and beverages to an assortment of personal care items, they left no stone unturned in ensuring our comfort.
What made our experience even more remarkable was the thoughtful gesture of providing daily travel and driving tips, along with updates on the aurora forecast.This personalized touch added an exciting element to our trip, allowingus to explore the beautiful surroundings of Fairbanks with easeand excitement."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Not sure where to start but this place is incredible and Dan and Amber are the most amazing host I have ever met. We have stayed at many Airbnb but nothing has come close to Dan and Amber hospitality. They have thought of every detail to ensure guest feel at home. The cabin is clean, warm, and has everything you need. The beautiful surroundings of the cabin and peacefulness is the ultimate location to enjoy Alaska. Thank You Dan And Amber for the wonderful experience cant wait to come back . ❤️"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Amber and Dan are such great hosts that we are so thrilled to be the guests. Before the trip, Amber already sent tons of docs and notes, that is great for planning! During the stay, Amber welcomed us with smoked salmon(umm so good!) and fire wood in the basement, I burned two pitches during the stay, it is warm! Also for the northern light, Amber provided detailed info in real time! That was also impressed. Amber is also aware of the wild animals around, during the stay I took photos of many adorable creatures, and I think that is something make this Airbnb such a special one. Place two food feeder for birds around the house? that was genius, you placed a B&W speakers and a bare eye binocular for birds at the same time! The house itself is truely a home in the north, I will definitely return. Had so much fun!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Well, what can I say..other than AMAZING!! The cabin was everything we hoped for and more! It was the perfect retreat after sight seeing and taking long walks viewing the breath taking sights of Alaska. The hosts communicated well and were very proactive with helpful tips and recommendations throughout our stay and there is an excellent information file in the lodge. The check in was flexible and the log fire had been lit prior to our arrival. Fresh treats and drinks had been left for us and the cupboards were full of various groceries for us too. The kitchen was equipped with every useful tool you can think of. Every room was immaculate, querky with a beautiful decor and there was a mulititude of books and games available. I will definitely be returning here and would highly recommend! The only regret is that you will not want to leave ❤"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"A pure GEM in the middle of a birch wood forest! This sweet place was secluded, private and felt like home the moment we drove up… and it was filled with so many extras! It exceeded our expectations and was easily driving distance to everything we wanted to visit in the town of Fairbanks. One of the highlights was sitting by the wood burning stove and watching ‘Into the Wild’, with movie snacks… the icing on the cake was seeing the Aurora (Northern Lights) on our last night there - WOW!
We would highly recommend it to anyone wanting a quiet getaway, close to all and will definitely stay here the next time we plan a trip this way!!
Thank you for the hospitality and perfect stay!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed about a week,"This place was over the top. Not only the location, but the layout of this house was just adorable. Every detail was enough to make you smile. The live plant vines strewed amongst the 2 spiral staircases, the unique hand soaps, hair products and decorations as well as the ambiance. It was peaceful and welcoming. A pristine record player with a flawless collection of albums were available along with a guitar, several games and a vintage Nintendo system with a huge game collection as well. Books galore sit on the bookcase and a large smart TV in the basement.
Personal touches were everywhere. Fresh baked goods were provided and local Alaskan Beer collection in the fridge with a personal note to our family welcoming us to reassure if anything could possibly be needed other than what was already provided. Other food items were provided as well. Our host was so generous and sweet. Just look at all the pictures! This space is even better than that. THIS STAY WAS 10/10. :)"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Amazing place, great hosts. We had a great stay. Amber and Dan are very responsive. Felt like home and they left us goodies in the fridge too. Best Air bnb so far!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This Airbnb was the best one I have stayed with so far!! The place is so comfy and neat. The host (Amber) is super nice and responsive! She answered my messages/questions asap! Also super thoughtful…the Airbnb has EVERYTHING you need and also have a lot of books/boardgames/LPs if wanted to spend time in the house. I would 100% recommend this place to anyone who is plan on visiting Fairbanks!
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Amber's place was perfect for our family who came in last minute. She was very responsive and accommodating, 5 star experience!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The Birch Perch is a literal work of art. Every detail of the house and the decorations are amazing. Amber the host, even left us welcoming treats in the fridge. We have never had such a generous and kind welcome before. The house is located at the end of a private road, right next to a network of hiking trails. It's location was perfect for our adventure on the Dalton highway as well as experiencing all that Fairbanks had to offer. Amber's recommendations were fantastic. She even sent us a local list of activities for the nights that we were staying. First rate accommodations, location and host. Thanks for everything Amber!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,I don’t have enough good things to stay about our stay at the Birch Perch. So many thoughtful touches. The house was equipped with anything and everything you could need. Amber had the best guide book for us with events listed for our time there. The house was beautiful and was everything we were hoping for. Best Airbnb experience ever! Thank you to Amber & Dan for making the experience one that we will always remember.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"My wife and 7 year old son throughly enjoyed our stay. Birch Perch is a lovely home. It’s very unique, comfortable, private. My son particularly enjoyed the “bunk” bed as his special retreat! We also enjoyed the wood stove in the cooler morning hours. When we are next in Fairbanks this will be our first choice of where to stay."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Easily one of the best Airbnbs I’ve ever stayed in
2023-07-01,5,Group trip,"The house is surrounded by a beautiful forest that you could do a couple of trails on. The house from the outside is really outstanding and pretty as the inside. It has everything you need and more. Amber gave us lots of sweets and food. We played music on the vinyl player, watched a couples of movies, played some mario on the nintendo, enjoyed a barbecue on the grill and very fun table games. Overall 💯 experience, would totally recommend 🎉"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Loved the spot. Absolutely beautiful on the inside and out. Amber is awesome and went above and beyond my expectations. I give the whole experience a 10 out of 10, 5 stars, and 2 thumbs up."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place was so perfect!! It’s an absolutely gorgeous place set off in the woods, and it was so serene and lovely. Great amenities, great decor, lots of fun little touches (we particularly enjoyed the original Nintendo; brought back lots of great memories from childhood :-) ). The host was wonderful; so kind and responsive! And she has so many different kinds of food for us! Cake and popcorn and all sorts of things! Such a lovely surprise, and well above and beyond! Everything we wanted for our 15th wedding anniversary!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,One of the most thoughtful spaces we’ve have ever stayed. Everything is labeled and very intuitive. Amber and Dan are so generous with all amenities. It was so tidy and clean. Will and already have recommended this spot!
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Our expectations were exceeded with this beautiful home. Such true heart went into making every detail from top to bottom excellent. Dan and Amber have an amazing place and Amber was so kind and warm in our conversation. We felt welcomed and even loved as we went through our weekend at the “Birch Perch” together. If I could give more stars, I would. There were sweet surprises around every corner! This place is so fun and unique in all the right ways! It was very clean too! We look forward to our next visit. It was truly a pleasure. I wholeheartedly recommend this experience with great delight."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Amber is the best host you'll ever meet! Our stay was so much more than a ""rental."" We wanted to find a beautiful place to hold a wedding ceremony for 15 people and Amber happily accommodated us, offering referrals for florists,photographers and bakeries! We were in constant contact since booking. We've NEVER felt so welcome at another booking. The home is exquisite! We were fortunate enough to meet our hosts and that was our privilege. Finding their perfect home for our daughter's wedding, their kindness and willingness to accommodate our unique requests made the wedding and our stay magical! If you visit Fairbanks, this is the place to stay! I honestly feel like we underpaid. No one has ever treated us better! This immaculate and stunning home was a dream stay for our family! We were blessed to meet two wonderful people and I will never forget their kindness, honesty and compassion. Amazing stay! A 1000 word review isn't enough to convey our appreciation!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed about a week,"The Best AirBnB I've Stayed In, Full Stop
This is I think what happens when you have a host who is perhaps a little OCD about ensuring you have a good experience (in a good way!). The place is perfectly appointed, stocked and... everything is labelled :). It's clear that a lot of iteration and work has gone into the experience design. Every detail of the space is smoothly and thoughtfully curated. Additionally, unlike most other AirBnb's I've stayed at, you don't feel 'nickel and dimed' over the amenities.
The interior design is better than I've seen in other AirBnb's, including the lighting design... there are a lot of lights... Good thing all the switches are labelled :) The grounds are extensive, and the privacy is palpable.
Amber & Dan were very friendly and went out of their way to help me arrange a package delivery and gave me some tips on braving the Dalton Hwy.
Staying here had me a little nostalgic for the early 'good ole days' of AirBnb.
Maximum Stars."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I stayed at the Birch Perch for my 30th birthday along with my bff and my fiancé. Before we had even booked our stay, Dan and Amber sent us several long, thoughtful messages answering our questions about visiting Alaska and how we should prepare. They were genuinely invested in making sure we had everything we needed.
They were very clear about the weather and the roads, and unfortunately we ran into a bit of an issue getting up the road to the house. They immediately jumped in their car and came to ferry us to the Birch Perch where they had already started a fire in the stove!
The place is AMAZING. The pictures don’t do it justice. Not only was it cozy and beautiful, they’d stocked everything we could possibly have needed, including binoculars, headlamps, yoga mats, postcards, and a fully stocked kitchen.
I can’t stress how unbelievably kind and generous they are. They constantly offered up their time and resources to improve our time in AK. We’re already planning to return!!!!"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Not only is the Host amazing! The place was everything, if not more from what we expected.
It was nice to wake up in the woods away from everyone and explore the hiking trails around the property. If you’re looking for a getaway with your significant other. This place is perfect!
Seeing the Aurora from Ambers place is awesome! Got to see it for the first time right from the driveway and was blown away!
While staying there, I was able to order groceries with ease and get rides into town using the Uber app since i didn’t take my own vehicle. Even then, I had an amazing time staying here.
This place is definitely worth the time and money! There’s no doubt you’ll feel right at home c:"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"To say this home and its hosts were wonderful is a complete understatement! From the first interaction at making the reservation through the whole visit we were treated like family! From the moment we arrived we felt welcome and at home! We even had treats and beverages waiting for us in the fridge! This house has something for everyone. The decorating was amazing along with the abundance of fun games, books, magazines, and music available. Our son accidentally left a small stuffed animal and Amber found him and is going to return our lost family member to us in style! Our stay was awesome and having daily updates from Amber about the happenings in town, along with northern lights updates was so great! It’s a peaceful property with tons of wildlife and access for outdoor adventures as well! We feel like we’ve made new friends in them and look forward to coming back again, soon!"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Our stay was perfect. Made better by the local special touches that greeted us upon arrival like a birthday cupcake, delicious cinnamon roll from a local bakery and others. The house is simply stunning and the perfect getaway for a trip to Fairbanks. Impeccable communication and thoughtfulness. We sure do hope to come back soon! Thank you!"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The house was exquisite - just as described, private, peaceful location, amenities to spare. Everything was perfect upon arrival and Amber and Dan were very helpful throughout our stay. Detailed, informative and clear communications were provided to make us feel at home. Sincerely enjoyed our stay and highly recommend."""
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I have to say what an absolute joy in every sense it was to arrive at Amber and Dan’s place. I’m a regular visitor to Fairbanks and often stay this side of town, but I was delighted with this beautiful peaceful but accessible spot. The cabin is so well designed, quirky, modern in all the right ways and cosy. If you’re visiting in winter make sure you rent a 4 wheel drive (but that’s always a good plan if you’re looking to get out and about for fun in Fairbanks at this time of year!). Every detail is thoughtful, every need has been considered and covered and the information and communication I received was helpful, timely and spot on. I was even treated to a fantastic aurora show from the deck on my first night - it was really something special. Amber has really perfected the AirBnB experience here and I wholeheartedly recommend you stay here. You won’t be disappointed."
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"It’s the best house!!! We loved it so much, everything is clean and cute! We will definitely go back! Thank you for sharing all of the information about Aurora light and activities in Fairbanks, we had a really good time there! Thanks for everything!"
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is the BEST Airbnb experience I ever have! The moment that we stepped into the house, it makes us feel like home. It’s very warm and clean, everything is clean. Basically you can find anything that you need in the house, Amber and Dan even have food and drinks in the fridge. I felt super relaxed in the house, I felt very warm and welcoming. Feels like a second home for me.
The community with Amber and Dan is incredible. They always keep us posted about when you can see the aurora, where you can go, what time etc. And they always make sure you have everything that you need and respond quickly.
This location of the house is super convenient, also very quiet, you can have your own privacy. I definitely recommend if anyone go to Fairbanks and looking a place to stay, here’s the best!!! And definitely wanna go visit again!"
2023-02-01,5,Stayed over a week,"Simply amazing! we were very well received, and also during our stay, they cared about us so that we could make the most of the place, always with quick responses! I was really happy and will be back again! highly recommend. You will feel right at home, that's how they make you feel. Thanks"
2023-01-01,5,Stayed about a week,"My wife and I have stayed in many vacation rentals, and our stay at Amber & Dan's house was quite honestly the best experience we have ever had. The house its self was incredibly well appointed and easy to navigate, and the attention to detail within the house was amazing - they had all the light switches, drawers, etc. labeled, extra device charging cables, everything you could possibly need in the kitchen/bathrooms, clear instructions everywhere, and the house looked exactly like the photos. Throughout our week long stay, Amber & Dan were quick to respond to messages and questions and provided many great recommendations to us. We felt like we were staying in a hotel with concierge service. 10/10 - we will definitely be staying here again during our next trip to Fairbanks."
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This location is phenomenal! It’s a castle of nostalgia, with old toys, books I haven’t seen since I was much younger, classic records etc. We legit forfeited our entire second day of prepaid activities, to just relax and enjoy the amenities. The first night we played Nintendo until we fell asleep, then spent the entire next day playing records, cooking and reading. Amber and Dan were so accommodating, she even kept an eye out for the northern lights for me and messaged me when she saw them so that I wouldn’t miss them while I was out there. I will plan all future trips to Fairbanks around the availability of this listing alone."
2023-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,Great trip!! Hosts were amazing! Thank you Amber!
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The Birch Perch is the perfect launch point for Fairbanks! I didn’t want to leave. Amber and Dan thought of everything we could possibly need for our stay, and more. Their attention to detail showed in every nook of the home. The bedroom was very comfy and the bathrooms are beautiful! The guidebook was very inclusive and had great suggestions for local restaurants. The kitchen is also fully stocked to make meals. There are labels and instructions around the house that made everything easy to find. As 80’s babies, we loved closing out each day we were there with a fire in the stove and Nintendo tournaments. Amber was very quick to respond and kept up with communication during our stay. Overall incredible experience at the Birch Perch!"
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I guarantee you will NOT find a cooler, more stylish place in all of Alaska. Amenities are truly above and beyond. You can not miss out on this experience."
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Lovely wooded escape not far from town! Thoughtful touches and plenty to occupy you on a rainy cold day! Beautiful gardens, comfortable furnishings, generous host and a must stay when in Fairbanks!!"
2022-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The Birch Perch was an absolutely an amazing AirBNB experience!! This was easily one of the best places we have ever stayed in!! Amber & Dan are incredible hosts! Amber was extremely responsive, left us yummy treats in the fridge and wrote us a nice greeting upon arrival.
The home is lovely and is a true place of peace! It's in a beautiful spot outside of the city tucked into a hillside surrounded by a gorgeous forrest. There is even a fairy house tucked along the driveway! There are miles of trails literally outside the back door that we enjoyed exploring in the light of the early evening. The care and detail they have put into the home shows! Everything is labeled, and the home manual has everything thought through with every detail. The home was thoughtfully designed, decorated, safe, private and comfortable!
We loved the peace and quiet in the evenings, and looked forward to returning to this beautiful home after our days out! There is a plethora of books, and board games to enjoy! The game center was great, and we enjoyed playing the old Atari and Nintendo systems with our kids that took us back to our childhood! We would will definitely return to the Birch Perch! Don’t stay anywhere else in Fairbanks - This is the place to stay!!"
2022-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"From start to finish, this was an amazing experience. Amber was very courteous and thoughtful from the moment I made reservations. She was very accommodating by letting us check in early and even left a few nice surprises in the fridge.
The place was very clean, comfortable and private. Amber has it designed and decorated very beautifully. It was like something out of a magazine.
If you want cozy comfort with all the amenities, this is the place to stay. Highly recommended 👌"
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This was a wonderful place to stay during our conference. The place was adorable.
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Wow. This place is fantastic. I travel to Fairbanks several times a year for work. The location of the Birch Perch was perfect for me. I loved the solitude this home provided. It's in a beautiful spot about twenty minutes out of the city tucked into a hillside surrounded by a gorgeous. forrest. There are miles of trails literally outside the back door that I enjoyed before heading off for the day. I loved the peace and quiet in the evenings. The home was thoughtfully designed, decorated, safe, private and comfortable. The owners honestly could not be more thoughtful and attentive. There were garden fresh vegetables left in the fridge for me on arrival with a sampling of local beverages and amazing smoked salmon. I cannot rate this highly enough and will definitely return on future trips to Fairbanks."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The house was amazing! It’s exactly how it was pictured in the ad but was just more cozy in person, the location is a little away from downtown Fairbanks but only by a few minutes which wasn’t a problem as the change of scenery constantly was appreciated, Amber kept in contact with us constantly so we never felt confused about the check in-check out and she even left little notes around the house to aid us in properly utilizing everything, the treats she left was awesome and much appreciated. The whole house was extremely clean and attention to detail on basic necessities one might need during their stay was above and beyond. All in all I’d absolutely come back, the price was well worth it and there were no issues that presented itself during our stay. Made my girlfriends experience in Alaska that much more memorable."
2022-07-01,5,Group trip,"This place was absolutely awesome, even better than it was advertised, the host is beyond awesome and helpful and super friendly, I’ve not seen a place that was more organized and equipped than this place in all 29 countries that I’ve been too. The kitchen is full of stuff that you can eat not just the basics. Amber went above and beyond to make sure we won’t need a single thing during our stay and the area is sooo beautiful and quite. I would definitely recommend everyone who’s coming to Fairbanks to book this place without hesitation. And I’ll definitely be back soon.
Hassan"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Ambers cabin is the perfect place to enjoy Fairbanks nature. The cabin is beautiful inside as is outside. It’s well organized with everything you need to cook your own meals. Amber is a great host who cares that you enjoy your stay and makes sure you have anything you need to have a good time.
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Amber was amazing and very helpful .The house was lovely everything was nice and clean ,she left goodies in the fridge for us and checked in to see if we needed anything.It would be a great place for families,we had a great time and would definitely visit again ."
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Excellent destination with hiking trails close…. The accommodations were perfect while special features throughout..
The amenities were numerous and made our stay in Fairbanks epic. I highly recommend."
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Best AirBnB experience ever! Amber was so helpful, accommodating and communicative before/during/after the reservation. The place was perfect. Just the right distance from town to be & feel remote enough, but accessible and an easy 7 min drive to civilization. Everything you could ever need is provided. Artsy, whimsical and modern. We found new little fun surprises around the place everyday. Would definitely stay there again. Super clean and very well curated."
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The Birch Perch was beyond our expectations. The pictures are great but you really have to stay there to appreciate all the detail. Very clean and extremely well stocked. The location is perfect, close to town but still feels very secluded. The hosts were very helpful and even let us borrow some bear spray. Highly recommend this place and we hope it is available for our next visit."
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Wonderful large house, with attention to even the smallest details. One of the best Airbnb’s my family has been to, and the privacy, cleanliness, and environment was top notch. The owners were very quick to respond and very thoughtful and accommodating. The house as a whole is better looking then the photos and would definitely recommend to anyone coming to Fairbanks!"
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Absolutely the best AirBnB experience I’ve had - by far. You cannot have a true Alaskan trip without spending a few days at this amazing home. Amber went above and beyond in hosting us. Every detail was thought out. She was responsive, had prepared local cheese dip for us, and warmly greeted us upon arrival. The home is lovely and is a true place of peace. Don’t stay anywhere else in Fairbanks - you’ve found the right place here. I highly, highly, highly recommend. It was the highlight of the trip!"
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Extremely nice and helpful with everything
2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The ""Birch Perch"" was aptly named, birch trees out of every window! My husband and I enjoyed an impromptu weekend getaway here, it did not disappoint.
The house is immaculate. It is as pictured. I will add that the two spiral staircases are a great use of space though something to consider if you have any mobility issues. Every cooking tool or spice is available along with many canned items to get you started to make a soup, pasta sauce or more. Amber and Dan have thought of every item you could possibly need and many more you didn't know you needed but was a treat to have. I have never stayed in an Airbnb that was so well equipped. The bed was a dream with heavenly linens. The home is cozy, beautifully decorated and toasty warm!
We arrived to flowers and a few welcome gifts, not expected though highly appreciated. There is a vast assortment of books, magazines and games as well as stationary cards to choose from to write that note to someone you have been thinking of. Dan and Amber also took the time to sand the steep hill up to their home as well as the driveway prior to our arrival.
This has been a favorite Airbnb stay for us. Close enough to town but far enough out that we were (fortunate enough) to view the Northern Lights directly off the deck!! I am already looking forward to a making a return trip this summer, the stay was that spectacular. Amber is a highly communicative host. The House book was full of suggestions for local eateries and tips for viewing the Northern Lights.
I cannot say enough about this gem of a house nestled among the birch trees. Amber and Dan have gone above and beyond in designing a truly exquisite space to feel comfortable and relaxed in.
You will not be disappointed!"
2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Don't look elsewhere -- book Dan & Amber's place. We were lucky to find this gem. One of the best stays in my travel experience.
We came to Fairbanks for just two days in late March - a last-minute getaway to snow, huskies, and Aurora Borealis. It was a perfect house for two to completely switch the context, disconnect, and enjoy the time. We watched the night sky from the deck, hiked local trails (just next to the house), tried dog mushing, and cooked delicious food..
The hosts thought through every step of the guest experience -- that's how I usually feel being in a good resort. The house is exactly as you see in the photos. Care towards the guests is all in the little details: e.g. there's a big collection of spices in the fully-stocked kitchen, and every appliance you may need for cooking. There's a pair of snowshoes outside; a collection of hand-made cards and stamps for you to sign and send home; video games from the 90s and all kinds of board games; a small library and a stereo with a vinyl player with disks; yoga mats, the wood for the woodstove is dry so it's easy to fire.
Also, I cannot be more thankful to our hosts for excellent communication throughout the whole journey and a lot of genuine care towards us. Dan and Amber are so welcoming and warm-hearted that we instantly got connected."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"We had a fantastic night at Tanglewood Inn, we wish we could have stayed longer! The space is spotless, had everything we could need and more! Location was easy to find using directions. Washer and dryer were a nice touch. We also enjoyed the chickens walking by!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Tanglewood is a lovely cabin and Jess is a great host. We drive to Denali a few times, soaked at Chena hot springs, and explored local parks around Fairbanks. Tanglewood was an ideal base camp for our adventure and we would definitely return. Watch for moose on the road in though."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We had a great time at the cabin! We really enjoyed the fire pit and appreciated the firewood restock! Jessica was very responsive and flexible leading up to and throughout our stay. Highly recommend staying here if you are looking for a comfortable cabin in the woods.
2024-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great airbnb! There were thoughtful little things throughout the cabin which made it a joy to stay in, like an extra phone charger. Bed was comfy and nice to see the chickens wandering around. Thank you!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Jessica’s place is hands down one of the best stays I’ve experienced in an Airbnb. The cabin is beautiful and has everything you need. Feels like a home away from home. Perfect location for activities in the area. Short drives to several aurora viewing locations. I was even lucky enough to see a moose with her calf right next to the cabin. Definitely would recommend to anyone looking for a place outside of the city.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"one of the best Air Bnb's we have stayed at. So many extra touches, from the welcome basket, to the toiletries. just everything a person might need when away from home. We even rented their car, which was great. Would highly recommend this to anyone looking for a quiet getaway in Fairbanks. Thanks Jessica :)"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Jessica’s place was wonderful! We had an excellent stay. Check in and check out was a breeze, the amenities at the cabin went above and beyond, the location was great, and the cabin felt cozy and like a home away from home. I highly recommend Jessica’s place to anyone looking to stay in the Fairbanks area. I can see why this place is a rare find on Air Bnb, there’s not enough good things to say about it!"
2024-03-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Jessica is a very responsive host. Her cabin is delightful. She had a well-stocked cupboard complete with a basket of welcoming snacks on the countertop for our arrival. On our warmish late March visit, we enjoyed sitting on the front porch basking in the sunlight. There are plenty of boardgames and books to choose from to pass the time whilst awaiting the Aurora. We do wish the property listing would have disclosed that the cabin has neighbors to either side with sled dog kennels. This was unexpected and the dogs could be a bit noisy at times. When we inquired, Jessica responded that a moose and baby were in the area which made the dogs a little more restless and provided ear plugs. At the end of the day, the property is wonderful. And, as we have increasingly learned, it may not be that unusual for folks to have sled dogs. That said, for the urban folks out there, it will be helpful to note."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Jessica's place exceeded our expectations! We stayed there for 3 nights and saw the Northern lights every night. The cabin is located in the woods, which makes the lights easily visible from all directions. Despite being in a secluded area, we felt very safe because Jessica lives closeby and they have dogs outside protecting the property. The inside of the cabin is exactly as described and seen in the photos. The kitchen and the house overall were very well equipped, we cooked meals for three days. My husband worked from there, and the internet speed was amazing; we had no problem. The interior of the cabin is decorated so cozy, and we didn't even leave the house some days. We loved the super comfy reclining chairs, wooden stairs, and other details, especially the window nook that we spent most of our evenings chasing aurora and reading books. Jessica is a great host, so responsive, friendly, and helpful. Overall, we enjoyed our stay very much and hope to stay here again!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Really enjoyed our stay at Jessica’s place. The place was really clean, private and lots of space to separate out. Also was great that they provide a Jeep you can rent, was great in the snow. Thanks Jessica!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My husband and I were celebrating our anniversary and were hoping to see the Northern Lights.
Jessica was great and gave us tips on where to find them. We were successful twice. It was a trip we’ll never forget.
The cabin was perfect for the two of us. It was tucked away, but not too far from town. The snacks that Jessica left were an amazing touch."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Wonderful place to stay! Beautiful area and very responsive host!
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Jessica’s Airbnb was fantastic! The cabin was peaceful yet not to far away from the town. We loved seeing the moose in the morning and the amenities provided were above and beyond. We would definitely come back to stay at Jessica’s cabin again!
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We were only in Fairbanks for two nights, but staying at Jessica's place really helped us make the most of it. The cabin was warm, cozy, and easy to locate. The cabin is set away from downtown, which made it ideal for viewing the northern lights (which we were able to see from the window next to the bed!) as well as some moose lounging outside the kitchen window. The cabin was clean and very well stocked with anything we may need. Jessica even had snacks and a bottle of wine waiting for us when we arrived! Thank you for a great stay!"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Best Airbnb ever. Jessica and Aron were amazing hosts. she exceeded our expectations.
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Jessica was extremely helpful, providing us with a lot of Northern Lights guidance. The cabin is incredibly cozy, and Jessica has thoughtfully adorned every detail, even preparing numerous snacks for us. The location of the cabin is also very convenient. Highly recommended for anyone visiting Fairbanks – we will definitely be back!"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We were finally able to make a trip to AK in the winter for a possible siting of the Aurora. This place was perfectly located for going into Fairbanks when we wanted to and for getting to great spots to catch the Aurora. We were lucky enough to see it two of the four nights we were there. The place was adorable and actually matched the pictures. Aaron and Jessica were super helpful and we really enjoyed our stay.
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This cabin is perfectly out of the way from Downtown Fairbanks but not too far. The cabin had lots of little touches that put it over the top. Two bathrooms each with nice toiletries. A very well equipped kitchen, lots of extra blankets and pillows, even though the heating in the cabin worked beautifully. The location was very convenient to popular Aurora viewing areas and less than an hour to Chen Hot Springs."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My wife and I stayed here for our 1 year anniversary. The place was exactly as described in the listing with extremely beautiful surroundings. The inside was very cozy with lots of attention to detail. Jessica was amazing in her response time and giving us multiple recommendations and insight when we reached out to her for some advice. We would absolutely stay here again if we ever have the pleasure of coming back to Fairbanks.
The only thing I would say to other guests to be aware of, is that there are dogs in a kennel near the cabin. They would bark every so often, including at night time. There is a sound machine provided right by the bed (for this purpose I would guess?) which we used, and had no problem with the dogs barking. But I think it's something to be aware of before making the booking."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Jessica's cabin is beautiful. House was clean and organized. Jessica is a Wonderful host, she was always responsive. The house was provided with all amenities required for the stay. We were there in the first week of February and the stay was magical with the cabin completely surrounded by Snow. It is just 15mins away from Costco and Walmart."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"These hosts are the real deal! From answering our questions to recommending local places to visit, our inquiries were always met with cheerful responses. We enjoyed being able to rent a vehicle directly from them and the airport pick up and drop off were just the icing on the cake. They made it so convenient for us! We loved being outside of the city where it was easy to relax and enjoy the natural surroundings and yet be close enough to the hosts that if we needed help with anything, they were quite near by. It's about an hour away from Chena Hot Springs. Definitely take the time to check out that place. Lovely, relaxing cabin with all the comforts of home. Would absolutely book again if in the area. Thank you, Jessica!"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,great place!
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had such a wonderful full at the cabin. Definitely one of the best well thought of airbnb we've stayed at. The cabin was very cozy you didn't even notice the it was below 0 outside.
We spent most of our trip exploring Fairbanks. We rented her Jeep and felt completely safe driving on the icy roads. We drove down to Castner Ice Cave definitely worth a drive. And went mushing at Bill Cotter's Sled Dog Rides. It was such a wonderful experience mushing and if you have time definitely try them out. They love there dogs so much.
The last night Jessica suggested heading up to Murphy Dome to check out the Aurora. And we caught it! It was amazing!!
Overall our trip was unforgettable and we're already planning a summer visit back to Alaska. Winter time is magical now we can't wait to see the other Seasons. Give a winter Alaska visit a try you want regret it."
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"A very nice place, recommend. Clean and cozy.
The breakfast kit is helpful as sometimes we would like to head out right away instead of stopping at the town to grab some food.
There’s a pack of dogs living near by, when we pulled our car at the door at night, there’s always one coming towards to check what’s happening, and others barking in the background. Don’t be scared they won’t attack."
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay in Fairbanks.
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,12/26-12/29/23. We went to Fairbanks hoping to see aurora. But we didn’t want to spend all night outside at aurora viewing locations. We were able to see aurora just outside of Jessica’s cabin. At one point we could even see it through the window from inside of the cabin. Inside of the cabin is very cozy and comfortable. Kitchen had everything we needed and more.
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Merry Christmas!
We had a really good experience in your home, it’s large, clean and has all kinds of tools we might use. The chairs are so comfortable, kitchen has full functions. And washer and dryer let us could fresh our clothes.
Thank you so much and hope we could live again when we come to Alaska."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"We only got to stay for one day and night, but we were stunned by how amazing the cabin and host were! The cabin and surrounding property were absolutely beautiful and looked just like the pictures. We visited in December and the snow made the area all the more peaceful (and showed the fresh moose tracks in the morning). Jessica was amazing from the time we booked and has really thought of everything to make this a perfect place to stay for anyone. ANYTHING you could need is there for you. She provided information about the cabin and check-in right away, as well as plenty of information in the cabin about the surrounding area and activities. We would gladly stay again and hopefully for a longer visit next time!"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We had such a great time staying at Jessica’s cabin. The description of the location and amenities offered were accurate and she was very quick and helpful in her responses. I would recommend this stay to anyone and definitely hope to make it back again!
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a great stay at Jessica's! It was extremely cold outside (to us) but the cabin was warm and cozy and literally had anything and everything we needed. There were even snacks that were way above and beyond our expectations.
Our goal was to see the Northern Lights and power through our Christmas cards. Alas, it was overcast and snowy for much of our visit but on the last night, the skies cleared for a bit and we saw a very faint aurora. (We think we might try again on a shoulder season). But we did get through all our card writing so achieved that goal.
We liked the quiet country setting but were fairly timid about driving in the snow. Even so, town is not far so it was the best of both worlds. Jessica checked in quite often and was very responsive to the few questions we had.
I'd highly recommend this spot - it's a real find."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Jessica was very helpful and the place was beautiful. Far away from the city that the stars were very clearly seen. Would highly recommend this place for a quiet get away
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,Felt very cozy and at home! Great host for our family getaway and would recommend to anyone!
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Even better than advertised. Extremely clean and very cozy. Cabin was easily accessible to town but made you feel like you were miles and miles away from any town. Cabin has everything we needed and more. Jessica and her husband went out of their way to make sure we were comfortable and made great suggestions of things to do and where to go for a great experience. My husband and I are already looking at dates to come back and will definitely be booking the cabin again!!!!
2023-11-01,5,Stayed about a week,Very nice place that on the way to Chena Hot Springs! Quiet place and friendly hosts that are always responsive. Very clean rooms that have everything we need. Will come back for sure!
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We enjoyed our stay very much. It was the perfect place for our Alaskan honeymoon. Thank you!
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Jessica’s Tanglewood Inn was the *perfect* retreat for our short trip to Alaska. From booking to check out Jessica was responsive and always had recommendations for Northern Lights viewing or whatever else we needed. 12/10 would recommend Tanglewood Inn, beautiful, clean, comfortable, and well equipped! Thank you for an amazing experience for our wonderful trip!!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"The place was beautiful, extremely clean, and was just like the listing. Bed was comfortable and place was very cozy. My only complaint was the amount of dogs barking the entire night, completely out of the hosts hands, but was definitely a little annoying. Overall great place!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Jessica and her family were amazing. The cabin was more than we expected! Pretty and cozy!
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Planning to stay here again, when we visit Alaska in the future! extremely helpful host and amazing location/cabin."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This Airbnb could be in the dictionary under quaint Alaskan cabin. From when we first contacted Jessica, she was so helpful with recommendations for things to do and places to eat. We even ended up renting their Cherokee for our stay. I will be recommending this place to all our friends looking for a Fairbanks getaway and if we go back, there is no other place I would stay. The cabin had all the touches of home in a great vacation location."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"Beautiful, cozy, comfortable cabin stocked with amenities and everything you need for an Alaskan adventure. Lots of small touches and details to make guests feel at home.
Looking forward to coming back to catch the aurora. This would be a great spot for it."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"A lovely little cabin that was very cozy and clean. Was exactly as the pictures show. Not quite as private as I thought it would be but Jessica was a wonderful host, very kind with excellent communication. We had a great anniversary staycation!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay!
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was one of the most well equipped air bnb’s I have ever had the pleasure of staying in. Not only did the space have everything we needed and more, but Jessica was an amazing host. From answering any questions we had to local recommendations, and more, Jessica was incredible. The home was comfy, peaceful, and beautiful along with clean and inviting. If we are lucky enough to make it to Fairbanks again, I will definitely be staying at Tanglewood."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Best Airbnb we have ever stayed at! Jessica was amazing to work with! The cabin was comfortable and looks just like the pictures! The property is lovely, I loved drinking hot cocoa on the porch! We rented their Jeep and it was perfect! Jessica is an AMAZING host!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We came here not knowing what to expect and leave here with our hearts full.
Coming from a very tropical country and this being our first encounter with snow was a shock but your cabin in the woods gave us everything and more. You thought of everything! Great job Jessica!
Since the moment we stepped in my boyfriend felt like home, he instantly knew where all things were, kitchen speaking (he does the cooking) and it is so cozy you just wanna stay here and understand why you live here. We came here to celebrate my boyfriend’s 50th birthday and with your recommendations was incredible! Sorry again for my clueless mind 😅. You weren’t lying when you said that we can see the Aurora from the front door and boy oh boy it didn’t disappoint ! The aurora was a dream come true. Lucky you! Definitely we are recommending your cabin.
Mucha gracias desde el fondo de nuestro corazón!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"best way to end our trip. the place was well stocked, clean, and cozy. Jessica was so nice and accommodating. loved it!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was a great little cabin. It was very clean and well stocked with coffee and snacks. If the Aurora is active, you can see them from here."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed about a week,This place was so great! Jessica was an amazing host and the cabin was beautiful and perfect. We got to see the aurora and Jessica sent us a message when there was a great viewing night! Her husband Aaron even built us a fire pit when we asked if there was a place we could have a camp fire. I can't think of a better place to stay in all of Fairbanks.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What a wonderful stay we had at Tanglewood Inn! The cabin is SO lovely and Jessica has filled it with every amenity you could need for a comfortable, cozy visit. We loved sitting out on the porch in the evenings. The location is perfect; we loved being away from town but close enough to drive in. Being on Chena Hot Springs Road made hiking (don’t miss Angel Rocks!) and outdoor activities easily accessible. Jessica was a great host with recommendations for activities, restaurants, etc and she was always available. We would definitely stay here again!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,My boyfriend and I loved our stay at Jessica’s place. We felt right at home and everything was perfect. Jessica was also responsive and very helpful. We would definitely stay here again!
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,Excellent communication from Jessica from the beginning. The place was spotless and cozy. Its perfect for couples and would highly recommend. Cabin is close to super markets making stay more convenient. Will definitely visit again for a longer stay.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I booked this trip for my parents and we all agree it was five stars from the time of reservation to the check out date! Jessica went above and beyond to ensure my parents had a lovely stay at the quaint Tanglewood Cabin. Communication was always friendly and prompt. She offered many local attractions/resources for them to explore during their stay. My parents felts right at home in a cabin that offered multiple amenities, but the peaceful surrounding was what they loved the most. Forever grateful for what Jessica and I were able to team up and pull off for my parents. It was a true trip of a lifetime for them! #thegreatalaskanadventure"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place was awesome. It actually is cute and cozy, and we found the location to be perfect: close enough to town, but also it gives you a head start if you’re heading out to the hot springs. And it’s big enough for some space if one of you goes to bed earlier (the other person could hang out downstairs. Thanks for the fresh eggs too, Jessica!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"I can’t recommend Jessica’s cabin highly enough. It is a perfect Alaskan cabin, so homely with many lovely touches and thought into what a guest may want. Everything has been provided and all you need to do is arrive and enjoy the comfort and peaceful surrounds. Jessica is a great host and we hope to come back and stay longer next time!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Cute little place and easy to find.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Jessica’s cabin was very cozy and made us feel at home. The cabin was off the main roadway and was relatively quiet. We even passed a herd of cows on the way in. Definitely would stay there again.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"We’ve stayed at several Air BnB’s before and most are great. But, Tanglewood Inn was by far the cleanest I’ve ever been in, and the most stocked with kitchen items. If we were staying for a few days there were lot and options for food preparation. It was great in every way!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We had an absolutely amazing stay in Jessica's cabin. I highly recommend her cabin to anyone visiting Fairbanks!
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This cabin was very cozy and well stocked with amenities. It is not far from downtown Fairbanks or Chena River State Recreation Area for great hikes. The cabin was even stocked with bear spray and insect repellent. Jessica is an excellent hostess and very responsive.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great cabin & host! Jessica was very helpful and responsive. Cabin was clean, homey and perfect for our stay in Fairbanks. It was about 20 minutes from the airport/town, but worth the drive in my opinion."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We enjoyed our stay at Jessica’s cabin. She is a wonderful host- very responsive and friendly. The cabin is charming and comfortable, with lots of amenities and extras - from snacks, to coffee, tea, and a big selection of games. I especially appreciated the eye patches provided- which helped me go to sleep when it stays light out until super late in the summer. We definitely recommend the place. Thanks Jessica!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Once again, we had a very pleasant stay at Tanglewood while visiting family that lives in the Chena Hot Springs Road area. Highly recommended."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a great stay. Jessica checked in before we arrived and after to make sure that everything was as expected. The cabin was super clean and comfy, and the snacks left on the cabinet upon our late arrival were a very welcome treat. Private with no traffic noise. We would absolutely stay here again."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Jessica’s cabin was perfect for us. She has been so thoughtful preparing the space for guests. The bed is comfortable and the linens are good quality. Having a half bath in the loft was one of the main reasons for choosing her place.
Jessica made excellent suggestions for us including an outdoor concert in the day of our arrival. She even provided a cloth for us so we could have a picnic.
To top it off, she rents her keep Cherokee, which made our arrangements even easier."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,Great location and wonderful host!
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The cabin is in a perfect location for privacy and that ""out of town"" feel. The owner is very helpful with recommendations. Kitchen has local cook books. There is plenty of Alaska unique qualities of this home. Its a genuine log cabin so it really doesn't get better than that. The only thing that might dull the experience is the dog sled team nearby. Only because of the occasional howling. If you love dogs and don't mind them, this shouldnt be a problem. However if your a lite sleeper you might get woken up to howling. (Ear plugs are the solution here) I do appreciate the owner for training them to be quiet at night as they did not howl at night... but come morning (~7/8am) they are awake and will let the whole neighborhood know about it. Overall though it was a beauitful cabin and the perfect place for a weekend."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Jessica and her husband are super host. They are very responsive from beginning till we get there and finally leave. The cabin is amazing its cute and super comfy. All the things you ever needed is there from pots and pans down to even ziploc bags.
Her house have 2 restroom that is very nice touch, one in the bedroom and one dow stairs. They live just at the back of the cabin so if ever there is any need for anything it is easy to ask them.
The cabin is so clean and smells clean too. They take really good care of the property. The cabin have a lot of magazine to read. I recommend to read the Tanglewood Cabin book there you can find all the things to do and to go.
Over all it was a fun 5 days and 4 nights stay.
Aimee"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This place is off the beaten path and quiet! The host has literally thought of everything. Communication was perfect. Would definitely come back!
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Tanglewood Inn was a perfect retreat. 12 miles from Fairbanks; an easy drive on well-paved roads, provided seclusion with every amenity we could have desired (and no tv to distract you from the beauty of nature). We had accessibility to all the activities we wanted in the area as well as a peaceful, modern, quiet spot to regroup & refresh. Internet was reliable, if not lightning fast. Remember, this IS rural Alaska! Jessica is flexible, responsive, friendly, & sincere. She respects guests' privacy yet is accessible whenever necessary. Photos & descriptions accurately reflect the cabin & don't even begin to describe all the items provided as a matter of course that improved our stay--food items stocked, for example, that we didn't think of and would have required a trip back to town. Also: an abundance of towels, blankets, toiletries, games, books, flashlights, even bug spray & a white noise machine! Up-to-date appliances--including washer & dryer--made our stay even easier"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed about a week,"The perfect get away.
It wasn't to far out of town but far enough that it was very easy to find and was surrounded by very beautiful scenery. It is located on the owners land but we were not disturbed at all, aside from the cutest dogs comming up to say hello (Jessica always informed us if they would be doing work around the cabin). The inside look exactly as pictured, even more cute then that. Everything was included like towels, toiletries, dishes, and more like sleep masks and bug spray. Fully plumbed with shower, sinks, dish washer, and washer/dryer combo which is extremely hard to find, most cabins are dry cabins. Even being a bit out of fairbanks the provided wifi worked amazingly. Everything was extremely clean and well kept! Jessica was responsive, on top of checking in if we needed anything, friendly. Reminded me of bed and breakfasts I stayed at as a kid. Definitely one of the best places I have ever stayed, host and housing wise. Highly recommend could not have been happier"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed about a week,Cute little cabin
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I had a wonderful stay at Tanglewood! if I get the chance to stay again, I definitely would. The whole cabin is incredibly cute and cozy. I loved the setup. Very clean and private. I saw a little ermine run by the property and that was sweet to see. the location is the perfect distance between Chena Hot Springs and town, along with many wonderful trails to hike. I stayed from May 26-28th and the weather was beautiful. Jessica is super helpful too! Thank you so much for the stay. It was the best way I could have spent my 30th birthday!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"One of the best rentsl places we've stayed. Greats hosts, best stocked place ever. Awesome decor. Definitely stay there again!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Very comfortable, quiet and clean"
2023-04-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"This was our second stay, and the place was just as clean with upscale amenities as during our first stay summer 2022. Pre-breakup (of ice and snow) in April was just not a good time to be on their road. The owners helped us dig out our rental car one day, and then we helped dig out their SUV the next day. Any other time of the year, I would highly recommend Tanglewood Inn."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"It is the perfect accommodation with everything
They were attentive to the convenience of our guests and actively resolved any inconveniences or difficulties during our stay.
It's a great place to rest because it's peaceful and quiet. I want to stay again"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Jessica’s place was exactly what I had in mind when I planned my trip to Alaska. I’d love to come back again.
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Jessica’s place was so thoughtfully decorated and the stay was amazing. She is a very responsive and helpful host, making herself available and even leaving us a cute welcome basket! We had an absolute blast exploring glaciers and watching the northern lights. Her place has everything you could need! Highly recommend staying here if you’re exploring Fairbanks or hunting the aurora!"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The cabin was lovely. it was very comfortable and cozy, off the beaten path, so very quiet. A good location for Aurora viewing when active. The access road is not plowed in snow, so you will need to plan for that if visiting in winter. Highly recommend."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful cabin. Absolutely charming and felt like home
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Jessica was amazing. She picked us up and took us to the airport in her jeep that we rented. She told us about several local places to eat and shop that were great. The Airbnb was outside Fairbanks just enough to feel that you were in the country but close enough to Fairbanks to enjoy the town. We were also able to walk outdoors to see the Aurora Lights. Be sure to check with your camera or camera phone for the lights. We didn’t see anything with the naked eye but the camera brought the lights to life. There was several choices of games on the shelves to enjoy in the evenings while checking for the lights. She checked on us during the stay to make sure everything was ok. Thanks again for a great stay.
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Absolutely enjoyed our stay at tanglewood Inn.
We saw the northern lights on the first night upon arrival right at the front porch. The next morning we met the neighbors kids chasing squirrels in the woods with air guns. Already felt Alaskan 😁. We came mainly for the aurora so we explored several other places including aurora pointe, cleary summit and a trading post 1.5 hrs north to Fairbanks. In the end we concluded that the aurora we saw at tanglewood Inn is as good as other locations. Basically, the light pollution is low (no city lights and no cars in and out at public viewing locations), no long driving needed around midnight plus a hot drink is just steps away.
The place is also very clean. The bed is comfortable and the recliners are essential for resting after a long day. Clearly Jessica thought about it all. So big thanks!"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Jessica's cabin is sooo good! It's not only somewhere you can live for a while, like a hotel, but also an uniqie and special experience. The cabin has everything we need, and it's just like a friend's home. Snacks, drinks, eggs, .etc... Jess is also one of the best hosts I've ever had: very friendly and communicative. She's running this business with love. Would definitely come back again when we visit Alaska next time!"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful little cabin in the woods of Fairbanks. It is in property with the owners but I never saw them and they did not interfere with our stay at all. We had everything we needed and many things were already provided by the hosts. Jess is super responsive and proactive in her communications. She was a pleasure to do business with and I would stay at the cabin again. Exactly what we were looking for in our first trip to Fairbanks.
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Nice little cabin off the beaten path. But Jessica was very helpful 💯
To advising us on how many layers we should pack to which local restaurants are favorites.
Great get away.
Happy we went!!"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"I am so happy we found Jessica's cabin. it is tucked back in the woods and totally private, but close to town with plenty of things to do. the cabin was something out of a movie. so adorable and cozy, with so many well thought out amenities. very comfy chairs and bed. The window nook was fun to sit and watch for the lights, which we saw many nights we were there. It was great for viewing the northern lights, especially having a toddler. we were able to put him to bed and stay warm inside, until the aurora arrived. Jessica was more than helpful and extremely responsive. she is full of information and happy to give local recommendations. we truly hope to come visit again and will definitely stay here and see our new friends again. oh, and it was spotless, a huge plus! thank you!!!!"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Incredible place tucked away like a hidden jewel in Fairbanks. So many well thought out amenities. Peaceful, with beautiful surroundings. Fantastic views of the Northern Lights. The host was in constant communication ensuring our comforts; although we couldn’t have been more comfortable. A dream come true. We can’t wait to stay here again during the summer months."
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Cabin was amazing! Cozy, clean, hot shower, soft lazy boy chairs in the living room, and a good furnace kept the place warm for us after spending the day out in the cold. I Really enjoyed a hot cup of coffee on the front porch in the peaceful environment every morning"
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I travel a lot and have stayed in many Airbnbs; Tanglewood Inn is a complete gem! The cabin is as cute as the pictures, spotless, very comfortable, and incredibly well stocked. We even got fresh eggs from their chickens. Jess thought of everything!
The location was close enough to the city to run to restaurants/shops but far enough from the city lights to see the Auroras right from the deck!
By far the best thing about Tanglewood Inn are the hosts. From the start, Jessica was a source of valuable information and made our trip so easy. She helped us with a rental car, dog sledding tours, where to catch the auroras, and must see events during our stay. She was always there for us.
If you need to rent a car, take advantage of what they have to offer. We rented a great 4WD Jeep and Aaron even picked us up and dropped us off at the airport! He is super nice and a wealth of information. Awesome trip! I feel like I’ve just returned from visiting friends 😊
Thank you, Jess, Aaron & Family!"
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Tanglewood Inn far exceeded our expectations! If I could give it more than 5 stars I would! Jessica is an amazing host, very helpful and communicating was wonderful. We were able to see the northern lights from the cabin during our stay! HIGHLY recommend when visiting the Fairbanks area."
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Tanglewood Inn was everything I hoped for and more! Jessica had just the right about amount of communication to help us feel comfortable. When we arrived, she was even thoughtful enough to leave me a small birthday present and card - so sweet! The cabin was spotlessly clean and the amenities were exactly as described but even better than we expected! She thought of everything! It was an incredibly peaceful and relaxing stay. We were able to see the Northern Lights by stepping outside of the cabin, thanks to some tracking recommendations she made. It was the kind of vacation that we will be talking about for years to come! Honestly, she may have spoiled us for other Airbnb’s. It will be hard to match her hospitality, cabin and location. Hurry up, book this location now! You won’t regret it."
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was the perfect place to stay for our first time in Alaska! It’s secluded and quaint, far enough outside of the town where you can feel more nature than city.
Jessica is very in tune with what would be needed for a guest staying out of the direct reach of downtown, making it easy to have a cozy night in.
Jessica was very communicative before and during the stay, making sure that you are enjoying your time and curious about the things you are enjoying in her town.
I would stay here again if I come back!"
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Loved Tanglewood cabin! Beautiful setting and full of great amenities! Thank you for hosting me. I will return next time I’m in Fairbanks!
2023-01-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Truly an outstanding experience - I simply can't recommend Tanglewood Inn enough! It was the perfect location for our first visit to Alaska. Jessica was so helpful both during our week-long stay and in the weeks leading up to our vacation - providing local recommendations, an opportunity to rent a vehicle if needed, and answering all of our questions.
The cabin was the ideal jumping off point for all of our activities in the Fairbanks area - dog sledding, a reindeer walk, ice climbing, Denali National Park, the Chena Hot Springs, and the stores and restaurants in the city. Despite several cloudy nights, we were fortunate enough to see the Northern Lights from the Airbnb just like we were hoping!"
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"If I could rate Tanglewood at 10000/10000 I would. I’ve stayed in multiple air bnbs and this cabin was the most comfortable and “at home” I’ve ever felt. The cabin is well decorated and every room has a rustic vibe. It also was equipped with everything you need ranging from cozy blankets, books, board games, snacks, cleaning supplies, multiple recommendations for things to do in Fairbanks, and more!
If you’re concerned about internet being spotty in a rural area, rest assure the wifi is fast and has no issues when studying and streaming movies.
The auroras were visible almost every night (some nights faint and others obvious).
Jessica is thorough and is available to address your concerns and questions. She never made me feel like I was bothering her (even when I had silly/random questions). You can feel her sincerity in wanting to ensure your stay at Tanglewood is the BEST.
Would stay here again, no doubt about it!"
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Wonderful location, Jessica is a great and communicative host. Place was well stocked and great charm."
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,What a great place to stay and experience Fairbanks and it’s surroundings. We were lucky to find this place on AirBnB and spend our Christmas here. We immediately fell in love with the cabin and this wonderful country. Jess went above and beyond advising us on where to best see the northern lights (tracking forecasts and sharing her recommendations). The cabin offers everything we need and more! It was also a pleasure to meet Aaron and all the dogs! If we could we would stay longer!! Thank you!
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I hope i'll come this place with my gf before i pass away.
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Jessica's place was quiet and beautiful, a nice place to watch for the aurora, and not so far out of town to make a run there so inconvenient. She was super helpful and responsive to messages just about any time of day. Thank you!"
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We could not have been happier staying here. Every single thing that we could have wanted was there. Everything was clean and perfect. The cabin is far enough out of town to be peaceful and have a dark sky, but still close enough to be convenient. Truly the perfect location.
Jessica was very helpful in making good recommendations. We would absolutely stay again!"
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Jessica is an amazing host and very responsive, She also knows the area well we were able to catch a glimpse of the northern lights on her recommendation
the house is cute and perfectly distant from many good viewpoints"

2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We loved staying here! The cabin is off the beaten bath but not too far out of town. It’s as cute as any small cabin and really feels like homey. Everything was clean and fresh and you could tell the host put thought into preparing every space. We were able to see the lights right outside the door. This would be my first option if returning to Fairbanks!
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,They went above and beyond with little touches here and there that made us feel special and welcomed got to see the lights and check out the area we’d definitely go back it was perfect thanks you guys
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Stopped here for 2 nights at the start of our Alaskan Vacay. Easy check-in, accurate description, and great attention to detail! You can truly tell Jessica takes pride in the cabin. Sure hope we will be back again!"
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Amazing Airbnb where all the details have been taken care of (even snacks!). The cabin was perfect for my stay; I’d absolutely stay here again when in the area.

2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place is good!
Highly recommend!!"
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Jessica and her husband were amazing hosts! The cabin was surprisingly well stocked with snacks. Full amenities aside from a TV (which we liked). They are very respectful of your privacy, but more than willing to answer any questions or help if you ask. From enough from town to feel like you're in the wilderness, but only 20 minutes away from Fairbanks. Would stay again!"
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This place is super adorable and awesome! We wanted to enjoy our anniversary and Jessica went above and provided an amazing experience for our trip!
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Highly recommend staying here. It's cozy welcoming, charming and very well supplied. Great location for viewing aurora, scenic hike and hot springs. Jessica puts a lot of thought into making the home welcoming and it shows. She was very accommodating and friendly. We thoroughly enjoyed staying here and hope to do so again."
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,You can not go wrong renting this place! I can not imagine a host better than Jessica. our ONLY disappointment was that it was cloudy during our stay and we did not see the Auroras. other than that our stay was perfect
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Super nice cabin, very well equipped with everything you need. Quiet location outside of Fairbanks. We‘ll be back for sure!"
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I can't say enough about how great our stay was. The place is well stocked. Jessica is friendly and helpful. The instructions were clear. The checkout time is generous. It's a little outside town but exactly what we were looking for.
2022-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,Perfect get-away retreat located only minutes from downtown Fairbanks! Highly recommend!
2022-08-01,5,Stayed about a week,Jessica is an amazing hostess. Her cabin is the perfect location to be close to town but still be in the country. The cabin itself is adorable and she adds so many extras in the cabin for your stay. She communicated with me the whole stay. Highly recommend!
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great combination of Alaskan decor with upscale amenities, like plush blankets, thick towels, high thread-count sheets, and numerous small appliances in the kitchen."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed about a week,"All I can is WOW!
After almost giving up on Airbnb, this was the place that made up for all the duds!
Everything in the description and more! The perfect spot for the person who wants to get away but not to far from anything in town. Jessica is a great host and looks out for the client. This was the BEST Airbnb we have ever used! My wife is a city girl who loved this place from day 1. All I can say is don't hesitate to stay here!
Anthony"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Jessica is a great host, and had an awesome time."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,A great place to stay out of the hussle of Fairbanks. Everything you could want in a cabin stay Jessica has provided. A very clean comfortsble place with an exceptional host.
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Lovely cabin in the outskirts of Fairbanks. Well stocked kitchen and bath. Communication was fantastic and check-in was a breeze!

2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This little gem is just what we needed to get away from the big city. Jessica had thought of everything, even down to the snacks and games. We even saw a moose at the front door. She replies quickly and genuinely wants to know if you’re enjoying your stay. Would start here again."
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Jessica was communicative and attentive without being too much. The home is cozy classic Alaskan, but with great Wi-Fi! I would definitely stay there again!"
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The place is very private and quiet. No tv but theres an internet which is nice. My children and I enjoyed the bored games. It is cute little place but not so little. Its very spacious and everything you will need is in it. My favorite is the stairs and the bathroom upstairs. Kitchen is really nice and whatever you need is in there. You don't have to get anything from store except of course the food you'll make. My partner and I really loves it. When we come back next time. We will come to this place again. Highly recommended. Miss Jessica is very responsive and i am very thankful.
2022-05-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Perfect for two people.
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The place was great! I really enjoyed the cabin feel and all the amenities the place offered. Check in was easy and communication was great. I definitely recommend!
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,A wonderful taster of Alaska. Was just as advertised.
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The Tanglewood Inn was amazing! We loved our stay and Jessica was a perfect host. The location is great as well to be a little closer to Chena, but still close to downtown as well. The cabin is put together so nicely and has everything you need. Would definitely stay again."
2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We had an absolute wonderful time!Stayed 3 nights here. On the last night we saw a moose in the yard and the northern lights! So awesome! The owner Jess is easy to talk to and will definitely help you anyway she can.
2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,A truly enjoyable place to stay; I can’t recommend enough.. and a bargain at that (it’s an exceptional value for how nice the place is and it’s amenities). Jessica is a great host. Highly recommend and zero complaints
2022-04-01,4,Stayed with kids,"This cabin has everything you need to have a wonderful stay. The location is very central, far enough, yet close to things and attractions. We were able to spot the auroras every night from the cabin. Jessica is wonderful to work with, fast response and cordial at all times. I would definitely stay here again!"
2022-04-01,5,Stayed about a week,"This little cabin is the perfect place to be if you want to be close to the city but still have a nice warm, secluded and unforgettable experience in Fairbanks, Alaska. We were able to see Aurora from the front porch too...which was pretty amazing.
Jessica is a great host and she made our stay even better. She kept in constant contact with us and even gave us pointers to when we can view the aurora. She is amazing! The house is clean and no TV means no distraction so you can enjoy the surroundings and have an experience. They have games in the cabin which u can enjoy with your family and loved ones.
I would recommend this place to everyone"
2022-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This place is fabulous. We had a wonderful stay. It is quiet, peaceful, close enough to everything we wanted, wonderful hosts, and the place is beautiful."
2022-03-01,5,Stayed about a week,"This place is a great location for those that want to have ‘one foot in-town and the other foot towards the wilderness”. It’s very close to the shopping of Fairbanks, and at a location that’s great for heading up the Steese to Cleary or up the Elliott.. or Chena Hot Springs. Jessica was great during my stay and very inquisitive for suggestions to improve the comfort of her guests. I’ll state here what I told her.. that there is nothing I would change; the cabin is very well thought out and practical. It has a bathroom upstairs and downstairs.. which is nice not having to go up and down the steps in the middle of the night. It has a washer/dryer, which is priceless for any stays over a night or 2. The kitchen is well appointed, everything is new and clean. Jessica seems to really care about her guests.. it was a great stay from the location, the property itself, and the host (Jessica). It’s a fairly new place on Airbnb.. but book without hesitation, this delivers it all."
2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,What a spectacular place to stay! It's just far enough out of town to get the country feel but close enough to the city to feel connected and have things close by. I loved the decor and the vibe of the cabin. Jessica is an amazing host that was there if I needed anything and also offered great suggestions on things to do and check out. I could tell she spent alot of time and effort in decorating and adding great touches around the cabin like a welcome snacks and a very thoughtful guest book. I am so glad I booked my stay here and wish I could have stayed longer. I will definitely stay here again and would highly recommend to others also.
2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,the cabin is in good condition and the owner is super helpful. I would highly recommend rent this cabin. There’s everything you need in there. 5🌟
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Everything about the cabin was perfect for me—I particularly enjoyed the balcony overlooking the river, although frozen and covered in snow, it was a beautiful view. I will most definitely come back for a summer trip at Riverbend Cabins!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Perfect cabin for 2! Great midpoint between Fairbanks and hot springs and close to North Pole. Beautiful scenery and nice balcony for Borealis viewing. Heather was sweet and helpful! Would definitely stay there again!
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The cabin was cozy and charming and just perfect for the two of us. It was well appointed with everything I might want and check in and instructions were clear and concise. Heather even reached out to tell me when the Aurora was visible and where I might see it. All in all it couldn’t have been better and we were very happy with our experience here!
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The place was incredible! Saw the lights from the porch! Heather was super responsive! Highly recommend!
2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"Heather and Gary were incredibly accommodating hosts. Our stay was cut short due to a family emergency and we didn’t even end staying at the cabin a second day/night, just used it for a day while waiting to catch a last minute flight home. Without hesitation Heather offered a refund for the second day and was extremely kind during a tough situation. The cabin itself was absolutely everything I would’ve wanted in a stay - cozy, clean, comfortable, and an amazing location right on the river. We even had a great view of northern lights on our way out that evening, so I can only imagine how nice it would’ve been later at night. I really wish we could’ve stayed but I already have this place bookmarked if I ever find myself in Fairbanks again."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed about a week,"This cute and cozy cabin was perfect for two and had everything we needed. It was the perfect location for our time in Fairbanks. It was far enough away from the city without being remote, and there were many options for food or exploration just a short drive away. This spot on the river was beautiful and was great for Aurora spotting - we were able to see the lights right outside the cabin! Heather & Gary were very responsive, helpful, and friendly. This was one of the best Airbnbs I’ve stayed in, and I would definitely recommend it to anyone. Hope to be back!"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We stayed for just two nights but wish it was longer! The cabin is adorable, and even when it was 30 below outside, we were cozy inside. We saw a mom and baby moose outside the window when we woke up! I’d come back to stay anytime."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I can't say enough great things about this little place. Such a beautiful property. Remote enough to have incredible aurora views, but didn't feel completely isolated from other things. Super friendly hosts who were incredibly accommodating. Great communication on their end. Such a pleasant experience. I'm so glad we chose to stay here!"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I can’t tell you enough how brilliant this little place was during our Alaska Adventure. Cute. Cozy. And comfortable.
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Heather & Gary were extremely helpful, just awesome hosts all together,
the cabin was comfortable & cozy,
definitely worth the trip up..."
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Stayed during the winter season. The directions and explanation to check-in were very thorough and easy to understand. The room was clean and equipped with all the necessary amenities for a convenient and comfortable stay. The decor is wonderfully uniform and adds to the feeling of spending a moment in Fairbanks Alaska. The surrounding environment was beautiful and natural, and I was able to enjoy the stars and the best Northern Lights. It was a great lodge and well worth the visit!"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Perfect cabin for a couple! We only had a short stay at one day and two nights, but we loved our time here. The cabin is so cute and looks just like the pictures. We visited in December and the snow made the area all the more peaceful, and we were still able to enjoy walking on the beautiful property down to the river! Our hosts were amazing from the time we booked, sending a bunch of information about not only the cabin and check-in info but also the surrounding area and recommendations. We would gladly stay again!"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Amazing stay. The host were wonderful and the cabin was just right for my wife and I.
2023-11-01,5,Stayed about a week,"We absolutely loved Sourdough cabin. I and my wife stayed here for 8 days and Heather and Gary were amazing hosts. Cabin was exactly how it’s described in the listing and shown in pics. We had -20 to -25 C weather during our stay but cabin was cosy and warm. We never had any issues with hot water for bathing or clean water for drinking.
We were easily able to work from home for a day ( they are upgrading the internet to Starlink - for folks who are planning to wfh) , drive to downtown Fairbanks for groceries and to restaurants near by.
We were fortunate enough to see Aurora Borealis 4/8 nights during our stay here. Area surrounding cabin is pretty scenic - great for experiencing both sunrise and sunset or go for leisurely strolls.
It’s only 20-25 mins drive to most of the areas worth visiting Museum of the North, Alaska Bowl or tour starting points.
In case you want to travel to Fairbanks to watch Northern lights or to experience Alaska, this is the cabin you want to stay at."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The cabin was small & cozy which was perfect! Had a lot of outdoor space to go exploring. Hosts were really nice and responsive! Will definitely come back!
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The cabin is just as pictured. The location is peaceful and beautiful. Heather went above and beyond to accommodate me to make sure my stay was as perfect as it could be. I wanted to see the northern light but unfortunately, the weather didn't permit it, however, I still saw the beautiful starry sky and shooting stars! This place is wonderful and I would love to stay here again if I'm back at the location!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Cabin is adorable, with beautiful surroundings and the perfect size for a couple. Heather is very informative and responsive. Bed is incredibly comfortable. Cabin is exactly as pictured. Would highly recommend this Host."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Adorable cabin and the hosts are so kind, responsive, and helpful! 10/10 - I’d recommend for anyone to stay here."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is the coziest little cabin I've ever stayed in. My wife and I stayed here as part of our 10th anniversary vacation, and it was perfect. Heather was super helpful, and even provided us with a useful online resource for tracking the Aurora, which is the only reason we were able to see it on a midnight adventure nearby! A great, calm, quiet getaway on a private stretch of river. Would have loved to stay longer!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,2nd time here and just absolutely love the vibe! Heather is amazing to work with and responds quickly!
2023-10-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Adorable, cozy cabin for two in a great location! Beautiful river on the property, and the balcony is a wonderful perk. Our only complaint was the mattress was very soft and unsupportive, we both found it difficult to get comfortable and fall asleep. It felt like we were sinking in the bed. Other than that it was a lovely stay!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Heather & Gary went above and beyond for our stay. They were extremely communicative and helpful, making our first visit to Alaska memorable. We even got engaged under the northern lights thanks to their help. Thank you both again for everything, we’ll definitely be returning!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Wonderful, peaceful cabin for the two of us. Far enough from the city lights to see the Aurora Borealis from the balcony or down by the river, but close enough that getting to any restaurant or activity was easy. The river setting and fire pits were wonderful and so relaxing. Heather and Gary are awesome hosts! Helpful, friendly, full of suggestions and always prompt to reply. We left feeling like we'd made new friends! Recommend the Sourdough Cabin highly for any couple!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great little cabin on the water. Was smaller than I expected but it was cozy and enjoyable.
2023-09-01,2,Stayed a few nights,"Upon finally arriving at Sourdough Cabin, we had some trouble reaching the owner as they did not respond to our messages or calls. To confirm that we were at the right place, my husband walked around the cabin. Since the owner had mentioned that the cabin would be open, my husband opened it, and we went inside. Unfortunately, we had to carry our luggage from the car onto the wet grass, and one of our new suitcase wheels broke.
The cabin was advertised as a 5-star accommodation, but it turned out to be a 2-star Airbnb. The furniture looked old, and the space was cramped. We had to search for the pots and pans, and upon finding them, I noticed that some of them were not clean and some of the glasses were dusty. I had to re-clean the place and wash the pots and glasses again, which was quite a hassle for just two people. Although backpackers might find this place suitable, I would not recommend it for couples."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We really enjoyed our stay. It’s a perfect cozy cabin with all the basic amenities and beautiful river access. Heather and Gary were responsive and accommodating to our requests. We would recommend this property and consider visiting again in winter!
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"One of the most peaceful bnb experiences we’ve yet had! The cabin was immaculate, beautifully located, and Heather & Gary were great hosts! Wished we could have spent more time there!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The Sourdough Cabin was perfect for the two of us to stay at while we explored the Fairbanks area. It was cozy, cute, and comfortable. Everything was very clean and the setting was peaceful."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Wonderful cozy cabin with wonderful hosts, would recommend to anyone!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Heather and Gary were so accommodating—we had flight delays and they assured us our cabin was ready when we arrived. I highly recommend this cabin— so close to so many locations.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Heather and Gary's cabin was very comfortable nd cozy. The first floor with living area and kitchen was smallish, but very liva le and pleasant . The bedroom upstairs was very roomy, and the bed very comfortable.
The outside spaces were great...a front porch with swing and bench and an upstairs balcony with bistro table and chairs. There were fire pits which we had no chance to use.
Being on the river was super. Fairbanks was a bit urban, but this cabin was pleasantly rural.
Our hosts were super friendly and accommodating. ...and helpful with local restaurant and ""to do"" suggestions. We had a great Japanese meal in town, and our hosts told us about North Pole Crepery...super!!!!
We.spent only one night here...We were very pleased with all that was offered by our hospitable hosts."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Perfect location and highly recommend this place!
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We really enjoyed the cozy cabin. It was just perfect for the two of us. Hope we can make it back during the winter to experience the northern lights. Thanks again Heather and Gary!
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Had a lovely stay. Particularly enjoyed breakfasts on the upstairs patio and afternoon beverages in the downstairs porch swing, looking across beautifully kept river frontage. Any boat traffic was far enough away to be interesting but not disturbing.
Bonus: Heather was just the right amount of welcoming when we arrived tired and road-worn from our drive to the arctic circle, and super helpful the next day after we’d found all of our senses again."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"An excellent accommodation with very well maintained environment and clean interior, very friendly and easily accessible hosts! Highly recommend!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This cabin was absolutely wonderful! It has everything you need and the hosts are so accommodating and quick to respond to any question. It was in the perfect location for our day trips to enjoy Fairbanks. It was nice to sit in the cabin as well to read, relax and watch tv. I would HIGHLY recommend staying here. Made our Dream trip of my 50th state perfect. Super grateful to Heather and Gary!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I stay in air bnbs every month and this one stands out. This is a very cute cabin and was a relaxing lovely stay. The cabin is not large but has everything you could need (except a tea pot). The bed was so comfortable! I loved sitting on my porch or walking along the water. Would recommend but as description says not really suitable for more than 2 people.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The cabin was perfect for our time in Fairbanks. It was about 10-15 min away from most activities and remote enough to feel like you were in rural Alaska. The cabin was cozy and right by the river. The hosts live next door and we’re available as needed but also have privacy to their guests. Overall, great experience."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed about a week,"FABULOUS cabin, experience, and location. The interior was masterfully decorated and supplied. LOVE the scenery and looking at the river daily from our beautiful log cabin home. The hosts were AWESOME and extremely personable, friendly, and delightful. Highly recommended."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed about a week,"We loved our stay here! The cabin was stocked with everything we needed and was very clean. Beautiful surrounding area and very conveniently located. We would recommend it to anyone looking to visit Fairbanks! Thank you, Heather and Gary!"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We really enjoyed our stay in the cabin and would love to come back. It felt like an Alaskan vacation right down to the visiting moose and northern lights.
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"If you are looking for a peaceful place in Fairbanks to see the Aurora in the winter, this cabin was perfection.
We saw the aurora from the balcony 3 out of our 4 nights there. And we saw Moose walking on the river each day as well. It was incredible.
It’s located nicely away from bustle and noise, but you don’t feel isolated. The drive into Fairbanks is only 30 minutes which is perfect for catching tours, etc. It’s an hour to Chena Hot Springs, but an easy drive.
It is a small cabin, but just as described. Perfect for a couple. Well maintained. Easy to find and park. Hot water with good pressure. Nice little kitchen. Comfy bed and linens. Lots of little extras.
Heather was great about answering my questions. She even sent me a quick text when the moose first showed up to let me know to look out the window.!
I didn’t want to leave! I highly recommend it and have told all my friends and family to go!!"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I had the Sourdough Cabin during my trip to Fairbanks. After a busy itinerary the days before, it was really nice to relax in this quaint chalet right on the Chena River. The place was cozy and perfect for a peaceful getaway. I also came just in time to see the World Ice Art Championships in town, which I would highly recommend. Thank you Heather & Gary, it was a lovely stay!"
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had the most wonderful time at Heather and Gary’s listing. Worked out very well for the 2 of us… great aurora viewing right outside on the patio, life time experience…kitchen is well equipped considering that we are vegetarian.. internet was great as we were working during the early mornings… hot water ….heated space ( winter stay) highly recommended for 2 people… it’s a cute cabin that is very well designed..and optimized for space …am sure this would be great spot for the summer too…
We will definitely recommend and visit next time..
Thank you Heather…"
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Absolutely loved our stay here! The cabin itself is so warm and cozy in the winter and was the perfect size for my fiancee and I. The scenery around was gorgeous and great for seeing the northern lights. We look all over for the lights and the only time we saw them was actually on the drive up to our cabin!
I highly recommend coming here if you plan on going to Fairbanks. It's still very close to town so you can access a ton of stuff while still being able to experience the scenery and nature. I can only imagine how great the property looks in the summer. Definitely plan on staying here again the next time we're in Fairbanks!"
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The Sourdough Cabin is clean, peaceful and cozy. The main floor is quite small but was enough for us to enjoy over an extended weekend. There is not a dining table and chairs inside, but we made due with the sofa. On our first night we saw the Northern Lights from the property, and even from the balcony outside the second floor bedroom! Wifi was sufficient for two people to get work done, though a bit slow to handle two simultaneous Zoom calls with video. Heather provided clear directions for driving to the cabin and was very responsive to our questions. Snow was cleared from the parking area and there was a wide, cleared pathway for accessing the cabin. There were outlets for plugging in the block heater which comes with rental cars in Fairbanks. We enjoyed our stay!"
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful place

2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Heather & Garys cabin is a short 20 minute drive from Fairbanks airport nestled on the Chena river in a picturesque location. The queen bed in this cabin is so very comfy and the cabin itself is warm and accommodating.
Shampoo, body-wash and conditioner is in the shower and the house is stocked with all one would need to cook. The location is fantastic as we were able to get beautiful pictures of the Northern Lights from the cabin on the night we left.
It’s a magical and charming place."
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We loved our stay in the cabin. It is very prepared and we enjoyed our adventure. We were able to see the aurora borealis from the property and we did dog sledding just 9 minutes away from the cabin. We recommend it 100%.
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,What a cute little cabin. We enjoyed our stay in Alaska and were able to view the northern lights in a pull out right down the road which our host had recommended. Heather and Gary are fabulous hosts making us feel welcomed. Definitely the place to stay when enjoying an Alaskan adventure

2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Umm, excuse me?? This place is AMAZING!! Forget the adorable, cozy, clean, has everything you need cabin... the yard, fire pits, and river accessibility are enough to book this cabin. We took multiple walks along the river each day and night. Its so quiet and peaceful, yet close enough to everything. Heather and Gary are quick to respond, super helpful and very sweet. Highly recommend and we will absolutely be back!"

2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We landed in Fairbanks at midnight and the check-in was very easy. Its about a 20 min drive from the airport and the perfect place to see the Northern lights. We saw the northern lights on the day we landed right from our patio. The cabin had everything we could ask for: kitchen to bathroom and amazing wifi. It's closer to Chena Hot springs as well. Heather and Gary are very communicating as well. Will surely stay here the next time I come to Alaska. Highly Recommend the cabin and Thank you for making our stay wonderful!
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Nice peaceful and quiet location 15-20 minutes out of town. Very clean, cozy, and homey."
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Cozy log cabin with small but nicely stocked full kitchen. Loved the plush soft linens and the deck overlooking the river. Floor is a bit creaky but otherwise a delightful stay within 20 minutes of downtown Fairbanks. If you have your own vehicle it is a perfect stay, and way better than anything else you could get closer to town. Dee"
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Such a warm welcome, with very considerate advance check ins and recommendations. Cabin was cute and cozy! We loved staying here and would definitely stay again! Thank you, Heather and Gary!"

2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We attended a wedding and this place was much nicer and had more character than a hotel room

2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,A magic place.
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The cabin is well stocked, clean, well decorated, and just overall adorable! You can walk out to the river and cast a couple lines with the fishing poles heather and Gary provided! Also there are several fire pits to sit next to and enjoy. Inside the cabin is a binder full of information about different things to do during your visit alongside a nice little balcony to drink your coffee and breathe in the Alaskan air!"
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Awesome location and very cozy stay.
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This was an amazing stay! We came here to celebrate my 30th birthday and always looked forward to coming back home to the peaceful cabin. It is right off the river and the upstairs balcony was a perfect place to relax after a long day of hiking. 10/10 recommend. We want to come back sometime in the winter.
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Perfect cabin for our vacation!! Everything we needed, perfectly clean!!"
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The Sourdough Cabin was just the perfect spot for a quiet weekend getaway. Everything you need to cook or grill up a nice meal and a great relaxing setup inside. We’ll always check availability here each visit to Fairbanks!
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The cabin and location were perfect and more than I could’ve asked. Got to see a moose across the river the last night I stayed there. Would stay here again for sure

2022-06-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Nice and convenient cabin
2022-06-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Lovely cabin right on the river. Easy check in and full amenities. Hosts are very responsive. Sitting out on the top balcony having dinner was a treat. I would definitely stay there again 😊
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This stay was perfect!Heather and Gary were so welcoming. The cabin is so cozy and quaint, right on the Chena River. It was warmer than normal, and without asking, they brought over a fan. Such accommodating hosts!"
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What an absolutely awesome, relaxing time we had in our cabin on the Chena! The listing is absolutely accurate, and you will not be disappointed if you book this spot! Gary and Heather are amazing hosts, and we will definitely stay at their place again on our next trip to Fairbanks.
I would definitely recommend a trip to Chena Hot Springs, and if you have enough time, Fountainhead Antique Auto Museum is amazing!"
2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"If you have the opportunity to stay here...do it!!! The location is amazing! We had paid for Aurora viewing tour and had no luck, Heather was extremely helpful and sent us links to get notified- on our last night here we were able to view the Northern lights right from our bedroom balcony...absolutely magical. Location is the perfect combination of seclusion yet close enough to restaurants. Couple of hours to drive out to Denali. Couple of hours drive to Castner Glacier and short drive to Chena Hot Springs. You cannot stay anywhere better than here!!! Hosts are amazing. Fast to communicate, Cabin has absolutely everything you will need and then some.... we will definitely come back in the near future! If you're undecided where to stay...seriously look no more and stay here!! I promise you'll leave with memories of a lifetime!"
2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I cannot recommend this place enough! The property is absolutely beautiful, the cabin is so cute, comfortable and homey. I was able to get some photos of the northern lights right from their backyard! The hosts were super responsive and kind. Highly recommended!!"
2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Excellent location for Aurora viewing away from the lights of Fairbanks. A few miles down the road you have a clearing on both sides of the road that provides the perfect setting for taking in the Northern Lights at night. Hands down the best experience and Aurora photos I’ve ever taken! Check it out for yourself…
2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful property and wonderfully managed! Thanks for creating a restful space for us to visit.
2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Heather has been super friendly. Would recommend!
2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very beautiful cabin
2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Wow. This cabin and the hosts are amazing. The communication, location, amenities, scenery, trip tips and all made this experience unforgettable. 10 stars and would recommend for Alaska first timers like us! Till next time!"
2022-03-01,4,Stayed a few nights,We enjoyed our stay at the cabin and exploring the outdoors! We were able to see the aurora for a couple nights during our stay which felt very magical here.
2022-03-01,5,Stayed about a week,"My husband and I had an amazing stay! Cabin is very cute and the location is perfect - dark skies, right next to the river and remote (but close to Fairbanks and North Pole). It’s well stocked and very clean. We got to do and see everything we had hoped for! Fairbanks in winter and especially this location is magical.
Heather is very responsive and helpful! It was a wonderful stay and we would definitely recommend it! Hope to visit soon in summer."
2022-03-01,5,Stayed about a week,Heather and Gary are wonderful hosts and the cabin and location are fantastic. There is plenty of things to do around the area. The cabin was great. The location even better. Heather and Gary are really easy to contact and quickly answer any and all questions. We would highly recommend this location and this cabin.
2022-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Cabin was awesome, moose running around the yard 😍😍. Heather was super friendly, gave us local things to do even brought over some salmon for my boyfriend. Would definitely stay here again."
2022-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Loved everything about this place! The location was amazing and Heather and Gary could not have been more kind! They went out of their way to text us about moose in the yard and woke up at midnight to let us in when we got locked out. I wish I could have stayed there longer, and I will recommend this place to anyone looking for a cozy get away to Fairbanks! My goal was to see the northern lights, and all I had to do was walk onto the balcony!"
2022-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This log cabin is an amazing stay! It has beautiful views and river access of the frozen Chena river (I visited in winter, but I guess in summer the river access must be a great feature too). If Aurora viewing is your priority then this cabin serves a great spot given it’s location which is slightly away from the city lights. The Sourdough cabin is a cozy place for two with all necessities. Heather was great with her communication and sent detailed emails about the area and things to do. She was also kind enough to send us texts late at night as an Aurora alert so we don’t miss out on the light show. I highly recommend this place and would love to visit again on my next trip to Fairbanks."
2022-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The last thing you want is to be locked outside of cabin when the temperature is -5F. Thank you so much to Heather, she saved us at 1:30am, I felt so sorry to call her when we were locked outside if the cabin because ice got stuck in the door lock(welcome to Alaska!). Also, the cabin was great, warm and cozy, and we saw aurora right above the cabin"
2022-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Heather and Gary were excellent communicators and made us feel like any problem we had would be solved as quickly as possible. The cabin was clean, very warm and a really fun way to explore Alaska for the first time. We would highly recommend this to anyone and we would also definitely return!"
2022-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Seriously the BEST place to stay! Plus the BEST location! The sweetest people! 10/10 recommend. We loved it.
2022-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Wonderful little cabin that was conveniently located, yet offered the outdoorsy feeling of seclusion. Website description was accurate, communication was great, and the stay was amazing."
2022-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Heather and Gary's cabin was wonderful. Clean and beautifully designed for a cozy mountain-top vibe. Temps reached -42° while here so it was nice to have a nice warm spot to rest while not out and about. Hosts communicated well and were very accommodating! Can't wait to come back.
2022-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,A cozy little place. The host was very helpful and shared detail instructions on how to find the place as well as things to do in Fairbanks.
2021-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Lovely warm cabin, will definitely come back!"
2021-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The Sourdough is an amazing cabin! you won't be disappointed.
2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Terrific place to getaway in Fairbanks. Roughly 20mins from the main town - this is a lovely quiet place that is well equipped and perfect for two people to have some time in the wilderness.
Great communication from the hosts.
Thank you heather and Gary."
2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Awesome place, felt right at home :)"
2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great hidden gem!
2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This cabin is absolutely beautiful!! You will not regret staying here. The area that it’s in is stunning. River is right in front and trails to explore. Heather and Gary are great people!!! They communicate very well from beginning to end of your stay. I really loved it that they had it all nice and cozy smelling good as soon as we walked in !! Especially after a long trip and freezing temperatures outside. Definitely be back again !!!
2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Heather’s place is amazing, beautiful cabin, great scenery! You can just sit there and watch it snow outside the whole day. Highly recommend!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Really loved this unique stay. Devin was such a great hot and was very responsive. If I ever plan on coming back to Fairbanks this airbnb will be my go to!! It’s so sweet and has a warm and cozy feel to the place 🤍
2024-06-01,4,Stayed a few nights,The treehouse was a very cute and cozy place!! Loved seeing the “off grid” ways to make something like this work well. The water dispenser and the toilet- what a unique and pleasant way to give us amenities far in the trees!! It was fun to stay in the treehouse- certainly a first! Devin did a great job at providing all the details we needed for our stay!!April
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place was a great stay for my husband and I’s weekend getaway. It was tucked away and we easily forgot we were in Fairbanks. We really appreciated the robes for wearing to the bathhouse. Loved the hot tub(s) and sauna. The treehouse space was very clean, uniquely decorated, and had everything we needed. The bathhouse was a quick walk away and was also very clean! We’d stay here again for sure."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,All good. I like it.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,Super fun and unique stay!

2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,Highly recommend!!
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We absolutely loved our stay. The treehouse is setup perfectly and had everything we needed.
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,My husband and I had a wonderful and unique time in the treehouse for our trip. It was perfect for our couple nights stay. We enjoyed the hot tub on one of of the evenings which was relaxing. I can’t say enough about the loft/bed area as it was the most comfortable bed we stayed in on our trip all together. Wish we could have stayed longer.
2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,Had a wonderful time in the tree house was above and beyond our expectations!!!! Highly recommend staying there…
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The treehouse was so cool. It looks like the photos, and the bed was very comfortable. Easy to find and parking near the place. Hot tub and sauna near the bathhouse were great. Devin was very communicative and easy to work with. The treehouse wasn’t a lot more than a Sheraton in Fairbanks so it was so much more worth the money to stay here."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"Lovely little tree house, just as described. We were there during a brutal cold snap. -35 degrees at night. The place was toasty warm. Unfortunately, there were alot of lights at the site, not good for viewing Northern Lights, which were out. But, after all, this is in Fairbanks. All else was great and I would definitely go back again."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great stay! Cozy and clean space.
2024-02-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful treehouse! Very cozy and felt safe! One heck of an experience to stay in a treehouse!
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"So cute! My friends & I absolutely loved staying in this cozy, modern, chic little tree house during our winter wonderland getaway in Fairbanks! The hot tub & sauna were the cherry on top! Will definitely recommend to all my friends and will stay at again when I return!"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was my first time ever traveling to Alaska and I am forever grateful for this wonderful Airbnb. Devin was our host and my goodness these treehouses is truly the most beautiful experience I’ve done thus far. It’s like fulfilling your inner child while having such an intimate and perfect winter vacation with your partner. I spent my birthday weekend here and I just loved every details about this treehouse. It was warm and had a sense of home as soon as you enter. I am definitely coming back with my partner. We truly had the best time experiencing all of Alaska while being cozy and comfortable at the end of the day.
THANK YOU SO MUCH ❤️❤️"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a great stay at Fairbanks, thanks to the amazing AirBnB Tree House experience."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful Airbnb! Would love to stay again someday. It’s small and cozy! Instructions were clear and didn’t have any issues finding our treehouse. Also not too far from stores and restaurants! Again, Thank you for having us! :)"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We loved our stay and will highly recommend to our friends and family. The treehouse was exactly as pictured, so cute and every detail was thought out and beautiful. I was a little concerned about the dry toilet when booking, but it was not a problem at all. Very easy to use and not smelly at all. Everything was very clean. The amenities were GREAT! We loved the sauna and luxurious bathhouse. Overall we really enjoyed our stay."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Really fun unique place to stay! Small but so cute! Definitely recommend for a stay in Fairbanks!
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I stayed two nights in the grouse house and my expectations were over exceeded! The entire place is beautiful and the bathhouse is very pleasing. I didn’t want to leave! Would recommend to friends.
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Such a beautiful, comfy, cozy treehouse 💗 loved every second of my stay and also the hot tub was the perfect way to relax and be warm while still enjoying the snowy weather! Thanks so much for sharing your place"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The Grouse treehouse was absolutely amazing. The space is small but it worked fine with 2 of us, I would say no more than 3 people comfortably would be able to stay. The bed was comfortable, the place was clean. The place was heated and perfect, especially since outside ranged from -15° to -26° during our stay! The toilet was nice and instructions were easy to follow but we mostly used the bathhouse!
The hot tub and sauna was great the first night (especially since it was -15° outside!) the bathhouse was clean and easy to access if needed.
We loved the treehouse and would recommend to anyone visiting Fairbanks to see the northern lights!!"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Our tree house stay was amazing. The hot tub and sauna were fabulous. The cozy down bed clothes were warm and comfortable. The tiny treehouse had everything we needed for a wonderful stay. If you want a different kind of experience, treat yourself to a treehouse."
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very cozy and it’s definitely a tree house. Not super big but the space is used very well.
2024-01-01,5,Stayed one night,Everything was amazing. One of the best places that I’ve stayed at through airbnb!
2024-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"This property is super unique and fun! The tree houses are very well equipped with everything you'd expect in a unit plus more. They even provided some complimentary beverages on check in which was a nice gesture. There are two hot tubs and a sauna by the bathhouse as well as laundry and multiple nice restrooms inside the bathhouse. The dry toilet in the unit worked fine, essentially like a normal toilet. Don't be deterred by the lack of running water in the tree house, they provide a jug of water with a pump and it's really not an issue.
The staff are absolutely great. I got quite sick while we stayed here, they were super responsive and accommodating."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Very cute tree house, a great experience!"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"Our stay was something kinda different in a spectacular kinda way! The tree house was simply but tastefully decorated. The hot tub was a hit, even at -20. We enjoyed our stay and look forward to recommending this place to others."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful tree house, wonderful getaway spot! Will come again🥹💖"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed about a week,Amazing service & place.
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,It was a very beautiful stay and the host was very responsive and helpful throughout this experience.

2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Very clean, very unique place! Comfortable bed and the complex was very nice."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great spot to stay in Fairbanks. The tree house was cozy and cute. We enjoyed our stay!
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"It was a great experience to stay at the TreeHouse. The unite was super clean. Also the shared amenities was super clean as well.
I can not wait to visit again.
I highly recommend it.
Thanks Devin for a great Airbnb"
2023-09-01,3,Stayed a few nights,Adorable tiny house but very dirty. The bucket under the sink was half full of used water upon our arrival. The floors were filthy. Both hot tubs had yellowish water and excessive dirt on the bottom. One hot tub did not heat above 85 and the other hot tub smelled really bad. Neither of the floating chlorinators had anything in them. The bathhouse is NOT as pristine as shown in the photos. The showers have typical brown water stains around that caulking but the water in the single sink bathroom came out brown and water in the double sink bathroom shot out of the under sink cabinet from a leak. And the bed in Grouse was soooo uncomfortable.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Had an absolutely fantastic stay in the tree house! Bed was extremely comfortable, toilet was easy to use, and the bathhouse was lovely. I even saw the Aurora both nights of my stay, right from my deck! I can’t wait to stay again!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Cute, fun stay. Plenty of privacy but also enjoyed the common amenities."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Fun place to stay -
Located in a nice spot, had to drive through industrial area but once you got there was a cool location! Very close to the airport. It’s not a in the woods area very much in the town.
Not huge fan of the shared bathrooms but we knew what we signed up for - can tell they definitely kept them cleaned and organized. Not prepared for the shower water, from a well system. It had a distinct smell too it but we used it and got over it.
Tree house was pretty cool! We where 2 adults and a 2 year old and we made it work! Awesome place for a couple to stay with no kids.
Dry toilet worked great, I was worried it would be an issue - no issues at all. No smells in the tree house etc.
Overall great experience, cool set up."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,Amazing place. My first treehouse experience. The dream treehouse. You have to do it once in your life.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,I never wanted to leave. It was a dream come true. This place made me feel like a kid with many little touches that made it super memorable. Thanks for the best part of our trip!
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,amazing place
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Awesome fun atmosphere! Felt very welcoming. House equipped with everything we needed. Bathroom not great for privacy, but theres a spacious, clean, comfortable bathroom just a short quick walk. The hot tub was great!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Great Stay, Devin was quick with any little needs we had. Certainly quiet and off the beaten path, but only minutes from downtown. Bath house was built to the very highest standards. Great stay, will be back if ever we need a place in Fairbanks. THANK YOU Devin!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,A very cool Airbnb experience with extremely updated and new facilities. A memorable stay. I recommend to anyone!
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Excellent place. Highly recommended
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,.
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,What an amazing getaway hidden in downtown Fairbanks. We loved the uniqueness and finish work of the tree house. So relaxing and just what was needed with a one month baby at home - great escape just minutes from home. Lots of restaurant choices nearby. Living in Fairbanks and no idea it was here! Fun for guests too!
2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,Devins treehouse made me feel like a kid in a very bougie tree fort. With a bridge that announces visitors ascending the treehouse and a quiet little barrel sauna with a serene view you will feel like royalty. Do yourself a favor and get away for a night to the treehouse right in Aurora Subdivision!
2023-04-01,3,Stayed one night,"Cute idea, was hoping it would be a little larger. Bathhouse was nice, hot tub was nice as well. Wasn’t a fan of the dry flush toilet."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Fantastic little quirky space. Clean with lots of supplies. Clear instructions for the property. Would return!
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Super cute and well designed cabin. Definitely worth staying
2023-03-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Very small! Definitely tight if you bring a lot of luggage but overall the host was very responsive and the place was exactly like the pictures. Super cute and she had everything we needed!!
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Definitely a unique experience living in such a tree house!
2023-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"Had a great couples get away in the Grouse treehouse! Cute, memorable, clean. Great host that even messaged us when he heard the northern lights were out! Exceeded expectations 👍🏻 thank you so much!"
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My wife and I stayed two nights, the place had everything and more for our stay."
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Awesome tiny/three house.
Great location, fun amenities!"
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Devin has a wonderful spot. I loved sitting in the hot tub and exploring Fairbanks.
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Awesome place! Highly recommend the tree house to anyone!
2022-08-01,4,Stayed one night,"Wonder experience, and first treehouse stay for us both. Very unique and cozy. Bathhouse and amenities were wonderful. They have a great thing going here, though I wish it was more remote or had better views."
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great experience, very clean and accommodating, I would love to stay again, and will recommend to others."
2022-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"This place is magical. What could be better than sleeping in a treehouse? There is no attached bathroom but it's a short walk to really nice facilities. The space is small but we'll organized and cozy. I can't see putting more than two people in it but there are two houses that are connected via a bridge and common area if you're a party of four.
The minor ding is that the area around the location feels a little industrial but then all if Fairbanks felt that way to me. I absolutely hope to come back."
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The Grouse Treehouse is an amazing place to stay. You get a nice Alaska dry cabin ""glamping"" feel but with the bonus of luxury showers and hot tubs! With a lake nearby and friendly neighbors, this is an excellent way to spend your time in Alaska."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The tree house was an awsome experience, definitely a must try."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed over a week,"Great place to stay while in the Fairbanks area. The description and photos were accurate to the actual lodging. The accommodations where clean and comfortable, while being well stocked with basic items. The complimentary beverages and snacks where a nice touch. This is a place I would stay again and recommend to anyone looking for a place to stay. Devin is a fantastic communicator and a great host. If I could give more than 5 stars, I would. You won't regret staying here!"
2022-07-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Such a cute little tree house! We loved the views from the deck and the indoor swing seat. There were a few things that took some getting used to like the fact that the sink does not have any running water, so you use a water jug with a pump to wash your hands or to wash dishes, and they run out of water pretty fast and you have to go down the stairs to a different building to get refills, but we managed and tried to avoid dishes. We really loved the hot tub and the fact that the bath house with the showers is right next to it. It was also nice that robes were provided. The tree house does have a toilet, but you can only use it a certain amount before you get charged more, so we had to walk down the stairs and to a different building every time we needed to use the restroom, but the bathrooms in the other building were very nice! That’s also where you go to do laundry and the washers and dryers are very nice. Overall we had a great time!"
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,A very neat experience with a very central location. The place and facilities were all very clean and the hot tub was always nice to use at the end of the day.
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,If I could give this place 10 stars I would! Truly everything about it from location to the actual treehouses was such an amazing experience! Devin was a great host who was very informative and helpful with everything and really made our stay wonderful! We would love to come back and stay again!
2022-05-01,5,Stayed about a week,"What a unique treehouse experience. Steps to the loft would be a little steep for someone with knee problems or the elderly. There is no running water but they had a gallon jug with a pump and we managed just fine. I cooked breakfast every morning and it was not a problem. Expect a quiet, serene stay. The bed and pillow were so comfortable. The sofa bed was a little small, but we managed fine. Sitting outside on the deck, especially in the morning and late at night was so relaxing. All in all a great experience. Devin was a wonderfully responsive host. We had absolutely no problems at all. Really enjoyed it."
2022-05-01,4,Stayed with kids,"Cute little treehouses, very clean, very nice snacks and finishes. I didn't realize how small they were so certainly read all the information that they list in reference to their property."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Really appreciate the quiet location. Easy to communicate Theodora. The stay went very smoothly.
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Enjoyed staying here, beautiful surroundings and very peaceful!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,Definately a beautiful place if you want some peaceful surroundings 😊
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great secluded location to see the northern lights
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Perfect start to our Alaskan adventure. Cozy cabin surrounded by a picturesque forest.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We loved this house. Cozy, good location and peaceful. Saw northern lights from deck. Would stay here again."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This was a quiet, comfortable home in the perfect location for viewing the northern lights from the porch! We had a great stay."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,The home was secluded and extremely cozy. Theodora let us check in early and was very responsive. We woke up around 1:30am to see the northern lights outside and were able to capture them through our phones. We will definitely stay again!
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Absolutely perfect. Booked (and stayed) for a quick weekend trip and it was everything we were hoping and more. Everything was great, instructions were clear, and the flexible (self) check-in and check-out was perfect with our late arrival and early departure. The house was incredibly clean, the neighborhood was extremely quietly and peaceful, and our host even had the drive/entry cleared of snow before we came which was so thoughtful and I really appreciated that detail that I'm sure goes unnoticed.
As we traveled home we already started to discuss plans to come back in the future and we will only stay at one place (here!). Thank you very much, Theodora and family, for sharing your beautiful home with us!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great house in a very convenient location! We were able to catch the northern lights just 15 minutes out from the house. It was a very beautiful experience and a pleasant stay. Thank you!
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Will be visiting again.
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This is such a charming Airbnb surrounded by picturesque woods. It is a beautiful and secluded retreat, offering tranquility and privacy. The place was impeccably clean and cozy, with a fully equipped kitchen and comfortable beds. The host was incredibly responsive and made sure my stay was perfect. I highly recommend this Airbnb for anyone seeking a peaceful getaway."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Beautiful cabin in a peaceful and secluded setting, yet located only 10 minutes from downtown Fairbanks. Though the dryer was not working Theodora let us know ahead of time and provided a drying rack which worked perfectly for drying out clothes. We were able to see the northern lights on some clear nights right from our front porch."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Theodora’s place was tidy, had a great kitchen with everything needed to cook meals, and comfy beds. Theodora’s place was the perfect staycation getaway."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,Great stay!
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We loved our stay in this place!
The house is extremely private and it really does feel like home! 2 bedroom and 1 bedroom is upstairs and it’s huge. The whole house was very clean and the heater did the work (I was so worried that the heater will not be strong), bathroom was very clean and it looks brand new.
The location requires a car but it’s definitely worth it! Everything is about 12-15 minutes drive. It’s a perfect location- not too far and far enough to feel like you are secluded.
Overall very nice place and experience!"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"2 friends & I came to Fairbanks in hopes of seeing the Nothern Lights & to explore Fairbanks. We wanted a place that was far enough from the city so that if we didn’t want to go out hunting lights, we’d have a chance of seeing them from where we stayed. Theodora’s house is far enough away from the light pollution that you can see the lights if they’re strong enough & weather is good. Unfortunately, we came when weather was not great, so we didn’t see the lights from the house, but we did see them on our way out by Hwy 2.
The house itself is pretty accurate in description. I would describe the vibe as simple country cozy, which for my city friends was a nice change of pace. I liked that there was a lot of privacy since it’s remote which also made it feel safer to me. If you’re coming for the lights & have a small group, this house is a good choice. 1 thing to note is that the shower may be a bit tight for anyone taller than 5’9” or who has a wider frame but hot water tuns on quickly."
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was a lovely place to stay. Beautiful, quiet location and the house was very clean and comfortable. The host was very responsive when we had a question. We’d gladly stay here again."
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great stay!
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful house in a great location.
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great spot to get away but not too far away.
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great cozy place!
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This cabin was perfect. We stayed cozy through the cold snap and everything was just as expected. It was close to good aurora viewing spots and overall we had a great time. Thanks again!
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Very nice place, very quiet"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had an awesome experience at this cozy home away from home in the outskirts of fairbanks.
I definitely recommend this place to anyone interested in going to fairbanks."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Excellent
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,this was an amazing place! even got to see the Northern Lights while sitting on the front deck. what a great experience!
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,The place is exactly as described with all amenities of home. We only needed it for a night but if we’d stayed in Fairbanks we’d of rented it for the entire trip.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We love this place! This is our 2nd visit, about a year apart. (And if it’s available next August, we’ll be back again!)
The setting is amazing. It’s tucked into the hills north of Fairbanks surrounded by woods. It’s so quiet & pretty.
The house itself is perfect. Comfy furniture. Super clean! Big upstairs loft area. The only odd thing, which wasn’t an issue for us at all, was that there isn’t a true dining room table but bar seating in the kitchen."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Thank you
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,Our second time staying here. Another awesome experience!
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"Pretty surroundings, clean and functional cabin. We loved this place."
2023-08-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Great stay at this adorable cabin. Bigger than anticipated based on the pictures. Host was very helpful when we had a question. Very clean! We would definitely stay here again!
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,it truly is a cabin in the woods. Surrounded by beautiful tall trees.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"A very cozy house in a beautiful setting away from the busyness of Fairbanks. We would definitely book another stay
with them."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful house tucked in the spruce trees. Very clean and comfortable!
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful surroundings. So peaceful and private. The most relaxing vacation we have had in a while. Unfortunately we didn't see any moose, however there is an adorable little porcupine and it's mom that we did have the pleasure of watching several days in a row.
We also had the pleasure of watching the hosts check the bee hives which was very interesting.
Can't wait to come back again and spend time."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great stay, and location."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,Great place to stay. A short drive from town and really quite. Would definitely return.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Nice private setting that was peaceful and quiet. Perfect for our needs while visiting Fairbanks.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"We loved staying here! It was a great spot to stop, clean up, and rest after a long day if travel! More than enough means of cooking and we felt very comfortable with blankets, pillows, and fresh air! Overall a great stay!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This getaway in the woods is exactly what we needed. It’s tucked away nicely, has a large, well manicured yard we were able to play in with our girls. They got to do school out on the lawn & have lunch on the porch while observing the bees (which was such an awesome treat) - the upstairs was claimed by our girls during our stay. AMAZING open floor plan up there to play games and for kids to play and sleep. Living room had everyone as cozy as could be with the couches, extra blankets, and plush carpet. Kitchen had everything we needed to prepare snacks/food. Bathroom was well stocked with towels, toilet paper, tissues, etc. This place really has everything you need to enjoy your stay. And you get to do so surrounded by beautiful views!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,Very nice place. Loved the seclusion of being surrounded by trees. Definitely worth the money. Would stay here again.
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was a great place to stay, and if it hadn't been May I would have been able to get a great aurora show out off the deal. It is a bit out from Fairbanks but definitely worth it."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great place to get away and be alone for a while. Comfortable, quiet, and plenty of room for activities"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,A lot of AirBnBs around Fairbanks say you can view the aurora from the cabin (when it’s out) but it turns out to be a challenge - not this one!! I had an awesome viewing experience and never left the deck! It’s comfortable and serene and just about perfect.
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Location was exactly as described. Serene and perfect for our needs.
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We had a great two nights at Theodora’s place. We couldn’t see the Northern lights from the house but other than that the house had everything you would need for a relaxing weekend in nature
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very nice place
2023-04-01,4,Stayed with kids,"If you need a digital detox and spend some time in pin drop silence watching snowfall, this is a place to be. We enjoyed our time thoroughly and got a glimpse of the Northern light from the deck. Awesome experience overall."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Place was amazing. We got to see northern lights right from home.
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Awesome little house that makes you feel like you’re in the middle of nowhere. Extremely clean and everything we had hoped for. Would recommend to anyone.
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had an amazing time during our stay! The surrounding views are beautiful and it felt like we were tucked away from any outside distractions. The hosts are very kind, responsive and have great recommendations for things to see and do around town as well as places to eat. I would highly recommend staying and hope to be back soon!"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Perfect if you are looking for a location that is quiet and away from the city lights.
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I can’t Thank the host and Co-host enough. Such a small gesture to help accommodate my family really meant the world to us. I loved this Airbnb and if there wasn’t a booking in between my trip, I would have rented this Airbnb for 13 days! I even proposed to my gf under Aurora right in front of the Airbnb!
I really look forward to staying here again but I already know great places and hosts like this normally stay booked year around. Thank you guys again for hosting my family and I. We had such a great stay!"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed one night,We loved our stay here. Clean house in a peaceful environment and the host was great. We would definitely stay here again if we ever visit Fairbanks in the future.
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place in the woods!
2023-03-01,5,Stayed one night,Really great experience - super responsive and accommodating! We enjoyed our stay.
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Theodora's place was great! Very cozy, clean, and very well stocked. She had everything we needed and more. Felt like we were at home!"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed one night,Great location & host. We needed a space in a pinch & Theodora's quick response was much appreciated!
2023-03-01,5,Stayed about a week,"The house was perfect and the location beautiful … the northern lights came out several night and lit up the sky and we could see them from both the front porch and yard as well as from inside the house …
The house felt cozy and comfortable with a wonderful kitchen, good bathroom and two bedrooms as well as a comfy living room …
Will totally stay here again whenever we come back to Fairbanks :)"
2023-02-01,5,Stayed one night,Beautiful Location
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The location of Theodora’s place is perfect for Northern Lights hunting. Secluded, dark, yet close enough to Fairbanks for shopping etc. The road the house is on - wow. Absolutely stunning winter wonderland.
I saw the most amazing Aurora from her place.
House itself is large and had everything I needed. It was a little cold and a touch dated inside but value for money."
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great! Secluded but not far from town! Good layout and super warm!
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We loved the mammoth house! It was our first time in Alaska and it did not disappoint. At times the GPS wanted to take us to the back of the property so the host’s instructions were incredibly helpful. The heater really does keep the house nice and warm. The kitchen was well stocked with supplies and the place was very neat and clean. They even had someone come and plow and clean off the steps while we were out one day. We’ll be visiting again and this place will be first on our list!
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Theodora was very accommodating to the crazy schedule of my husbands. It made Alaska even better. I would stay there again, thank you!"
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We loved the setting—great spot for viewing the Northern Lights. A wide meadow surrounded by boreal forest. It was fun to snowshoe on the trail behind the house.
It's also a good location from town—far enough for dark skies, quiet and solitude, but close enough for anything you might need.
The house was very cozy and toasty. Shower was hot and had good pressure."
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"House was as stated . Perfect for the 3 of us! Loved the location in the beautiful woods . But it’s close to Fairbanks to go when needed. Theodora answered all my questions promptly. House was warm despite bitter cold . Enjoyed our stay , hope to return one day ! Thanks!"
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Theodora's place is fantastic for our winter stay! It's super private and we got this awesome forest view. The house is very cozy and clean. We get to cook a lot thanks to the kitchen (plenty of pans and pots). Will come back and stay again in summer time!
2022-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Great cabin - clean, beautiful location, peaceful and private. Excellent place to unplug. Very helpful communications with the host. Despite the cold weather outside, the cabin was plenty warm - just need to read the simple and helpful instructions left by the host in the cabin on how to handle the heater. Really enjoyed our stay!"
2022-12-01,4,Stayed with kids,"The cabin is great, awsome location, nice and clean. the only thing is the heater. the cabin is too cold and the heater do not cover the cabin. its very cold. different than that everything ese is great."
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had unforgettable time at this place! I loved the house and it’s location ! Every morning I had my coffee outside, enjoying the view of beautiful forest around,covered in snow and listening the silence!
It was so easy to get to different places , stores, restaurants!
We didn’t see the Northern lights(we have to come back again!-:),but it was a wonderful experience to see a lot off places around !
Thank you Theodora, Shelton and Amy! We felt very save, care and comfortable at your place! I would like to come back!
Galina, Dmitry, Indira."
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Theodora was very easy communicate with. We loved the cabin and it was very cozy. Saw the northern lights!
2022-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,Beautiful cabin with a forest behind it. You can def see the aurora on a clear sky if there’s a magnetic storm!
2022-11-01,5,Stayed about a week,Went to Alaska to unplug and to see the aurora. This house was the perfect place to do both. My stay was fantastic and the house was warm and cozy. Highly recommended!
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Lovely stay. We really enjoyed our long winter weekend in Fairbanks.
2022-11-01,5,Stayed over a week,"We had a very good time. We went to see the lights and I enjoyed the Auroras a lot. We saw from the cabin and from the Cleary Summit, which is short 15 mins driving. The place is also close to the city and restaurants. I was concerned based on previous review about the wi-fi, but we worked the entire period with 2 people in calls all the time, we also watched some movies, and we didn’t have any problem. The host was also pro-active checking the wi-fi performance. I recommend and I would go again in the future."
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Mammoth house was clean and cozy with wonderful views of the Aurora. We were super excited to see moose tracks in the snow around the house.
2022-10-01,5,Stayed one night,excellent view recommended 100%
2022-10-01,5,Stayed one night,We had an amazing time here! We were able to step out on the porch and see the northern lights which is exactly what we came for! The entire check in and out was a breeze!
2022-10-01,5,Stayed one night,We had a really great stay! And we were able to see the lights as it was a clear night. The house was as advertised. We loved that it was more secluded and in an open area to make viewing the lights easy. We would definitely recommend to others and look to stay here again if we return to the area.
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very cool place! So cozy and homey. Wonderful stay!
2022-10-01,5,Stayed one night,Wonderful time staying at this place! We didn’t see the northern lights because of the clouds. But we did see a green hue! Lol the place was nice and cozy! And big for a small place! We would love to come back!!
2022-10-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Lovely property. We’re from AZ and the house was cold! Not really sure why there were no draperies in the living room but there’s probably a reason 🤷🏻‍♀️. I just think the house would stay warmer with curtains up. We had one hand towel for 6 days. We appreciated the laundry facilities.
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We cherished every moment of our stay in this beautiful home! The view of the trees with their yellow fall leaves was gorgeous. Cleanest rental ever. Wonderful host with great communication. Comfortable and cozy. We wished we had booked a longer stay!
2022-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Cozy cabin, comfortable enough for the 4 if us, the lot was great for the kids to run around with plenty of space, but still within the property lines. Close to town, but far enough away to feel like you were removed from everything. Would definitely stay again!"
2022-09-01,5,Stayed one night,Was an amazing place to stay even if we weren’t able to see the northern lights that night we still woke up to an awesome sunrise over the mountains. It’s a pretty cozy place💛
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We loved staying at the cabin. It was about 10 minutes out of town, but that's what we wanted...to be away from everyone. Location is very private and quiet with lots of trees! Because it is out of the way, we could only use once device at a time (if you were streaming a show, you could not use a phone, and only one phone at a time when not streaming a show). This was no big deal to us ,as we wanted to get away, however, it may be an issue if you are planning on conducting business, or have multiple people trying to use the wifi. We would definitely stay here again!!!!!"
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Such a comfortable stay! It was the perfect place to see the aurora borealis. Easy check-in, everything was as described."

2022-09-01,4,Stayed one night,It was a great stay and a great location.
2022-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Gorgeous location, gorgeous house! We were able to pick a few raspberries & cranberries. The location was so quiet and the views were so pretty. I’d definitely recommend staying here!"
2022-08-01,5,Stayed one night,Remote location but still close to town. Would stay again
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The place is nice and clean. We really enjoyed our stay!
2022-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"We are locals and just wanted to get away for the night. I recommend this location! Bed was firm, comfortable and felt new. (Didn't check second bed, but I assume it is good too given the condition of everything else in the house.) Clean. Surrounded by woods for a quiet secluded feel, but the trees have also been cleared enough that it seems it would have a wide sky for Aurora viewing in the winter. (We stayed in the summer, so I can't confirm that.)"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Everything was great! Getting into the house was so easy, there were clear instructions for everything and the house is perfectly placed far enough out of town to be peaceful but close enough to run in and grab a bite to eat or do some shopping. The bed was so comfortable. We LOVED our stay here!"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Thanks
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Our stay at Theodora's place was great. We really enjoyed the peace and quiet in this remote location. The surroundings of the house are beautiful, there are many raspberry bushes. We also saw some moose!
Wee worked for a couple of days and found the internet able to support 2 remote workers. Communication with the hosts was very smooth. Overall, we really recommend this stay!"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is a great place, clean, comfortable, and quiet. I stayed as part of a trip for work and it was perfect. It was nice not to have to deal with all the people and the crazy prices of hotels here. I will be bake."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Cute home, quiet area, a bit of a drive from Fairbanks (about 15 minutes)"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,Comfortable cabin with a great location from Fairbanks. We enjoyed the space as our final resting spot in Alaska.

2022-06-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Very nice place less than 10 miles from fairbanks. quiet country road set back in the woods and not too close to neighbors. if u have accounts, all streaming services, good wifi, nice space overall...nothing lacking. would highly recommend...good value"

2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We loved this place! Felt like home and we didn’t want to leave! House was super clean and everything you can think of was provided. Wonderful trip!
2022-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,Cozy house and nice view
2022-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,.
2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Hosts were communicative and attentive. The water was a little tricky at times but hosts were very responsive and took care of issues right away. Location was perfect for our aurora viewing trio - we saw from the front porch two nights in a row. Perfect stay for 2 people - would recommend!
2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Wonderful place to stay! Private with secluded feeling on large lot with amazing views. My husband and I were fortunate to spot two moose on a side street while driving to the main road from the property.
Our host, Theodora, responded quickly to a question I had pre-arrival. The location was perfect for us by being away from the city, yet a close enough driving distance back to it if needed. The house suited our needs perfectly. Thank you!"
2022-03-01,5,Stayed one night,Really beatiful sightseeing aroud the house and very nice house-owner!!
2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Feels very remote, yet it is close enough to town and the base (only 20 mins). Owners were super great and helpful."
2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The Mammoth House is perfect in every way, especially for a couple or a small family! Perfectly cozy, perfect location/views, and perfect price for budgets! It made us want to stay longer and was very convenient but felt completely secluded. Bonus - the bed was super comfy too! We highly recommend this property and will definitely be returning guests!"
2022-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,The cabin was excellent for our stay in Fairbanks. Beautiful scenery and just far enough out of town we could see the northern lights! Thanks!
2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Cozy place to stay just outside of Fairbanks. Easy access to town and adventure and beautiful views!
2022-03-01,5,Stayed about a week,"My husband and I visited from San Diego in late February and had a wonderful time at Theodora's place! It was clean, comfortable and in a lovely location. We were fortunate enough to see the Northern Lights during our visit - we stayed for 6 nights, and only saw them one time, but we felt very blessed! The home has many windows and when we woke up to snow on two of the mornings, we felt like we were staying inside a beautiful snow globe with a blanket of snow outside and a dusting of snow on all the evergreens surrounding the spacious property - truly a winter wonderland. The location was convenient, far enough from the city lights, but close enough to get into Faribanks for meals, museums, groceries, movies, hockey games etc. We even went downhill skiing on our last day there at Ski Land and it was only a beautiful 20 min. drive away. The home is cozy and comfortable, only thing we would have preferred is a King Size Bed rather than the Queen. We enjoyed a wonderful, bucket list trip and are grateful to Theodora for providing our home base during our time in Fairbanks."
2022-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Loved the location! It's very remote but at the same time a short drive to downtown. The place is very clean. Had an issue with the air mattress, but Theodora responded quickly and Kara brought a brand new mattress a few hours later. The beds are very comfortable! Having a washer and a dryer was definitely a plus too."
2022-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We had a great time at Theodora’s place. The communication was super easy and quick and the place looks exactly like it does on the pictures. The neighborhood is very conveniently located and although it’s a lively neighborhood the apartment is very quiet! Would absolutely recommend to stay there!
2022-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Cozy home with the most amazing view of the northern lights and didn'thave to leave the driveway!!! I would definitely recommend staying at the mammoth home on Alaska! Was an amazing time and the location to everything is within 15 minutes drive.
2022-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was a great location! We were a little cold in the bedroom but overall the home was exactly as described. Extremely clean, and the host was so nice and always responded immediately to any questions I had.
Nice bedroom, air mattress provided as well, couch, love seat, washer and dryer!
About an hour from the chena hot springs. Not far from North Pole.
Remote enough that if you’re lucky enough for the lights to come out you should see them. We weren’t so lucky unfortunately.
Fully stocked kitchen. Hot shower water. Great views from all of the windows.
Roads were easy to drive on with a AWD SUV.
Would definitely stay again, loved the cute little cabin feel!"
2022-02-01,4,Stayed one night,Great place out in the country! The house has what you need for a stay in Fairbanks. Not too far from town but well-stocked is good for cooking breakfast or dinner at home. Nice bathroom and kitchen accessories.
2022-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"A great Fairbanks getaway, up in the mountains, close to everything. Very clean and comfortable, easy to find. Would definitely be back!"
2022-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"it was a great stay. we were able to see the northern light right above the cabin, around 4am. the cabin was warm and clean."
2022-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,My wife and I had a nice time. It's a quiet neighborhood which is nice. The place was clean and they were responsive. Seems like a nice location to view aurora on a clear night.
2022-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Theodora place is one of the best airbnb house I ever had. Perfect!!!
2022-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"Cozy cabin in wonderful nature. Highly recommend!
I don’t have any problems staying there!"
2022-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"Very nice cabin, cozy and clean. The view and location are amazing."
2022-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This cabin it’s amazing and Theo it’s amazing too.
Me and my friends stayed for 3 nights and we enjoyed every moment. On the last night we even saw the Northern lights from the windows.
Has a full kitchen, Wi-Fi it’s great and a plus if you are going to chega hotsprings, the washer and dryer works just fine.
I super recommend and in the future if I come back to Alaska will look for this cabin again!"
2022-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Theodora’s place was wonderful, clean, and WARM. The heater provided was awesome and there was a car plug in for us which was much needed in the -20° weather! This was an awesome place to stay and I’d definitely stay here again the next time I drive up to Fairbanks!"
2021-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"It was a wonderful stay despite the storm and power outage. We all have respect to the Mother Nature! The cabin is beautiful and clean.
The manager and the host went above and beyond to help us. Thank you!!!"
2021-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Wonderful, clean and well equipped little cabin. Hosts were very responsive to any questions or needs we had. Bathroom included shampoo and body wash which we had forgotten to bring. Kitchen has most common spices, oils, condiments to get you started, also coffee, sugar, creamer. Surrounding area is quiet and just beautiful. We only had one clear night and saw the Aurora Borealis 🤩. Many other attractions within 20 minutes, such as downtown Fairbanks, dog mushing, reindeer ranch etc. Chena Hot Springs is about one hour drive away. Definitely will be back."
2021-12-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"We had a good stay. A heads-up: you may be lost and have difficulty locating the home if you use Google map for navigation.
We followed the Google map and were directed to the host's neighbor's place. Fortunately, we ran into the neighbor on the way, and he showed us how to get there."
2021-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Had a Great stay. The house is beautiful and very cozy. The bed and pillows and comforter are very comfortable. The Kitchen had a few extra things that is usually forgotten In packing like salt, pepper, other condiments, coffee, etc.
The yard was absolutely beautiful, all white full of snow. It was so relaxing waking up to that view. Theodora left an extension cord with a timer for the car which came in very handy.
If you had any questions, she quickly replied. Our only regret is that we couldn’t stay longer. We will definitely be back."
2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The place was great! The location was the most critical factor in deciding where to stay since I wanted to cover a lot of ground in different directions. It’s located about 10-15 min from DT Fairbanks (restaurants and bars), 20-25 min from Murphy’s Dome (northern lights), 20-25 min from North Pole (santa) and just shy of an hour from Chena Hot Springs (must visit!).
Easy and swift check in and check out - I even arrived about 2-3 hours early with no issue. Definitely a score when it’s -25F outside! Property manager & owners very amicable, professional, responsive. They also gave good suggestions on what to do and where to go. One minor thing: there were only two towels for a 5-day trip. To avoid wasting H2O & doing lots of laundry, I bought three more towels from a store nearby and left them there for future guests."
2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We staid at Mammoth Lodge in November 2021 for about a week. The place is perfect for a secluded Alaska stay - surrounded by forest and snow (in winter). And yet easily accessible. We were lucky to see Northern Lights on the very first night from the house's window! Thanks for hosting us!
2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great Airbnb! Definitely my favourite stay so far. So clean and so private and quiet, we loved it!"
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This was a great stay with a host that is always available to answer questions. I highly recommend Theodora's home. Hope to stay there again on our next trip.
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Perfect place for solo, friends, couple or small family. The location is great, out of town but close to town, and quiet with a pretty view. The place is immaculate with everything needed for kitchen. Comfy bed, block out curtains. Good pressure shower and much appreciated heater in the bathroom. Great information about the area. Highly recommend."
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We really enjoyed it here. The location was secluded but the place had wifi, refrigerator, alarm, as well as Netflix, Disney+, Amazon Prime, Peacock in case you wanted to stay in. It was close to the Cleary Summit for Aurora Viewing and close to Fairbanks city itself."
2021-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"ABSOLUTELY stay here. Perfect location. Perfect property. Property manager a few minutes away who found my shoe and met me before we boarded our plane to return it. Super nice. We came in at 2 am with pretty heavy snow and it was an easy drive and find. Beautiful sunrises and snow. Very well equipped with even a junk drawer and medicine cabinet. If you do not thoroughly enjoy your stay here, please check with you physician as something is very wrong. My only complaint is 2022 calender is not open yet to book again."
2021-10-01,5,Stayed one night,A lovely and quiet cabin in a wooded area that feels so far from it all but very convenient drive from Fairbanks. We stayed during a snowstorm and felt very cozy and warm inside and loved seeing the snow on the trees through the large windows. The owners left a snow shovel out for us to clear the patio and stairs which was a nice touch. We were hoping to see northern lights and this seems like a perfect spot for them if only we had a clear night! Nice large deck and outdoor seating area.
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great location and cottage was very clean and roomy, sofa bed was comfortable. Beautiful lot surrounded by woods. We did see the Northern Lights too! (9/21) We would definitely stay there again."
2021-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great, clean place located in a quiet spot. Would love to stay here again."
2021-09-01,4,Stayed one night,It was nice place at reasonable price.
2021-09-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Great location and price! Highly recommend.
2021-08-01,5,Stayed one night,Excellent stay!
2021-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Best place to stay! You will not be disappointed! Our host was amazing, the house was in a secluded , peaceful, quiet spot. We really enjoyed our stay and they are very accommodating. We plan on coming back in the future!"
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Nice, quiet and private house! Perfect for our party of two, we loved watching our Disney Plus and YouTube on the tv. It was an amazing place to stay!"
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Excellent place, this would be a 10 star rating if I could give one. Very cozy and the surrounding forest was lovely to hike around in."
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This stay is in a nice isolated location free from any disturbance noises. All the amenities you could need in a stay with friendly host’s!
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"If i can rate this place more than a five star i would do it in an heartbeat. The place is clean, well maintainance and cozy. The owner response to all your needs in a timely manner."
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We enjoyed our stay. Very clean, pleasant, good location out of the city but not too far out. I would highly recommend. One evening we even saw a red fox jumping around in the grass, so cool! We would stay again if in Fairbanks."
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The house is amazing, even better than expected, I only wish we would have visited in the winter rather than summer!"
2021-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,Fantastic place! Lovely little house in a perfect location for escaping it all. 10/10!
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great spot - not too far away from town but also secluded and beautiful.
2021-07-01,5,Stayed about a week,It was a great place to stay. It was like home away from home for our Alaskan adventure. just 10 minutes to Fairbanks and all your shopping and dining needs. very quiet and inviting.
2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We enjoyed our stay! Nice and private, and close enough to Fairbanks to easily commute. Loved how quiet it was and the beautiful views of nature!"
2021-06-01,4,Stayed one night,The cabin had everything we needed while passing through the area on work. We enjoyed the personal touches and how well the kitchen was stocked with what we needed. It's located in a beautiful and spacious area. We enjoyed our stay!
2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Fantastic stay
2021-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Peaceful, quiet, private, but not too far from Fairbanks. Very relaxing!"
2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The house was small but cute. Great porch to sit and drink coffee in the morning.
2021-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Perfect little home away from home. Clean and had everything we needed! Secluded enough for privacy but still convenient and close enough to get back to town for actives and dinner. Our only wish would be for the front room / kitchen to have curtains or blinds since we had our girls sleeping on the sofa bed and the summer night sun comes in bright. Nothing some sleep masks can’t solve though! Otherwise, we highly recommend this house and Theodora’s excellent communication and hospitality. We would absolutely book again in the future!"
2021-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We loved this place! We would definitely go back if visiting again.
When I booked it I was worried it might be too far from “downtown” but turns out Fairbanks is so vast and spread out that we really didn’t feel far away. And, I would pick this spot out in nature over something in town! And there isn’t really much of a downtown anyways so we didn’t feel like we we’re missing out at all."
2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The cabin is really nice. My wife and I enjoyed our stay. it must be even better to stay in the winter. thank you, Shelton and Theodora!"
2021-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,Best place to stay so gorgeous and clean and just a. Breathe of fresh air from life
2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"You won’t want to miss out on this little Alaska gem. It is incredibly homey and a prime location to visit the interior. Clean and comfy and a list of the favorite things to do and see around the area. Secluded, private, and close enough to town to make a trip if needed. Only a couple hours drive to Denali, but who needs to go that far when the moose are right outside the windows. Gold panning right down the road and many more Alaskan experiences around the area. Everyone was very communicative and helpful as to what problems may arise, but there were none. This will be our recommendation for any of our friends and family visiting the area"
2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Amazing place absolutely gorgeous and well maintained
2021-05-01,5,Stayed one night,The place is just amazing. Its better than shown in the photos. Everything works properly. Thanks very much sharing this beautiful place surrounded by nature.
2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Thank you for an amazing visit! We appreciate the clean, beautiful space and all of the extra touches that made our visit so special...the coffee, the extra few minutes at check out and a nice hot shower! Thank you for the quick communication! Would love to come back and stay again! So nice to be in the midst of nature with all the modern amenities!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This beautiful cabin was the highlight of our trip. I was a peaceful place to
Come home to every evening. Everything was exceptional and very clean!! So glad we chose to stay at this one-of-a kind cabin!! If we ever return to Alaska, this is where we will stay!!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,Great host and very comfortable place to stay.
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Staying in this cabin was an amazing experience, my only regret is that we didn't stay longer than 2 nights. The space is very well appointed and very cozy and clean. Our mornings spent on the veranda sipping our coffee, watching and listening to the wildlife and the evenings over a glass of wine, marveling over the midnight sun will stay with us for a long time. The drive to town is only 15 minutes, where you can find some good eats if you don't feel like cooking - you have the best of both worlds if you are looking for some serenity, but are close enough to other amenities that Fairbanks has to offer. Jordann and Jeff are amazing hosts, very responsive and kind. I def plan to come back and recommend this cabin without any hesitation. This is a great place!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I absolutely loved staying at Jordann's cabin. It was a little getaway while my oldest son played soccer games. The cabin was immaculate, with such amazing little touches. You can tell thought was put into every detail. The covered wrap around deck was perfect for sipping coffee in the morning. It wasn't too far from Fairbanks so going shopping didn't take long. I will definitely be back if I need to stay in Fairbanks again! Thank you Jordann!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,Can you give six stars?!
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,Beautiful place loved our stay!
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What a wonderful place to stay! Very clean, comfortable, and spacious. Loved the location; just far enough out of town to be private and quiet, but close enough that it's a very easy drive into Fairbanks. Had all the amenities of home and sure beats staying in an overpriced gross hotel. Host was super responsive and gave clear instructions. Absolutely loved staying here and would definitely stay again!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Thank you for sharing your beautiful home with us. I really enjoyed the deep tub which was perfect to soak in and warm up after long nights of watching the aurora borealis! The home was spotless and well stocked with all the necessities. Jordann was a wonderful host. I highly recommend her home!
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Jordann was a really top host! Always aware of everything we need. We found the place even better than what we saw on the pictures. The location is perfect if you want to have a quite time. We were in Fairbanks to chase northern lights, so the location was ideal for us, near to some of the places they reccomend to see them. Also within the house we found magazines and information with tips to chase them that were really helpful, we actually were able to see them 2 nights in a row!!The house has everything you need; really brand new and cozy. We hope to come back for spending more time and also visit in summer season."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed about a week,"I really enjoyed my stay at Jordann’s cabin for my aurora viewing trip, it exceeded all my expectations. The place is very clean and everything feels like new. It’s situated on a large private lot surrounded by birch and spruce trees, only 10 minutes drive to town if you need to. It’s conveniently located to drive to popular aurora viewing locations outside of town such as Cleary summit, Chena Hot Springs, Chena lake recreation area in North Pole, etc. Jordann is very responsive and considerate. Highly recommend this cabin if you’re planning a trip to Fairbanks."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Even though my travel was for work, it was great to have this space to return to every evening. This was my second stay in this location with this host and it was great. I will be looking to book this location as it's available since I travel to this location frequently. Thank you very much for the clean, peaceful, well equipped and furnished place."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The place is wonderful. Appears that they just built it and they really did an amazing job. New appliances, furniture, bedding. Really nicely done. Makes you feel like you are at your own home. Jordann and Jeffrey are super nice and helpful. They gave us some info that was very useful and she actually bought deck furniture while we were there and put them out so we could sit on the deck and relax. I wish all AirBnB hosts were like these folks. They will be Super Hosts in no time. We would absolutely stay here again if we come back to Fairbanks. It’s maybe 15-18 minutes into Fairbanks on a main road. No issues at all running back and forth. They also have a huge property surrounded by woods. Loved it"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We had a wonderful time at this Bnb and will book again. The communication and information provided was the best I have received so far.
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"I loved the place, slept comfortably and good."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Great place, clean, private area. updated and modern appliances throughout."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This property is well cared for and spacious. Very peaceful and only a short drive to anything you need or want. The host is very friendly.
2024-06-01,5,Group trip,"This is a unique home in Fairbanks—it is very groovy! Our large family—from the kids to grandma—stayed here. It was centrally located. Our only hiccup was that it didn't have air conditioning, but that was my fault... I didn't realize that most homes in AK likely don't have it as it's likely only utilized a few times a year... but we stayed at the beginning of the summer months. We like sleeping in the cold. There were box fans, which helped immensely! :)
Otherwise, it is a nice and unique setting!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Awesome mid-century home with a beautiful space, hot tub, and viewing area!"
2024-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,Very unique and cozy place. Plenty of room for the whole family! Even Grandma and Grandpa! We will be back! Thank you!
2024-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Awesome place! Would definitely stay again when we are in Fairbanks.
2024-04-01,5,Group trip,"Eric was a great host, anything that we needed help with he was quick to respond and help."
2024-04-01,5,Group trip,Very unique home! Definitely an interesting place to stay with my friends. Appreciate the art and dedication of the host to set up their home like this :)
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This house was an amazing find. Close to everything in Fairbanks while still feeling private. Our kids especially loved the game room and hot tub. If anyone is looking for a unique house where you are sure to make memories, this is the house!"
2024-04-01,5,Group trip,Beautiful Airbnb - just as shown in the photos! The hosts were also great - incredibly responsive to our questions and provided many recommendations of activities and restaurants to explore in and around Fairbanks. Would definitely stay here again if we are ever in the area!
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,My family and I really enjoyed our time there. This place made our vacation to Alaska magical highly recommend and can't wait to go back again. Thank you.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great place, perfect for our family. Eric had great communication."
2024-04-01,5,Group trip,"The house was perfect for our combo adventure/kickback vacation. He communicated directly on access and house details so we relaxed immediately. When we weren’t out and about, we played records, puzzled, and had video game battles! The kitchen was small but had everything we needed for 6 adults."
2024-04-01,5,Group trip,"This was a great place for our family of 5- 2 adults and 3 teenagers - everyone had their own space but also had community stews to hang out together as well. The game room was a huge hit! Especially w the old school games. I’m not sure who loved it more- the kids or my husband!
The hot tub and dome outside was a fun touch.
Eric was really responsive and very accommodating!
Location was close enough to everything but felt pretty private. Would stay here again if we were ever back in Fairbanks."
2024-03-01,5,Group trip,"Great vacation home! We had great time enjoying home, including jacuzzi. Highly recommend for larger groups."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,Great property and host. Very helpful and responsive with answering questions and suggesting activities and shopping.
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Star Base was the perfect place for our crew to gather and celebrate! This Fairbanks homestead was perfectly situated between town, the University of Alaska, and the airport. It felt just removed enough from downtown but close enough to civilization to not feel too isolated. Viewing the Northern Lights from the hot tub in the backyard was a core memory for my children and I know this wouldn't have been possible at any other rental in Fairbanks. Grateful to the Star Base command center for keeping the place ship shape and our crew well informed throughout our stay!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,Loved staying at Starbase! The hot tub on a cold night in the snow was bucket list worthy!
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Eric (and Sarah) was genuinely a great host. From the initial communication to taking care of a few little issues upon arrival. We were happy with the house and enjoyed the fireplace tremendously! We did arrive a few minutes early and hadn't read in the messages that early check in required that we contact them, but once we did, they were able to set the entry time to earlier so we could get in. We really were impressed with their responsiveness (timely and helpful) and desire to provide the best possible stay to their guests. Beds in and under the loft near the kitchen were really comfortable! The dome was cute, but we didn't use it because it was so cold out. We also didn't use the gaming room, but if you are into that it would be really cool! We did use the grill which worked great! House was stocked with all the necessary items. the location was near town, but felt very private and in the woods. Eric was very helpful in recommending local spots and tours too! Fun place!1"
2024-02-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Very cool place. Super vibey. Solid kitchen and a lot of things to cook with. Great hot tub. Only complaint is the bed sheets were so bad. Stiff and hard.
2024-02-01,3,Group trip,"We had a nice stay at the house, despite some hiccups at the beginning. Eric was extremely responsive and helpful and made sure to do what he could to help rectify the situation. The beds were relatively comfortable and the house was well stocked with dishes, utensils, etc. Unfortunately, the dome door was broken and completely unusable, which we were not made aware of prior to our stay. Additionally, the hot tub chemicals were off; the hot tub smelled and the water was murky. Eric was able to send a cleaner out our first night to fix it, but we didn’t feel comfortable using it the rest of the weekend. Location is good, about 15-20 minutes to anywhere we wanted to go in town. Overall we had a nice stay and were lucky enough to see the northern lights!"
2024-02-01,5,Group trip,"February 9 to 17, 2024
Thank you, Captain Eric and the Star Base team, for such a wonderful stay! Your hospitality made our journey truly unforgettable. We appreciate the attention to detail and the warm welcome. We are eagerly looking forward to our next adventure with you.
During our stay, we had the pleasure of witnessing the stunning aurora from the backyard – truly amazing! Celebrating Valentine's Day with my family amidst such a beautiful setting was an experience we will cherish forever.
Thank you, Eric, Ellen, and Sarah, for this special vacation.
The BRUNI family
P.S. We couldn't resist mentioning that we also enjoyed listening to the Beatles during our stay!"
2024-02-01,5,Group trip,"We had a wonderful stay at the Star Base! We loved the mid century modern feel. Our favorite part of the stay was the hot tub, which we enjoyed every night and had a great view of the sky. It was a very private location but close driving distance to great local restaurants and activities. Eric was a fantastic host and quick to respond with any questions we had. We highly recommend!!!"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This was SUCH a fun stay! The house was beautiful and quirky and incredibly fun. We loved the game room of course, but also loved all the other board games, puzzles and books. All the details and decorations made it an immersive retro experience that we really enjoyed. Finally, our host was incredible and communicative and helpful. If you stay, make sure you read the old newspaper article about the original couple who built the house in the 1960s, it’s in the back of the guidebook. Also, the hot tub was still hot and delightful at -45."
2024-02-01,5,Group trip,Clean and fun space. Cabin vibes
2024-01-01,5,Group trip,"We had a great time in Fairbanks! The house was very clean and cozy. We loved the decor and it was the perfect place to come back to warm up in the cold weather. The beds were comfy and we all slept super well.
Eric was extremely responsive during our stay. He typically responded within a couple minutes and was proactive in helping up solve any problems and answer our questions.
We had a great time and would definitely stay here again if we return to Fairbanks."
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I don't think I can find the right words to describe how magical our trip was. Mt husband and I have fallen madly in love with Fairbanks, and Eric's home played a huge roll in that. The home and its surroundings are absolutely breathtaking. Everything was extremely clean, and our hosts were phenomenal. We had zero issues with the place, but Eric would still check in regardless to make sure everything was going smoothly. We enjoyed the jacuzzi every night, went snowmobiling, dog mushing, and even got to witness the aurora!! We couldn't be happier with the location of Eric's home. This will definitely not be the last time we stop by."
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"One of the best stays I have had. Eric was such an amazing host, always got back with prompt responses and made sure we were comfortable at the airbnb from time to time.
The house is so beautiful and cozy. Made us feel at home with all the exciting stuff like arcade games the sauna and board games. We felt safe at the accommodation. The washrooms were super clean. Overall a very well maintained house. Highly recommend this place. 💯"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,10/10 recommend. Surrounding area is nice and quiet
2023-12-01,5,Group trip,This is such a great place that I will definitely recommend it to my friends who are planning to visit Fairbanks
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place and great host. Eric and Sarah responded quickly and helped us solve the problem within half an hour.
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The house is unique, the surroundings are breathtaking, and the fireplace and hot tub set off the -22° day nicely.
It is conveniently located to the many shops and restaurants Fairbanks has to offer.
Being from the south, it was nice they anticipated things we would need, like a place to plug in the cars engine heater.
KEURIG pods provided really was a nice touch since we arrived late and did not get to stop for coffee.
There is room for plenty of folks. We slept in the upstairs loft, plenty of privacy and toasty warm. At first the beds seemed extremely firm, but we quickly realized that they were really comfortable.
The bathrooms must be recently remodeled, it seemed they had heated floors. Lots of nic3 fluffy towels and extra pillows.
We are a group of retired folks and there are some stairs. We were extremely cautious on the steps into the living room.
Overall, a very good value and if I ever trek to the last frontier again, I would stay here."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed one night,Totally would come and also recommend
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Best Airbnb in Fairbanks, super cozy! How tub is amazing, especially with the view! And the host is super nice and always response so quick!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very nice place too stay would highly recommend too anyone worth every penny I paid
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Deanna is the best host, most friendly & most accommodating person I have ever met. She was very responsive even when planning our trip, she shared & helped us to recommend best places to go/visit & restaurants.
We are traveling with our 9 & 7 year olds & they loved spending time with her cute horses & newest addition, little horse Phoebe. She left carrots in our fridge to feed the horses… For our last evening she prepared a beautiful fire outside with S’mores. Kids absolutely loved it & loved her! Even though we didn’t cook there, the kitchen is fully equipped, there’s wonderful local coffee, water in the fridge, etc… everything is there & the cabin is beautifully decorated. You feel right at home & wanting to stay longer & definitely come back!
Thank you Deanna, you made our Fairbanks/North Pole experience more than worth while! Thank you 🥰
Family Van Broekoven (from Belgium/Switzerland)"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Deanna was the best AirBnB host we’ve ever had! Her place is beautiful and charming. She welcomed us with warm hugs and a warm freshly baked banana bread! I must add, she’s a great baker! She made this trip so special for us for helping me organize a small surprise birthday party for my husband. She baked his cake herself! It was very special and her loc recommendations are bang on! Definitely worth a visit!! And if you visit Fairbanks, Deanna’s place is where you have to stay if you want a cozy comfy home away from home!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This property has so much character and perfect for our main reason to visit-to see the Northern lights. First off, when we booked the property, Deanna reached out to give us important information before we even started to plan our trip. She was very responsive. On our first day, we were welcomed with homemade fresh baked banana bread and it was delicious!! My 8yo enjoyed feeding the horses on the property with the carrots Deanna provided. She also invited us on our first night to a fire in the back of the property as we sat out to watch for the Northern Lights. The beds are comfy, the kitchen is well stocked, and we could even view the auroras from indoors through the big windows. We highly recommend staying here for anyone who is looking for a hospitable host and want to explore Fairbanks and it's surrounding areas. Thank you Deanna!!!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,Best host ever!! Dianna is very friendly and kind. Her place is clean and comfortable. Can not wait to come back again 😊
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We cannot say enough great things about Deanna and her property! The place is beautiful, inside and out! It is built and situated so that you can see the Northern Lights right from your bed! The cabin was clean , and stocked with lots of amenities, and plenty of extra goodies! She goes above and beyond any other host to make you feel welcome and comfortable..including some homemade goodies; and a campfire with all the fixings for s’mores! From my very first inquiry, Deanna answered LOTS of questions and gave us so so many ideas for activities and eateries; and all the advice of a lifelong Alaskan. We left planning our next visit, and to stay in touch with someone we will now call our forever FRIEND! Can’t wait to go back in the summer to experience the lake that’s right outside the cabin and canoe and kayak! If you’re considering visiting Alaska, think no more, and book this Airbnb cabin now! You won’t be disappointed!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What a beautiful place to stay! You can’t beat the view from the cabin! I loved staying in the loft, being able to look out the window while laying in bed was amazing. I even set up my camera and was able to capture the northern lights and a moose! We will be visiting again soon!
Thank you Deanna for everything. Can’t wait to hang out more next time."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed about a week,"As our week long stay comes to an end, I find myself emotional about leaving. We’ve fallen in love with Deanna and Alaska. Deanna is by far the most attentive in all her details. She has a genuine interest and willingness to ensure your best stay. This vacation has by far exceeded any of our Air BnB experience’s. Her Raven themed cabin is cozy and welcoming. The big picture windows in the cabin provide the most serene setting for looking out to the lake. We did not have to want for anything during our stay. We definitely desire to be a repeat guest, maybe for the Summer Solstice next! We highly recommend staying here for anyone visiting Alaska. If we could rate it 10/10, we’d give it an 11!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Deanna loves being an AirBNB host and her passion is evident in everything she does. As a Fairbanks local she can guide you to whatever your interests are: sightseeing, restaurants, tours, etc. We loved the cabin and the raven themed artwork throughout. We saw the aurora 2 nights, and thankfully Deanna alerted us one time when the lights started really late. The cabin also has a beautiful view with regular moose sightings! This is the only place we will stay in Fairbanks. AirBNB is lucky to have hosts like Deanna!"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Where do I begin? Let me first say that my husband and I are AVID Airbnb users. None have compared to Deanna as a host. The whole cabin is so incredibly cozy, beautifully designed, feels like a big warm hug. Honestly, it’s a reflection of Deanna! The minute we walked in the door we were greeted with the scent of her freshly baked chocolate chip banana bread. We spent so many nights by the fire sharing laughs, stories, and wonderful conversation. She even brought out a table and we got to make s’mores! Her knowledge, recommendations, attention to detail, and kindness made this trip unforgettable. Deanna became a friend by the end of this trip. We were so sad to leave! But we will definitely be back :)"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"If you think the picture of this place is beautiful, the actual place is even better. I have never seen a place with such characters. Its location is very peaceful and private. Parking is easy to get in and out. This place is full of amenities, you will think you have over-packed. Deanna is the most wonderful host and person I have ever met. She is very knowledgeable and helpful. She is a Fairbanks' local, so she can give excellent recommendations. There is no doubt if I ever in Fairbanks in the future, I would stay here again. This place made my vacation unforgettable. Thank you for everything, Deanna!!"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Words cannot explain the most wonderful experience my husband and I had at our stay with Deanna at Camp Curvy Birch. We chatted so much before we even got there, I felt like we had known her for years and when we arrived we greeted each other with a smile and hug! There's nothing Deanna wouldn't do to make sure we had a wonderful stay and a great time. Her place is beautiful inside and out. The house has these magnificent windows that allow you to rest in the evening with the beautiful sunrises and sunsets, then relaxing and looking out over the property with the horses. Then at night you can look out for the Aurora, all while in the comfort of the beautiful place that Deanna has created to be the most awesome, lovely, comfortable place to be in the North Pole. If you want to do something or go somewhere, she knows the best places and will make sure it's what you want. The house had everything you needed and more! The house and scenery are absolutely breathtaking!"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Deanna is the best host ever! Upon booking, she reached out with a guide of activities and restaurants that made our planning so easy! The cabin is one of the most beautiful I have seen, so cozy and surrounded by the most magical landscape. Deanna welcomed us with a delicious chocolate chip bread, still warm from the oven and we loved hearing her stories about the place and the horses. The place has everything we needed, and Deanna made us feel home immediately. Throughout our stay, Deanna made recommendations for restaurants based on our itinerary.
I will definitely recommend this stay to our friends and to anyone who is considering to visit Alaska! Thanks Deanna for these days, we will never forget North Pole, your cabin, the northern lights and this magical experience! 🩷"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Had an amazing place to stay. Very comfortable and enjoying experience and surroundings. Deanna was a very humble and accommodating hostess. Very friendly and willing to help you find things to do while you’re staying with her. Will be coming back!
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place was wonderful, Deanna was on top of everything and duper nice. The place is close to great places to see and waking up in the morning to the beautiful snowy lake and horses was magical. Can’t wait to ckme back!"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed one night,Deanna's place is very nice and well-provisioned. Our stay was during an incredible cold snap and Deanna went out of her way to make sure that we were taken care of. This is a lovely location adjacent to a pond and we were lucky enough to see a moose nearby and the aurora borealis right through the window.
2024-01-01,5,Stayed about a week,"We had a wonderful week at Deanna's cabin. The location and home were beautiful, and everything inside was new/well-maintained and homey. We came for the northern lights (3/7 nights) which came with cold weather (-30s throughout the week), but the cabin was nice and warm, and Deanna's freshly baked banana bread certainly helped out. She was an amazingly thoughtful host, and we'd love to come back and see the area during the summer months.
Cannot recommend this place enough!"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Being that this was my dream trip…booking with Deanna definitely made it extra special. She was so sweet and full of knowledge about Alaska. She gave me suggestions on food places as well as who was good to book our rental car from, and every activity we did. She literally gives you the best of the best. The cabin was cozy and felt like home away from home. Anything that we could have needed was there! And a perk was feeding the horses carrots!! Highly highly highly recommend Deanna and Camp Curvy Birch"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,A really exceptional experience! Host is super friendly and responsive! And the whole cabin is clean and comfortable. The interior exactly matches with the pictures. Definitely will come back in summertime and highly recommended!
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Our family had a wonderful experience. She was very helpful with fabulous local restaurants and local attractions. Even though we were there for Christmas she knew what was open for the holidays . We had to do no searching. Definitely would stay again.
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This Airbnb experience has truly been the most exceptional one I’ve ever had!
Deanna is an incredibly warm host who not only welcomed us warmly but also shared so much about what makes Fairbanks so special.
During our stay, Deanna went above and beyond by surprising us with a delectable chocolate cake that melted our heart, making us feel truly cherished. Her attention to detail and thoughtfulness added to the incredibly unforgettable travel experience.
The accommodation itself was an art piece—outstanding—elegant, cozy, clean, comfortable, and equipped with everything we needed and beyond. Its convenient location made it easy to explore the many interesting attractions and activities nearby.
Deanna’s Airbnb has etched indelible memories in our hearts, and I wholeheartedly recommend this place to anyone planning a visit to Fairbanks. Thank you, Deanna, for the exceptional experience!"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Wow! What an amazing day at Deanna’s cabin. The area is secluded, and quite peaceful. We had the pleasure of meeting Deanna while on our trip, and she was very friendly and made us feel right at home! We also had fun feeding Denali, Pirate, and Rebel. Definitely would recommend this cozy cabin to stay at, and Deanna will give you tons of recommendations even before your stay! (Which was a lifesaver)."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is the most beautiful cabin for a cozy winter getaway. Deanna is by far the best host we’ve ever met and gave us a really special week in Alaska.
When we arrived at a very late hour, there was the most delicious warm loaf waiting for us in the cabin (I don’t know how this was pulled off!) and the cabin smelled amazing.
Deanna provided us with a wealth of local knowledge and recommendations, all of which were just perfect for us.
The property is stunning! From watching the northern lights to feeding the horses, it was just the most incredible time.
The cabin has beautiful views of the lake and night sky. It has everything you’ll need and feels like a home. It’s obvious this is also a passion project.
Staying here is way more than just a place to stay. Deanna made it an experience we’ll never forget."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Deanna is a wonderful host with a beautiful place. Her recommendations for nearby places and things to do were spot on. The place was exactly as described and we had an amazing stay. I will definitely be coming back in the summer months. Highly recommended.
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"When you book at Camp Curvy Birch, you get an incredible host, a beautiful, isolated cabin, and s'mores by the fire on a lake! We could not have found a better location to spend our three days in Fairbanks!
Our nights were quiet, and we always felt well-rested. Although the cabin *is* by a road, there is a treeline between the two, and the road itself is very lightly traveled.

The cabin was well stocked with everything we could have possibly needed, and Deanna was always very responsive. She gave us wonderful recommendations for everything from rental cars to dog sledding adventures to local businesses/coffee shops and diners.
We absolutely loved Camp Curvy Birch and highly recommend it!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Deanna is an incredible person, she will make your trip easy and unforgettable, she does her best to make you feel at home. I will always be grateful to her. This trip changed my life and all my wishes were fulfilled thanks to her. God bless you always Deanna I will never forget this trip.
It is the best decision to enjoy your vacation here, I will return soon!
Thanks for everything!!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed about a week,We enjoyed the fact that the location was remote with easy access to amenities. Deanna thought of everything from needs to kitchen to bedding to laundry. She was extremely helpful in making sure we got to see the aura borealis. Deanna was extremely knowledgeable about all local services. She is a great communicator and she has great stories. And she truly cares about her guests. We are already thinking about coming back. THANK YOU DEANNA YOU ARE A ROCKSTAR!!
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I couldn’t even begin to express how happy we were to stay with Deanna. Everything an AirBnB should be. She was extremely easy to communicate with, the accommodations were amazing, and her hospitality was tip-top. The cabin is situated on a quaint private road, along an amazing lake, on a private piece of paradise. We walked in and immediately fell in love, we had plans to explore but spent most of our time in the cabin enjoying the serene surroundings. To add the cherry on top, our host Deanna was the best you could hope for. A local, she knows all the best spots and her recommendations were right on. She made our stay one to remember and if I ever make my way to Fairbanks again I would make it a point to stop and say hello. This experience was a total package that is rare to find, I couldn’t imagine anything more we could have wanted."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a great, relaxing stay at Deanna’s place! She is a wonderful host who truly cares about the wellbeing of her guests and is very thoughtful about helping visitors get the best experiences from their stay. The scenery is so beautiful and tranquil, and feeding the horses nearby was a nice, sweet activity for us. Definitely worth visiting again!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,Really well thought out little cabin. Nice view of the host’s lake and everything was very comfortable. She visited with our 2 year old daughter and 9 month old daughter and after a super long day of traveling we arrived at 3am to find an adorable stuffed animal on one of the beds with a note on it that said “I belong to Faye!”. So sweet and nice.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had an absolutely wonderful stay at Deanna's Airbnb and cannot recommend it enough! The beautiful space and peaceful view exceeded our expectations in every way. The location was perfect, with easy access to local attractions and great dining options. The host's hospitality was exceptional! Deanna was incredibly welcoming, responsive, and accommodating, making sure we had everything we needed for a comfortable stay. Deanna's genuine kindness and warmth made the stay so special and memorable. Overall, we couldn't have asked for a better experience. If you're looking for a beautiful place to stay with a host who goes above and beyond, we HIGHLY recommend this Airbnb!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What a great experience. As locals to Alaska, we travel a lot to Fairbanks. This spot was by far one of the best stays we’ve had. Super clean, fresh baked goodies, and well stocked. The host is a great human and I’m pretty sure we’d be great friends if we lived closer!
We will book again asap."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Deanna was very friendly, she had our check in ready with a fresh loaf of banana bread and was very responsive and available! Her home is right on the property, while it is private from the neighbors, and the view and horses are lovely."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed about a week,I have nothing but positive things to say about our stay here! Not only was Deanna’s cabin clean absolutely BEAUTIFUL and in a GORGEOUS location but she could not have been a better host! Was flexible when we needed early checkin due to flights and we were still greeted by a WARM banana bread that was to die for! (How she did it when we got in at 3am is beyond me). She had some of the best suggestions for where to eat and drink and must see places! Deanna was even kind enough to help take us to our rental car when we were in a bind! If you’re going to Alaska make it a priority to stop at camp curvy birch and stay with Deanna I promise you won’t regret it! Thank you for everything and making us feel at home! I know we will be back!
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Deanna and her lovely cabin was such a highlight to our Alaska adventure! She was such an amazing host and was so welcoming to us (& with some homemade warm banana bread), which was a delightful touch. Deanna had so many suggestions for us and wanted to make sure there was never a dull moment. I’ve never had an Airbnb host who has made me feel like I have made a friend! It was so hard to leave this cabin but we know there will be a next time :)"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This place was the best ever place we stayed in our 8 days of Alaskan trip. I was so happy about this place as this place is in exact right place for seeing a northern lights and also few places to visit in Fairbanks and Chena.
Apart from the place the Host Deanna was so kind and friendly also informative. We loved the host more than the place 😊. Our long trip was a rainy / cloudy trip and the day before checkout we heard that there is a Northern Light with a KP-5. I haven’t seen the Aurora that much and one of my main reason to travel is to see the Aurora. I was not sure whether I should checkout on my day or do an extended stay just to see the Aurora. I requested Deanna for a extended day and she immediately accepted the request and suggest the places to watch on her cabin and also nearby spot. If I haven’t met Deanna I would have lost hope of watching the Aurora.
Would definitely recommend this stay. And we already miss Deanna and her Cabin."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Can’t say enough good things about Deanna’s place! We got in pretty late the first night but it was still easy to navigate and the second I walked in I said I didn’t want to leave.
The cabin / house is adorable. I stayed up in the loft with no challenges and the bed was super comfortable.
We even had banana bread waiting on our arrival which was amazing.
The place was a great mix of being secluded and serene with full amenities from wifi to tv to new appliances. You could use it as a place to hop in and out of activities in Fairbanks or just hide out with a book and a fire.
Deanna is super responsive and helpful for even the smallest questions. 10/10 would recommend and can’t wait to go back!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The place was sensational. We felt extremely comfortable 😊
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I would have given Deana 100 stars, if I could have. Not only was her cabin unique, artsy, and welcoming, but it was in a beautiful setting on a private lake with kayaks and horses.
Deana was a phenomenal host, and all of her personal touches made this a memorable stay. I hope I am able to return someday."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This Airbnb is great! Deanna is a wonderful host. The banana bread lived up to all the expectations.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Deanna’s place is unlike any other! The property is so serene and beautiful. We loved waking up and looking out and the lake and listening to the birds. The cabin is immaculate with extra “touches” everywhere. We walked in to smell freshly baked bread waiting for us! Deanna was always super helpful and offered excellent suggestions including restaurants, activities, and shops. Kayaks were always ready by the lake if we wanted to take them out. There is also a fire pit….we just ran out of time to use it. Book this property! You will love staying here!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I can’t recommend this stay enough, this airbnb was by far one of the best places I have ever stayed at! The location was absolutely stunning! There were horses you can feed within a few feet of your stay and a lake where you can relax while taking in the beautiful views on your kayack. This was such a peaceful place to be, Deanna was so kind and helpful! She gave me recommendations on where to eat and visit and she ensured that I was comfortable during my whole stay! The bnb itself was very cozy and comfortable and absolutely stunning with everything you need at your disposal. To say the least, I have no complaints at all. Deanna was so welcoming and passionate about what she does I will definitely be visiting again!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The lovingly designed cabin by the lake is a good starting point to explore the surrounding area. It is worth a hike to the nearby forests (Chena River) or to the brewery in Fairbanks. Many moose in the area, beavers live in the lake and the kayaks invite you to cruise on the lake. Everything is perfectly equipped and Deanne provided us daily not only with good info about the area and restaurants, but was also a pleasure to talk with her. Must be a dream in the colder months with northern lights!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"What can say....Deanna is the most impeccable host in the most beautiful, idyllic Alaskan oasis. Do not let the size listed be a deterrent....the high angled ceiling and thoughtful placement of things make the space seem way bigger! Everything was perfect, from the easy communication and great local recommendations, to the freshly baked bread at check in, s'mores at the fire, taking my 2 kids (9 & 13) out on the lake to see the beavers in kayaks, the amazing horses (okay, Pirate is a teenage brat!), and the gorgeous property, this ranks as my top Air BnB I have stayed in. The place is FULLY stocked to cook, very clean space, and unreal views. Cannot wait for a repeat winter trip!!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I don’t even know where to start. I never leave reviews because I never know if people read them. This time is different. Different because when something good happens you need to write about it. THIS WAS THE BEST EXPERIENCE EVER! Deanna was the kindest host—from warm homemade banana bread, lovely cozy accommodations to her care for her property and the people (us, especially my two young kids!) who stay in it—made this a place we will come back to again and again. If there was a hall of fame for hosts, she would be a first ballot hall of famer!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,Deanna’s place was just perfect for our family of four. The guest house is beautifully decorated and so homey! Deanna was a gem. We had such a wonderful time interacting with her and our kids felt right at home. They fed the horses and kayaked in the lake. We can’t wait to come back.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,This place made my trip ❤️❤️❤️
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful and serene
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The Airbnb (camp curvy birch) far exceeded all of our expectations! The listing was exceptional to start and imagine topping that - which it clearly did!! So amazed! The host Deanna was the best of the best hosts we have ever had! She was very friendly, helpful and fun through your stay! Great Lake to kayak and sit beside fireside. What a grand stay!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"This cabin was absolutely beautiful and well worth the drive from Anchorage! It was clean, modern but with a cozy feel, had a beautiful lakefront, a fire waiting for us when we arrived and the cutest horses! We had fresh baked banana chocolate chip bread (absolutely delicious, I need to try to replicate it!), an abundance of carrots to feed the horses and pet them, there were kayaks set out and it wasn't a hassle to find some good resteraunts close by. Chena was also very close which was a big plus! I had reserved when she had one night slots available and despite that not being the norm for her she graciously let us stay and went above and beyond to make us feel welcome and comfortable in her gorgeous space. I will definitely have to come again whenever I visit Fairbanks/North Pole. I highly recommend!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Deanna is an amazing host that will go out of your way to have a memorable Alaskan vacation. Will have the fire pit and kayak available if asked
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Deanna was a fantastic host and Camp Curvy Birch was wonderful.
Spotless, beautiful, and peaceful.
Her recommendations were spot on and she was great. Her chocolate chip banana bread was great too.
We all loved feeding the horses carrots. Looking forward to going back in the winter to chase the Norther Lights. 😊"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Fantastic stay! The moose managed to dodge us for our entire stay but they had tracks all around.
Would definitely recommend if you’re looking for a quiet spot that’s still conveniently close to everything in the area."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Honestly the best air bnb experience that I have ever had. Not only is the property beautiful but the host was beyond amazing! She went above and beyond to ensure that our trip was one to remember. Literally did not have to do much because she let me know all of the local spots to eat and activities centers to have a great time. Was always available to answer any questions and give guidance. All and all amazing 10/10 Please book! Trust me it does not disappoint. Just a wonderful place to stay.
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Seeing the northern lights, feeding the horses carrots, the friendly hostess, the warm chocolate banana bread was a nice touch, the lake, the moose on the lake, all this made for a great experience. Tom and Theresa Dunn"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The hostess with the mostest! Deanna is friendly, communicative and extremely helpful. She definitely goes out of her way to make you feel welcome and at home. Gorgeous property. Beautiful home."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Absolutely amazing! Far exceeded our expectations. The cabin was beautiful and the property even more beautiful. Deanna made sure everything was perfect and had all the little extras. After a long day of traveling walking in to the smell of the nest choc chip banana bread was so welcoming. 5 stars aren’t enough. A million stars earned. I hope we can visit again soon.
2023-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Deanna’s place was amazing! We’ve stayed in many AirBnBs and this was probably our most favorite. She was friendly, responsive & the place was immaculate!! Will definitely stay again should we visit Fairbanks area again."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"WOW!! Where do I even begin?! Camp Curvy Birch was absolutely amazing. The location is stunning!! We were able to see the aurora the first two nights we were there. The location of the cabin makes it so you can see the northern lights right from the living room (and even from the lofted bed!) The cabin was stocked with everything we needed, and was incredibly comfortable and home-y! Deanna was an absolutely incredible host - she is so nice!! She gave us some wonderful local recommendations on food, activities. She even went above and beyond and offered us laundry service in her own home when the washer in the cabin was out of service. I would HIGHLY recommend this cabin to anyone!!! We will definitely be back! A truly memorable stay 😁"
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a fantastic stay, the place felt like new and was well stocked for people who like to cook. Beds were comfy. We broke something and Deanna was super easy to work with to fix it. The Airbnb is so charming and I loved feeding the horses the carrots that were left in the fridge. Winter was great, I bet summer is also fantastic! Would def return."
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Gorgeous little home just as pictured. Close enough to town for meals out, but far enough to feel secluded, private, and far from lights! Unfortunately the weather was uncooperative… snowy and cloudy, so we didn’t get an Aurora show. But we had a blast dog mushing, going to Chena Hot Springs, and seeing the international ice carving championships. Deanna was an extraordinary host, including turning on the lights and heat in the house in preparation for our late night arrival after missed flight connections. Fantastic stay. Highly recommended!"
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My husband and I had an amazing vacation! Deanna was a super host, best recommendations and beautiful property. The locals are very friendly. We are definitely coming back. Wish we could have stayed forever. 🥰"
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Absolutely the best AirBnb I’ve ever stayed in. Nothing even compares to the quality of stay that Deanna provided. I just finished my stay here and I am honestly at a loss for words for how to describe her hospitality and the beauty of the property. It truly felt like a home away from home and immersed me into the feel of Alaskan living. From the reviews it looks like she has had many return guests, no doubt I will be one of them! Deanna made this trip one I will never forget! 🤍❄️"
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Can't say enough AMAZING things about our stay at Deanna's cabin!! Was the best experience we have had at an Airbnb!! She is a GEM!! So sweet, caring, and super thoughtful! Made us feel right at home and gives the best recommendations to places!! She is easy to contact for anything and makes you feel like family.
Her cabin is close to everything and very easy to get around! The views are impeccable- we love the snow and were blown away!! She has horses to feed carrots to and are so sweet! 😊
You can tell she puts so much love into her cabin and provides her guests with the best experience possible!!
We had the BEST honeymoon and Deanna was a great part in that!!
Plus we saw the Nothern lights on our last night and she was so helpful with it all and made us an amazing fire to watch!
Don't miss out on staying at her place- you won't regret it!! We can't wait to come back!!"
2023-01-01,5,Stayed about a week,"This was my second year in a row at Deanna’s Camp Curvy Birch, it’s that awesome!"
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This house is the perfect spot to see Northern Lights. You don't have to go to other places chasing and waiting, just relax waiting for the Northern Lights to come out.
Deanna is such a great host, she always responds to our questions in no time.
This is our second time staying at this lovely house. For sure we will come back again when we visit Fairbanks next time."
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We really love this cabin! Every night, we saw northern lights in the cabin. Deanna is so helpful and kindness, gave us lots of support and suggestions during our stay. We have tea, coffee, cupcakes mix, and hot chocolate ！ Deanna prepared all what we need for us! The view outside is amazing, definitely we would come back!"
2022-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Deanna’s stay at the North Pole was perfect combo of comfort, cozy and cleanliness. We were greeted as soon as we arrived and she even baked us a delicious banana 🍌 chocolate bread, which was still warm upon our arrival. Beautiful high ceilings, comfy couch and cozy loft for sleeping. Deanna communication was on point. She knew all the cool spots to see during our stay. Would definitely stay here again when I visit the North Pole in the future! Thank you 😊"
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Such an amazing trip. Deanna was welcoming and very helpful in planning our trip. She truly cares about her guests. Highly recommend staying here if you are traveling to the Fairbanks/North Pole area.
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"There really aren't enough words to describe our stay at Camp Curvy Birch. The hostess was incredibly helpful from dining recommendations months ahead (for those that would require a reservation) to excursions to directions, timing, shopping locations, we could not have asked for more. The location is beautiful, the cabin feels exactly like home followed you to this snowy destination and the personal touches the hostess provides are second to none. No one would regret staying here, we can't wait to visit again!"
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Deanna was a fabulous host and the location was absolutely beautiful. We enjoyed every minute of our stay.
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Perfect!! All the amenities you will need plus the best banana chocolate chip bread!! Deanna was there for us all the way!! Our 1st night she messaged me “the lights were coming across the lake”!! The Auroras were my bucket list and Deanna told me how to see them or I never would have. After that we saw them every night!!! She was always giving us recommendations which we did them all!! We were not able to have a fire with Deanna and her daughter or feed the horses, but hope to come back when it’s warm!!! One last thing, cause I could go on and on! Our last day, our flight was moved up and Deanna told us to just stay as long as we needed which was a blessing for us. Her next renters were coming the next day so we were so lucky!! Go stay in Deanna’s homey cabin, any season, you will be glad you did!!!"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Deanna was a great host. The cabin was exactly as described, it was perfect for us. We were welcomed to warm banana bread. We stayed for about a week and Deanna had plenty of recommendations for things to do and places to eat. We had a fire one night and she supplied all the fixings for the s’mores and the cabin was well stocked for us! We appreciate what Deanna does and would love to come back again some day. If the time is open book the cabin, it was worth it."
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We can not say enough great things about our time at Deanna’s place! The cabin is perfect and had all the things we needed for our getaway to the North Pole. The location was amazing! On a great little lake (which we got to see freeze over in the few days we were there 😮) and close to so many great things to visit. And Deanna and Gracyn are wonderful. They provided a campfire and shared in a night we’ll never forget-we were fortunate enough to see the Northern lights and Deanna and Gracyn were great company. Deanna was so very helpful with her guidebook as well as personally recommending places to eat and visit. And even though they live on the property they were very respectful and gave us our own space. We definitely plan to return someday and came home considering Deanna and Gracyn our new friends!
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Deanna’s place is incredible! My daughter and I enjoyed the property so much and Deanna’s personal touches made us feel at home from the moment we arrived. If you’re planning a trip to the Fairbanks area, you NEED to stay here!"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed about a week,"“Four Word”
Charming/Clean/Cozy/Thoughtful
A relaxing home away from home with all the little extras you wont find in other Airbnbs.
Deanna knew we had a late flight so she made sure the place ready for our arrival. The beds were turned down, fresh home made banana bread (which was a DELIGHTFUL treat), and all the extras to kick off your morning.
We were all luck to watch Lady A together by the a warm cozy fire not once but twice. Capturing and sharing photos and stories as we waited into the night.
Thank you for the memories and will forever be cherished."
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Words cannot explain how wonderful our stay at Deanna’s cabin has been! From the location, to the cabin to the amazing time and effort Deanna has put into every aspect of the cabin. Deanna is also one of the kindest people we have met! As we are from Australia, we do not drive and Deanna was kind enough to take us to get groceries and take us to some popular places around town! We didn’t expect this but we are so thankful as it make our trip so much better! On top of the already wonderful stay and location, we were able to see the northern lights on our last night! Absolutely adored our visit and wish we could have stayed longer!"
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place is really something special. It will captivate your heart, relax your soul, release your inner-child and clear space for amazing memories. Deanna is an amazing host and incredible human being and she will move mountains to make your stay the best thing that ever happened."
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My daughter and I absolutely adored staying here! Deanna keeps the place immaculate, she gives great tips on where to go, works so hard, and doesn't hover and gives you space to relax. We loved feeding her horses carrots everyday! Was a fantastic memory made with my daughter! Cannot go wrong staying here!!!! XOXO"
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I don’t even know where to start. This place was beyond magical. From the moment we got there our host took care of us like we were family. The home itself was one of the best airbnbs we’ve ever stayed at. Clean, cozy and fully stocked full of the essentials and more. The lake view was breathtaking with the sunsets and sunrises, and don’t even get me started on the northern light show…if you’re looking for the Alaska experience, but want to feel at home this is the place for you. If you’re lucky you’ll even get to sit by the fire with an adorable horse."
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This place is AMAZING ! Highly recommend. Our host thought of every detail that would make our stay special. The land is peaceful and serene. Every detail has been thought through. S'mores by the fire was an exceptional touch. Thank you Deanna. We will be return guests for certain.
2022-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The very special cabin that makes the very memorable moments of our trip in Alaska. We got to meet Deanna who is the most friendly host we ever got to meet and learned so much about the local life from. The banana bread was fresh out of the oven when we arrived and there were carrots in the fridge that we could grab at o feed the horses! Full case of water and bowl of chocolates, so much care and love! Not to mention the custom built and bird themed cabin with birch branches and big windows looking over the lake. We wish we stayed longer, but a good excuse to come back!"
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What a great experience, an amazing cabin with an equally amazing host!! Great place to view the northern lights and close to everything you would want to see near Fairbanks. Has everything you could want and more. When we come back to Fairbanks we will definitely be staying at the Raven cabin. -Thank you again Deanna😊"
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Deanna is an outstanding host and made the stay feel like home. it's true, the chocolate chip banana bread is amazing and the house smells like it when you walk in. The location is great with a nice fire pit by the water. I would highly recommend anyone visiting to stay here!!"
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful little place. The host was top notch. The kitchen and bath were well equipped. Very clean. Close to a pretty heavily trafficked road, but otherwise it was very peaceful."
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Deanna is the embodiment of the Alaskan spirit. She is welcoming, helpful and kind to everyone she meets. We held our wedding reception on her property and she went above and beyond the call of duty- lending a hand wherever she saw a need. The cabin was warmly decorated and smelled like chocolate chip banana bread - which she made for us to begin our stay with. She gave us fresh carrots to feed the horses and kept the fire burning. I’ve never met a more gracious person."
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,What a wonderful place to stay. The cottage was designed and decorated so well. It has an incredible view and the host was super friendly. There were personal touches everywhere. An incredible time for my family to connect.
2022-07-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Our stay in the Raven cabin at Camp Curvy Birch was five star all around. The owner, Deanna, thought of everything a guest could possibly need, including a selection of locally roasted coffees, large fluffy white hotel towels, homemade banana bread, carrots to feed the horses, and so much more. As an experienced artist herself, Deanna has tastefully decorated the cabin with beautiful works from numerous local artists. Before we booked with Deanna we researched all of the other cabins in the area - as someone who's traveled internationally for the last 15 years and stayed in dozens of Air BnBs, I can promise nothing else even comes close to the comfort and hospitality you will experience at Camp Curvy Birch. Thank you for everything, Deanna!!!"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Deanna’s cabin was the perfect space for our family of four to stay while exploring Fairbanks, Chena Hot Springs, and North Pole over several days. Moreover, Deanna was an amazing host, from greeting us on arrival and seeing us off on departure, preparing the banana bread which fed us breakfast each day, and even going out of her way to provide a craft for our kids to do on a rainy day. We’ve already recommended her place to our family in Alaska, and we would absolutely stay again if we are in the area!"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Wonderful place to stay! The cabin is sweet! Clean and exactly as described. Deanna is very attentive and responsive. Lots of lovely details to make our stay even more memorable. Unique stay, great guidebook and I would definitely recommend it. Thanks so much Deanna, this was a great break on our northern overlanding adventure."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Truly phenomenal! Deanna has pulled out all the stops to make her cabin getaway an amazing Alaskan experience. The cabin is beautiful inside and out with terrific views. She packed it full of local treats and Alaskan themed decor (plus homemade banana bread when we checked in!). What really set Deanna apart was her friendliness and hospitality. She dropped us off right down the road in her kayaks to float the Chena River through the Alaskan wilderness (we saw a moose!) into town and picked us at the end of the day. I can’t say enough good things. Thanks so much!
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Camp curvy birth is a wonderful place to stay. Deanna has a well thought out location and the cabin has everything, you will need! I will be back to stay at her place again!"
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"A few words just doesn’t suffice. We spent our wedding weekend at Deanna’s property and truly could not have picked a more perfect location. From the moment we arrived to her signature chocolate chip banana bread & beautiful cabin we felt at home.
We were able to use the property for our wedding and it was perfect. We had a lakefront ceremony, and then reception all in one location. It’s easy and quick enough for guests to get to, plenty of space, and the horses were the added bonus.
Deanna puts careful consideration and an enormous amount of love into every single aspect of the cabin as well as the entire property. Whether you’re planning a wedding or just here for a weekend getaway; this is the location you want to be."
2022-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,Deanna was a superb host. She not only made us a welcome loaf cake but also a cake Father's day. My daughter loved feeding carrots to the horses everyday. It was a plus being able to go on the kayaks without having to leave and find rentals. The cabin itself was immaculate and had everything we needed. The kitchen was the best stocked Airbnb I have seen. Deanna thought of everything. But the best part of the cabin were the views. We had such an amazing time and we can't wait to come back again.
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The AirBnB cabin and the property it sits on was beyond imagination. The view of and access to the lake and the horses right across was surreal. The unit was very tidy and organized and well, inspiring! We enjoyed the upper bedroom, bathroom, kitchen, and living area. We were in the middle of a long trip so we got to use the washer and dryer. Deanna, our host, was gracious with her stories of her, her family, and her property her and warmth welcomed us the minute we got to the property. She naturally won us over and made our stay feel wholesome. We even opened the fridge and found a bunch of carrots which we were encouraged to feed to the horses and I absolutely loved having them chomp on them from our hands so happily. We followed her recommendations and enjoyed our stay in Fairbanks in-between our time in Seward and Denali. We look forward to planning another stay here at Deanna’s and continue to follow the Camp Curvy Birch FB site to see those additions to the property Deanna has been raving about and eager to share. We 10/10 recommend staying here anytime you’re visiting Alaska! Thank you for the memories Deanna!"
2022-06-01,4,Stayed a few nights,The cabin is as gorgeous as the pictures. Deanna left all sorts of goodies for me including sort fresh baked bread. Having the horses on the property and the pond is really nice. Only downside is the property backs up to a road. It’s not super busy but it’s a fast road so there is noise from that and the four wheeling path.
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Wow, this place is absolutely amazing! Deanna put so much into this cabin and the personal touches were much appreciated. She helped with the planning of our trip and gave wonderful suggestions and went way above and beyond what a host usually does. This is the best AirBnb we have ever stayed at and can’t recommend it enough. The carrots left in the fridge for us to feed the horses was one of the highlights of our stay along with the thoughtfulness of Deanna with her gifts she left for us for our anniversary. She truly is a great person to get to know and if we come back to this area we will definitely stay here again."
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Wow! That’s the best way to describe our time at Deanna’s place. Everything was just perfect. Deanna is a world-class host who considers every detail to make you feel comfortable and welcomed. Her banana bread itself is worth the trip to Alaska!
For us, her place was the exact place we needed to spend our nights as we visited the many nearby sights during the day!
The horses and lake were beautiful - and the place is conveniently located right next to a main road to get you to North Pole and Fairbanks.
I highly recommend!"
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Deanna is such a great host! She is kind, warm, and thoughtful she gives us so many good things to know how to enjoy our trip to Fairbanks.
The house is so beautiful with a fully equipped kitchen. Outside of the house is a private beach with an excellent view.
We are looking forward to the coming Christmas holidays. Because we already booked 6 days here. Hope can see the Aurora just lying on the bed."
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,What a perfect little get away! The cabin is absolutely beautiful- Deanna is amazing! My daughter and I stayed for a few days and we couldn’t have asked for a better place to stay. Deanna is very sweet and makes you feel at home! Can’t wait to visit again!
2022-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Where do I begin.. from check in to check out, Deanna has been nothing but accommodating. She would make sure you felt right at home. I’ve traveled and stayed in many different places. By that being said, this will be a stay that my family and I will never forget. We started as guest and left as family. Deanna and her daughter, Gracyn are both amazing, kind and loving. We’re so lucky to have met you both. Thank you so much for everything!! We cannot wait to book our next stay and come visit."
2022-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,Camp Curvy Birch was such a beautiful property! Deanna was such a wonderful host! The Banana bread lived up to all the raves! :) My 7 year old son loved playing in the snow. We were able to see the northern lights from there the first two nights we were there. Such a great place close enough to town but just far enough to enjoy nature! We can’t wait to come back for a visit again!
2022-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"Deanna is the perfect hostess. Why? Because she’s all about the extras, the little things, the small touches that make you feel like YOU are her first guest. If you want to experience an Alaskan stay with heart and soul, Camp Curvy Birch is your place!"
2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Deanna and her daughter provided such an amazing Airbnb experience. I wish we could give more than a 5 star review! They welcome us the moment we got to their property and let us know they were available if we needed anything! The cabin had everything we could’ve needed for a few cozy days in, and a perfect view for watching the northern lights and moose out on the lake! Thank you again for having us, we can’t wait to come back!"
2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Perfect location, amazing views and friendly neighbors!"
2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We can't say how much we enjoyed our time here with Deanna. From the time we arrived, we were received to a beautiful, CLEAN, warm and toasty cabin. Along with a wonderful cinnamon smell from the banana bread, which was delicious! That same first night, we saw the Aurora borealis. Deanna was even kind enough to let us know when the lights were out and when moose were spotted nearby.
In the cabin, we found everything we needed. From coffee, water and even a washer and dryer(which is always a huge plus). Her location is perfect for viewing the lights. Out of the three times we saw them in our trip, two times where in this cabin. In addition, she even has horses that you can feed with carrots left in the fridge, so that's an added experience with your stay. Was hands down one of our fav Airbnb's we've stayed in. Will definitely be back."
2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was one of my favorite Airbnb experiences.
Deanna was super sweet.. greeted us the moment we arrived with a very contagious smile and warm welcome. She accommodated our odd travel schedule without hesitation, and after 7 hours of driving we walked into fresh choc. Banana bread. Her property is gorgeous and perfect for northern lights spotting; and there is restaurants very close by! Everything was perfect."
2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a fantastic time at Deanna’s place.
First of all, the cabin itself is of huge value, it’s crystal clean, it has everything we could ever need, even Netflix sub which we didn’t have of our own and we watched a whole season of show while waiting for the northern lights. The interiors design is super stylish, great for taking pictures even just inside of the cabin.
The other big pro of the cabin is its convenience for northern lights watching. You’d need somewhere without light pollution and open space to watch the lights, and Deanna’s cabin is exactly just like that. We waited inside of the cabin, watching out for the aurora map, and when it says it covers Fairbanks area, we turned off the lights and saw there’s northern lights outside then we just get dressed and walked out to the lake to watch it, we stayed in the cabin for only 2 nights in March and we saw the lights 2 nights in a row. I could never imagine waiting and watching northern lights is just this simple.
Another great experience we had is feeding the horses with the carrots Deanna prepared, that was super fun too!
Will definitely come back again!"
2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is an amazing find! Gorgeous place with amazing view out the windows. Deanna made us feel so special with lots of little extras. Home made chocolate chip banana bread loaf was warm and waiting for us upon arrival. Smelled just baked in the cabin! A whole drawer in the fridge full of carrots to feed the horses! All kitchen, bath, laundry, and other amenities you will need. Deanna even started a fire for us one night and was willing to help us chase the auroras. Spent a whole day snuggled up in the cabin, did not want to leave it was so cozy! Loved the place loved the hospitality- way above and beyond! Staying here is a must if you are in Fairbanks."
2022-03-01,5,Stayed about a week,"We had a wonderful stay at The Raven — such a cute and comforting cabin to come back to every evening on our trip to Fairbanks, Alaska! It is located in a great spot just outside of Fairbanks. It is clean, has great amenities and Deanna is an amazing host. You come as guests and leave as family! Deanna was super helpful when we had an issue with our rental car the first day, and she provided lots of great recommendations for activities and restaurants in the area. If you’re looking for a place to stay while visiting Fairbanks, look no further than The Raven! We hope to make it back to her cabin one day (hopefully that time in the summer)."
2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful cabin, warm and inviting-excellent hostess!"
2022-03-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Deanna is an amazing hostess! She was so helpful before our trip with trip planning and great suggestions. During our trip her caring and friendship were so genuine, Deanne really helped to make our vacation a trip of a lifetime."
2022-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Deanna’s air bnb was nothing short of perfect! You can tell she put in so much thought and effort in even the tiniest bit of details that made the cabin feel like home away from home. She gave us her homemade Banana bread that was absolutely delicious! The place is stocked up with everything you need from a bowl of chocolates, coffee, utensils and more! The best part was the stunning views that surrounded the cabin. I definitely miss waking up to the sunrise beaming over the lake and trees covered in snow. We were also lucky to be able to watch the northern lights while sitting right outside of our cabin. Thank you to Deanna and her wonderful family/friends for making this trip unforgettable. We will definitely come back one day! -Shane"
2022-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful lakefront property, very clean, and well equipped with all amenities. Deanna is a tremendous host and her suggestions on where to go and eat did not disappoint. The aroma of fresh baked banana chocolate chip bread greeted us as we came in the house and yes this was
our breakfast during our stay. Of course one can see the Aurora borealis during a dark, clear cloudless night! Seeing the mama moose and her baby walking across the lake as well as feeding carrots to Deanna’s horses were pluses to our stay. The Raven’s cabin is good for 2-4 people. Renting a 4x4 during the winter months is recommended. This property is close to North Pole and driving distance to Fairbanks. We will definitely come back!"
2022-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Best stay we have ever had at an AirBnB… (drop the mic)!
2022-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"You may see two reviews in a row here because I was able to extend my stay at Camp Curvy Birch. How many days you ask? 13! That should tell you how awesome it is! Also, if you are coming to see the aurora, then you need more than a nignt or two. Don’t miss this gem of a cabin - summer looks awesome, too!"
2022-02-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Two of us visited Camp Curvy Birch in February and were thrilled with this lovely cabin in the Arctic! It’s just far enough from Fairbanks to enjoy the dark skies and peace and quiet but also centrally located to go N, S, E or W for adventures. Deanna is a 5 Star Concierge ready with incredible ideas for anything & everything. You won’t find a better hostess anywhere! We even extended our stay and will for sure return. Highly recommended!"
2022-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,Deanna is a great host! She goes above and beyond to ensure her guests are well taken care of. The place is great and cute perfect for a small family. We saw the Northern lights by the windows at night—no need to go out and hunt them in a super harsh cold climate. My kids loved the loft. The beds are comfortable. The kitchen is well stocked with cooking supplies and kitchen wares. And oh there is an unlimited supply of coffee and creamer. We were welcomed with a freshly baked chocolate chip banana bread which is so delicious! And she even baked me a chocolate birthday cake on my birthday. This place is amazing with great views of the lake. Can't recommend it enough to my friends and family.
2022-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was one of our favorite airbnbs we ever stayed at. Deanna goes above and beyond for her guests and has a whole range of recommendations and is incredibly helpful!
We saw the northern lights and the cabin itself is awesome, we were able to cook, relax, get cosy, feed the horses and more.
Highly recommended, and will have to come back in summer!
My wife and I really enjoyed the Vegan chocolate chip banana bread too! Thank you for the generosity! You are awesome!!!"
2022-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was the best Airbnb we have ever stayed in! It was amazing, start to finish. Deanna takes it upon herself to ensure her guests have a wonderful experience. Highly recommend!"
2022-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Deanna is a tremendous host. She is very accommodating and gracious. The cabin has wonderful views and is fully equipped! The horses on the property are the cherry on top. We would love to go back.
2022-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great host and cabin!! it was perfect for the nights we were there to relax! has everything you could need!
2022-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was our second stay at Deanna’s place and it did not disappoint. The hospitality, decor, cleanliness, location, EVERYTHING was amazing. Not sure when are next visit to the area will be but will definitely book this place again. Highly recommended whether it’s winter, spring, summer or fall!"
2021-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Deanna went above and beyond to ensure we felt welcomed and provided for. We were greeted by delicious warm bread and a personalized note in the Airbnb. Throughout our stay she offered up recommendations for what we could do. She cleared the snow for us during a fierce snowstorm so we could leave and helped us jump our car. She was very accommodating, and everything exceeded expectations. We would love to come back."
2021-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This is one of the best rentals we have ever stayed in. The host couldn’t have been better. 5 stars aren’t enough!
2021-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great little spot in North Pole. Beautiful cabin and great amenities. We really enjoyed our stay. and feeding the horses
2021-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The cabin is so cute and the view is amazing. We loved the horses on property and being able to feed them carrots!! If you want a cute cabin experience while still being pampered with having running water lol this is it. Deanna is an amazing host! So nice and offers advice on what to do around town! Hands down the best host I’ve had. Oh and her chocolate chip banana bread is amazing! I like the location of being outside of Fairbanks, but still being able to drive into the city to do stuff, but most of the really cool things are located on the out skirts anyways so the location was perfect for the things we had planned. This location is located about 50 miles outside of Chena hot springs which is a beautiful drive anyways and near the Santa Claus House. We will definitely be coming back in the not so cold months! Lol"
2021-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Deanna is an amazing host! We had a magical time at her cabin. What a joy to wake up to that view over the lake! And to watch the stars (& on one of the nights, hints of Aurora borealis!) from the bed. Deanna went out of her way to help us with any and all questions and needs that came up while we were there, even lent my partner snow boots! The cabin itself was spotlessly clean, super cozy, & just a charming atmosphere with tasteful & artful raven themed touches that I adored discovering :) the kitchen has everything you need to cook! And the wifi was strong enough to take zoom calls & even stream a movie on Netflix, even while the space felt like we were in a remote forest far away from the world."
2021-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a great stay at Camp Curvy Birch! We were greeted with the warm smell of fresh banana bread. The cabin was well stocked with all the essentials. Deanna was very helpful with recommendations before and during our stay, and was very accommodating to our needs. It was -40, and she was still willing to start a fire outside so we could watch the northern lights. We had a great stay, and would highly recommend to others."
2021-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Amazing host and stunning view . Location was perfect to see northern light Deanna is amazing she bake welcome bread for us and it was yummy. Cabin is really cozy and cute there has everything that you want. We will come back here again for sure.
2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Deanna’s place and sense of hospitality are beyond anything we’ve ever experienced. She really cares about her guests and their experience in Alaska. She went above and beyond for us, like with an incredibly early check in and calling our car rental to about the plug in for our car. The rental is super cozy, clean, and very well stocked and provided well. She was very responsive and has tons of amazing local recommendations. She was even going to make a fire for us if Lady Aurora came out! We are so appreciative of Deanna and would absolutely recommend her place. Book asap!"
2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"First, Deanna is an amazing host. She goes above and beyond for her guests. From informing us to ask our car rental company about winterization, activity recommendations, to making us a vegan banana bread to welcome us. And another to see us off! The cabin is in the perfect location to be close to stuff in Fairbanks but still have a quiet location by a lake. The cabin is super comfortable and really well appointed. We were able to make a decent Thanksgiving dinner in the kitchen. Definitely a place to stay in Fairbanks!"
2021-11-01,5,Stayed about a week,"An absolute amazing stay with an excellent host! You will not regret staying here. Deanna is such a great host she will make you feel like your family from the moment you walk in. The lake offers breathtaking views of the sunrise, sunset, aurora and stars. (All which you can also see from inside the cozy cabin.) The cabin is a dream, so modern and beautiful. Even just staying in for the day was great. The horse outdoors are so adorable you cannot help but feed them some carrots. Overall an amazing stay in every aspect. We already booked another week before we even left."
2021-11-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Southern hospitality in a northern winter wonderland! We are from Atlanta, GA so we were a bit nervous traveling to Alaska in the winter. But our fears were immediately put to rest after arriving at this beautiful modern cabin in the snow by the almost frozen lake. Deanna is an incredible host who has everything immaculate before you arrive and the scent of the most delicious banana bread welcomes you through the door. She pays attention to the details of what makes a guest's stay comfortable and unique. Not only did she provide coffee and coffee filters, she provided things people like us would have never even considered: an extension cord for the rental car's heating plate, bear spray, a drawer full of carrots for the horses. She started multiple fires in the fire pit by the lake to help keep us warm while watching the northern lights. She also provided us with many helpful suggestions for things to do, places to visit, restaurants, etc. I cannot say enough about how awesome our stay was."
2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful experience. The location and cabin are beautiful, the surrounding areas are beautiful, wish we could’ve stayed longer. Until next time! Thank you."
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Deanna was a wonderful Host. She was very attentive to our needs. She was even kind enough to let me receive packages there for me and went above and beyond by mailing and shipping packages for us after we left. The cabin was beautiful and spacious. She has a very large library of books in the cabin about Alaska which was awesome during our downtime. The frozen lake was beautiful. It does back up to a road so there is some road noise. But, you’ll be in Alaska so you’ll be out doing things most of the time. The horse paddock is right outside the door which was great for us since we like horses but, might not be for everyone. Definitely a wonderful experience for us. Thank you Deanna."
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"You will love absolutely everything about this place. It has more than what an Airbnb has to offer. You can feed carrots to the horses, take riding lesson by arrangement, catch Northern Lights over the lake, or simply just relax by the fire pit at night or in the cozy cabin and gazing out the windows. Oh, did I mention how convenient the location of this AirBnb yet? It’s so close to everything: The Pump House, Santa Clause House, Fairbanks airport, etc… you name it. We had so much unforgettable moments at the cabin, met many great people and we look forward to be back to create more memories. Thank you Deanna and her Camp Curvy Birch!"
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This cabin is adorable! Deanna put her beautiful creative touch in this cozy haven. Not to mention the loving hospitality we received.
Grayson Lake is literally right outside your door! With a cute bonfire, perfect for viewing the Northern Lights. Lady A can be tricky to catch, so we recommend staying 4-5 days (or more honestly, you're not going to want to leave) to enjoy the catch!
Deanna is honestly the greatest hostess. She is attentive, thoughtful, and just all around a great person!
The drive from the airport was about 30 min (We recommend renting a car!) and outside food is close by as well."
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful property, wonderful host! You cannot ask for a friendlier host or more well appointed place to stay! Everything plus more was provided. Very nice, special touches and we saw the Northern lights without even leaving the property! Deanna is a heck of a fire keeper too! It was fun feeding the horses on the property too. We would definitely stay here again! Thanks for making my 50th birthday so special!!"
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This lovely cabin is a gorgeous piece of modern art and so very cozy!
From the second we turned into the driveway, saw the horses and the lake, we knew we were in for a special experience. Then the owner Deanna greeted us with a welcoming hug and we felt like old friends.
Upon entering the cabin, we were greeted with the an amazing aroma-fresh baked chocolate chip banana bread!
Every single detail of the Raven cabin is intentional to ensure an easy, comfortable stay.
We saw the northern lights on our first night, right over the lake! And when we started to feel cold being outside after midnight staring at the sky we simply walked back in the cabin and gazed at the lights from the loft bedroom.
Deanna and her daughter Gracyn are wonderful hosts and share a sweet bond that is heartwarming to witness. They are full of suggestions for dining and sightseeing, and build the very best campfires!
Alaska is beautiful, the northern lights are amazing and this cabin made our trip even more magical."
2021-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Wonderful host, wonderful place."
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Deanna is a fantastic host. The cabin is perfectly designed, well built, clean and beautiful. Perfect location to be close enough to get to all of the ""must see's"" but far enough away to still feel remote. Beautiful landscape everywhere. Northern Lights that magically reflect off of the lake. Great place to visit. Great place to stay. I cannot speak highly enough about the experience my wife and I enjoyed at Camp Curvy Birch. We will be returning for the sights... and Deanna's company."
2021-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This place was so amazing! Deanna and Gracyn made us feel like we were on a trip to visit family. They made us feel so welcomed. We have never stayed anywhere more perfect. The nights out by the campfire making s’mores, were the kids favorite time of the whole trip. My daughter (8) loved spending time with Gracyn and the horses. We are already trying to book our trip back. The views of the lake from the cabin are breathtaking! I would highly recommend making this place part of your trip to see the northern lights or just to get away and enjoy Alaska!"
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I had an unforgettable 2-night stay at Deanna’s airbnb. It was exactly as pictured; beautifully designed, immaculate , and cozy. Some activities were available and offered, but just doing nothing and relaxing inside all day was also a great way of enjoying this place. Highly recommended."
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"If you get the chance to stay here- do it!! This was probably the best Airbnb my husband and I have stayed at! Deanna could not have been a more friendly, communicative, and helpful host. She had fires for us every night and gave great recommendations. The cabin was so clean and beautiful. We already want to come back!!! Thanks so much Deanna and Gracyn!"
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is the Airbnb against which all other Airbnb’s shall be judged forever! It is out of this world! If you are looking at this little gem, and it is available, just book it. You can thank me later. It is like a fairy tale! The cabin is stunning, the views are stunning, the northern lights are stunning and you can see them right here if they are out. No need to drive around chasing them, just stay here and look out the windows, or up over the lake. Deanna is amazing and will help you with any part of planning your trip or recommendations, plus she starts you off with homemade chocolate chip banana bread (the way to my heart is with a baked good). She’s not even a superhost, she’s now a friend. Kitchen has everything you need (and great coffee), the bed and couch are comfy, and there’s tv and WiFi, not that you need it. Seriously the best host ever, the best Airbnb ever, and we can’t wait to come back."
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Deanna’s property was exactly as pictured. It was such a wonderful location, and Deanna was extremely welcoming and helpful. We loved every second of our stay there, and would stay again in a heartbeat. I would highly recommend this location for anyone looking to getaway and enjoy a relaxing stay near Fairbanks."
2021-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Amazing. Would stay here every time we’re in Fairbanks. Deanna was phenomenal with local knowledge (and tales!), overly gracious with children, a great banana-bread-maker, and incredibly generous with personal touches. The cabin is gorgeous and perfectly functional with all you need and nothing you don’t. The views are inspiring and the location convenient. Can’t say enough!"
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"No words to describe how wonderful this experience was. Deanna was so incredibly hospitable we not only had an amazing place to stay, we have now made connections we can call friends! The cabin was beyond expectations. We are already planning out trip back in 6 months. This is not a place you want to miss!"
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This cabin on the lake exceeded our expectations. My husband and I fell asleep under the stars and Northern Lights seen through the bedside window 3/4 nights we were there. Everything was neat and clean as this cabin is brand new. Deanna is the best host I have had the pleasure to encounter thus far - communicative & gracious, going above and beyond and providing every little thing you could need. We feel so lucky to have booked our stay in Fairbanks/North Pole at Camp Curvy Birch!"
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"A comfy cabin with all the comforts of home. A king bed with a top notch mattress in a loft upstairs as well as a comfy bed downstairs. You will greeted by 5 horses who will come to expect plenty of carrots.
Deanna is the ultimate host with a campfire and s’mores waiting for her guests as well as fresh-baked bread that makes the cabin smell heavenly. If you can find an open reservation for Deanna’s cabin, you should book it immediately. Because places like this are few and far between."
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This place will exceed anyone's expectations. The hostess Deanna went way out of her way for me and my family. If you don't feel comfortable here I don't know what would please you. Our stay there made such an impact on our Alaskan experience!
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Deanna was incredible and this home was so beautiful!!! It was clean, beautiful, and such cozy vibes. The views are stunning and Deanna is a wonderful and attentive host. The horses are beautiful and great feels being there."
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,🥰 Amazing
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Camp Curvy Birch is a beautiful spot on a quiet little lake! The house is beautiful inside and out. Getting to feed carrots to the horses was an extra bonus. Loved this place and hope to return and see the Northern Lights!
2021-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,This place is STUNNING! Deanna has put so many thoughtful and unique touches to this cabin that make it both stylish as well as comfy/cozy! We cannot wait to be back!
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Amazing experience! Kayaking on the lake was so beautiful! The cabin is very well equipped and the bed is super comfy. Feeding the horses was a surreal experience! I highly reckoned this Airbnb!
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What an amazing place to stay! Agree with all the other raving reviews. It’s a beautiful house with many personal touches. We went in the summer but in the winter the northern lights would be amazing because the house has huge windows. There are kayaks available and Deana made us a fire with s’mores one night. If you’re are in Fairbanks, this is the place to stay!"
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Easily the best place we’ve ever stayed. From location to the host, Deanna, everything was perfect. We are already planning our next trip out here for the winter. Highly recommend Deanna’s place. She is an amazing host."
2021-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Definitely the best Airbnb we’ve ever stayed at! Deanna is an amazing host. The cabin was very clean, with everything (and more) you might need for your stay! Having horses right next to us was a huge bonus! Our girls loved feeding horses with the carrots :)
Deanna made our stay safe, entertaining, and unique. We did kayaking on the lake next to the cabin, and we had an amazing marshmallow night!
Highly recommend, very much loved and appreciated for the hospitality!"
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Our stay at Deanna’s AirBnB was absolutely PERFECT!! You will feel welcomed with open arms, and will become family by the time you leave. Deanna goes above and beyond for her guests and always makes sure that her guest are happy and entertained. The cabin itself is one of the most beautiful AirBnB’s you could ever find. All custom built and STUNNING!! The location is a little slice of heaven! Literally right off the road, but feels miles away and in the middle of nowhere but perfectly close to everything. The cabin is right on its own private lake and she has horses around as well. You can go out anytime and pet the horses, or go sit around the campfire and enjoy a relaxing evening by the fire. Simply perfection. My husband and I will definitely be coming back to stay again! 💙"
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This Airbnb is probably the most gorgeous one we have ever stayed in. IT IS BRAND NEW AND BEAUTIFULLY DECORATED. It is spectacular in it’s decor, cleanliness, location and its host. Everything is high-end. Do not miss a chance to stay in this beautiful property on its own private lake, with seven horses and numerous dogs. The host is pleasant, helpful and attentive."
2021-07-01,5,Stayed about a week,"This cabin was just what we needed, and it exceeded our expectations. Great location, scenery, wonderful hosts, friendly…definitely recommend!"
2021-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,Absolutely perfect place to stay in North Pole! Deeana has thought of everything. This is such a cozy cabin with an amazing view. We really appreciated getting to feed the horses. Deeana was incredibly hospitable and helpful.
2021-06-01,3,Stayed a few nights,"The house is as describe, furniture was very comfortable and the cabin was well stocked.
The property does back up to a busy road so you will hear road noise day and night. There is not curtains on 2 of the windows. Sleeping in the daylight with all of the road noise was challenging. There isn’t a curtain on the window on the front door so when they are feeding or working with the horses they are steps away from the door and can see right into the cabin.
This was a work trip for me and unfortunately there was no cell reception for ATT (or any other major carriers.) The listing states the cabin has wif but unfortunately the connection was not adequate and upload speeds weren’t fast enough to attach encrypted files. Due to the lack of connectivity I had to relocate after one night. The host was unwilling to offer any discount or reimbursement despite knowing it was a work trip and not disclosing the connectivity issues."
2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We can't say enough about how perfect this stay was. The location, privacy, horses, beautiful lake/pond, and comfortable, tasteful and well equipped house. We couldn't have asked for anything more and will be returning whenever we visit family."
2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The property is as beautiful as it looks like in the pictures. The lake is a perfect place to relax and enjoy the fire. The horses on the property are very friendly and playful. The cabin has a lot of thoughtful touches, which give it a very cozy and comfortable vibe. The windows open to one of the best views of the lake.
Deanna is a wonderful host. She helped us with nice local recommendations. She was very quick to respond and we were greeted with a warm banana bread, that made our stays even better. Would surely recommend staying here."
2021-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The Curvy Birch was extraordinary. Our cabin, The Raven, was cozy and welcoming and spotless. More than that, it had a natural vibe (thanks to Deanna's top-shelf taste) with touches of birch, stone, and metal which literally brought the beauty of Alaska inside, rather than just out our window. Cupboards were stocked with yummy desserts and snacks and the fridge with coffee creamers and a veggie drawer full of carrots to spoil the horses. The property was picturesque and sprawling surrounded by pines and birches with a full view of a snow covered lake.
The setting aside, the best advantage of the rental is the host, Deanna. She had an innate ability to swoop in with a local suggestion and a much needed ride in the heavy snow and then duck out to give us our privacy. It's rare to find someone with such warmth and commitment. She tirelessly dug out her fire pit and a path to the lake, hauled firewood and built us a blazing fire so we could better enjoy the Northern Lights. We so enjoyed her company that we invited her to join us. On the flight home, we agreed that our vacation would have been less if we had stayed anywhere else. We felt so lucky to have stumbled upon this hidden gem and recommend it wholeheartedly."
2021-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I’ve never been so happy to write a review for any place. If you’re questioning this place at all, don’t! From the moment you walk in to the moment you walk out, it’s pure bliss. The location is beautiful, the cabin is so gorgeous, cozy, and properly stocked that you’ll feel dragged out to leave and excited to come back from any and all excursions that you visit.
The cabin is completely modernized without losing that cozy, farmhouse vibe. Deanna makes sure you walk in and instantly feel at home. The fireplace on the screen, the lovely scent that makes you feel like it’s Christmas, and the homemade banana bread and champagne were the cherry on top! (Best banana bread recipe EVER, btw!) The kitchen is fully stocked with anything you need for cooking/baking, the bathrooms have more than enough towels and the shampoo/conditioner/body wash smell amazing! The couch and the bed up on the loft are SO COMFORTABLE, we had a great night’s sleep all throughout the trip. And let’s not forget the horses that we’re allowed to feed and provided carrots for in the fridge to do so. It made us feel more than welcome that Deanna allows her guests to provide such a service to her lovely furry animals!
Aside from the cabin experience, Deanna is truly the most phenomenal host. She provides you with recommendations on excursions and places to eat. But, she truly went above and beyond when we discovered we may not get into town on time as planned. Our flight was delayed about 4 hours, which made us miss our connecting flight, and we almost weren’t able to find a connecting flight into Fairbanks that same day. This would also mean we would miss our helicopter/snowmobile tour at Borealis Basecamp we had planned the next day. Deanna has connections everywhere! She offered to call the airlines for us to try and find us a flight that same day, and also offered to call the basecamp and try to reschedule our tour if need be (thankfully it all worked out for us). It was absolutely lovely to meet Deanna and have her share her stories about the history and future plans of the whole place.
All in all, best location with the best host we’ve ever experienced. We will be back! Thank you, Deanna!!"
2021-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I can’t say enough about this place and the host. Deanna truly went above a beyond with thoughtful touches and helpful hints. Snow shoeing across the frozen lake was especially fun.
2021-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,The greatest AirBnb stay we have ever had! If you are coming to Alaska plan at least a couple nights to stay with Deanna. I’d go to North Pole just to stay at her place. She is an amazing person and incredibly generous. She did everything she could to make our stay as enjoyable as possible. I can’t recommend her place enough.
2021-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had an AMAZING vacation!!! Deanna & her daughter Gracyn were ABSOLUTELY WONDERFUL!!! If I know anyone going to Fairbanks, I will for sure tell them to stay at Camp Curvy Birch!! And when we go back we will stay in no other place than Camp Curvy Birch!!! Thank you for the FANTASTIC vacation & for answering all our questions in record speed!!! You guys are AMAZING hosts!!! THANK YOU!!!"
2021-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful property and cabin! Our group had a wonderful stay here! Deanna is a phenomenal host! She is very knowledgeable about the area and has great recommendations! The cabin is very cozy and was perfect for our group of 4. We loved being able to feed the horses as well! Would definitely recommend!
2021-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The thoughtful touches on literally every thing we’re more than going the extra mile.
The place is done up in such a thoughtful and experience inducing manner. It’s such a rare find for an exceptional value.
The kitchen was well stocked with all amenities and then some more.
The loft style bed was a beautiful touch to the bedroom.
The freshly baked banana bread and a lovely bouquet of roses was a very heartfelt welcome to this magical place.
We thank Deanna for making our stay so memorable.
I would highly recommend staying here and only here in this area. If the this place is booked adjust your travel dates to match this place’s vacancy."
2021-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Deanna was absolutely amazing! Camp Curvy Birch is like living a scene from something you would see on t.v. Deana was an amazing host who really went above and beyond to make sure our experience was great! Deanna is very familiar with the area, she answered all of our questions and made great recommendations. During our stay we enjoyed captivating skies over the quiet lake. Our visit to Camp Curvy Birch provided an authentic Alaskan experience with all of of the comforts of home. From the electric blinds to the cozy loft, the cabin was amazing. We couldn't imagine a better place to stay, or a better host for the experience. Thank you Deanna!!"
2021-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This has been my favorite airbnb stay! Deanna got everything right from the warm welcome, to the comfy and clean space, to going above and beyond to make our stay with a 9 month old the best it could be. She is so friendly and genuinely wants your stay to be the best it could have been. We are hoping to come back!"
2021-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This might be long but worth the read. Deanna is honestly the sweetest person Ryan and I have ever met. Before coming to Alaska - I was very nervous of the covid restrictions and things we needed to complete in order to book our flight. Deanna called me the day before we left for our trip and talked on the phone with me for 30 minutes to ensure we would be okay. She gave me tips, recommendations and shared her life story with me. We arrived at our air bnb and the pictures do not do it justice with HOW PERFECT this place is. We would have paid the triple the price just with how beautiful and magical this place really is. Deanna was nothing but a perfect host. We texted throughout our whole stay - checking in with what was best to do & see and she really goes ABOVE AND BEYOND to make sure you have a perfect time. Without her and her cabin our trip to fairbanks would have been nothing but a general vacation. She’s like family at this point and we cannot wait to come back. She even celebrated our engagement with us right after it happened! You’re amazing Deanna. Can’t wait for my whole family to come and meet you."
2021-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Deanna went above and beyond for us during our stay. We were welcomed warmly but also given complete privacy. She even graciously let us checkout late after our flight unexpectedly got delayed. It was lovely waking up to a beautiful view and enjoying all the cozy amenities including giant fluffy towels and local coffee. I’m certain this is the best place to stay in the area!
2020-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Deanna’s place is so awesome and we had such a wonderful experience. I would love to come back in summer time and stay here again!
2020-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What a dream it was to stay here. The kitchen has everything you need, the cabin is very comfortable and the surroundings are gorgeous. We snowshoed on the frozen lake and the trails beyond. We saw the aurora from our bed. Deanna is an amazing host and we checked in with warm freshly baked banana bread.
Highly recommend this place."
2020-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Deanna was amazing from the moment I booked this Airbnb. She answered all of my questions about the area. (A lot of questions) She had great recommendations for tours and restaurants. She was very thoughtful and surprised us with delicious bake goods and red roses. 😊 we enjoyed our stay with her and her sweet daughter. I highly recommend her Airbnb.
2020-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I highly recommend Deanna’s place! My husband and I give it 5 stars across the board! She made our weekend special and was such a delight to work with and meet!
2020-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place is awesome, brand new , thoughtful decoration , super clean, variety of amenities (great choices of coffee) , close to main road, .... the host, Deanna is great. She responded very fast if we had any questions. On the last day, she offered us to stay as long as we want. We are extremely happy that we stayed there."
2020-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Staying at Camp Curvy Birch was amazing! From opening the door and smelling home-made chocolate chip banana bread and amazing scentsys around the cabin, Deanna thought of every homie touch possible. She provided us carrots to feed the horses; suggested places to eat and where to see the northern lights; and offered to build us a fire to have a campfire on the beach. She was an amazing host and so kind to talk to. We look forward to staying there again someday!"
2020-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This place is a gem. Nothing less than perfection in every touch. They were extremely accommodating and flexible when plans had to change. Seriously the best experience I've had on Airbnb
2020-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Amazing cabin! She put so much thought into everything - has anything you could need. Views are amazing. Very cozy, very relaxing!"
2020-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a fantastic stay at Deanna's cabin! It's a beautiful space with all of the creature comforts you need to have a cozy experience. The property is gorgeous and Deanna is an exceptional host who goes above and beyond to make you feel comfortable. One of the best Airbnbs I've ever come across. Look no further, this is the place to stay while adventuring in Alaska!"
2020-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,"If you want a real cabin in the middle of the forest, this is the site, a super beautiful place with a super beautiful cabin, with a super host Deana."
2020-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We highly recommend this place for anyone looking for a place near Fairbanks!
First of all the home is really charming and comfy. We didn’t have much luck with the weather (really cloudy), but enjoyed our stay our stay regardless. There were plenty of amenities and a fully stocked kitchen.
Second, the location is really convenient. It is only a short drive to town or to the Chena hot springs.
Finally, Deanna is such a great host. Her family and the horses are very welcoming. When we have plans to chase the aurora lights again we’ll be sure to check if Deanna this place is available first!"
2020-10-01,5,Stayed about a week,"First off wow! There are no words to describe our honeymoon at Camp Curvy Birch! Deanna and Gracyn seriously became like family during our stay! The thoughtful touches were never ending!
When we arrived they had roses and champagne waiting for us as well as an amazing fire and s’mores! We sat out under the stars by the lake (and fire) many nights and took in the stars and each other’s company! We thought we would miss the lights on this trip but the Aurora put on a show on our last night. During our stay we enjoyed Deanna’s family Moose Stew recipe (so delicious), a chocolate cherry cake she made for my 30th birthday (as a surprise complete with a candle), and amazing chocolate chip banana bread!
Not only were we made yummy food but Deanna’s restaurant recommendations were all 10/10! We probably gained 10 lbs while there and no I haven’t stepped on a scale 😂
The thought put into this place is amazing and I cannot wait to see all of Deanna and Gracyn’s dreams for the property come true! The hospitality is like no other! I cannot recommend staying here enough, we cannot wait to come back! ❤️"
2020-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Our family loved staying at this stylish, modern cabin with absolutely everything you might need! The s'mores & popcorn were a huge hit with the kids! Oh and the horses! By far our most favorite airbnb & we have stayed at so many. Deanna the hostess is amazing!"
2020-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"If I could give this cabin more than five stars, I would.
To start, Deanna is fantastic host. My wife and I traveled to Fairbanks for our honeymoon, so as a welcome gift she left us a bouquet of roses and a bottle of champagne. She also gave us wonderful suggestions for food and activities to make our stay extra special. She had a fire going every night and as a parting gift, she even baked us a loaf of chocolate chip banana bread!
The cabin itself was beautiful. It's obvious that Deanna put a lot of thought into both the interior and exterior design. We loved it and can't wait to stay there again!"
2020-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Camp Curvy Birch was amazing. The host made sure we had a fire every night, the cabin was clean, and the property was beautiful. S
There were two horses on the property and carrots in the cabin we could feed them! Deanna gave great recommendations on things to do, and we were lucky enough to see the northern lights our last night! We are excited to make this a yearly trip!"
2020-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The property is close enough to town to not be a pain to get to, but far enough out that you have no light pollution for star gazing or watching for the aurora. The cabin itself is spectacular with amazing detailed finishes, not to mention sparkling clean. There is a fire pit and she even had the makings of smores for us! She also had kayaks for use by the guests on the lake. This is not your average airBnB. While it had all of the standard amenities. There were so many extras that made it spectacular. She had bottled water, coffee, filters, creamers, spices, condiments, as well as tin foil, plastic wrap and ziplocks ready to go for your use. She also has horses on the property (and left carrots in the fridge for us to give them treats). I loved it, but I would recommend caution for those with severe horse allergies as they are close to the cabin. Deanna herself is personable and a fantastic hostess, always looking for a way to make your stay better! I would happily recommend this place to anyone. I would give it more than 5 stars if I could."
2020-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,Beautiful location. Great stay. Very welcoming host. Would like to go again
2020-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"5/5 stars is not nearly good enough to truly represent this listing! Deanna & Gracyn are tremendous hostesses! From the moment I booked this cabin Deanna was very responsive and offered to help us plan any activities we wanted to do while in town. Once we arrived at the cabin check in was very easy (there was a code on the door) and we were able to get settled in the cabin without issue. The cabin itself is absolutely gorgeous and looks exactly as it is pictured in this listing. The craftsmanship that went into designing and furnishing this cabin is truly second to none! There are so many thoughtful touches implemented into the cabin as well, washer/dryer, large TV, many interesting reading materials, snacks, etc. We were more at home in this cabin than we are in our own home. We were able to see 2 nights worth of amazing Northern Lights shows that were definitely a highlight of our trip! Deanna also baked us some homemade chocolate banana bread that was to die for, the perfect breakfast as we headed out to a full day of exploring. We spent countless hours sitting by the lakeside fire getting to know Deanna & Gracyn and cannot believe what amazing ladies they are! Deanna is incredibly knowledgeable about the local area so if you have any free time you are looking to fill, Deanna won't lead you astray on activities or food suggestions! Staying in the Raven cabin at Camp Curvy Birch is guranteed to be an experience you won't soon forget! We arrived as strangers and departed as friends and are so thankful for that!"
2020-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great place , and more than happy to stay again if future trips. Amazing hospitality!"
2020-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"if you are in fairbanks you have to stay here!

2020-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,An amazing stay! Deanna is amazingly thoughtful! My wife and I have stayed at many airbnbs around the world. This is by far our best experience to date!!
2020-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Deanna is an AMAZING host! From the beginning, she was incredibly communicative and responsive. Upon arrival, she and her daughter greeted us and helped us get settled in, and the next day she came by in the morning with fresh, warm banana bread! After a day of exploring, Deanna also set up a lovely sunset fire by the beach, and we had a wonderful time listening to her stories. Her Airbnb is spacious and beautifully built. Everything was sparkling clean, and the decor was cozy and comfortable. The best part is the refrigerator filled with carrots for the resident horses. :) I wanted to move right in permanently! You won't regret staying here - I highly recommend it and I can't wait until my next trip to Fairbanks so I can stay there again. Thank you Deanna!!"
2020-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"If you are going to Fairbanks, North Pole or any other city near by, you need to stay at this place. The host, Deanna, is caring and makes sure your stay is outstanding. The Cabin in general is beyond anything you can imagine. Beautiful and perfectly designed. I would stay here again and again. My wife and I loved the location and everything about this cabin."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Jeremiah's place was very comfortable and perfect for the stay. The bed was comfortable, the place was clean and tidy. Jeremiah was quick to respond when booking.

2020-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place was the perfect little getaway for us. It was close to the Santa Claus House and other North Pole adventures. Also, a very convenient location to access Fairbanks and Chena HotSprings. This cozy place was very clean and very affordable. The host was very responsive and provided complimentary snacks for guests. Would highly recommend this place to others."

2020-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Fantastic place thank you very much.
2020-02-01,5,Stayed one night,We really enjoyed our time here. It is the perfect size for a couple. It is completely separate to the house and we really appreciated the easy check-in process as we arrived at 3 am. It is perfect if you are planning to stay around the Fairbanks region. If we are back in the Fairbanks region we will most definitely be staying with Jeremiah if we can!
2020-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Jeremiah’s place was so lovely. It was a convenient location but beautiful and secluded enough. They had really nice little touches like hot cocoa packets as well and quick response times. We would definitely come again!

Great location to Fairbanks 11 miles. Great visitor center there to let you know what all there is to do in surrounding area. 1hr 15 min to Chena hot springs. Town of Fox to see Alaska pipeline. Jeremiah is definitely a superhost. Very fast,and efficient to needs and questions. Goes above and beyond. We feel very lucky to have got to stay here."

2019-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Jeremiah‘s little apartment had everything we needed and we enjoyed our stay a lot! We were very grateful for the little heater as it was quite freezing for July. It was very quiet and we didn‘t hear any noise from the rest of the house and also the bed was nice and comfy which made us sleep very well. We can highly recommend.
2019-07-01,5,Stayed one night,Dont think twice to book this place
2019-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,You won’t find a better deal in the Fairbanks/North Pole area. Clean and comfortable. Check in/check out was as simple as possible. More than we could have asked for!

2024-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Would recommend to anyone looking to be near Fairbanks but also feel like they're in the middle of nowhere. The cabin is cozy, super clean and David has thought of it all. We slept so well and enjoyed long summer nights listening to the birds on the porch. The hot tub IS all it's hyped up to be."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,Awesome spot. Great host.
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,The ability to bring my pups with out additional fees was lovely
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,Magical. Exactly what was described. We joked it was a ‘human free’ zone. I truly felt alone in the middle of Alaska. The hot tub was perfect to enjoy the midnight sun. David was kind and quick to reply. We’ll be back.
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,David's place was so relaxing. It was really great to take a few days to ourselves with the pups of course to just be together and enjoy each other's company. We can't wait to come back again.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Want can I say other than this will be the only bnb that I will stay at in the future when in the Fairbanks area. Our host made sure we had all of the water and wood that we needed for the cabin and the amazing Wood fired hot tub. The views are priceless, abundant wildlife, a place where you can become one with nature during the day, and run into town for a steak dinner. 5+ stars!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"David’s place was the perfect getaway for my girlfriend and I. We had a nice, peaceful few days to ourselves. The place was quiet and calm, just what we needed to get out of the city. The hottub was an added bonus! 10/10 highly recommend ☺️"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"Cabin is extremely cozy and sat on a rather beautiful property. David's description was pretty spot on, and his directions helped us find the cabin without a hitch. Don't let the no electricity/ running water sway your decision, everything was seamless and taken care of. Plenty of lanterns/ battery powered lights, heating works extremely well, and the hot tub was perfect. If you are looking for a remote place to stay I would recommend this spot. Price is very good as well."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place is amazing! So glad we booked it. This private off the grid cabin is perfect for a relaxing stay in Alaska. Seeing the northern lights from the cabin/hot tub was magical. Even though it was a dry cabin, the host made it extremely comfortable. David the host was by far one of the best hosts I’ve had with Airbnb. He was so attentive, got everything we needed, and offered great knowledge about the area. We absolutely loved hiking the beautiful property. David was so nice. Truly excellent stay and I would recommend to anyone!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had an exceptional stay here! The cabin was idyllic for our little anniversary getaway, especially with the amazing hot tub and beautiful scenery. David went above and beyond to provide an excellent stay, along with a snowshoe tour and a night under the auroras to remember forever!
Thank you so much David! We hope to stay here again ❤️"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I'm not even sure where to start. We booked a week back in November on a whim after checking out some northern lights photos and decided to go for it. We had an amazing week. The cabin is truly a gem. The views, the solitude. we happened to get lucky with the weather as it was sunny almost every day. We saw the northern lights from the hot tub 3 nights of the 6.. David was a super kind and helpful host. He even offered us rides as our rental was somehow canceled last minute. Luckily Uber was an option and even with several trips to town and back saved us quite a bit compared to the rental. The hot tub is amazing, I wasn't sure what to expect as I've never used that type before but it exceeded my expectations. Overall it was an amazing week, just what we needed and I can't wait to go back!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,What an amazing trip!!! Can’t thank David enough for the amazing help and courtesy! The place was fantastic! Loves how rustic and secluded it was! Thank you for everything! Totally recommend David’s place for an off-the-grid-adventure!
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Our host David was absolutely wonderful. He was very good at communicating. The place was beautiful. We want to come back to experience that again. The hike we went on was so much fun with the snow shoes. We had an amazing stay.
2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"Book it, beautiful secluded gem. The place was toasty all night!!! Originally I was nervous to use the bathroom outside but it was not bad at all! David was very responsive. Even prior to the trip he reached out to be a few times. He is an amazing host who truly cares about your stay. I’d highly recommend"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was by far the best experience my husband & I have ever had ! This cabin is a one of a kind gem !! The location is beautiful, cabin is supplied with everything you need, the wooden stove kept us cozy, the hot tub was so unique / relaxing !! David was one of the best hosts we have ever had; he supplied wood for us & cleaned/ prepped the hot tub for us daily ! He was so welcoming & friendly; my husband had a chance to chat with him as he was cleaning the hot tub & he was such a kind person ! We are very grateful to have had the opportunity for this adventure !"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Perfect place to start our honeymoon!
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"David is great, and the cabin is great. Enjoy the snowshoe walk with David, he told me a lot about forest and wild life. Really worth to stay here. Winter is great, but also will visit in summer, to see a different view."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,David was such an amazing host! This was the best Airbnb experience we’ve had and a large part of that was because of how kind and attentive David was. The cabin was beautiful and the hot tub was such a nice bonus!!
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We stayed the last week of Feb. 2024, and the temps dropped into the -20⁰s. Is it fun to use an outhouse at those temps? No. Is it not as bad as you imagine and is totally worth it for the experience of a lifetime? 100%! The cabin is an easy 15 min drive from Fairbank, but the property makes you feel the beauty and remoteness of alaska. David was a great host and does the hard work while respecting your privacy. The cabin is well stocked and very warm. We were lucky enough to see the aoura every night and enjoy it from the hottub. Snowshoes and poles were provided, and there is a nice trail that follows a grove of burch trees and then up into black spruce, which took us about 45 mins. An off grid vacation isn't for everyone, but if there is any little feeling that you could handle it, do it! It is the perfect place to unplug, relax, and appreciate natural beauty. Even at -20⁰, it was not as bad as we imagined, and we had one of the most beautiful trips of our lives."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The cabin was absolutely amazing. It offered us the peace and relaxation we needed, while still being within a very comfortable driving distance to town. David was the best AirBNB host we have ever encountered! He was fast to reply to our questions and concerns, gave us a snow-shoe tour around his beautiful property, and even helped us figure out how to efficiently operate our 4x4 rental truck (after towing us up the hill!). The 4 nights we spent here were great, and I wish we could have stayed longer."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed one night,David was a gracious host and the cabin and hot tub were perfect! Next time we'll stay longer. : )
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Cabin was great as was David. He provided several great recommendations for local activities.
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Absolutely amazing experience! David couldn’t have been a better host - so, so helpful. His place was truly the best adventure and we were so comfortable! The very best."
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The coziest, most wonderful weekend getaway spending two nights at this cabin. We spent many hours in the hot tub, saw the northern lights from the front window, and overall had a great, relaxing time. David was a fantastic host, very friendly and responsive, and took us for a short snowshoe. Would absolutely stay here again in the future, highly recommend for people looking to have some cozy alone/private time in a beautiful area."
2024-01-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"An absolute dream of a place. We were so lucky to spend our first two nights in Alaska SO cozy in this gorgeous off-grid cabin, complete with daily soaks in the wood-fired hot pot. The long winding driveway makes it feel so far from anyone, though David lives nearby to help with anything you may need and is so kind and accommodating. We were impressed with how well the cabin holds heat and also slept really well on the super comfortable mattress. Can’t imagine a better basecamp to enjoy the Fairbanks region."
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great place to stay and relax! I will definitely be booking this spot again, this place books up fast so if you think you want to stay here just book it. It is completely worth it!!"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I had a wonderful stay at this cabin! Everything was exactly as listed and just as peaceful as expected. David was a very helpful and pleasant host, I couldn't have asked for better. Even with the cold weather, there was no issue staying warm with the heaters. The highlight of the stay for me was the hot tub. So relaxing and such good views of the beautiful night sky. I will definitely be recommending this place!!"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had an amazing stay in the cabin and we definitely recommend it! We stayed during the last days of December, and while it was really cold outside, we stayed warm and comfortable in the cabin. The hot tube makes a great way to observe the aurora lights and be in that moment (as the lights come and go quickly, it’s great to have a warm way to stay outside). The outhouse was not a challenge at all, it was very clean and you get quickly used to it.
The cabin itself is magic, time goes by slower in there and you can really disconnect and relax. On top of that, David is the best host ever! He gave us all the needed tips, he is very responsive and helpful. He provides a walk in the property that helps you better understand and connect with Alaska. And he actually gave us a ride into town with a few more sightseeings as we couldn’t get a taxi on Jan 1st to leave the cabin.
The whole experience was one the best experiences we ever had in our lives!
We really recommend it!"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"If you want to do a modern glamping like experience with the coziness of a cabin, you definitely should stay here. This place is about 12 mins from the main city and yet feel so secluded in the wild. Thats the beauty of it. The hot tub is really relaxing and David is a great host. He met us and gave us a tour of the property which was so unique as an experience."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This was a great space to get away from the hot tub is probably one of the coolest features here, along with how quiet the whole property is. David was a great host and communicated with us quickly."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The place was magical. Had a great time spending our honeymoon.
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place exceeded all expectations! Don't be deterred by its off-grid and dry setting; it's truly a hidden gem. Your experience here is bound to be exceptional. Even in winter, the wood stove efficiently warms the cabin, and its excellent heat retention ensures you stay cozy. We were fortunate to witness the mesmerizing Aurora during our two nights there. I highly recommend visiting. Kudos to David for excellent communication and ensuring our every need was met."
2023-11-01,4,Stayed one night,"David’s Airbnb was away from the city and so, so peaceful. You can tell he put a lot of work into it from the hot tub, outhouse, and items provided in the Airbnb. He was responsive and helped us navigate how to see the Northern Lights (though we didn’t catch them due to the cloud cover). The propane heater that heats the cabin works VERY well, so you don’t have to worry at all about getting chilly due to not having electricity. It’s a very nice way to disconnect. The only thing we would’ve changed is the bed. It’s an older spring mattress laid directly on the loft floor and is pretty uncomfortable compared to most. If this were updated, we would definitely come here again. But both my partner and I agreed we didn’t get great sleep due to feeling the springs as we turned throughout the night. If the bedding doesn’t bother you too much, this is an absolute gem of a place to stay to get out of the city and see the Northern Lights from the hot tub!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed one night,Incredible place to stay… Wish we stayed for couple more days
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,If you get the chance to book this cabin you are in for a treat. It’s exactly what we expected and more. Don’t let the dry cabin scare you. David had everything we needed ready for us and the out house is so clean. This really was exactly what we needed. The hot tub was the absolute best park and walking the property with David.
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,10/10 great place and great host! Will definitely be booking again in the future.
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Trust me if you’re worried about being cold YOU WILL NOT BE. It’s so adorable and I loved the hot tub! The heating system inside is perfect and it’s such a comfy place. Highly recommend taking a tour with David and his adorable puppies
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"David’s cabin was just what we needed - to be immersed in nature, and slow down. We read, wrote, drew, cooked, and relaxed to our hearts’ content in the hot tub. David was very attentive and even led us on a hike, accompanied by his dogs! We can’t wait to go back! Thank you, David!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great place, rented for a staycation for my boyfriends birthday weekend. Loved the hot tub, it was perfect in the 20 degree weather. Clear communication by host. On a large property and feels very secluded despite being minutes from town."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We visited David’s cabin for our honeymoon and can honestly say we didn’t want to leave. We were there for 5 nights but could’ve easily stayed a couple more. Don’t let the fact that it’s a dry cabin scare you away! If you are capable of operating a propane heater/wood burning stove you will feel right at home. The surrounding property is beautiful and private.
David showed us around his property and was very kind and communicative the entire trip. He gave us great recommendations, kept us stocked with supplies, and even left us a complimentary bottle of champagne! 10/10 my best Airbnb experience yet. If you want to experience the REAL Alaska, David’s place is the only way to go."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Amazing little cabin in the woods outside of Fairbanks. David is a great host, responded quickly and provided what we needed. Very friendly -- and chill host too, which adds a layer of calm homeliness. The hot tub and the word burning stove make everything so comfortable toasty and peaceful. Don't miss this place."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"We are thrilled and so in love with David’s cabin, what a great stay experience, first time in Alaska, and we could not be more than grateful to found his place, super clean, warm, and wonderful in any way possible, the hot tub is out of this world, with a great view and peacefulness enjoying the nature, we felt blessed to had the opportunity to stay in a place like this, so lovely and with all the supplies that you need for a dry-cabin, the bathroom outside is extremely clean and David is a great host, he was super responsive and gave us recommendations for our stay!
We hope to be back in Alaska and stay again! Thank you for everything!!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This cabin is a MUST if you’re looking to get away from all the distractions to just enjoy nature and recharge.
The hot tub is glorious, the views are incredible, and the cabin is cozy.
Would definitely stay here again!"

2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,What an awesome spot!! David is a top notch host with top notch accommodations at the cabin. The hot tub is so nice after a long day of exploring. Great spot to watch for northern lights and relax in nature but still have a very comfortable space to cook and sleep.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Absolutely relaxing!!! The hot tub was amazing. We stayed in even though it was raining. The ambience was spectacular!! Highly recommend David’s Place.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"Absolutely gorgeous and very quiet and peaceful.
The hot tub was awesome.
David had the water all warmed up and the cabin was nice and cozy warm when we checked in.
This was by far the highlight of our trip."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"Place was amazing, perfect for a romantic getaway.
David was also very informative!!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"David’s place is amazing!! It’s less than 20mins north of town, but you really get that interior Alaska wilderness feel. Very peaceful, private, and quiet, with beautiful views. The kitchen is well-stocked and you hardly notice there’s no electricity or running water - even the outhouse is very clean and comfortable. And the hot tub is a HUGE plus! David is very kind and a proactive communicator, and his walking tour around the property is a must!! Absolutely would stay again!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,David was a great host! he took us on a lovely tour of his property and we learned a lot about the area and plants. The cabin was adorable and cozy. it was the perfect get away.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"We BEYOND loved this cabin!! It was so incredibly special…we had everything we needed, it was quiet and private, the scenery was magical, the hot tub was exquisite, and walking in the door to a beautiful fire in the wood stove left by David was the cherry on top!!! This space simply CANNOT BE RECOMMEND HIGHLY ENOUGH!! Thank you for a perfect stay!!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We loved our stay at the cabin!! The space was clean and cozy, and the cabin had everything we needed. The cedar hot tub outside was easy to operate and such a cool way to be outside in the woods. David was super easy to communicate with. Highly recommend! We want to come back in the winter!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,Such a wonderful stay! Definitely will be back

2023-07-01,4,Stayed one night,I really liked staying at the cabin! It was very peaceful and quiet. Super cute.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"I'd like to start by saying how much work this place is to keep up with. A dry cabin in the woods takes a lot of work to prepare, especially the way that David does. He has made such a comfortable space in a pristine location with great amenities. We loved the hot tub and the fact that he warms it beforehand and refills it is amazing! David was great! Super flexible and helpful when I made a booking mistake. Looking forward to a winter visit!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This cabin was so incredibly peaceful and calming, it was just what we needed. Plan to get away from the noise of life and truly enjoy the simple living in Alaska. It was very cozy, and had a beautiful hot tub and porch. David is an extremely accommodating and friendly host."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This by far is my favorite air bnb. Beautiful scenery, amazing cedar hot tub, very clean, private. My fiancé and I had an amazing time. David was great, he was extremely helpful and responsive. He gave us clear instructions and was always willing to stop by and help with whatever we need. We can’t wait to come back. Thanks David! 😊"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Amazing cabin had a great expierence!
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Cozy little cabin conveniently located within driving distance to the town. The cabin offered a nice view of the mountains with a remote forest feeling. The host maintained the hot tub daily. Would definitely stay here again!
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"This was our 1st stay at an off-grid dry cabin and it was absolutely fabulous! Very honestly, this was the highlight of our time in Fairbanks, Alaska!
David was very thorough, patient, and responsive!
The cabin is beautiful and surrounded by lush green trees. It was very functional and David ensured every little thing 1 would need for the stay is available eg. drinking water, plates, spoons, cooking pots/pans, kettle, spices, lighter, firewood, books, towels, lamps, candles, and headlamps. The outdoor tub was comfortable though a little extra hot when we got in and took sometime to cool down but so unique at the same time. We cooked dinner and breakfast while enjoying the cabin and truly felt disconnected in a good way!
I was most anxious about the bathroom situation but it was not an issue! It was very clean with toilet paper, hay to cover up, sanitizer, comfy cushioned seat, and room spray.
Overall, it was a very nice experience for us and would have regretted not staying here"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"David is an absolutely amazing host. He was attentive, kind, easy to communicate with, and enthusiastic about sharing his love for Alaska. The cabin is a truly special place that exceeded our expectations in every way. Pride of ownership, hard work, and attention to detail are evident here. We remain thankful that we had the opportunity to stay and relax on this quite and peaceful property. We are already looking forward to coming back to experience aurora borealis and to use the wood fired hot tub again during the colder months. Thanks for sharing your cabin with us. Until next time :D"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,Wonderful location and the cabin was exactly as described. Would highly recommend for those that would like an alternative to a traditional experience.
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,The views were amazing! We loved chilling in the hot tub listening to nature around us. David was a great host. Wish we could have stayed longer.
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,Loved this space and the hot tub! David was awesome to communicate with and made things so easy! Would recommend!
2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"Amazing stay. Hot tub gets hot, wood stove is going before we arrive. Totally will visit again."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Just as all the other reviews suggest, David's cabin is a gem!! Close enough to the conveniences of downtown Fairbanks, yet secluded enough to make you feel like you were hours away from civilization. David was ultra responsive and helpful with any and all questions we had about the cabin and Fairbanks in general. Make sure you take him up on the snow shoe tour offer, it was one of the highlights of our stay and his knowledge and love for Alaska and his property is undeniable! The cabin itself is well appointed and extremely cozy. The provided lanterns and headlamps were more than enough light and the wood burning stove kept us nice and warm through several snowy nights. We would not hesitate to stay there if in Fairbanks again!!"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Had the PERFECT time at David's incredible cabin. Saw 2 moose night one in the front yard, and had 2 nights of the stunning aurora. David was highly communicative and incredibly kind. He gave me loads of local tips and took me on a fun and informative snowshoeing hike on his property with his puppers. The cabin is located at the end of a quiet road. It's private, cozy and quiet. So peaceful. I really hope to return soon. Thank you David!"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great cabin! Wood stove works excellent, bed was super comfy and the cabin was very comfortable!"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed one night,David’s place was amazing and would highly recommend to anyone looking for a remote stay in the Fairbanks area.
2023-03-01,5,Stayed one night,David's place was beautiful and serene. The check-in process was seamless. The cabin was very well-kept. We were able to enjoy the Aurora from the hot tub.
2023-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"I live in Alaska and have seen the Northern Lights quite a few times, but viewing them from a secluded wood-fired hot tub was nothing short of magical. The cabin was comfortable and David had a fire in the stove when we arrived. I’m planning on making a stay at this wonderful place a yearly event!"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed one night,Had a great time. It was wonderful to be in the hot tub with such a peaceful serenity around you.
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had an amazing time staying at David's cabin. Frankly, I was a bit concerned about the dry bathroom, but it turns out to be pristine clean and easy to use!!!! The hot tub is amazing too. We had a fun snowshoe hike with David and his super sweet dogs. I am so glad we chose to stay here for 2 nights! It's such a beautiful and peaceful cabin. We appreciate how much work David put into building this meditative experience."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,An absolute must stay if you truly want the Alaskan experience! David provided very detailed instructions for anything and everything you would need to know. We would definitely stay here again
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Amazing experience. Absolutely recommend this place. David is super attentive and responds very fast. The forest surrounding the cabin is stunning. A winter wonderland. Very private and secluded. The cabin is cozy. Heating works perfectly. Tub is great. It’s an ideal place for reading, writing and resting. Loved the experience."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Absolutely worth it to stay here! David was very prompt with anything you ask, the Hot Tub is amazing!! He gave us a free Snowshoe tour which was adventurous and he’s very knowledgeable about the area and trees along the hike. You’ll never have a dull moment with him touring around he always has LOTS to tell. Will definitely visit the cabin again in summer.
Highly recommend this listing!!"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,David was super accommodating. He even helped us get our car out of a 4 foot snowbank when we managed to get stuck. The hot tub was phenomenal and a great end to day. very peaceful and quiet and gorgeous especially in the winter. I highly recommend it. It was wonderful.
2023-02-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"The cabin is very beautiful and well built. The location is very quiet, a bit out of town and beautiful. The wood fired hot tub made the stay for sure! A little dark inside at night as there is no electricity and only a few battery powdered lights. I’d suggest bringing a good flashlight or extra lanterns."
2023-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"Don’t hesitate and book this cabin! It’s the true Alaskan experience. Beautiful surroundings, clean and cozy cabin and amazing hot tub. You can’t beat it. Also, the host David was responsive and helpful."
2023-02-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This place during the winter is a must! Not only it is beautiful, the quiet and private environment with nature surrounding hot tub is truly breathtaking scenery to be seen. Everything was easy to use including bathroom, beds upstairs and comfortable couch and kitchen. David was very friendly and nice. Will definitely return!"
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"David was a great host. He is passionate about his cabin and making sure that his guests enjoy it to the fullest. He prepared the hot tub for us several times, communicated very proactively, recommended a great dog mushing place and best of all took us on a 2 hr snow shoe around the property.
The cabin itself is perfect, feels very remote and off the grid, but still only 5 minutes to a great restaurant (the Turtle club), or 10-15 minutes away from everything in Fairbanks. sitting in the hot tub under the stars or hopefully the Aurora is an unforgettable experience. Highly recommend!"
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"David was a great host! Had a good time hanging out with David and his wife and traveling around town, David had plenty of good recommendations. The BF definitely enjoyed his snow shoeing hike. We made a couple new friends and can't wait to come back again!"
2023-02-01,5,Stayed one night,If you want to experience true off-grid living in a beautiful setting then this is it! The wood fired hot tub was a great way to spend the evening at such a quiet and beautiful place!
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Considering the extra assistance you get with building fires and checking the snorkel tub, the services such as trash and waste disposal for staying at a dry cabin— the price is just right.
Tip: I wish I had brought more water to drink since the dry air and fire heated cabin meant for dry dry dry conditions while sleeping at night."
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Amazing host! Incredibly kind and hospitable. We got our car stuck in the snow and David came to meet us in the early hours of the morning to help dig us out. His kindness left a forever impact on us. Worth the trip!
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"David is a passionate host who build this cabin by himself. He’s always responsive and care about our need of stay. We stay for two nights in the snow weather and the hot tub is amazing. We cooked inside the cabin for some hot soups, and the kitchen is no problem. Hear absolutely nothing and found the perfect peaceful moment that exactly we need.
David and his wife just live somewhere near, and we had a good time on snowshoeing with his lovely dogs. The cabin looks like far away from anything in the woods but it’s actually only 10 min drive away from the city. For city people who’ve been longing for a heavenly peace to off-grid few days like us, we highly recommend it and so glad we found this place.
His also very LGBT friendly."
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Adored every second of our stay. I was a little nervous about this whole “dry cabin” thing, especially in cold December weather, but David was so helpful and the cabin is so nice, that it was not a huge deal at all! The cabin is very peaceful - in the middle of frozen and snow covered trees, with an awesome wood burning fireplace, and a cozy wood fired hot tub. The kitchen is easy to cook in with a stove and oven (pots, pans, kettle, knives, and even tons of spices all provided). The ice box stayed cool for two nights with two bags of ice. It was just so chill hanging out with the fire and candles and home cooked food. The outhouse is not too far at all and very clean. The property is huge, with tons of areas to snowshoe and explore. Driving up was not a problem at all in our AWD rental. Also, David and his dogs were awesome. He answered a million of my questions, was so friendly, and even led us snowshoeing on the property. I was sad to leave at the end of our 2 nights! Def 100% book!"
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Another magical stay in this gorgeous little cabin..! David is a wonderful host and has made this place a true little gem. It is close to town yet feels really remote and private. The cabin is cozy and offers everything you need for a comfortable stay… and the hot-tub is such a treat! We even got to enjoy some northern lights during our stay. We highly recommend this beautiful little getaway, whether you are passing through or calling Fairbanks home!"
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"David was a great host! I wasn’t sure if I was going to come back to Alaska, but it’s definitely on my list so I can come back and stay at David’s place! Beautiful spot and David is a fantastic host. Always going the extra mile. A must stay!!"
2022-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Beautiful cabin! Secluded but close to town. David made us feel very welcome. While we were out, he took care of the hot tub and plowed the driveway for us. We enjoyed the hot tub while our dogs played in the snow. We will definitely be back!"
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"David's cabin was cozy and wonderful. Enjoyed the hot tub, wood burning stove, and book selection! The surroundings were beautiful and very private. David was very responsive to questions and knowledgeable about the flora on the property. I would definitely recommend spending some time here."
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"If you are in Fairbanks, you must stay here! The cabin was stocked with everything you might need. It felt like you were far way in the middle of nowhere, and yet a short drive to town. David was very responsive and a great host."
2022-11-01,5,Stayed one night,David’s cabin is absolutely amazing! We are so grateful to have gotten a peaceful and cozy night alone. 100% recommend
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Had an amazing time at David’s place! Such a nice, secluded, peaceful getaway and a great Alaskan experience! The hot tub was so nice to soak in under the stars and David maintained it for us! He also loves to show people around the beautiful snowy property and wish we would’ve had more time to explore more!"
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Loved this stay! We will be back. 10/10 recommend
2022-11-01,5,Stayed one night,We loved the cabin and the remoteness! We did not get to see the northern lights but we did get to hot tub on the deck in -5* which is an experience to say the least! David is very communicative and accommodating which we really appreciated! Would love to come back!
2022-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"We loved this stay, my boyfriend and I are into bushcraft so this was the perfect off-grid stay. Unfortunately we only stayed a few hours and weren’t able to use the beautiful hot tub (poor trip planning on our part). We would love to be back again someday!"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"AMAZING!! This is the place to stay if you are in Fairbanks. The communication was amazing. Any questions I had, David answered them right away. The cabin has everything you would need to stay warm in the winter and cool in the summer. Can’t wait to book a trip to go back!"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed about a week,The place was amazing perfect of you’re looking for an off the grid cabin! David was great had quick turn around on problems and communicated often. A great place for vacation
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This house was truly magical. We had a most amazing time there and it will be a trip to remember for a long time. David has thought of everything from the lanterns to the candles to headlamps, you name it, he's got it! The hot tub was the highlight for us as we used it both nights we were there - especially on the second night when we got quite the northern lights viewing! We also explored the grounds a bit ourselves and the cabin is an easy drive into town for food and other needs. Cell service is GREAT at the cabin so even though you may not have Wifi, you are still connected with the outside world for those that cannot fully unplug. This place is a little slice of heaven - can't recommend it enough."
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"A very nice view, hot tub and location. Highly recommended!"
2022-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"Amazingly beautiful place to stay. Must see private hiking trails if desired, hot tub, comfy house and bed. Definitely will be back."
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was my first experience in a dry cabin and probably one of the most memorable times in my life. This experience has given me a different perspective, which is exactly what I was looking for when coming to alaska. I’m realizing less is more in some circumstances and I’m thankful for hosts like you who put so much thought and effort to keeping us guests comfortable. This place is mesmerizing…the cabin, the scenery, the auroras, even the outhouse! That was the nicest outhouse I’ve ever used! All photography and decorations fit in so perfectly with the cabin. It truly is worth it even with it being a dry cabin. The hot tub made the stay even better! I’m very impressed and would recommend it to anyone! If you’re on the fence about staying in a dry cabin, just do it!"
2022-09-01,5,Stayed one night,A great place to escape for the weekend and enjoy the outdoors!
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"If you like the idea of a dry cabin, DO NOT SKIP THIS PLACE! Staying at the Aurora Outpost was the highlight lodging of our Alaska trip and my favorite ever Airbnb experience. It feels like a remote escape in all aspects, yet it is a short drive to anything you need in Fairbanks. We stayed for 2 nights in September. The temps ranged from mid-30s at night to low 50s in the day, and the cabin was always very comfortable with the heating elements easily and appropriately implemented. The aesthetic of the interior (and exterior, for that matter) is so lovely and tasteful. The hot tub was FANTASTIC- fun and relaxing, maintains temperature well, and we even got to view the Aurora one night! The outhouse is also the most pleasant outhouse I’ve ever used, and more comfortable than I expected during the chillier parts of the evening. We cooked a few simple meals in the kitchen (stocked with a considerable variety of spices, oil, and basic cookware) with ease. We slept well on the comfortable bed in the loft with a perfect variety of blankets to meet your warmth preference. David has really created a masterpiece with this cabin and we felt so lucky to be able to stay there. Honestly, we couldn’t even think of a way for cabin to be improved, it’s wonderful. Overall 10/10 amazing romantic getaway, and I hope we can return in the future for a longer stay in another season!"
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Relaxing and beautiful. Very clean

2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Wonderful cabin hideaway close to Fairbanks! The location is peaceful and private and the hot tub is amazing. Great place to read, relax, and unwind. We saw the northern lights - which was quite a treat - and were very toasty in the cabin at night. Everything was very clean (including the outhouse!) and with all the little touches, it felt like a little home away from home. David the host was super responsive and helpful."
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great accommodation in an amazing location, perfect for a romantic escape!"
2022-08-01,5,Stayed one night,A beautiful off the grid stay! We loved relaxing in the outdoor hot tub and enjoying the views after a long day of travel. David was quick to answer any questions and had nice little touches throughout the cabin. A wonderful and relaxing way to begin our honeymoon!

2022-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"Best honeymoon suite ever. We arrived late after our beautiful wedding then reception dinner. We showed up to find a perfect little cabin, an immaculate outhouse, and steaming hot tub."
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"It's an amazing little cabin, that David put a lot of thought and attention into. Hot tub was an absolute game-changer! It was a pleasure meeting him and his fiance, when they took us blueberry picking and showed us around the vast and beautiful property. If we're ever in the area again, we'll definitely come knocking! Thanks again, David!"
2022-08-01,5,Stayed one night,Not usually a review guy. But David’s cabin deserves a five star review with fancier words than I have. Everything was perfect and I cannot recommend it enough if you’re looking to get away. This can be for a single night or longer. The perfect place to unplug and unwind.
2022-08-01,5,Stayed one night,Magical place to stay!
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This place is amazing! Quiet, private cabin in a birch and aspen forest. Wood fired hot tub was great! This is the best air bnb I’ve ever stayed at!"

2022-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,We very much enjoyed our stay. The cabin was clean and cozy. Definitely had an authentic Alaska feel while maintaining great cell coverage. The hottub was great place to relax and soak in the beauty of nature. David was a great host and great with communication
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We enjoyed a wonderful weekend at this beautiful cabin. The cabin is even cuter in person and the views even more fantastic. The proximity to town is convenient but it feels totally private and isolated, nestled in the forest. There are so many personal touches including interesting books and flower pots lining the deck. The hot tub is perfection and is positioned for an epic soaking view. David was super helpful and communicative and we appreciated the helpful suggestion for activities around town. We’d love to return in the winter."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This stay is a must for everyone! The hot tub, scenery, and privacy is amazing. Absolutely recommend!"
2022-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"A true escape that is unique and beautiful. Driving down the gravel road towards the cabin feels like waving goodbye to the modern world. As a stopover in the middle of our trip, a soak after several long days of driving was truly a blessing. The water temperature is perfect, and you get such a peaceful view of this private land. I wish we could stay a few days longer and explore the area more according to the helpful map that David left in the cabin. Next time, blueberries!
Almost forgot to mention, David is an awesome host that is super accommodating. We had a last minute change to our reservation and he still gladly accepted it. Communication is fast and clear, which made our stay even better!"
2022-06-01,5,Stayed one night,Loved our stay and the hot tub! Great place to start our vacation!!
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This cabin is clean, nice, and cozy. David was responsive and helpful with all of our questions. A great location to escape from the city!"
2022-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Beautiful surroundings, a hot tub that is to die for, and an cute and comfy cabin stocked with all the necessities. I would love to stay here again!"
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This place is absolutely amazing and I recommend it to anyone and everyone. One of the best hosts I have ever talked to. super knowledgeable and a one of a kind experience.
2022-06-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Awesome remote cabin on a beautiful property. Nice, secluded, and peaceful. We went in spring and the hot tub was perfect after a long flight, a day of hiking, or for a warm soak on the more chilly mornings. It's next to the Chena River State Park which has lots of great trails, fishing and boating/canoeing/kayaking."
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"peaceful, secluded dry cabin (no running water) with beautiful view. Nice hot tub that David helps keep warm. He is available for anything you need."
2022-05-01,5,Stayed one night,This cabin is the perfect getaway!! Its a hidden treasure with beautiful views. David is a great host with great communication that keeps everything very clean and maintained.
2022-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"This little cabin is true gem! I stayed there for the first time this winter and enjoyed it so much that I booked it again for my parents who are in town for a visit. They absolutely loved their time there. It is close to town yet feels very private and remote. The wood-heated hot tub is amazing, and the cabin very charming and comfortable. It is a perfect little getaway for visitors and locals alike!"
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The cabin is definitely one-of-a-kind experience. We especially love the hot tub and the view outside.
2022-05-01,5,Stayed about a week,simply the best.
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This spot is very unique, and we would consider it a ""Once in a lifetime"" kind of stay. The hot tub is one of the best and most unique we've ever used. The outhouse is so clean and so well kept, you almost forget you're using an outhouse. The view of the sunsets are stunning, and I can only imagine what the place looks like when the northern lights are fully displayed. We wished we could've experienced them from this cabin. However, our experience was just as perfect without having had that experience. David is so kind and helpful and he has a lot of good advice for things to do and places to go in the area.
Overall, we really loved this stay and highly recommended this as a must if you plan to stay in the Fairbanks area!"
2022-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"Amazing weekend at David’s cabin! Absolutely beautiful property, hiking trails and cedar hot tub. Will definitely be back again!"
2022-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"Just go!!! Don’t think about it! This will be for sure one of the best experiences of your lives (it was one of ours). I’ve been to 46 states of the USA, Alaska was my favorite and David’s place has a point on that. We saw the Aurora, it was magical!"
2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great getaway!! So close to Fairbanks, and yet you feel like you are a million miles away. David was an amazing host, super responsive and helpful. Provided snowshoes for us to explore property. This 'dry' cabin had everything we needed. Well appointed kitchen. The hot tub was awesome. Got to soak under snowflakes, and one night we even got treated to the Auroras. Highly recommend. We will be back!!"
2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great experience! Would highly recommend!
2022-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"David was an outstanding host. My fiancé and I got engaged at the cabin and it was the perfect place to start the rest of our lives together. Definitely recommend the snowshoeing tour, cedar hot tub, and amazing views of the night sky. We’ll definitely be back."
2022-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"The view from the cabin is amazing, and the hot tub was so relaxing. We will definitely be coming back. David keeps the cabin very clean and has great communication with his guests."
2022-03-01,5,Stayed one night,My husband and I wanted to do a weekend getaway in a dry cabin. It was an amazimg experience. The view was breathtaking! The cabin is very clean and cute! The hottub was clean and warm our whole stay! I would recommend staying here for the Alaskan experience! Will be returning!
2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What an amazing property! We loved our stay, the hot tub and snowshoeing experience were highlights, we will for sure be back!"
2022-03-01,5,Stayed one night,Great spot and friendly host- would recommend.
2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My stay was absolutely wonderful, and David definitely deserves the super host title. I stayed for two nights while traveling solo, with no rental car, and his hospitality gave me great comfort knowing if I needed anything he’d be able to help at any time. The space itself was super cute, cozy, and comfortable, and the hot tub was perfect day and night. The peace and solitude definitely made for a great place to relax, unwind, and just sit in the hot tub and enjoy nature—especially when the northern lights made an appearance! Overall highly recommend this place, and if you’re at all iffy about it being a dry cabin don’t be. He’s spared no detail ensuring the place has everything you need to feel comfortable. Can’t wait to come back!"
2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This was our 2nd stay and it was so wonderful to be back. This has become a place that we look so forward to. A complete “check out” from society where our dogs and us can relax and explore. Thank you David for your great communication and providing us with everything we need!
2022-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"This cabin is amazing. Although being off the grid, it’s got pretty much everything you need. Among them all of course, the hot tub is the star. Soaking in it surrounded by snowy forests is an unforgettable experience. David is super nice, patient and responsive. I can tell how much time and care he spends keeping this place in the best condition possible."
2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What an amazing experience. The cabin is super cozy and you will have the best host ever. David is such a great person, he really care about his guess. We went to Alaska for our anniversary and we decided to tried a dry Cabin, it was the best idea we could ever have, David guided us and answered all our questions making everything easy for our stay, cabin has also all you need to enjoy your time on. We were able to see the northern light from the hot tub and took a great picture of it. I highly recommend the snowshoes tour and aurora photography lesson with David.
We will definitely be back."
2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a great time at the cabin and would recommend it 100%. The cabin was clean and cozy, and David is a great and really nice host. Between the wood burning stove and propane heater, we were more than warm. The hot tub was fantastic & we enjoyed it every night. It was a perfect place to watch the Northern lights (we saw them 3 of our 5 nights). The outhouse was super clean and not an issue for us at all. David left snowshoes on the front porch, and we enjoyed using them to explore part of the 100 acres. When we planned the trip, we knew that being off the grid was the best way for us to experience the Northern Lights and David’s cabin was the perfect choice. We are already planning a return visit."
2022-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Aurora Outpost is a must!! This cozy cabin makes for the perfect romantic-rustic getaway. The cabin itself comes supplied with all the essentials (drink-serve-cookware; candles, towels, blankets). The wood burning stove and wall heater keep you warm on cold winter nights.
The secluded property makes the cabin even better!!! The hot tub will get so much use, you will start to wonder where you can fit one of your own back home. The scenery was a wonderland of snow-covered trees, making snowshoeing on the property an excursion in itself! Far enough out of town for the night sky to be filled with lights like us East Coasters have never seen before, yet close enough to town that you're only a short drive away from the city center of Fairbanks.
David is truly what makes the Aurora Outpost a slice of paradise. His hosting goes above and beyond. He welcomes you to his cabin and truly allows you to feel at home."
2022-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Wether you’re looking for a romantic getaway, complete seclusion (or both) to take in all the raw beauty Alaska has to offer all while being within driving distance from all things in Fairbanks - this is your place! The wood burning hot tub was the cherry on top and David made sure we felt at home. We hope to return one day in the near future!"
2022-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was a perfect little escape, and by far the coziest dry cabin I’ve ever stayed in! The location feels remote, and the land is mesmerizing! Truly a little slice of heaven. David was such a great host! We had all the information we needed before we even arrive, and all the instructions he gave us were very descriptive! We had zero issues!
If you are from out of state, I would highly recommend staying more then one night! This is a great little Alaskan experience, and an extremely comfortable one! It honestly doesn’t get much better then this!
I’m already looking forward to my next visit!"
2021-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,5/5 would stay here again.
2021-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"Hubby and I really enjoyed our stay at David's cabin.
He provided us with all the information we needed before we even arrive. The outdoor hot tub was excellent!!
Cabin is very clean and comfortable and has everything you could need for a dry cabin. I️ would 100% recommend a stay here. I have already told a few close friends and now they want to stay there as well!!"
2021-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Great Air bnb experience. Clean and Cozy. David kept the hot tub going for us for our whole stay. beautiful cabin. we would definitely stay there again!
2021-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Can you imagine anything more romantic than a little cabin deep in the woods of Alaska during a snowy winter evening? Or sitting in a cedar hot tub while watching the northern lights while it's -30*F? David's cabin was simply phenomenal, especially for couples looking for a private cabin getaway. Thank you!"
2021-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Fantastic cabin to visit; while it's dry and no electricity David does a great job keeping it stocked with water, candles, battery powered lights and plenty of fire wood. We were there in -30 weather and stayed very warm; with the cold weather we had clear skies both nights and had killer views of the Aurora. Would definitely come back."
2021-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"What a gem! Dave was a great host, very responsive and helpful. We loved every minute of our stay in his beautiful little cabin. It’s close to town yet feels really remote. The cabin is cozy and warm, with an efficient wood stove that is easy to operate. It is tastefully decorated and everything is set-up to make the best of your off-the-grid stay. Soaking up in the hot-tub toasty water while it was so cold outside was a real treat. We will be back!"
2021-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"beautiful piece of secluded property among tall white birch trees. David is very thoughtful and detail oriented. Very accommodating, he even offered me a late check out since I got in very late. Certainly a hidden, cozy gem of a place"
2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a great time at the cabin. It’s not like a public use cabin-it’s filled with useful amenities and comforts that make for a cozy stay. The cabin is super close to Fairbanks but without losing its isolated, wilderness vibe. My wife and I loved our stay and we’ll be back."
2021-11-01,5,Stayed one night,David was very accommodating and gave us very detailed and clear instructions on how to run the cabin. I highly recommend this place for someone that is looking for a true “off the grid” experience.
2021-11-01,5,Stayed one night,Awesome place! Recommend staying more than 1 night to fully appreciate the place. David was super nice and helpful. place was super clean and great location.
2021-11-01,5,Stayed one night,We loved the cabin! The hot chocolate was definitely nice on a cold snowy night. The cabin was cozy and one of the best places we’ve stayed! David was very responsive and provided all the answers to our questions.
2021-11-01,5,Stayed one night,David definitely earns his top host rating. Such a gem of a getaway. Can’t wait til I can get another weekend away.
2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Best experience for a true Alaska stay
2021-11-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Lovely cabin, but watch your head if above 6'3"". The jacuzzi while snowing is a hallmark moment and worth the trip alone!"
2021-10-01,5,Stayed one night,This was a fantastic stay! The cabin is interior-Alaska-luxurious with great decor and dry cabin amenities. Being able to sit in the hot tub in the snowy weather while looking at the stars is Alaska at its best!
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"David’s cabin is perfect. He is very accommodating and answers very quickly. The hot tub is amazing, the cabin is super clean and cozy, and not too far from town. Hands down nicest/easiest dry cabin we’ve ever stayed in, highly recommended"
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Excellent location, feels like you're out in the woods even though you're just minutes from town. The hot tub wasn't credible and life-changing! Now I'm coveting one. Will be back soon."
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Such a gorgeous cabin! David has put a lot of effort into making this a relaxing getaway. The hot tub is amazing! We saw the aurora from it one night! He did an incredible property tour with us as well. We will be back!
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We had an amazing time at the cabin! Secluded with tons of character. Stunning views of the northern lights!
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Amazing stay! Easy checkin and smooth communications. Cozy cabin, it kept warm through the night. The hot tub was amazing."
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This cabin was EVERYTHING we could’ve asked for and more. David was extremely helpful and gave us plenty of tips on how to see the lights and made sure we could use the hot tub. He provided cooking ware and headlamps with lanterns. The outhouse was well kept. The attention to detail was amazing! We saw the northern lights and stayed up all night in the hot tub. Truly a once in a lifetime experience!
2021-10-01,5,Stayed about a week,This off grid cabin is amazing. The hot tub is the best. Only problem is the place is so perfect it was difficult to leave on day trips. David was amazing and always responded quickly. It was 7 days of heaven for us.
2021-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"Peaceful, quiet Alaskan get-a-way with a chance of seeing some Northern Lights. If this is what you are looking for than this is it! All around a GREAT place to stay a night or two."
2021-09-01,5,Stayed one night,David was so very helpful and always immediately responded when we had questions. It was such a beautiful and peaceful place.
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"A truly amazing Alaskan experience. David thought of everything and provided very detailed instructions, we had no issues."
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Our stay here was amazing! The location was perfect, the cabin was so cute and the hot tub and views were super cool!"
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Absolutely enjoyed my stay at this cabin. The directions and communication were on point. Very good location to the airport and easy access. The cabin had all I needed and I really appreciated all the small touches… like head lamps, battery lighting, kitchen and living area was very cute. The hot tub was the highlight and it was kept warm the entire stay. David is an excellent host!"
2021-09-01,5,Stayed one night,Great location and lovely little cabin with so much details and amenities.
2021-09-01,5,Stayed one night,Beautiful place to stay! Everything was well thought out in what a guest would need and the hot tub was perfect!
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was the perfect get away for my husband and I. David has a beautiful property and created the perfect stay. I would 100% recommend booking. This cozy cabin has everything you need, and we stayed a total of 6 nights. David was great at replenishing and providing us with everything we needed during our stay. Water jugs, kitchen amenities, lanterns, headlights, towels, “bathroom” amenities and more.
The hot tub was absolutely amazing, probably one of the best parts of our stay. David came by daily to get it up and running for us but also provided great direction for us to maintain.
Location was great, 12-15 mins from shopping, food and gas.
No WiFi but cell service is available at the cabin which was nice to map out activites.
If you are renting a car I would prepare for some off roading, which heads up some rentals don’t allow.
Overall such an amazing experience here, we will remember it forever and a big thanks to David for allowing us to stay!"
2021-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"I'm a local, so I've been in lots of dry cabins, and this one is the nicest I've seen. Everything is put together very thoughtfully, and it's a cozy setting for two people. The hot tub was glorious, much nicer than a chlorinated jet tub. The location feels quiet and remote even though it's very convenient to town; we occasionally heard a plane or car traffic, but it was much quieter than home. We rented this cabin just to have a relaxing ""date night"", and it was perfect! We will be back."
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is an awesome place to stay and relax. David is great at getting back to you quickly and always offering local insights on the best things to do, or how to enhance what you want to do. If you’re gonna stay here, I’d recommend at least two nights to get to enjoy it to its fullest."
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Everything is as advertised. This is an amazing place to stay! Great off the grid experience, does have cell service and is close to town. Gorgeous cabin and very kind host."
2021-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"My girlfriend and I enjoyed this rustic yet beautiful cabin in the woods. David was great with communication and was swift to visit the cabin next morning and replaced the firewood for the hottub on our request. The cabin is clean, well equipped and has scenic views. We highly recommend staying here."
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What a great experience staying In the Off the Grid Cabin. David, went above & beyond communicating with whatever we needed. Don’t pass up staying here, it is a gem in the woods!!"
2021-07-01,5,Stayed one night,Great stay! Very quiet area and perfect for relaxing.
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a great time at David’s cabin, it was a great way to relax. This was the best AirB&B we have ever stayed at and will definetly be back in the future. David was very easy to communicate with and we could tell he took the time to make our stay the best that it could be."
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We were so intrigued by the 100 acres and cedar hot tub we drove from Anchorage (after flying from SLC, Utah) just to stay at this cabin… it did not disappoint. We had no other business in Fairbanks; it was absolutely worth the drive.
The peace, the solitude, the abundance of life and biodiversity emanates nothing but magic. Thanks for creating such a rejuvenating place David.
Cheers."
2021-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"This place is amazing!!! You MUST stay here! It was clean, and amazingly well stocked. It's tucked away and quiet. All you see is trees and amazing sunsets. Soaking in the wood fired hotub and then sitting on the deck to be entertained by squirrels robbing the bird feeders. So relaxing! We will be staying here again!"
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great remote place to stay! If you are looking for quiet time this is the SPOT!
2021-07-01,5,Stayed one night,David’s place was remote but not too far from the downtown area. Perfect getaway for couples looking to be immersed in nature. The hot tub was great and the cabin was cute and quaint but equipped with anything we might need. Would love to stay here again and highly recommend!
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"David's cabin is tucked back in a forest which makes you feel like you're in your own private paradise. However, it is a short drive into Fairbanks for anything you're interested in doing there. We loved coming back to the cabin, watching the birds and squirrels and soaking in the super hot hot tub! The cabin had all the amenities you could need and then some. We will definitely be back in the winter to hopefully catch some northern lights, but summer time was beautiful and the cabin is surrounded by wildflowers. You won't regret your stay here! So worth it!"
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is a nice little cabin, secluded but not too far from town, with an awesome hot tub. Make sure to bring a battery pack for charging essentials and drinking water.
David was a great host and the cabin was very comfortable. Be ready to make friends with all the playful, hungry squirrels. :)"
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,David doesn’t drink that “lower 48 Kool Aid”and if you also want a piece of Alaskan freedom and relaxation then you would enjoy the cabin. Great property!
