2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Whether you are local needing a night away, or simply passing through Rolla, MO, I highly encourage choosing The Webber Cottage. The place was so cute, cozy, and squeaky clean! I can't wait to return this winter when its cold out, so we can use the fireplace!"

2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Loved this house! Perfect for a visit to my son, who is attending S&T.
We stay in AirBNBs all overteh country and Jamie was incredibly thoughtful putting this home together - best of any home we've stayed in. She left so may wonderful items that might get forgotten, from shaving cream to great coffee flavorings for the coffee bar. She also outfitted the home with tons of great seasonal decor which made it super homey. All of the super soft throws throughout the house were also great to stay cozy on beautiful fall days!
Definitely recommend!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Jamie’s home was so incredibly homey and cozy! Felt right at home with the comfortable bed, plush blankets and couch plus everything in between.

2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This was an outstanding Airbnb—one of our favorites out of almost 200 that we’ve stayed in. It was so fun to read about the history of the Webber family and see the old photos. Jamie has gone over and above to make sure her guests have absolutely everything they could possibly need. We loved our stay here!
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"My family really enjoyed the home it was very inviting, cozy and comfortable and the welcome basket was a nice touch.

Jamie was very helpful and accommodating and we would be happy to stay here again."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The Webber Cottage was perfect. It was comfortable and had lovely decor. The front porch and chairs were a nice bonus.

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We visited for our son’s graduation from Fort Leonard Wood, 701st Military Police Battalion. Our large family with grandparents wanted a place to stay where we could all eat together and have common space large enough to hang out. This “cabin” delivered! Its gorgeous features and beautiful surroundings had something for everyone. Judy was very responsive and an excellent host. We will definitely be back!!!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We rented the cabin for my daughter’s wedding. It allowed us to have the whole family in one spot. The house was beautiful, equipped with everything we needed for the weekend plus more. Judy allowed us to check in at 2:00 pm instead of the normal time of 4:00 so that we could start decorating and getting ready for the wedding at the pavilion. On the wedding night we had two guests that had a long drive home and since we only had 8 people in our house Judy allowed us to have let the other two guests stay with no extra charge. She was prompt in answering anytime we needed her and check in and check out was a breeze.
My one and only complaint was that we did find a packet of birth control pills under the pillow in one of the rooms, and some small empty liquor bottles in the couch arm rest of another.
Overall it was a great stay, just thought the cleaning person could’ve been a bit more thorough."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had our daughters wedding and reception at The Village. We rented the cabin for the wedding party and photos. It was convenient, beautiful, and spacious."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"I utilized this space for my sons military graduation at Fort Leonardwood. This place and the kindness of Judy was nothing short of amazing!
The home was immaculate and had everything you needed that would be in your own home. Every message I sent to her, she responded with in five minutes. She was also VERY accommodating, welcoming, and kind. The only thing I would say is the location is 45 minutes away from the military base, However, I knew that, but still couldn't resist staying there instead of a hotel. The pictures are exactly as it looks in the images. Beautiful home and host!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Beautiful home in a peaceful spot, loved staying here on our way to see the eclipse."

2024-03-01,5.0,Group trip,"We very much enjoyed staying at ""the Village"" in Rolla MO to get to spend time with my brother who is 2 months into his officer training at Ft. Leonard wood. We were able to make him some home cooked meals in the wonderfully stocked kitchen with not just pots and pans but also a casserole dish and all the utensils necessary."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Incredible home in an unexpected place!
2024-03-01,5.0,Group trip,Loved staying in this Airbnb. It was our first time renting an airbnb and it was an amazing experience. The home looked just as pictured. Enjoyed spending time outside. It felt just like home. We will definitely go back on the winter to spend more time in the home.

2024-01-01,5.0,Group trip,"Judy was very accommodating and responsive to our needs. This was a beautiful place for our couples weekend retreat, where we spend time relaxing, playing games, and watching movies. This kitchen was quite spacious with everything we needed to cook our meals and the living room was perfect for movie watching. We'd love to come back in the warmer months to enjoy the outdoors in this cool and unique setting!"
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We stayed in the Log Cabin and it is a beautiful setup for a family or group. Judy has done a great job making it functional and pretty. The open concept arrangement is nice and the large dining and kitchen were very useful!! Definitely the largest fridge/freezer we have ever had! Multiple bathrooms were also awesome 👏 We didn’t get to explore the surroundings much per the weather, but would come back again for sure. Thanks for hosting our 2024 family Christmas/New Year’s."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"This place is stunning, pictures do not do it justice. Our family did something different this year & spent Christmas here. It did not disappoint. All that was missing was the snow to make it the perfect Norman Rockwell picture. Quiet & tranquil at least in the winter. Jim & Judy are the perfect host. They leave you alone but respond almost immediately when you need something. Plenty of games and things to do for kids of any age. Kitchen is 2x the size in the pictures. Large deck on back of the home. I don’t think that picture was shown. My 12 year old daughter absolutely fell in love the back bedroom which had its own bathroom & 2 shower heads. It was tough to get her out of that room to spend time with us. I can’t blame her it was so cozy and private. She’s a twin so he doesn’t get that much privacy at home. I recommend a winter stay it’s the perfect peaceful hideaway."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"The cabin is absolutely stunning, comfortable and clean. We truly enjoyed our family’s stay!"
2023-12-01,5.0,Group trip,awesome
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"My family was here for our son’s graduation ceremony from Ft Leonard Wood about 30 miles west of Rolla. It was absolutely beautiful, and spacious for our family. Please know that the pictures are an understatement of this property, this home is most certainly a 5 star property. The kitchen omg, is certainly a dream kitchen , it’s everything and equipped with everything, soft close drawers, the finest dishes , cooking accessories for what ever dish your preparing. Must I say my family spent most of our time hanging out in this gorgeous kitchen. Dining for18- 20 people , we had a graduation dinner and had plenty of room . The bathrooms which every bedroom has an on suite bathroom. And one downstairs, all the bathrooms were absolutely fabulous, . Mrs Judy had prepared snacks , coffee , teas fresh water in the refrigerator. Also supplied big cozy blankets on her large sectional. Oh did I mention a very nice library in her home. Nice porch and fire pit , Me Judy was the best , responds qu"
2023-11-01,5.0,Group trip,"This place was adorable! Even though we didn’t end up staying here, everything was as it said and it was a beautiful space."
2023-11-01,4.0,Group trip,"Judy was quick, responsive and listed her place accurately! The cabinets and supplies were well stocked and the kitchen had nice, newer appliances. The housekeeping team could do a better job at checking to make sure sheets are spotless (They seemed washed, but stained or little pieces of dirt). The large kitchen and dining room made it easy to get ready in the morning while being together with all my girls. The price is a little steep for the place, but Judy was sure to make the place cute and all necessities covered. It’d be nice to have a table top ice maker and extra throw blankets. The extra blankets/quilts provided were pretty old looking (Didn’t want to use those) so we were pretty chilly and the fireplace smelled strongly of propane so we didn’t use it. Thanks for hosting us!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We stayed in Judy’s home for my sisters wedding weekend! The home was equipped with everything we needed! There were beautiful personal touches throughout the home and it was comfortable and clean. Talk about a dream kitchen! This location is so beautiful, a nice getaway from the real world! Definitely recommend this peaceful home."

2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The cabin was amazing, we were just there for one night for an event at MST. Close to town and the place was even nicer than the pictures show. Would stay again!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Group trip,"My second time staying at one of Judy’s places and I wish all Air BNB’s could be like hers. Beautiful home with touches that make you want to incorporate them into your own home. Judy gives you your space; however, is so responsive and kind if you need to get in touch with her. I can’t say enough positive things about Judy and the homes she offers for visitors like me. Highly recommend!!"

2023-07-01,5.0,Group trip,One of the most beautiful places i've ever had the privilege of staying at.
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Such a unique and memorable place!!! The house is spacious and modern with nice amenities. The kitchen is luxurious and the bedrooms/bathrooms are well-appointed. Be prepared to drive a bit to get into town (about 10 mins to downtown Rolla) - but that also means that you have privacy and peace & quiet!
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We were so happy with the house and the land surrounding. It was beautiful and peaceful. We enjoyed our time immensely would totally stay here again next summer.

2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Judy and her place were exceptional. We checked into an Airbnb in ft Leonard wood for a graduation that had not been cleaned and not as described. 2nd time this happened to us with Airbnb this year…….Thankfully Judy’s place was available! It was exactly what we were looking for. Pristine , peaceful and felt right at home. Judy was very responsive and close by for anything we needed. The property is beautiful and quiet, just up the road from Rolla. I could not say enough positive things about this property and our experience there!"

2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The cabin was amazing and the perfect place for our girl's weekend. The property was beautiful and peaceful.

2022-12-01,5.0,Group trip,"A STEAL. This is by far the highlight for my kids- a cabin in a private village during a winter storm. 4 star for check in since the door lock was a little stuck (maybe cold related) but fortunately the doorbell produced an immediate response to help resolve the situation, and the back door worked just fine. I cannot say enough about this building and this property. A destination property in Rolla."

2022-09-01,5.0,Group trip,We really enjoyed having our daughter's wedding at your beautiful venue. We really loved being able to have all of the bridesmaids and groomsmen onsite at the venue the night before the wedding and especially the the night of. I think having the bridesmaids stay together in a house for the whole weekend helped them all to bond and make even more wonderful memories. The same for the groomsmen!! It's such a beautiful venue with a very neat historical story behind how the place was originally created for Donna Douglas (Elly May Clampett from The Beverly Hillbillies). Loved it!
2022-09-01,5.0,Group trip,"Come with confidence! This home is everything it says it is. Very clean, very quiet, beautiful location, well equipped.

2022-07-01,5.0,Group trip,"I have stayed in Airbnb’s throughout Europe, Central America, and the United States and Judy’s place is by far one of the nicest, cleanest, and most elegant places I have stayed! The pictures do not do it justice and the kitchen is one that Gordon Ramsey would be jealous of! Even though these items are important to travelers, their is no substitute for the personal attention Judy so willingly offered. She was able to accommodate us at the end of our stay given that we encountered unforeseen circumstances…she is the best! Needless to say, I would highly recommend this oasis to travelers! ENJOY!!!!"

The dining room had a giant table that could seat a small army if you're cooking for a large crowd. Everyone slept well in the comfortable beds and the attached bathrooms were nicely adorned. We all had At&t and there wasn't much signal but the internet at the house was speedy and we were able to use wifi calling.
The house was just minutes away from the Cub Creek Science camp where we were all picking up our children the next day. It was great to relax the night before and spend 5 minutes in the car vs 2 hours. We look forward to staying again in the future."
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We had a wonderful time at this gorgeous house and unique property. We loved how comfortable and well appointed the “cabin” was and also loved having some acres to roam. It was the perfect was to unplug and recharge. Thank you for your hospitality!!
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Beautiful home. And amazing host !
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,We had a great stay at Judy’s cabin. I felt like we had gone back in time with the little town of building around us.
2022-05-01,5.0,Group trip,Stayed at the on-site lodging for a wedding and it was fantastic! The house was so clean and had everything we needed. So much space for a large group of people. Highly recommend!
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This log cabin is absolutely beautiful and in a perfect setting. If you get the chance to stay here...DO IT!! Our daughter was graduating at Fort Leonard Wood..it's an easy drive, and yet out in the perfect nature surrounding setting. I can't say enough positive things to give enough credit to this home. Just beautiful!"
2022-05-01,5.0,Group trip,Very big but comfortable place! Comfortable beds and couch. Modern and sleek kitchen
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"I reserved this Log Cabin in Rolla and when I looked up ""Rolla"" on the map I was worried about staying there because of the bad rating about this city/town. I called Judy and she was absolutely wonderful and made me feel comfortable about the area even before we arrived. When we arrived, Rolla was everything Judy said, a quiet city/town with friendly people.The Log Cabin is like a home away from home; for family quality time, peaceful and surrounded by nature."
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Beautiful location! Accommodations were great! Comfy beds too!
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"There is only one word to describe this heavenly place - Perfect! Everything was just perfect! Exactly what I needed for a little down time and personal R & R. I arrived in the evening to a chorus of big and little frogs from the lake, whip-poor-will calls, and a beautiful moon to greet me in an otherwise silent forest evening. The cabin is simply magnificent. The photos don't, and couldn't possibly do it justice. I was fortunate enough to meet the hosts, Jim and Judy, and told them that if there had been any way for me to beam the place over to my farm in Illinois, they would have been left with an empty foundation! I loved the place that much! Since I was traveling alone, I didn't even begin to take advantage of all that the cabin and the property have to offer for a larger group - especially for folks who like to cook. That kitchen is astounding! And Judy and Jim are two of the most wonderful people and accommodating hosts that you will ever meet. Don't hesitate to book your stay or event with them at The Village. You will be ever so glad that you did!"
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Great place to stay or hold an event.

And then we opened the door of the cabin and literally we all just began to say “WOW! WOW! WOW!” The house is perfect. It’s immaculate. It’s a modern cabin with wonderful amenities. The sofa was so comfortable and had a USB port! The bedrooms were comfy and perfect size. The fixtures - EVERY detail was thought out and pristine. As a cook, I fell in love with the kitchen. It is a DREAM to anyone who loves to cook. This is hands down the BEST AirbNb we have every stayed out. The host is so kind and responsive. Literally she and her gorgeous home are FIVE STARS."

2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"The property is a gem. Amenities are great.

2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This cabin in the woods has the best of both worlds: lovely, quiet natural surroundings, and a luxurious house with all the comforts one could want.

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,This makes the 2nd time my family and I have stayed at one of Shane's AirB&B. 2 different locations and both times we were extremely happy with where we were and felt right at home. safe & secure is a hard feeling to always come by nowadays so when I find it crossing my path as we travel I tend to stick with it when possible especially when I have my family traveling along. Thanks Shane!!
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I personally didn't stay. I just arrange the places for my son to stay for his business travels. I appreciated the quick response from Shane. According to my son, I did a great job finding a place for him to stay in Rolla!"

2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was our 3rd time staying at this house. We like having separate bedrooms and baths since I’m traveling with my adult son with special needs. It gives us both space and privacy that a hotel room doesn’t provide for around the same cost.
It’s close enough to town for restaurants and shopping. But it’s quieter than being in town which allows for a good nights rest as well are both light sleepers.
Shane is always helpful and responsive to any needs. Thanks so much for another wonderful visit."

Everything inside has been recently redone and feels brand new from the moment you walk in. The location is phenomenal, quiet and off the beaten path, but very close to everything in Rolla you might need to get to. Had not grilled with charcoal in ages, had probably the best burger of my life, compliments of the grill on the deck!;)
Thanks Shane!

There is also a blender a hand mixer and a toaster :-) the beds were comfortable and the house is Charming. Great water pressure in the shower! super easy to access the house with an exterior lock box and quiet Street. it does share a wall but we did not hear the neighbors. we did not use the garage but it looks like you might be able to use it if the weather was inclement. also did not use the back deck or grill but it is an awesome feature! I also really like that they provided several throw blankets for curling up and watching TV and that we had two pillows per person that is a definite put this house on my favorite list! thanks for having your house on Airbnb!"

TVs in every room which is great but run on WiFi and the service was not great so made it difficult to watch. WiFi for phones was spotty. Unfortunately most likely just because of location.

2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"We enjoyed our stay at the Mona Lisa. The house is clean and well stocked. The only con was the day before check-in we received a message from the owners stating that they use a “boarding pass system” outside of Airbnb. We would have preferred having the information up front before making the reservation. The property is as described. There are many notes in the guidebook and posted in the house to give clear directions on how to find, use and care for items in the house. The location was perfect for our needs, and we were able to enjoy our visit with family in the area. The hosts were quick to respond with inquiries."

You have everything you need at Tessa's place to make your stay comfortable. All aminities are provided. Excellent host, smooth communication and flexible for my needs.
Absolutely recommended!"
2023-09-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,"Host asked us to take the trash out before we even arrived—wasn’t our trash, but another AirBnB guest. Multiple windows in the house wouldn’t lock properly so we didn’t feel safe. The basement is incredibly creepy and not to mention that they monitor your sound level in the house, which borderline feels like it should not be allowed. Not worth it, get a hotel."

2023-07-01,2.0,Stayed over a week,"House is good. Thanks t host and they arranged special furniture for us. But I had other issues which made my stay difficult. Issues I had
1. Internet is too slow. Even YouTube streaming on Tv is slow always.
2. It took me 2 hrs to figure out thermostat. So unless you are tech person it could be bit difficult.
3. Grass were taller on front yard and it is difficult to walk and enter the house. I requested host but they didn't take any action for customer satisfaction
4. Washing machine was in basement and basement is kinda dirty. Didn't feel like going down and washing clothes often.
Advantages:
House is clean and good.

I would give my stay 5 stars! ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️

2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I stayed at Tessa’s place alone on a weekend layover for a work trip. The place was safe, functional & stylish. Emerald green couch made me feel like I wasn’t in Rolla. Appliances are nice & the bed is comfy. The little design touches are what make the place its own little destination in a town with little happening. Thanks Tessa! I’ll see you on my next Missouri work trip!"
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I absolutely loved my stay, everything was clean and presented as the pictures assured us it would. and I appreciate that the host reached out and ask about my stay and if I needed anything.

2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Such a nice and comforting visit in Rolla
Very clean, everything was labeled, and the guidelines were clear so there was no confusion. It was great for us to be able to unwind in a home that felt safe for us new to AirBnB.
The only thing to be slightly aware of is the internet speed, it worked reliably for my partner’s work and was certainly acceptable - it just was a little sluggish handling a few devices using the internet at once (not a reason to count the place out, that’s for sure! :) )
Safe, comfortable, and awesome! Book this place if you need a place in town."
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very cozy home! Super clean and tidy! Will definitely stay over there again on the next visit!

2022-09-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"Had a good experience here, and would stay again. The little details-- like having closet hangers and clean fans, plenty of toilet paper etc., made this a really comfortable stay.
My one concern was that the windows were not locked properly (probably due to new windows being in an older home), and I did have to figure out how to get them secured on my own. I communicated this to the host who had not been aware of this safety issue prior. Hopefully this will not be an issue for future guests now that it has been brought to their attention.
Still, it was a very cozy little home and I would recommend it."
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Excellent 100% recommended

2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We stayed at The Mona Lisa House for a basic training graduation for our daughters boyfriend at Fort Leonard Wood. It was a great location just off the highway, approximately 25-30 minutes away from base but you wouldn’t know it with the beautiful scenery to take in on the drive. The home is beautifully decorated and had everything we needed to make our stay as comfortable as possible. Beds were comfortable enough that we’re now looking into purchasing a similar type. I usually have a rough time finding a good bed because of back issues that I have. Tessa is very informative and easy to communicate with. Check-in and check-out is flawless. This is our first Airbnb rental and now it won’t be our last! Thanks so much for a great first experience!!

The home is easy to find, well located close to the S & T campus, and very well appointed, cute and nicely updated.

2024-03-01,4.0,Group trip,Great space. Good location. Easy to get in and out of. Check out instructions hanging on wall in kitchen - loved that.

2024-02-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"Overall, we were happy and pleased with this home. It was nice inside, aside from the dirty floor that left my granddaughter’s hands and feet dirty. The interior walls are white and scuffed and knicked up. The outside surrounding area was sketchy and a run down part of town it seemed. The price was fair and the location was super convenient to the local restaurants and grocery."

2024-01-01,4.0,Group trip,"Our first impression as we parked was not very good with the overgrowth of bushes in front, surrounding neighborhood and jail across the street. The yard did not match the photo, however, we visited on one of the snowiest, coldest weekends in recent history, so I’m sure that doesn’t compare to the summer when the photo was taken . Once we were inside we thought the place was very nice, clean and met our needs. I just wanted others to be aware that first impressions don’t always accurately match the final impression. Shane was very attentive to our questions. The house was quiet and very clean. Overall we were pleased with our stay."

There was a strong, lingering cooking odor in the house that remained through our three days, and the beds were TOO soft, if you can believe it. Both are subjective opinions and certainly no fault of the hosts. This is a safe and clean location with great proximity to just about everything in Rolla. Thanks Shane!"

2023-12-01,5.0,Group trip,"My bridesmaids and I stayed here the night before the wedding, we all felt right at home!! the place was so clean and bed was so comfy!! Shane was also very responsive when had any questions. highly recommend!!"
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Some of the highlights I will mention is we loved the house. At first I was bummed about no tv in the bedrooms but it made us watch movies together in the living room. The kitchen was equipped with everything I needed. The shower head in the bathroom was great. Beds slept very comfortably. I was in town for basketball game and the school was in walking distance. This location is close to all the major stores you need to get to. I would stay again.

2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great house great host!
2023-11-01,5.0,Group trip,"Went to visit my brother at school. The location was very close to the school and everything in town seemed centralized which was nice. The interior of the house was very nice with just a few blemishes to give it some character. There is only street parking and it’s close to a police station so we felt relatively safe. There’s also some yard and space between houses so fairly private. We had some issues with spotty Wi-Fi and Shane was quick to respond and offer resolutions to fix the issues. The beds are comfortable the instructions provided for check out were minimal, simple, and straightforward which is appreciated so we could quickly get back to our 8 hour drive back. Would definitely recommend and stay again!"

2023-11-01,5.0,Group trip,Thanks for providing a comfortable and spacious spot for some friends to hang out and catch up.
2023-10-01,5.0,Group trip,"Second time staying here. Love how clean & clutter free it always is, how comfortable beds are & close to everything we can walk. It's usually pretty silent back there, so we were surprised when the house next door was loudly torn down from 5-8 am on a Saturday morning. Contacted Shane who had idea that was happening, who apologized profusely and said he would find out what's going on, but don't think we heard back. Thankfully it was pretty well done after that. Only other thing to mention was I don't know what's going on with that wonderful huge bathtub, but it looks like someone tried to patch it with a moldy green towel. I mean we could shower, but I love taking a bath in that big tub and I just couldn't with that rough nasty looking thing. Hopefully they fix it better soon. Needless to say, we've booked it again for St. Pat's when we'll be back!"
2023-10-01,4.0,Group trip,The beds are super comfy!

Dollar Tree to bowling & a movie 🎬...
our host was awesome. she did a great job in answering an concerns I may had & making us feel like we were right at home..."
2023-09-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,This was the second time we stayed here. It was exactly as we expected. It was just as described.
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great place! Exactly as described. Very grateful.
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This is a wonderful little home away from home. It’s so private and quiet in the neighborhood. Just down from the sheriffs station made me feel very safe. They had all my favorite restaurants near by but others worth trying for sure!
2023-09-01,4.0,Group trip,"We stayed for 3 nights and the place was nice, clean, and peaceful. The beds was uncomfortable because it dips in the middle causing you to sleep close to the edge to keep from rolling, which is very uncomfortable with me having back issues. We also ran out of toilet paper, 6 women and only 2 rolls of toilet paper which cause me to leave at 9pm to go get some. I’ve never booked an Airbnb before but now I know I can ask questions before booking, like location. Overall, the experience was good. The home itself was nice."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Cute place! Super clean!

The location was great. Right about the corner from all the stores and restaurants. My family and I enjoyed our stay at his home!
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,this house worked perfect for our family of 6. the kitchen space is awesome! equipped well with cooking essentials. very nice and clean. we were right in the middle of Rolla just 5 min from most places
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Let me say it was a great stay. The house is fantastic, newly done on the inside. We did have a minor issue with the a/c but Shane was superb in getting it handled quickly. I wish I could get that quick a response at my own home. The location is in the middle of Rolla however it is so quiet and peaceful. I enjoyed having my morning coffee on the back deck just listening to the birds. I look forward to booking this wonderful home again! Thanks Shane!!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Traveled to Fugitive Beach. 10 minute commute to house. Great appliances and well stocked kitchen for cooking. Rooms and beds were comfy for relaxing.
2023-08-01,5.0,Group trip,It was the perfect place to stay! My friends and I were extremely happy with our stay. The notebook full of recommendations of where to eat and things to do was definitely helpful in us finding things to do!!!
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We stayed here for our daughter’s graduation. We traveled 37-45 minutes to the Fort Leonard wood army base. The host was very accommodating for our requests and excellent communication. In addition, to having the house fully stocked with everything needed for a few days stay.
Definitely, would stay here again.
Con: area is mixed used

2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is a lovely home, highly recommend to anyone stopping through or just needing a place!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Nicely renovated and spacious in a convenient location close to many things. After we arrived, our plans slightly changed and we hoped to stay an extra night—luckily there was availability and Shane was totally accommodating. The mattresses do have a bit of a soup bowl shape probably from usage but we slept comfortably regardless. Clean and fairly priced with a responsive host—recommended!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is the 3rd time I've stayed at this home, and I'm sure I will probably stay there again when I visit Rolla. I like the location, because it's so easy to get to and so convenient. It's close to everything, restaurants, stores, etc."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Good Home
2023-06-01,4.0,Group trip,This place was really nice and clean. It was really fun for all of my friends to stay in and the only complaint that I have is there’s no TVs in the room so it was pitch black whenever we were sleeping and it’s by a sheriffs department and abandoned house. But other then that it was a perfect place to stay in!
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Beautiful home. Has everything you need for a perfect getaway. Would absolutely stay here again!!
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I've now stayed at a couple of Shane's properties and are never disappointed! Shane is easy to communicate with and very accommodating with special requests.

I can't wait to be back again."

2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Highly recommend!
2023-05-01,2.0,Stayed one night,There were roaches in this house. When I told Shane he said they were silverfish. I know cock roaches when I see them. My sister-in-laws car was vandalized while we slept which is insane because the house is right across the street from the Sheriff's Dept and a prison. Shane refused a full refund which is fine because I won't be back. Fugitive Beach was fun though.
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This was a great stay for the girls and myself to take a little trip to fugitive beach! Plenty of space and the kitchen was spotless and clean as well as the remainder of the home. The couch was so comfortable me and one of my besties literally just knocked out after our night on it! The other two said the beds where so comfortable too, they haven’t slept like that in a while! Shower has great pressure and they were fully stocked with towels, toilet paper, etc. Overall great stay 10/10! Thanks Shane!"

2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Very cute recently redone home, well done and tasteful remodel with a spacious and comfortable layout. Close proximity to the interstate made it an easy to find, it is listed as North Park street on online directions and that is correct. Loved the large washer and dryer for catching up on vacation laundry and the outdoor deck was so cute and nice to relax on a warm spring night. Kitchen was gorgeous and so fun to cook in all items available and thoughtful snacks like microwave popcorn and water, perfect for a kids movie night and great streaming services for watching shows. Bathroom was spa like with tons of nice fluffy towels and the bedrooms were spacious with comfortable beds and luxurious bedding. Loved the lit battery operated candles all over such a nice touch! Would stay again and recommend to others, thanks for the great stay Shane!"

2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Super nice house, definitely felt like a home away from home while on a 13 hour road trip. Something we noticed and really appreciated was the fact that almost every steaming channel already had a login and a profile dedicated to the guests staying in the Airbnb. It was such a relief to finally get unpacked, put the baby to bed, and just sit on the couch and relax watching a movie without having to go through the trouble of logging into my personal account. It’s a small thing, but it made a difference and set Shane’s place apart from the others. If I’m ever in Rolla again, I’ll definitely be booking with Shane!"
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place is close to everything, easy to find, and always very clean.

Very convenient for getting to Fugitive Beach and close enough to walk to the downtown area for dinner or ice cream. The kitchen is very spacious and had everything we needed.

I loved that the host allowed for last minute and one night bookings. Traveling with several small children, finding an AirBNB with multiple bedrooms is so much better than cramming into a hotel!
The house was close to the interstate, in a quiet area where we felt safe and was perfectly maintained. We had everything we needed for a quick overnight and the price couldn’t be beat."

2022-06-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"We booked last minute on our way through town. It was a quick and easy process to check-in. My daughter enjoyed the wildlife from the deck out back. We slept well with one exception. The a/c thermostat was programmed (I didn’t realize) and changed over sometime during the night or early morning to an 81 degree setting. Consequently, we were a bit warm as we slept so be sure to check that if you’re booking during the summer."

2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We had a great time. Peaceful location for a getaway weekend.
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This place was perfect for a quick night's rest. It was squeaky clean and had everything we needed to crash. I can't remember if it stated in the description that it was a duplex but that always makes me a little stressed because I don't want to disturb others. We got in very late and I just made sure my kids were quiet. I don't think it would have changed my mind and u am glad I chose this place. We would definitely stay again. Also, the national parks decore is great."

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,We stayed in Rolla for a friend's wedding and used Shane's appartment as our homebase for a little over a week.

2023-08-01,3.0,Stayed with kids,"It was great having cold waters and ice ready when we arrived!
The blankets in the living room were a very nice touch!
The back of the TV remote was missing when we arrived.
We saw several little bugs in the kitchen, one dead in a plastic bowl in the cabinet.
There was a slight sewer/mildew type smell through out the house.
The master bathroom was dirty, hair in the shower and on the floor, etc..
The floors/rug throughout needed swept and or vacuumed when we arrived. The beds were pretty uncomfortable. The kitchen and bathrooms had all the necessities."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Perfect for what we needed it for! Very clean, cute, and private. Close to town and where we needed to be. Definitely recommend! Lots of wildlife visited the back yard; which we loved!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This was our first time staying at an Air B&B, and it was the best! Price is comparable to a hotel, and we loved having the extra room to move around as a family. The attached garage was great, the kitchen was stocked with just the right items to be functional, and 2 bathrooms were perfect for 4 people. We plan to come back to Rolla next year and hope this home is available when we do!"

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We enjoyed our stay at Shane’s place. The home was very clean and beautiful. It was far enough out of town to be peaceful and quite, but not too far to drive for dinner."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This was the first time we opted to stay Air BnB in leu of staying at a hotel. Price was comparable to one night at a decent hotel. Instructions were clear, host reached out before our stay, and the accommodations were perfect for what we were looking for. The best part, unbeknownst to us, was the use of the one car garage. There was a storm that came through overnight and my car was protected from the elements. Would definitely stay again."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We were only there for one night. It’s a great alternative than a hotel if traveling with more than two people. The two bedroom, two bath is great. A peaceful setting only a few minutes outside of Rolla."
2023-06-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"When we arrived, the outdoor temperature was about 98 degrees. The unit was clean, precooled, with cold bottled water in the fridge. Much appreciated after a day long drive!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great place, highly recommend!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Shane was the best host I have ever had the pleasure of meeting. Timely responses, clean home, and a beautiful furnished kitchen. My husband was graduating from military police training at ft Leonard wood and I was struggling to find a nice quiet place with a kitchen that would also allow my service dog in training Shiloh since he is not yet fully certified. Shane did the most incredible thing for me by letting me have my family together for the short time that was given to us. It truly was a dream and such a gift! On top of that he went above and beyond by giving us the green light for my sister in laws dog who was supposed to join us but didn’t due to a vet reschedule. If I could give Shane all the stars in the world I would. Thank you again for the amazing experience! Should I come back I know exactly who to book from! Highly recommended!!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,As a first time Air BNB user I could not have been happier with the home. I had a ton of questions and Shane was always quick with a response. The home was very open and made relaxing easy to do without feeling cramped. There were four of us and everything we needed was in the home. The instructions and guidelines were posted and easy to follow (and fair) and the wifi worked great. After long and frenetic days with the extended family this was the perfect place to come back to. And the Misses loved to sit on the back deck and just 'breathe' in the country air; and watch lightning bugs! We will definitely use Shane for our next trip back to Missouri!
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Beautiful house and a relaxing and private atmosphere. I loved the decor, the setting and Shane’s attention to detail and flexibility. I will definitely visit again. Thanks, Shane!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a nice stay in the home. The location and general area is quiet and peaceful. Everything was clean and tidy. The kitchen had all of the basics needed to cook meals and there were plenty of dishes and silverware to use. We enjoyed the coffee and Keurig machine. Having laundry machines was beneficial too. Bathrooms had basic towels and washcloths- if needed guests can wash and reuse towels during their stay. We recommend pillows of your own if you enjoy firm support, the ones provided are very soft and fluffy. AC temperature was comfortable day and night. We would visit again if we return to the area! When we needed to contact Shane, he did respond fairly quickly. We felt the description and prices matched the home and its amenities perfectly."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Very clean and had a lot of extras like coffee, condiments, towels, and several water bottles in the refrigerator. About anything you could ask for. Will definitely stay here again!"
2023-06-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Overall it was a nice stay. Inside was clean (except the bathroom in the hallway, there were ants in the tub). Outside could be cleaned up a bit more but overall decent stay."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This place was outstanding and felt just like home! So thankful Shane was able to help us in such short notice of finding a place to stay and making sure everything went smoothly!! Will definitely be staying here again when traveling!
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Renting from Shane always goes smoothly for our family. He is easy to access and communicate with and very helpful. This is the second time so far in the last 6 months that we’ve rented one of his properties and we were just as pleased as the first time.
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great stay! House was clean and we enjoyed our time there.
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This Airbnb was exactly what I needed for the week! I was in Rolla for work training and wanted a place to stay where I could relax at the end of long field days. Couldn’t have asked for better. The little things (coffee, some extra body wash, bottled water) were very kind, but just the overall atmosphere was great. I am finishing up my Master’s on top of working full time and one night I went outside on the deck with a glass of wine and it was lovely. Exact little break I needed. Thank you Shane!"

2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"After spending years using the overpriced hotels in Rolla, we decided to try a different route. Having a beautiful, private residence in a neatly tucked away neighborhood in the woods was perfect. Shane's place was spacious, clean and comfortable. His special touches with water bottles and flavored coffees were the mark of a true host."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I have stayed here several times, more like 4-5 times. Always awesome stay."

2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Nothing further to add
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great location and Shane was more than friendly and helpful!
2023-03-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,We did not realize this was a duplex so it did not afford the privacy we were looking for as we were staying for 3 nights. The home was clean and nicely remodeled. The neighborhood was quiet. Shane was very responsive!
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I would recommend Shane's listing 100 percent to everyone. Very friendly, the listing looked just like the pictures, and he communicated with me anytime I messaged about anything. I would definitely book with him again."

2023-02-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"I couldn't ask for more... nice place and beautiful, quiet surroundings"
2023-01-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"Overall the place was good. More attention to detail would make this place great. There’s still pencil marks on the tiles in the shower so must not have ever been cleaned thoroughly. But when you find something really dirty it’s very hard to feel like everything else is clean. The rug needed vacuuming. The master bath was not cleaned. There was toothpaste splatter on the mirror and faucet/sink. There was hair in the shower. But worst of all, there was pee running down the side of the toilet that ran next to the toilet and created a pool behind it. 🤢 So gross! It was dried so had been there for a bit. I did let Shane know and he apologized and offered to have someone come the next morning to clean it which was appreciated. But we were only staying one night, leaving in the morning so that was pointless. He didn’t offer to have cleaning fee refunded, or even part of it. Might give it another chance if we are in the area."

2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"We stayed a month and it was the perfect home away from home. Quite, peaceful and relaxing. We had deer visiting every day. We were sad to leave."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Mossman Cottage is utterly enchanting. It sits at the end of a quiet street in the midst of a large shaded yard bordering a quiet field where does and their fawns silently meander out of the woods and bird song fills the air. Amy and Barbara have put a lot of thought into their guests’ comfort from the throws and recliners in the living room and a large closet in the main living space where one can easily store things out of sight, to plenty of linens in the large bathroom, to extra blankets and fans in the bedrooms, and plenty of dishes in the kitchen. They were prompt with replies to all of my questions and check-in was very easy. Everything felt welcoming and homey. While the step up and down between rooms and the steep stairs to the adorable second bedroom under the eaves aren’t for those with mobility challenges, it does add to the cottage’s charm, and I wholeheartedly recommend this stay to absolutely everyone else."

2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Was my first booking as a single father where my son ( 15 ) and I stayed multiple nights somewhere away from home. We were in Rolla to turkey hunt in the Mark Twain forest and what a nice place the cottage was to kick back during the timeout period that Missouri has after 1pm for turkey hunting. The cottage had an old timey feel to it and was very convenient to everything in Rolla and close to the interstate for easy travel to annd from each day. I definitely recommend a stay here for those traveling in this area.

The location was great and the price was a good deal for what I needed. I really enjoyed the large bathroom, the cute kitchen area, and cozy living area. I also enjoyed the decor and vintage feel.

2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Amy and Barb’s cabin was totally amazing. A nice relaxing weekend getaway just off the beaten path enough to feel like you’re away from the city. Lots of great places to eat nearby and it’s also great for checking out some wildlife. Lots of deer sightings right out in the yard and some sweet visits from some neighborhood cats that come by for snuggles. The cabin is clean and well stocked with amenities. We will definitely be back.

2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"great listing, easy to get in, and comfortable stay"
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Mossman Cottage was great. The lockbox was a bit of a challenge - Amy's directions were exactly right but we needed to take a closer look at the box to find out that just the combination plate and not more of the box released
The cottage was very comfortable-- the quiet location and front porch for watching the deer were just as pictured. We also appreciated the TV and wi-fi connection option when we felt the need to reconnect for a bit. The choice for air conditiioning or open windows was perfect for the time we were there.
We did not use the 2nd floor bedroom (although I did have to at least check it out just because it was there). The single steps to access the kitchen from either the main room and bedroom were not a problem at all and added to the charm. We would definitely consider returning if we are in the area.
Thanks, Amy, for everything."
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The cottage is even more then you’ll expect from the deer in the woods to the tater patch down the road! This place is definitely an amazing place to stay at. It’s in town but you feel so secluded. 10 stars!

Nice shady spots to park under trees. It is in town but you feel like you are in the country. There is a nice long walking/biking trail just a block or two away that I enjoyed in the evening (despite the heat!).
Upon entry, you'll notice the entire place is very clean. The internet is strong so I was able to work. The bed was comfortable. The bathroom is large with great shower.

Going to five guests created an additional fee we were willing to pay, and we didn't realize the additional fee request got sent to email.

If i could rate this house and it's host more than 5 stars i would. Forgot to mention we were 3 adult women's staying at this house and we felt extremely safe the whole time!! Everything is close, shopping, restaurants. Well is just perfect.. if i come back to Missouri this is were i will be staying... thank you Ammy and Barbara"
2021-09-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"Comfy stay in a beautiful, peaceful location... so much more restful than a hotel when road tripping across I-44. We enjoyed coffee on the porch and morning yoga outside with three curious neighbor kittens. There are nice walks right from the property in addition to the Audubon center a short drive away, past the campus. Host was always available online :)"

2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"We had a great 10 day stay in this quiet neighborhood cottage. When we arrived 2 deer were there to greet us near our front door and fireflies flickered in the back yard. We really liked the park and path that was very close by. Amy was attentive and we had no problems during the stay. When we are back in Rolla, we hope to be able to book again!"

2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is a perfect house for a family or group of 2-4. It is a very clean, spacious, and quiet place to stay. It has all of your common household needs and then some. It was close enough to many wonderful activities, restaurants, and grocery stores. It was also located in a great area, where you can see a lot of wildlife while also conveniently close to the city. I would recommend this place if you are looking for something that is both welcoming and well designed.
Thank you for such a great experience."

2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Amy's cottage is darling! Quiet, peaceful, and charming -- a perfect getaway spot. I'm so happy we lucked into it being available on a Saturday night. The location was terrific; tucked away, yet a short walk to dinner at a local brewery and ice cream after. We had everything we needed and will definitely return!"
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Great visit! Nice location, good size, etc"
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Wow!! Best place ever! This cottage was my office for a week while my daughter was at sleep away camp. It was perfect. Internet was crazy fast, I took numerous video calls without issue. Lots of natural light and wildlife to help your sanity while on business calls. Very quiet and peaceful yet close enough to town for errands. I felt extremely safe, yet was still tucked into a park. There is a gorgeous running/nature trail steps away as well as a playground for your kiddos. Loved it and hope to be back."
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,You can expect a excellent experience and comfortable stay. Highly recommend

2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The stay was great. We really appreciate how clean and cozy. Our second day, we drove in to find 2 deer and 2 fawn frolicking on the lawn. The birds singing and the fireflies at night.... So nice, I would definitely recommend for a nice quiet retreat."

2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This is the perfect place to stay if you are heading through Missouri and want to stay for a night OR if you wanted to take in the sights for a few days! Rolla is great, the cottage is conveniently located but with room to breathe, and the hosts were quick to reply and so hospitable! We loved it - cute and comfortable. Thank you!!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was a beautiful place in beautiful surroundings. The beds were very comfortable and high end. It felt very homey. Judy was friendly and attentive.
We also used the wedding venue on the site. This is where this property really shines. Judy, the owner had so much attention to detail from the day we booked all the way up to the wedding date. We chose the mini wedding & we never once felt like we got “lesser” service because we didn’t choose a large package. On wedding day, Judy was easily accessible. She anticipated our needs and seemed to show up wherever we needed her. Everything was perfect from the airb&bs to the wedding venue. I would recommend The Village to anyone!! Love love loved it!!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Accommodations for our family were very desirable. Kids enjoyed the outdoors.

Judy was a great host, accessible and accommodating even as we arrived in a gullywasher downpour of rain! Highly recommended! (Also recommend Randy’s Roadkill BBQ nearby!)"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The bungalow was beautifully done with rooms that were equipped with everything we needed. We had a great stay.
We did not understand why we could not unload the cars in front of the bungalow. Perhaps a short explanation would have helped us understand the reason.
Also, just out of curiosity, we were hoping to learn a bit more of the history of the intriguing site of The Village."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Great property and fun scenery.

2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Judy is a fabulous host! She was SO helpful and recommended great restaurants and things to do and we were glad we took her up on those suggestions. This was a wonderful, peaceful place to stay and the house was so well appointed! Everything you can imagine you might need is already there waiting and the decor is fabulous and comfortable. The beds were comfortable and linens are excellent and high end - so comfortable! This is such a unique and quaint “village”and atmosphere! Made the stay so much fun. We had a great time walking and exploring and enjoying nature and the beautiful surroundings. I even messed up on my reservation dates and Judy was SO accommodating. We loved our trip and can’t wait to visit there many times more in the future!"
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,A wonderful place to stay in Rolla and a great host.
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,This was our second stay at the Blacksmith and it did not disappoint. It’s a comfortable place in a peaceful location. The place is immaculate and exceptionally well appointed. We definitely are looking forward to our next stay!
2023-12-01,5.0,Group trip,"The place was amazing our family was very pleased. Our geust we had over was amazed by the veiw of the place and the Black smith cabin that we stayed in. We stayed there for a graduation, but it is an awesome place to get Married."

2023-11-01,5.0,Group trip,Judy was very friendly and the place was amazing! We were very pleased with this property!
2023-11-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"The Blacksmith is a nice place for a small group. It’s a tiny space not really for more than 5 people. While it sleeps 6, the kitchen and living area are small but the only place to be together and it’s tiny. The kitchen was well stocked with dishes and supplies as were the bathrooms. The ice maker in the fridge malfunctioned and dumped ice all over the floor the first day, not sure if the fridge is tricky or what. The newer throw blankets were a nice touch."
2023-10-01,5.0,Group trip,Our stay was fantastic! The area was beautiful I wish we could've stayed longer.
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The Blackstone and the entire Village is an amazing place!! We had my son's wedding there and it was PERFECT!!!

2023-09-01,5.0,Group trip,Nice furnishings and amenities. Clean and comfortable
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Just what we needed for a little family get away!
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Everything was lovely.
The kitchen was well stocked with everything you could think of to cook a meal. House was spacious."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"GLITZ AND GLAM!!!!!! The Blacksmith Bungalow is a whole lot of Beverly and a touch of Hillbilly. Inside, it's very spacious, super-duper modern, gorgeous, and extremely fancy. It's chock-full of cool games and the Roku TV has tons of entertainment options, plus the internet is exceptionally fast... For the most part, it makes up for the near-total lack of cell service. It was beyond clean and the bedding was possibly the most comfortable I've ever experienced *anywhere*, no joke! The Village is a very peaceful, secluded location and shockingly close to the billion or so amenities available in lovely Rolla. The gravel roads are a bit rough but a standard car can handle it if you drive with care. PLEASE do know that it is NOT lit at night and VERY hard to navigate in the dark; in daylight, the signs are handy. I forgot my fishing pole, but the pond would've been an awesome place to fish if I had brought it. Would recommend for a quiet, beautiful stay!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Group trip,Nice place in peaceful setting!
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"The Blacksmith’s Bungalow is amazing! The accommodations are as described, and because of Judy’s excellent directions, was easy to find! Judy’s directions were actually much better than our GPS!
The accommodation’s were as described, but even better. Judy has special little touches which made our stay even better. The beds and pillows were unbelievably comfortable!
Judy was extremely responsive to our questions and responded within a few minutes!
This is a fabulous place to stay. You won’t be disappointed!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Had an outstanding time at the Blacksmith home! Very peaceful. We overslept on our first morning as we were just so comfortable and relaxed! Cant say enough good things. Will certainly come back to visit in the fall as it would be so pretty there! Home was as described. Judy was there for our every need and very responsive. 5 stars all around
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,The Blacksmith Bungalow was very clean and beautifully decorated. The surroundings are beautiful and peaceful as well. The reviews I read made it seem like it had a fenced yard so I was a little disappointed that it didn’t. (I think maybe the reviews for all the rentals are collected in one place on the airbnb site and I didn’t realize that). Even so it was a great experience and we’d love to stay again soon.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,This place is absolutely adorable! My 14 year old son (who is all boy) even mentioned how well it's decorated. It had more than what we needed and everything was comfortable. Hope we can come back!
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"This is truly a hidden gem. We've experienced many airbnb's in Rolla while visiting our daughter, but this one is a cut above the norm. It's in an incredibly beautiful, quiet, and serene setting. There is nothing to compare with sitting on the porch swing, watching the sunset while the windmill lazily twirls around. The Blacksmith cottage is 100% up to date with sparkly clean appliances, a well-equipped kitchen, comfortable furniture and beds. and little touches - hot cocoa mix, biscotti, and popcorn provided for guests. It has everything you expect in 2023 with the rustic look of the 1800's. Judy was an absolutely fantastic host and was extremely communicative. We absolutely loved our stay, and hope that it will be available for future visits."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Judy and Jim have a charming lil place. Probably my favorite! We felt like we were at home. The place is impeccable and very clean and organized. This coming from an organized perfectionist. Very friendly people were around either working on the property or staying in another place. I highly recommend their places. You can’t go wrong! Thank you for sharing it with us!
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This place was amazing! Everything was exactly as listed but more than we expected! The location was perfect and peaceful! I would highly recommend this location especially if you’re wanting to escape the hustle and bustle of the city, yet not being so far away from the amenities of city life!if I had any questions Judy was extremely quick to respond!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Awesome place, will stay again"
2023-07-01,5.0,Group trip,We enjoyed our stay at the Blacksmith Bungalow. The place is relaxing and it is peaceful location. Thank you providing a full kitchen. Everything was great!
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We enjoyed our stay at the Blacksmith Bungalow. Our party of 5 adults had plenty of room. Kitchen was well stocked, beds were comfortable, and it was super clean. The bungalow was near a couple other cabins ( would be perfect for a big family vacation as everyone could have their own space) but we had plenty of privacy. We would stay again."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Absolutely my favorite stay yet! Thank you for the fishing and firewood! Great memories with my son 🎣
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,I stayed here with my family over the 4th of July to enjoy a nice peaceful getaway and it was perfect. Beautiful and remote enough that we didn’t hear very much noise over the holiday but was still close enough to restaurants to get food quickly. Would stay here again in a heartbeat and highly recommend this location!
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Judy thought of EVERYTHING. More than enough bath linens, kitchen ready for anything, comfy beds, & rustic-elegance in the decor. A great place to relax in peace or crash at the end of an activity-filled day!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Group trip,Great stay. Would definitely come back.
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We enjoyed our stay at the Blacksmith Bungalow. Everything was clean and refreshing. There was plenty to keep you busy during your down time such as firepit, pond, creek, and just wandering the grounds. This place is absolutely beautiful. I hope we get an opportunity to stay here again."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We very much enjoyed our stay at The Blacksmith cabin. The cabin was just as beautiful (and cozy) as it appeared in the pictures. The place was impeccably clean and decorated beautifully. We felt right at home with all of the amenities offered. We especially enjoyed the beds - they were SO comfortable. The front porch swing was the perfect way for us to relax and enjoy the evenings after our kids went to bed. The ONLY thing I would recommend is that a new kitchen sponge be provided. There was a sponge that had previously been used left for us. It was not the end of the world, but it wasn’t my ideal scenario. Other than that, it was perfect."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful place to stay. Pleasantly surprised there was coffee, filters, cream and sugar provided. Oatmeal, microwave popcorn, and biscotti were an unexpected bonus. Plenty of towels, comfortable beds, and we felt right at home. Beautifully decorated, and a quaint charm all of its own. You can’t go wrong with this get away. Thanks for great weekend."

2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,I was very impressed with the location. The directions were good and Judy was very proactive with instructions. Beautiful venue there as well. Will come back to visit again someday.
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"The Blacksmith house is incredible! The entire property is beautiful, peaceful and so very interesting! Judy and Jim have a gem of a property and they have worked hard to create a top notch location with 4 homes of various sizes to rent. Each home is spotless and stunningly decorated with every amenity you would need. The homes are spread apart and surrounded by woods so each home is very private. A perfect location to get away from it all with family and extended family. An easy drive to MS&T. They even host weddings and special events. Our student has graduated but we will be back again to visit our favorite spot at The Village! Thanks for all of the wonderful memories at The Blacksmith!!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"This is our second stay at the Blacksmith, and I said this then, and it's still true--Judy is the host I judge all other hosts by. She sets the standard. Judy has thought of everything from the well-stocked larder to the extra towels and blankets. And the property is magical. Birds are singing, incredible sunsets, and for introverts like us, privacy and peace."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Our favorite place to stay! We just love everything about The Blacksmith House and The Village! Our hosts Judy and Jim are just wonderful! We had a last minute change and Judy was very quick to respond and accommodate! Thanks again and can’t wait to come back!!
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"One of the best air bnbs I’ve stayed at! The place was even better than the photos and we greatly enjoyed the quiet setting with tons of room to roam and enjoy the forest and creek area. Really cool unique setting.
We really appreciated the tankless water heater with 2 teenage girls and 2 preteens along with us. The front porch was so comfortable and welcoming."
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,What an absolutely immaculate property and home. We were in awe of the area and the stunning forest. Judy and Jim are such fantastic hosts and we hope to return very soon. I would recommend this place over and over again.
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We had a wonderful stay. They supplied everything needed, surprised by everything that was supplied! It would be a wonderful place to hold a wedding, family reunion or any large get together."
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"The properties that Judy and Jim offer are beyond incredible! Beautiful surroundings, private, peaceful and relaxing outside. Squeaky clean, impeccably furnished and decorated, fully stocked, and so very homey. We have stayed many times and always look forward to our next stay! Can’t wait to come back!!

We recommend it to anyone looking for a getaway! We can’t wait to visit again."
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"A nice place just outside of Rolla, with access to all that the town has just minutes away. Perfect stay for a weekend getaway"
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"The place was wonderful. Great location that felt away from everything It was a great spot to spend time with family at a slower pace. Judy was very accommodating when it come to us bringing our small dog “Molly” and communicated well with us, even making a personal visit to let us know that the internet was going to be down for just a little bit. We would recommend this place to others who just want to get away and enjoy a scenic and private location to spend with family or just each other."
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Judy is very responsive. The house is very clean with a beautiful fireplace. We enjoy our stay here. Will reconsider next time

2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Our family had a wonderful stay. The home was more than big enough for 4 humans and 1 dog. I wish we had a longer visit!
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"If I could give 6 stars I would! We stayed at the Blacksmith for 4nights/5days for my son’s MP graduation at Fort Leonardwood. It was a wonderful escape from base for our Marine, plenty of space to relax, play board games, throw the football outside, go for long walks with our 4month old puppy and even had a fire in the fire pit one evening with wood provided! The kitchen is fully stocked and even included complimentary breakfast items, coffee and hot cocoa, even popcorn! The washer/dryer are incredibly high tech and require NO detergent or dryer sheets! And your clothes come out clean and smelling fresh! Judy was very quick to return my enquires. She went above and beyond letting us check in early and check out late due to my son’s graduation schedule. She even set me up with a dog walker from her staff while we were out for Family Day. I can’t rave enough about this place and Judy. It truly allowed our family of 4 to have a long over due wonderful mini vaca."

We loved the railroad tracks! What a perfect little getaway! The host was so responsive to message and we appreciated the whole experience!"
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Such a beautiful and relaxing home not to mention the scenery of the property. Judy thought of everything, and the blacksmith was the perfect cozy setup for our young family of six. Even down to the small size fold up crib and sheets in the closet. Our relatives stayed in the large ‘log cabin’ on the property so we didn’t run out do things to do since we were together. Would recommend to anyone looking for a place to just chill and watch the kids explore while you rock on the front porch!"
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The Blacksmith Shop is in a beautiful setting in a quiet area off the beaten path. The house had everything we needed for our stay. Would recommend and we would stay there again if in the area.

2022-07-01,5.0,Group trip,Great home for rent. Very clean and host very responsive. It is “remote” which we like and prefer. Nice and quiet. We’ll stay again when in the area.
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Such a unique setup- I believe it’s a wedding venue. You feel like you’re on a movie set, almost! It’s a rural location, less than 10 minutes off the highway. There is a steep-ish gravel hill, so we struggled pulling the boat up it (but, we made it!) I would definitely stay here again. It was clean, had a great layout, and had ample items for our stay!"
2022-07-01,5.0,Group trip,This was a great place to just get away and have a fun weekend with your friends. I highly recommend coming here! Bring some bug spray though there’s a few mosquitoes out there.

2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Judy‘s home was wonderful she had everything you could possibly need. She even was thoughtful enough to include a first aid kit, emergency candles, everything I could possibly think of even seasonings for food and supplied coffee, Cream and sugar. Which I could not have been more thankful for. The home was amazing but the surroundings was excellent as well. I walked around for a long time just taking beautiful pictures. Her communication was excellent we had many changes and she was gracious enough to accommodate all of them. Truly worth every penny. The beds are comfortable everything is so clean. I don’t have enough good things to say to express the wonderful experience we had. I truly recommend this place. My daughter and I would love to come back to this place again. Oh The front porch swing was wonderful. It was so quiet and tranquil there. Definitely must experience this. We highly recommend it."

2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Absolutely incredible place! Fully recommend for anyone looking for something nicer in the Rolla area.
The entire Village is full of neat little structures, including bridges, gazebos, a mini train station, a lake, and more. We stayed at The Blacksmith which had a cute, themed outside and was completely modern and beautiful inside. The fireplace was a nice feature and the kitchen was well-equipped. We will absolutely return next time we go to Rolla. FIVE STARS!!!"
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Amazing place once again, will stay again when In area"

2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Awesome place, will be back"
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The blacksmith shop is an amazing place to stay! It’s beautiful very well-kept and very relaxing. Judy was extremely easy to work with and very communicative.
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Perfection. Celebrated our S&T graduate and enjoyed a family Christmas in the same weekend! We all loved the Blacksmith and the charm of the entire property!
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The Blacksmith shop is a short ride north of Rolla. Located in a recreated western village, it is a terrific place to get away for a few days or to host a special event. The Location is quaint and peaceful, and the Blacksmith shop is clean and well furnished. All the aminities that you could want or need are available. I have stayed in the ""shop"" several times while working in the area over the past year... and for multiple days. Nothing else comes close for the surroundings and the price!! Kitchen/ Baths/ Beds are new, clean and Judy is wonderful. So dont hesitate.... or it will be booked...."
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,A beautiful place to relax and enjoy. Secluded but close enough to town to run and get whatever you may need. 35 minutes to the main gate of Fort Leonard Wood.
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This was such a wonderful stay the area is very beautiful and relaxing. The owners were beyond accommodating and very much available if we needed anything. We will definitely be back for sure!
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Pictures do not do this rental or property justice!! The location is about 5/10 minutes from downtown Rolla - Judy provides detailed instructions on driving into the location, as it is a sharp right at the bottom of a hill. Be careful - there are a couple HUGE potholes as you turn in. You will drive through the entire property to get to the rental - it is so cute, a wedding would be beautiful here. Make sure you take some time to walk around and check things out. There is ample parking and even doggie doo bags on the shed next door! Cute porch. Inside, everything was SO clean. Cute living area with fireplace, very well stocked kitchen, even Disney+ for the TV! Very nice laundry area, well-appointed bathrooms and bedrooms. Comfy beds with lots of bedding/comforters/blankets - everything you could want if you are someone that is cold all the time like me :) I wish we were staying a whole week, not just a quick weekend. The only negative at all is that the 'master' bathroom shower - the way the door opens, you have to get a little wet to turn the shower on. And the showerhead is nice, but lacking pressure, so ladies with long hair, it will take you a while. If those are the worst parts about this place though, you know you found a good one! There was even Kleenex, which has been unheard of in Airbnbs I've stayed in (it's the little things, I tell ya). Can't wait to come back for a slightly longer stay next year!!"
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The Blacksmith was perfect for our girls weekend! Everything about the place was wonderful and cozy. We had the perfect weekend. Judy really is a super host and check in and out was so easy!
I loved this place for a nice relaxing weekend with friends."

2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Everything is amazing! It’s a very nice area and the house is absolutely adorable!
The owner is incredibly responsive and kind.
The house has a lot of added touches. There is an air purifying system and water treatment system. There are natural soaps at every sink.
There showers are nice with plenty of hot water. The beds and pillows are very comfortable and there is an abundance of pillows and blankets.
There is fishing in a pond there where we caught a few fish.
This is a very pet friendly area. My dog loved it!
There wasn’t a thing I didn’t like."
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is a hidden gem for those looking for a quiet getaway in mid-Missouri! The bungalow is updated with all the modern amenities and finishing touches. The bed was comfortable, and the front porch was the perfect retreat for a relaxing evening. Check-in was easy and the host was very communicative. We would definitely recommend and return!"
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,The place was amazing! The location was very pretty and the Airbnb is very well decorated and maintained. My husband kept saying he loved the rustic elegance!

2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Beautiful home, only 35 mins away from Ft Leonard Wood Army base. We wanted to give our Soldier a home feeling environment for the couple of hours he was allowed off the base. He was very much looking forward to taking a warm shower, and his Mom’s cooking. Made some Mexican green pozole and steaks on the grill. Highly recommended!"
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Love the three bedrooms and two bathrooms. The stay was comfortable for four people or more. Great property for a morning walk and close to town. Had everything we needed.
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Nothing but wonderful things to say! Kind and hospitable hosts. They allowed us our privacy. The home was beautiful and my boys had a wonderful time!
2021-09-01,5.0,Group trip,This is an amazing and fun rental. We stayed here for a bachelor party and played D&D and hung out on the porch. It was clean and had enough space for us guys.
2021-09-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,This is a nice place set away from the busy city life. It was a nice time of rest that is always needed in our lives.
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Amazing stay!!!! So quiet. I fell asleep on the porch swing. The place is immaculate. Such a fun adventure. Perfect spot to spend our Family Day with my son during Basic training.
2021-08-01,5.0,Group trip,"The Blacksmith Bungalow was absolutely perfect for our family of 5 adults! The kitchen was fully stocked with anything we might need, and we really enjoyed spending time on the front porch. Everything was extremely clean when we arrived, and Judy quickly responded to questions. We happily recommended it to other family members nearby!"
2021-08-01,5.0,Group trip,"My family and I had an amazing time at this adorable home.

2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Nice place. Clean. Judy was great to deal with.
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,My family and I stayed here to visit with my son for Family Day and Graduation Day from FLW. The location was convenient took us about 35 minutes to get to FLW and we had a nice 3 bedroom 2 bath home that also accommodated our dog for the 4 days that we were there! The Blacksmith bungalow was very comfortable and had everything you would need. The Village is a unique stay. Unfortunately the heat index the week we stayed was +100 So we didn’t get to enjoy the outside and exploring too much! But The home had an excellent AC system and my son got to enjoy relaxing with his family and of course on his phone!
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Beautiful, peaceful cabin with modern finishes. Rocking chairs on the front porch to relax. Fully equipped kitchen with the little extras to make it feel more like home. There are seasonings, coffee, coffee creamer, condiments, oatmeal packets and even biscotti. That was so nice to have if you wanted or needed it. The bed was so comfortable that I am going to buy one for my own home. Also, it was great that there was a nice portable crib bc we had an 8 month old with our group. This is the first place I have stayed that I did not feel the need to clean w my sanitizer wipes, too. Can't say enough good things about this cabin. We will definitely be back."
2021-08-01,5.0,Group trip,"Absolutely perfect. The bungalow is charming, sparkling clean and in a gorgeous area. The hosts are sweet, and very accommodating. One of the BEST Airbnbs our group has stayed in."
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is one of the best properties we've ever stayed at -- pastoral, woodsy but minutes from town, fun, quaint, and well-maintained. The beds were luxurious, the house well-appointed, and the host, Judy, friendly, helpful, and respectful of our privacy. We were in town to celebrate my father's 90th birthday with family from all over the country, and when we showed them pictures of where we were staying, they were jealous. Next time, one of them is going to snap it up before we get a chance to book. Don't miss your chance. If you're looking for accommodations in the Rolla area, the Bunkhouse Bungalow is where you want to stay."
2021-07-01,5.0,Group trip,"Peace and quiet and a quality home make for a special stay. Very easy check-in with all the amenities - and more - of home. The swing was my porch favorite. Inside, the home is spacious. It easily accommodates the family and there is room to spread out inside, and then open the front door and you have all the outside space. The one twin bed has a trundle. The washer & dryer are new and modern. The refrigerator is roomy. Hard floors throughout. The beds and couch were comfortable. Kitchen table seats 8. Simple instructions make your stay easy. It is tucked away off a winding road with the town of Rolla accessible in about 15 minutes. Wish we had had more downtime to simply be in the house! A+ accommodations and host!"
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Perfect location for a family vacation for anything in the Rolla area. Hosts were amazing. Communication with step by step directions for everything could not have been better. The pictures still do not do this place justice. Make sure you stop at Randy's Roadkill BBQ, just 3 minutes up the road, on the way to and from Rolla."
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"the pictures do not do this place justice, it was fabulous. the owners thought of every little detail. it was so clean and beds were amazing!"
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We had a lovely time staying at this beautiful bungalow! The place was incredibly clean and tidy and the kitchen had everything we needed. We also enjoyed walking around the property and sitting on the porch. It was very quiet and peaceful, which was just what we needed as we took our first vacation with our young baby. Judy was incredibly quick to respond to questions and check-in was very easy. We would love to stay again and would recommend the place without hesitation!"
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This property is beautiful and quiet. It was the perfect little getaway for me and my friends. We explored the grounds and enjoyed nature. The hosts are kind and very accommodating. We would definitely love to stay again.

2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Great place! Peaceful be calming. A bit of wilderness yet close to town.
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"A great family or couples retreat. We rented both the Bungalow and Victoria for a family Holiday weekend with our adult kids and grandkids. There is no skimping on practical items on hand. We had a wonderful time. The homes and grounds have both a contemporary and rustic feel with a fun history. Something for everyone. In addition, Judy and Jim have made improvements since acquiring ownership and now offer facility for wedding events with additional development currently underway and a vision for even more enhancements in the future. I will enjoy checking back to see photos of progress and we will absolutely consider coming back for another stay."
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The house is beautiful and had everything we needed. We loved sitting out on the front porch watching and listening to the birds.
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Amazing!!!! Best AirBnB we’ve stayed in EVER. The property is stunning! Firepit, creek, wooded area!! So much room to roam and explore. Our kids had a blast playing in the “town” and exploring. We literally booked another stay while we were still there!! Loved relaxing on the porch while the kids ran around and played. Incredibly clean, well stocked, COMFORTABLE beds, and fantastic host communication."
2021-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"What an unexpected gem in the heart of Missouri! Rolla was the best place for us to stop on a long roadtrip after a 12-hour day of driving, and we could not have been happier with our decision to stay here! The directions were clear so we had no problem finding it, and we were in for a treat! The old Western Town vibe was amazing, and the Blacksmith was beyond our expectations. Sparkling clean - seriously, I can't even describe how clean the place was - and so beautifully decorated. Our pup loved the concrete floors - he ran laps down the hallway and around the kitchen table (gleeful to not be in the car anymore!) - and we humans loved the comfortable couch, fireplace and omg the amenities! Shower...excellent. Washer/Dryer...so convenient. Beds? Dreamland.
We cannot recommend this stay highly enough. BOOK IT!"
2021-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This was such a unique and great stay. The land is beautiful and Judy was such a nice host and helped us when we got lost. The stay was super quiet which we appreciated and we loved that we got to take our fur baby. Will defiantly come back for another visit.

2021-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This quaint village was a wonderful refuge from City life. Perfectly located, not too far from town/gas/grocery. The place was spotless! Beds were very comfy. Judy and Jim provided everything you need! We will definitely be coming back!!"
2021-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We had an absolute wonderful stay at the Blacksmith. A truly private and serene setting provided a perfect backdrop for our family getaway. Our kids are close to 8, 6, 4 and 2, and they all agree that sitting on the porch swing and running around exploring the grassy area in front of the house were their favorite parts (our pup shared their sentiments). The home is clean, cozy and has very comfortable beds. The small touches were truly going above and beyond to make this rental feel like home. This is a unique place with top accommodations, and we are grateful to have had the opportunity to visit. You won't be disappointed. :)"
2021-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Clean and very comfortable place.
2021-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Loved the property! Very relaxing and so unique. The bungalow exceeded our expectations. Tastefully decorated and nice touches. Just was great and very responsive to all our needs. Great getaway for some R&R.
2021-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The Blacksmith was very stylish and a great place to stay. The property is so unique and peaceful. Really enjoyed sitting on the front porch, watching the windmill turn, and enjoying the scenery of the old west town."

2021-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful place. Nice and clean. Comfy beds. Great property. Peaceful and relaxing. We will definitely be back.
2021-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"My family and I came down to explore the area and meet up with my sister, who lives in Springfield, MO. We chose this place because of its themed charm and wooded location. The property is absolutely gorgeous. The little village scene is picturesque and gave my three kids plenty of ideas for their imaginations to play with. The house was beautiful, exactly how I would want my dream home to look. We had plenty of room for 6 people and had every ""home away from home"" amenity that we would ever need. The house was clean and well-cared for. We could have stayed there forever if could! Thank you Judy and Jim for being so hospitable and kind to my family. We felt right at home. We are already planning another trip down and will be staying at the Blacksmith's Shop."
2021-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This place was amazing . We were only looking for a getaway but this was so much more.

2021-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This space is so unique and beautiful! The fireplace kept us toasty during the below zero temps of our trip and our young daughters were excited to bundle up and go explore during the sunshine hours of the day! Judy was extremely helpful with local tips and thoughtful of party as our trip proceeded! If you're looking for a unique and relaxed stay, this is the place!"
2021-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Great location!!
Modern amenities!
Secluded yet safe (located on 53+ acres).
Super comfy beds!
We will definitely be back...
Great for parents of MS&T students or anyone passing through the famous Route 66.
Beautiful woods on every side and honestly feels like you’re staying in an old western town with modern amenities."
2021-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This enchanting space is a traveler's or vacationer's dream! Clean and tidy, well stocked and comfortable, it offered every thing we could possibly need on our trip through Missouri. Our family enjoyed several walks around the beautiful grounds and slept soundly in the comfortable beds. We give this place five stars and a standing ovation!"
2021-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Private, secluded, peaceful, great get away!"
,,,"Absolutely terrible experience at this place! The house looks super cute in photos, but it wasn’t a very clean place. There were dead bugs, TONS of cobwebs in the basement where the washer and dryer are, you walk face first into them trying to do laundry. The washer smelled of mildew and musky. My daughter was grossed out by dried food on the utensils and we had to go buy a brillo pad to scrub down a pan with burnt food on it. The house was hot, I had to turn the air way down to 66 just to cool it down so I could sleep. You’d set it and it would turn itself back up to 75. We all woke up hot and kept having to change the thermostat. This happened the entire stay. I wasn’t going to write a review at all, until I got a $500 request for damages that we didn’t create. There was a lamp in one of the bedrooms that never worked and at the end of our stay when we stripped the sheets, I bumped the lamp with my leg and the whole shade and lightbulb fell off. When I looked at it, I could see wires hanging out and could see where a gray putty had been used to repair the bulb. When I was sent photos of the lamp and lightbulb, you could see the putty so there’s my proof of it being previously damaged. I actually had to unscrew the entire lamp to get everything to go back together. I did not break the lamp, and it definitely wasn’t worth $200 that I was accused of. I was also accused of knocking a hole in the wall which did not happen, and was requested $300 to patch a tiny little hole that you could fix with some $5 spackling and a coat of paint. Absolutely ridiculous experience and I’d never return!"
