2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We loved our stay here while in Helena for a wedding - very peaceful and relaxing by the creek with the hot tub & outdoor seating in the mountain setting. Truly the Montana vibe! The hosts were very responsive. Great stay!
2024-06-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"We loved the location of our Airbnb and how secluded it felt. It was very clean and the hot tub was a nice touch. The only room for improvement would probably have been the shower. We had a hard time with the consistency of the water temperature as well as the water pressure as it was just trickling down. Other than that, we enjoyed our stay and enjoyed the beautiful scenery around the Airbnb."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"After a long day, we got burgers just 2 minutes up the road. Then we checked into the absolutely spectacular brand new modern, private, tiny-but-didn't-feel-tiny home. It's right off the mountain road, but once you were inside or in the yard you barely noticed. (And not a lot of traffic on a Saturday-Sunday stay!) The creek sound was so soothing, and the wildlife was a nice treat. My daughter roasted all the marshmallows at the fire pit without sharing, so although my son and I were mad about that, you made her happy. The stars up there... just wow. Thank you Kallie for being quick and responsive. You made my Mother's Day extra special!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Kallie, was very responsive and accommodating."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Thank you so much it was so clean and nice! We appreciated it!! We will be back!
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This spot is an ideal vacation getaway nestled right inside Helena's National Forest. My fianc√© and I were blown away by the privacy, seculsion, and magnificent views offered by this property. The house is spacious and adorable, we cooked so many meals together here. We made memories that will last a lifetime around the fire pit, lounging in the hot tub, and dancing in the kitchen! If you're visiting Helena, don't pass this up!!
P.S. The hosts are so accommodating and responsive, they ensured we had the absolute best trip experience every step of the way <3"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Second time coming back and I hope it won‚Äôt be the last. Highly recommend
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great place for a weekend getaway!
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had an amazing stay at Kallie's place. Our favorite part was soaking in the hot tub along the rushing creek. Mountain chickadees, downy/hairy woodpeckers and robins kept us entertained, as well as the neighbor's friendly and acrobatic cat. If you're looking for a hike nearby, we definitely recommend Trout Creek Canyon!
The only downside was the low water pressure in the shower. Plan on being in there for a bit after your soaking sessions."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We stayed 2 nights with our grandkids at Kallie‚Äôs place and loved it! Our grans loved the loft area and the hot tub by the creek. The place was clean and well stocked in a great location. Highly recommend!
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This place was lovely. From the creek running through the property to the warm, cozy interior of the home, I am impressed. Beautiful attention to detail throughout! Kallie was wonderful to work with and the entire process was seamless.

No cell service but great wifi, if needed.
They have everything there that you may need: coffee, tea, oatmeal, shampoo/conditioner/body wash/lotion, make up remover, towels, extra blankets, fan.
Such a clean and new feel, with being right in the middle of the mountains. Creek, picnic area, and bonfire out back to enjoy.
10/10 RECOMMEND!"

The host was a true gem, going above and beyond to make us feel welcome. Their warmth and hospitality added an extra layer of joy to my trip. She was quick and responsive and very flexible even when booking last minute.

The studio apt was very clean with all needed amenities and several thoughtful features and provisions. Located in a nice neighborhood with easy off street parking right at your door. Easy walk to the Capitol and local businesses while also ready access to a network of hiking trails at the end of a short cul-de-sac across the street.

2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place is small but very comfortable, easy launching point for adventures in Helena. We sat on the chairs in the front yard and got to watch a zillion deer wander the neighborhood. I would say it is better for sleeping at night and adventuring during the day ‚Äî midday attempts to nap might be compromised since they do have little kids living in the floor above. Easy to find and get in on our own. Snacks were great!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The photos do not do the place justice. Its squeeky clean and everything there looks brand new. Its a surprisingly quiet little place, with a beautiful view. Clearly lots of thought went into making sure it has all the ammenities one might need while staying away from home.
This is definitely the nicest place I have stayed while in Helena, and Im there a few times each year. I will definitely be back!

2023-07-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Despite the bathroom/shower area being a little tight on space.......I managed to make it work.

I didn't cook, but it looked like all the tools were there to put together a simple meal. Would definitely stay there again on my next visit to Helena. Jeremy was very responsive and all instructions were very clear. Jeremy has two small children and a dog. As a father and grandfather I didn't mind the occasional signs of new life above me -- mostly in the morning. Jeremy is aware that could be a problem for some people and has thoughtfully provided a white-noise machine. I didn't fell like I needed to use it."

2023-05-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,The space was very nicely decorated and spotless. The view of Helena was great. The only reasons I gave a 4 star rating was the bathroom was small and had no extra shelving and space to put toiletries and the standing shower was a little small. The second reason was the only television channels available were streaming services with no live television or provide any local viewing. This is just a personal preference. The bed was very comfortable.
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,What a treat to stay here! Great views with a cozy and clean welcoming. Oh and extra bonus - the bedding and towels are plush! We‚Äôll be back!

2022-11-01,4.0,Stayed one night,The house was very clean and nice. There was definitely a bit more noise from the upstairs than we had expected.

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"The best part about the Mini-Vic was having a quiet place to relax and get restful sleep before a big day. Taking a bubble bath and studying by the fire really stood out as especially peaceful. The sunset from the house was beautiful, and the bird sounds too"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Excellent stay at John‚Äôs place! Host was very proactive with instructions and recommendations and very quick to respond to questions. The home was exactly as described and pictured and so many little touches that I don‚Äôt know where to start! Very thoughtful details that made the stay so great for myself and my family. Would absolutely stay again and highly recommend!
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Our son lives in Helena so we visit regularly and the Mini Vic is, hands down, the best AirBnB we‚Äôve stayed in there.

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Of all the Airbnbs that we‚Äôve stayed in, I felt the most welcomed in John‚Äôs home. Communication was great both prior to and after our arrival.
Once we arrived we were treated to many little touches that added up to mean a whole lot. The bathroom and kitchen remodels are beautiful and luxurious, with linens to match. There were many added touches such as handmade soaps, aromatherapy sprays and candles, and extra toiletries.
The home was very clean, which is a big priority for me. It was nice to have the option of sitting outside on the porch area and sitting around the fire both outside and inside.
The historic charm throughout the house made it feel very cozy. It was a perfect mixture of original features and modern updates.
If you‚Äôre looking for a place to stay in Helena, I‚Äôd highly recommend John‚Äôs place."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great place and a wonderful host.

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We had a wonderful time here. It‚Äôs a beautiful house, very clean and well kept. We especially loved that‚Äôs it‚Äôs dog friendly.

The house felt spacious and peaceful. We definitely want to come back!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Host was very responsive and welcoming! Many extra amenities were offered and available to make us comfortable and to feel at home. It was fun to read about the history of the home and see some of the original antiques. Great location and little outside patio at the front of the house. The home was clean and comfortable. Be aware that there is a bathroom on the second floor only. As you would expect in an old Victorian home, the stairs are rather narrow and steep. Worked fine for us, but others may want to consider this feature.
John was THE BEST host!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Absolutely loved staying at the Mini Vic. Great location, amenities, very quiet and had everything we needed. Only hiccup was I couldn‚Äôt figure out how to lock the lockbox once we got the key out. But was easily resolved. Perfect stay."

This is hands down one of the nicest airb&b's we have ever stayed in. John thought of everything we may have needed, the house is clean, and very well kept. The neighborhood is quiet and a very short walk to some great trails and an area to take our dogs. Absolutely would stay here again in a heartbeat!"

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,We enjoyed John‚Äôs place! It was very warm and homey feeling. The location was extremely quiet which surprised us because it is a downtown area we assumed there would be lots of activity but at night no one was outside and it was quiet. You are literally a few houses away from over the city mountain trails. We went up and hiked and you can see over the whole city it is very stunning.
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Great little place- John was a fantastic host. Highly recommend!
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I cannot say enough wonderful things about our experience! John checked in to make sure we had everything we needed on arrival day & sent a detailed welcome. The home itself was beautifully remodeled, warm and inviting from the moment we walked in, and included many thoughtful amenities like slippers to borrow, little boxes of chocolates on the beds, & lovely soaps! The view from the primary bedroom and writer's nook was gorgeous, and we even saw a group of friendly mule deer wander by one morning! Care and love for this home is evident in every detail, from the typed up history of the house to the art throughout and the preservation of the original door. We greatly enjoyed sipping the thoughtfully provided scotch and whiskey while relaxing in the cozy living room. When we checked out we left behind a pair of prescription glasses by accident and John immediately texted me and offered to ship them to us. We could not have picked a kinder host or more welcoming home away from home!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,My pups and I were spoiled staying at John‚Äôs Airbnb- treats for both and comfy bed. John was very responsive and I really appreciated having the comforts of home and well stocked fridge. House is steps away from great hiking trails.
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We loved staying at this Airbnb and felt right at home! The house is gorgeous and John pays attention to many details that made us feel very welcome like a hand written welcome note, chocolates on the bed, drinks and extras in the bathroom.

2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The ""Mini-Vic"" is a wonderful place to stay. John has plenty of snacks, beverages, and an array of seasonings. It's nice to have a place with cable TV (we are not streamers!)
I just loved our short stay. John is as responsive as any AirBnB host we've ever had.
For those who might have trouble with
stairs, look closely at the pictures. The bathroom is upstairs, but there is a walk-in shower. I managed just fine.
You'll love this place. Steep street out front. Friendly neighbors, too!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"John was most helpful, and available to assist us with anything we needed. His home was so spacious, beautifully
presented a truly delightful place to stay in. There were bonus treats left for us too. We even saw deer in the garden across the road-super bonus for us. All the recommendations John gave us also were spot on. staying there won't disappointment.
Helena itself is full of great architecture with the Sate Capital building being especially worth a visit.
we could have stayed for weeks!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"It goes without saying that John is an exceptional host, and the house is everything you might expect and more, but for us it was his attention to detail that most impressed. John left little treats for our dogs (which made him their favourite person in the whole world for nearly 30 seconds!) and also bottled water in the fridge for us. These are little things that aren't too onerous for a host to provide, but mean a great deal to travellers such as ourselves. Some other hosts might do well to take heed of John's approach.
As for the house, I hope (like us) you come to believe that it's where you have lived for decades; welcoming and familiar and timeless as it is. It's full of little details that will make you wish you could stay well beyond your brief tenure.
I for one am grateful that, in years to come and in my frail dotage, I will somehow half remember the wistful, fleeting time I lived in a small Victorian house on a hill."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,John was a terrific host. We appreciated his instructions and recommendations around the town.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,10/10 stay at John‚Äôs place. We have family in Helena but wanted a private place for my husbands and I anniversary weekend and the Mini Vic did not disappoint! John was one of the most responsive and communicative hosts we‚Äôve ever had on airbnb. The place was super cute and there was a book explaining the history of the house along with tons of local recommendations! The bed was super comfy and the bathroom was very clean and spacious. We enjoyed a drink on the patio while sitting around the fireplace. He made the stay super special with some little details that did not go unnoticed! You and your fur friends will truly enjoy this property!
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Johns place was so nice. It felt very fancy while also staying cozy. The little reading room in the Master Bedroom was beautiful. Mount Helena was within walking distance and great for our puppies. Would definitely stay again.

AND, if you're up to walking, you're not too far from all the downtown places that are great to visit. I was very impressed with the town, city. Everybody was so friendly and helpful.
Cannot say enough wonderful things about the house. it was interesting to read about the history not to mention the artwork and all the great restoration work that has been done on the house.

2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Thank you so much. Your place is absolutely beautiful, great location, and your thoughtful touches meant a lot to us. We are two insomniacs, and we were able to sleep well at your place.
Your price is more than reasonable, and, when you have more reviews, I think you can easily raise the price.
Welcome to the world of Airbnb. It used to be very different, back in the day, but it is still a great way to ""meet"" people and show off your hosting skills! (And you are a great host!)"

Had a fabulous time with our family, letting kids run free with no screens in sight (but Wi-Fi available for the adults!) A little off the beaten path which was exactly what we wanted. Great, comfortable spot for large families. Feels like a piece of Montana history we were lucky to share in."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"What a magical place! We spent a week at BML for a family reunion and it couldn‚Äôt have been a better experience. The solitude and freedom to roam, coupled with the beauty and history of this place are unmatched. It was perfect for our family. Everyone raved about the trip and we were very sad to leave. We have vowed to make this an annual trip.
Ayrne was helpful, accommodating and kind. When we arrived, it was pouring rain, but the cabins were all open and cozy-lamps on to create the perfect ambiance that made us instantly feel at home. The main lodge is full of history and interesting books and trinkets to look through. The cabins are each cozy and private. The huge lawn, large grounds and surrounding lands are so fun to explore! And the creek that runs through and ties the property together is fabulous!
If you rent this home, please take care of it and tread gently because it is a true treasure that I hope will be available to enjoy for years to come! Thank you BML!!! We love you!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This lodge is surrounded by beautiful Montana scenery. Our family loves the different options for sleeping arrangements, the rustic feel of the cabins and how private the location is. The Host always responds in a timely manner. We love it."

2021-10-01,5.0,Group trip,"Booked the Black Mountain Lodge to host a micro micro wedding. Just us and a handful of friends. No regrets. The whole place is absolutely beautiful, equipped with all of your hosting needs and immaculately labeled! It does get quite chilly and the space heaters certainly come in handy and make the cabins toasty! The kiddos loved exploring (and so did the adults). Town is under 30 mins away for whatever else you might need, too. What a wonderful stay!"
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"My family (Ohana) and I was very pleased with Black Mountain Lodge! It was serene, beautiful and relaxing. It had so much privacy and a lot of country setting.

2021-06-01,5.0,Group trip,"Just echoing: Amazing Montana mountain property. Obvious pride of ownership and loving stewardship. Glad they shared with us, thank you Ayrne"
2020-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We loved to be detached from the Tech world for two days and we'll be back soon!
A gem in Helena."
2020-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This place is a gem. The land and historic cabins offer respite from our fast-paced world. I will definitely return next time I need to get away from it all.
2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Ayrne‚Äôs property was amazing! It was the perfect stay for me and my friends. Hands down the best AirBNB I‚Äôve ever stayed at, everything was beautiful and thoughtful, a great value! I hope to visit again."
2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had an incredible stay at Black Mountain Lodge! The host has thought of anything guests might need and has them available (I.e. bear spray, flashlights, shower amenities). This is such a fun place to have a group or family reunion, and still just as fun with my husband and I! The screen doors make the perfect sound that reminds one of summers growing up. We had a lot of fun exploring the property and reading in the screened in porch!"
2020-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Ayrne is a top notch host and the property is amazing. Black Mountain Lodge is the perfect location for anyone hosting an event and our group could not have been more blessed to use such a beautiful place.
2019-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,An incredible location and lodge. Already planning on going back!
2019-08-01,5.0,Group trip,The Black Mountain Lodge was wonderful! It has a wonderful rustic feel while still providing lots of modern amenities. It was a wonderful place for our retreat and every remarked on the beautiful landscape.
2019-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Great place to Unplug from all devices and unwind. The spectacular views and coolness of the refreshing backdoor creek really make this place wonderful. Kitchen is amazing and has all the necessities and more. Beds are cozy and bedding is perfect for early chilly Montana mornings.
2019-06-01,5.0,Group trip,There are there are few words to describe the magic of this place! It is the essence of Montana. Everything is extremely well cared for and thought of. I had a small wedding here and it could not have been made better with all the money in the world. The setting is gorgeous! I plan to come back again and again! The whole family wants to come back as well!! The host is extremely easy to work with and very responsive. Could not have had a better experience!
2019-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,There is no place better than Black Mountain in Montana that I know of. A secret gem I almost do not want to write a review of for fear of never being able to book it again. It‚Äôs that good.
2018-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Black Mountain is magic. A hidden local secret that only recently became available for Airbnb that is so good I almost don‚Äôt want the secret to get out. Host Ayrne is world class and delivers on all the small details in the most delightful ways. You‚Äôll find yourself stopping to marvel at the history and magic of this cabin retreat that goes back to the 1800s. There is a true authenticity to it that is impossible to feel in modern cabin experiences. A very rare find indeed. Enjoy.
2018-09-01,5.0,Group trip,"We hosted our wedding out at Black Mountain Lodge this fall. All of our family stayed on site and some of our guests even camped. Everyone couldn‚Äôt get over the beauty of the place. Many friends and family had never been to Montana, and the lodge and surrounding landscapes are picturesque. Our guests enjoyed the beauty and quietness of the atmosphere and even strolled some of the hills. The creek that runs through the property was beautiful and it was wonderful to cook in the kitchen listening to the water rush by. We did all the catering for the whole weekend on site and found everything we could ever need in the kitchen. The beauty of the place and the atmosphere will be something our guests talk about for years to come."
2018-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The road to the lodge seems like you are going to nowhere until you when it opens up to the isolated valley where the lodge sits. Beautiful, quiet setting to relax for a few days within half hour of town.
The lodge was unique and comforting; nothing around like it! The kitchen was really well stocked, as where the cabins. The small touches like local bath soaps make this place a memorable experience."
2018-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Black Mountain Lodge was an awesome choice for our family reunion. There was something for everyone, for sure!
The location is so beautiful and peaceful and the lodge and cabins were very well appointed; Ayrne has thought of everything! From the kitchen to the first aid cabinets; there wasn't much we were missing!
I would love to have the opportunity to stay at this property again; I liked it that much!"
2018-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Forest bathing. Perfect place to reset and unwind. Very much a piece of heaven. We found it very secluded and also very convenient to hln airport and everything we wanted to visit. Great restaurants close by and just wonderful
2018-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Perfectly wonderful
2017-10-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"A unique, spacious rental in a spectacular setting!"
2017-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Black Mountain Lodge is like turning back the clock 100 years. It is very rustic, and so much fun. Ayrne has kept the charm and decor of the place as it was back in the 1800's, and yet it is very comfortable. There is everything you need to cook a great meal, if you desire. It is not like it is primitive or ""roughing it"" - very enjoyable and comfortable - truly a fun and wonderful experience."
2017-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The Black Mountain Lodge is a magical place. It is the kind of property that resets your expectations and re-focusses your priorities. During our stay we wandered the local trails, followed horses and cattle thru the woods, and saw numerous eagles and birds of prey in the surrounding hills. The lack of cell phone coverage was a blessing - and it brought our three family party closer together for meals, games, fishing, and adventures. The cabins were adorable - each one of the sleeping rooms was unique and provided many options for a large group to find solitude or companionship as each desired. Our children established a little tent-city just out of earshot to continue their revelry into the evening, while we enjoyed card games and conversation on the large screened porch. The kitchen is well equipped for bread making, pie making, and coffee making, with enough cast iron options to host a cooking show - and that was all we needed.
The hosts were fantastic, and helped us orient ourselves to the Big Skies of Montana and all they can offer.
Can't wait to return. All AirBnB adventures should be this memorable."
2017-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place is magic! We had our wedding at the Black Mountain Lodge and it was the perfect space for the rustic Montana wedding we were seeking. The property is of course beautiful and Ayrne is the absolute best. She was so easy to communicate with and incredibly accommodating. We feel so blessed to have stumbled upon this place, sad to have to say goodbye but hopeful we will be back soon to hear that creek running while we sit in the cold tub and enjoy the beautiful wildflowers. Thanks, Ayrne!"
2017-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is the perfect place for a family or a group of friends to have a true Montana experience and still be close enough to Helena to enjoy all it has to offer. This was our second stay here. The cabin has everything you need, and Ayrne is so, so friendly and helpful. We can't wait to come back to this gorgeous spot. Thanks, Ayrne, for another magical stay at the lodge."
2017-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We loved this place. We had a family wedding in Helena and made a mini family reunion out of it! The place is secluded. You could stay here and feel at the end of the road or go to town only 15 miles away. The beds are comfy, the kitchen well stocked for your cooking pleasure and there are lots of things to do. We rode horses, bikes, hiked, played cards, jumped in the cold tub, cooked and conversed. The place is as beautify as the pictures show! Quintessential Montana!"
2017-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place is incredible. We had a large group (16) and never were in need of anything. The lodge and cabins are beautiful, tons of historical decor and information...if you find time to read. The location is gorgeous with a beautiful view and valley right out the front door. Kids loved it too. Trails, babbling brook (seriously), friendly horses and the sweetest little dog - were just part of the package.
We came up for a wedding in Helena, and the drive into town was quick enough and scenic as well. Ayrne was VERY helpful and made several trips out ahead of time at our request for wedding arrangements. Thank you Ayrne! Staying at the Lodge made our weekend all the more memorable."
2024-06-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"Pros:
- Beautiful location
- Small and cozy place with ample place for everything
- Amazing toilet, outdoor shower and nice hot tub but didn‚Äôt use
Cons:
- Carpets needs deep cleaning
- TV could be placed near the digital fireplace and becomes kinda invisible"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"What a wonderful get away to celebrate our anniversary!! Such a beautiful location & a beautiful cabin. Loved the skylight that let us gaze at the stars before bed, the soaking tubs outside & the beauty all around us!!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Thank you for the perfect honeymoon!
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Magically woodland retreat out of town but running distance to town.
2024-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Beautiful setting, very comfortable bed, cozy and the soaking tubs were amazing!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Beautiful place
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Super cute little place. Close to town. Pewceful.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Location was great! Close to town but secluded enough to feel like a real getaway. Access to bikes, gym, and the tubs made it worth the price. We appreciated the eye masks, but the sun doesn‚Äôt shine directly in the skylight so they weren‚Äôt needed. Bring milk and sugar for your coffee unless you like it black."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Beautiful cabin, perfect for a weekend getaway."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I had a lovely getaway weekend with my fianc√© in Allie's cabin -- what a beautiful place to unplug and relax! The space is so cozy and incredibly well designed. The space had absolutely everything we needed, and we felt so cared for. It was a treat to spend the weekend in the cabin!!"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Beautiful cabin! Would definitely recommend to anyone wanting a peaceful stay in Helena with great amenities. We loved our stay!
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We loved our stay at the cabin. So peaceful and quiet. Was a great weekend getaway. Sitting in the tubs and stargazing was a favorite as was the little hike around the property. Would definitely come again!
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Adorable cabin in the woods! We loved our stay. Just a word of caution to winter guests: if you don‚Äôt have 4 wheel drive or snow tires, the driveway may be very slick and tricky, especially after fresh snow."
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Orofino was a great getaway for my boyfriend and I. It was very peaceful and quiet.
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Always a great stay!
2024-02-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Place was great, not as private as we had hoped. And even though the temp was above 0, the tubs were covered in snow and we opted not to even attempt to fill ourselves. Only complaint was we had booked for a romantic valentines weekend and were excited to sleep in, however the blinds offered zero light coverage and so we were up with the sun both mornings. Otherwise the place was great! Heated floors were a huge bonus. And the smart oven wasn‚Äôt too hard to figure out."
2024-02-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"This was a very darling cabin in beautiful surroundings. Very quaint and clean. The only problem we had was we booked it for a romantic valentine stay with a wood stove and soaking tub outside. When we got there we saw the wood stove was no longer there and the soaking tubs could not really be used in the cold weather. This was disappointing, but overall the stay was nice. I just wish the listing was updated to reflect these changes as they were important to us. The host was very responsive and helpful, the place was super cute and clean!"
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Always love staying here. Extra magical with the snow in winter. Will be back soon.
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Cute little cabin for a weekend getaway. Loved snow shoeing, soaking in the tubs and the firepit."
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Such a cute/modern place!
Beautiful surroundings! Can‚Äôt wait to go back in the summer!"
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,The cabin was delightful as is the overall property layout. Would highly recommend and hope to return sometime!
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We loved it! Would definitely stay again.
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Cute quiet cabin outside of Helena! The place is decorated perfectly and all the windows make you feel like you are right in the woods. We had a bonfire on the patio and enjoyed the walking path. Allie provides a great link with the info on the cabin and recommendations nearby. We would stay again!
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The cabin was easy to get to and the check in was simple, just a key in a lockbox. The place was clean and the surrounding area was quiet. We were the only ones at any of the airbnb's on the property, so we had plenty of privacy and quiet. The surrounding area and neighborhood was nice, the road up to the cabin is dirt but nicely maintained and had no problems with a rental car getting there. The amenities listed were accurate and the pictures on the listing were pretty accurate for the space. The only real issue was getting an Uber into town, seemed there was an issue on Ubers side telling drivers to take a road that doesn't connect to the road where the cabin is. If you have a rental car you'll be fine, regular GPS gives the correct route."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Perfectly peaceful. I‚Äôd love to come back.
2023-11-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,Great place!
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,What a cute cabin! We had such a wonderful time soaking in the outside tubs. The area was SO quiet and so relaxing! We will be back. It was a perfect night away!
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We needed a place close to home because of an elderly parent, and the Orifino Cabin delivered so many things we needed! Peace and quiet, a place to decompress, AND room to roam and hike around the acreage, and close to some of the best restaurants in Helena! The cabin had everything we needed, was very cozy and comfortable. We will definitely keep this in mind for a break from caretaking. We loved the Orofino Cabin and Allie's hospitality!"
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Top top top
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We had a wonderful stay. Can‚Äôt wait to come back!

2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,What a beautiful place! I really loved it and will definitely want to stay there again the next time I'm in Helena.
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,The place was great! It's situated out in the woods and you don't hear any of the city! It's nice and peaceful and the skylight right over the bed is awesome! Taking a hot tub while enjoying nature is amazing as well!
2023-10-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful place to stay and overall had a great time, however appliances and lighting were confusing to use and inside wood fire heater was not able to be used. Cabin is close by main guesthouse so not as private as we were expecting but still had ample privacy. Just be aware that there will be other people on the lot. Fire lighters were out of gas and was difficult to start campfire with no paper/fire lighter cubes - but we have camping experience so were able to make it work for us. Overall 4/5 only due to some of the listed inconvenienced but such a beautiful place it‚Äôs hard to be mad at it!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Warm tubs to soak in, peaceful atmosphere, star gazing in bed. Relaxing and cozy stay. Will definitely be coming back to visit."
2023-10-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,was a very nice stay. Could not find how to shut the light off above the kitchen bar. Made it hard to sleep. Other than that the stay was great. Thank you.
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful stay with an amazing host. My favorite vacation destination so far!
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great place! We love everything about the cabin. Inside is pretty amazing specially the heated toilet seat! :)

2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Great place, a must for the Helena cabin enthusiast!
If it‚Äôs available, book it."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Absolutely loved our stay at this cabin! It had a very secluded feeling without being miles away from town. The June oven was great for preparing our meals, the cabin had everything we needed and wanted- (the heated floors were amazing). Many options for a great cup of coffee!
The soaking tubs were greatly appreciated after having hiked Glacier National Park! This was the perfect place to end our Montana adventure!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We loved this cabin in Helena! You‚Äôre so close to all amenities you could need, without feeling like you are! This is a hidden gem. Clean, quiet and such a cool experience."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This was our first wedding anniversary getaway and we loved it! Thank you for a magical experience!
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We rented this cabin along with the larger house to give some of our party a more private space. It close enough but still private. Very clean and cozy, the back deck was very peaceful."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This cabin has a ton of small details that make it unique. From the toilet to the blinds and decorations it was extremely cozy. My husband and I especially enjoy the soaking tubs. Would recommend for a couples getaway!
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Just what the wife and I needed. Peaceful. Fantastic for a mini vacation. Close to Helena Mt. yet we felt like we were In the middle of the mountains. The instructions for every Allie offers are so user friendly. My favorite was the soaker tubs. Completely impressed with how well this place was put together!!! We will be back!!!
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Three amazing things that just wowed me were:
1. The heated toilet!! Never knew I needed one until this visit
2. The outdoor tin bath tub hot tub. Nestled in the cutest outdoor space and super peaceful at night.
3. The sky light right above the bed. Great for stargazing before bed.
This place is definitely suited for those looking for an escape and peace. Perfect studio space with anything you‚Äôd need for a small getaway from yummy smelling hair and body products to cozy comforts.
This place was exactly what I needed before starting my camping trip."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We had an amazing time staying at the cabin as a stopover between Whitefish and Bozeman. I couldn‚Äôt stop talking about how cute this place was, and as a designer I notice allll the details. The cabin, furnishings, and surroundings were top notch. The soaking tubs were an amazing bonus! We didn‚Äôt want to leave!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We loved the Miners cabin- especially the ‚Äúhot tubs‚Äù on the back deck-so relaxing! We loved the style and natural landscaping around the cabin- it was so nice to be next to so many hiking trails as well as the mountain bikes- which were wonderful! It‚Äôs close enough drive to enjoy walking downtown for great food and nice shops.
2023-08-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Overall, we were impressed by the serene beauty of the area and the stunning lodge where my brothers and my wife & I gathered for a wonderful family reunion. Even a challenge we faced initially was quickly overcome thanks to Allies kind responsive attention. We were really impressed also by how calm and poised ALLIE was in all circumstances. She was a great host!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Absolutely stunning little cabin!! Came for a girls' night to get away and was so very relaxing! Overall, 5 stars and would recommend. Would love to stay here again, but personally think it's a bit overpriced. There's no stove to cook, though they have a plug-in warmer. The biggest problem was how awkward the shower was. Didn't make or break the experience but was too small and open to really move around and shower without soaking the floor. Would have been easier to shower outside in a swimming suit."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We LOVED our stay at the Orofino Cabin!! We will definitely be back for another girl's weekend getaway. Those tubs are so awesome and a definite highlight of our trip. Allie was always responsive and kind in her communication and answered my messages right away. This was an all-around 10/10 stay. We'll be coming back for sure!
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The cabin was fantastic! We enjoyed walking the trail, sitting in the soaking tubs (while playing the waterproof cards they provided!), fire pit and the outdoor shower! Everything was perfect from the wonderful smelling shampoo & conditioner to the comfortable bed where we got to star gaze before falling asleep! The other housing on the property was a little closer than I realized, however, our outdoor area felt very private and secluded still. Well stocked kitchen and fun goodies provided. Highly recommend hitting up Montago Coffee while in town! We loved how close we were to town."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great place to stay! Quiet area and the cabin was clean and well stocked.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Beautiful and peaceful

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We had a staycation in this Airbnb. We‚Äôre from Helena and wanted a nice outdoor experience that was calm and relaxing. This cabin was all of that. The cabin itself is cozy and well designed. It was comfortable with the AC during our summer stay. There are Lots of areas to explore nature. Very relaxing atmosphere.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The cabin (along with the lodge and a-frames on the property) was the perfect place for our family getaway. The cabin was well-stocked and you can tell that the host paid great attention to detail. We wouldn‚Äôt hesitate to book the cabin again.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Allie was great she was very responsive and helpful. The cabin was beautiful had great views and plenty of things to do around the general area.
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Great private space for a getaway. We enjoyed the hot tubs, outdoor space, and cozy amenities. The kitchen is a little small for cooking, but overall had nice amenities."

2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,My wife and I had a wonderful time. The location was absolutely beautiful. It felt super secluded even though it is just a few miles from Helena. The cabin was beautiful and clean couldn't have asked for a better place to spend the weekend.
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Beautiful cabin in a quiet location. Highly recommend
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Hey girl , it was awesome and the old school hot tubs were fabulous üòä close to town, beautiful easy drive , it was wonderful."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Reserved the entire property Lodge, Miner‚Äôs Cabin and A-Frames this trip. Perfect for a large family providing privacy as well. The A-Frames were perfect for the teens. They felt they had their own space and close enough to the lodge if they needed anything. The A-Frames were a brilliant add on build.
The Miner‚Äôs cabin was comfortably quaint and again, private but close to join activities. The lodge is always perfect for a large group. This entire property is very clean and very well stocked. Close to downtown Helena and Carroll College. Allie was a great, very responsive and accommodating host. Will definitely reserve again."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This place was incredible. I had an extra day to spend in Montana after a work trip and booked this place thankfully as it had the exact day open I needed - it was totally worth it. It is beautiful - I wish I could have stayed longer. I was driving up at night and was a little nervous as it was raining but the instructions were so clear that I found it easily, and was inside and relaxing in no time. If you get the chance to book here, don‚Äôt hesitate."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Beautiful, clean, private and peaceful place close to town! I wish we had more time to experience the beautiful surroundings. Allie, thank you so much ! Best of luck with Orofino expansion ,we are looking forward to experience more of it in the future!"
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I absolutely loved this little cabin tucked away, yet so close to town!
Space it self was perfect, cozy, had everything you need to enjoy a weekend away. The fire place and tubs on the deck were the perfect addiction to being able to enjoy those beautiful views"
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Just with one night I was able to try the outdoor hot tub, watch Apple TV, cook, stargaze, and Peloton Treadmill the next morning. It took an hr to relax after a long drive and I loved every minute of it. The bathroom is like a mini spa with a rainlike shower and heated toliet. Perfect getaway to TV binge and try new things. I made pancakes for breakfast accompanied with plenty of coffee and tea."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The cabin was perfect and so romantic. Definitely wanting to go back sometime soon and hopefully this summer. Allie was a great host and very communicative.
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This was such a treat for my wife and I. Allie was so nice and always responded always immediately. The Cabin was so clean it made out house look like a junk yard lol. Amazing views and things to do. If you are looking for a get away that is private and quick this is the place for you. 10/10 would recommend.
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very clean and cozy! The bed was so comfortable and it was so peaceful outside.
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,It was a great clean place with a quiet location
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We loved our stay in this beautiful area and cozy cabin. It snowed our whole stay and the wood stove kept us very warm. Our favorite part of the cabin was the skylight above the bed. Seeing the stars at night and watching the snow fall in the mornings was a dream. We will definitely stay again!
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We absolutely loved our stay at the cabin! It was a peaceful and gorgeous getaway, Allie was great at communicating, and the place was cozy and clean. There were a couple of dinner plates that hadn't been washed very well by the previous overnighters - I had to rewash them before we could use them‚Äîlots of greases and residue, etc. There were also a couple of sticky spots at the top of the kitchen drawers that I needed to wipe up. And we were a little bummed to not be able to use the outdoor soaking tubs because we were really looking forward to that! We went out to fill them up and there was nothing to plug the drains with, but I'm assuming that's just because we've had so much snow lately and it was still very cold out. Overall, we loved our stay and would definitely come back! Thanks, Allie!"
2023-03-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"Such a quaint, cute, clean little place!"
2023-03-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Very nice cabin!
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We recently stayed in the Cabin @ Orofino and I have to say it's one of the most magical places we have ever visited.
We were so fortunate to have it snow whilst there, which did make it a little difficult to figure out where a lot of the trails started, but the views were absolutely incredible.
The location for this cabin is just stunning. If you need some time away to reset then this is the place for you. We had the most amazing time exploring the easier trails (the heavy snow restricted us a little) and explored Helena where there are some really beautiful restaurants and cafe's.
From the small touches (a small box of chocolates from nearby Parrot Confectionary) to the insanely crazy Japanese toilet, everything in the cabin is intentional. This was the perfect way to spend our honeymoon, I just wish we lived closer!
As a note, you'll definitely need a 4WD vehicle in the winter months (thankfully we did) as although the road to the cabin is cleared, it's still very snowy."
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The Cabin was amazing with lots to do, conveniently close to downtown, and lots of helpful tech which was a nice surprise (e.g., AppleTv, heated floors, auto blinds, etc.).
I would highly recommend this place for anyone that wants a home base to explore Helena and surrounding area!"
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Loved every bit of our stay. Everything was lovely and easy to use. Clear directions and great follow up on communication.
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Super cozy place, not far from town, great host! Couldn‚Äôt be happier"
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My girlfriend and I spent our weekend absolutely stunned at this spot. One of the best Airbnb‚Äôs we‚Äôve been to. There were so many little details that were thought through that make the cabin feel extra cozy and inviting. From the futurist toilet to the brand of lotion, the comfort of the bedding to the heated floors, it truly is something special. We were little worried to be disappointed about the tubs and make shift kitchen but both worked great. The tubs stayed hot for a surprisingly long time and the kitchen had everything you would need for 2 people. We would go back over and over and over again!"
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,It was amazing we had such a good time!
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This place was perfect getaway for two. Local and fun opportunities to snowshoe, and hike."
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We adored all of the intentional details in this space (inside and out!)‚Ä¶Cozy and comfortable!
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Awesome place for the few days we spent in Montana! The cabin was really clean and had everything we needed for a relaxing stay. The snowshoes really came in handy!
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Such a peaceful, beautiful place at the base of the mountains. Felt like we were away up in the mountains yet minutes from some good food. I would definitely go again."
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Our life just keeps getting busier and busier. This cabin is the perfect slow down for us. Pristine forest, no neighbors, quite serenity. This was the perfect place to reconnect with each other. I'm so glad we found this diamond in the rough. We will be back soon. Also, Peloton treadmill, work out room, snowshoes, mountain bikes, soaker tubs, rain shower shower head, soft sheets, cozy wood stove, great coffee, etc. I could keep going but you have to check this place out for yourself."
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The place was just like the pictures.
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This place is absolutely adorable! I loved it so much and I do plan on staying again in the summer. The place is private with beautiful surroundings! Allie is super responsive!

2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We absolutely loved the Miner‚Äôs Cabin! It is beautiful, comfy and cozy! It has everything needed for a home away from home. It is very private and we were able to relax and destress. Allie is an excellent host! She answered all my questions in a timely manner and is so kind and positive. We can‚Äôt wait to go back and stay longer!"
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This place is a dream!! Beautiful home. So cozy and comfortable. Close to town but secluded. I would definitely stay again!

2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,a great cabin getaway! the soaking tubs are really nice and relaxing! all around a good time
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"A beautiful, serene, and cozy place to spend some lovely evenings in the woods! Everything you could need for your adventure! It snowed the night we stayed and we awoke to our car having been brushed off - it's that kind of thoughtfulness that completes a lovely trip like that with Orofino."
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is one of the most beautiful, quiet, well thought out places that I have ever stayed! It is cozy and inviting. What a beautiful area, I can‚Äôt wait to return again!"
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful and well appointed cabin. We loved our cozy stay including waking up to skylight covered in snow.
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This cabin was extremely cozy, in the best of ways. My husband and I thoroughly enjoyed the ""warmth"" of this accomodation. All the little details were of great quality, from the decor to the June oven. It's location is great, tucked up and away from town but close enough to get there in minutes. The privacy is and nature surrounding the cabin is idyllic. We saw many deer while enjoying the hot soaking tubs on the back deck. This location served well as a middle point between Yellowstone and Glacier National Park."
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We had the coziest weekend staying at this amazing cabin. It is beautifully decorated, clean, and is fully equipped for a comfortable stay. We loved the wood-burning stove and fell asleep to watching it snow through the skylight above the bed. You can tell the hosts definitely paid attention to detail when furnishing this home, particularly the coffee set up. The hosts were also very accommodating of our requests and went out of their way to make the stay memorable."
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Super cool little cabin not too far from town but far enough away.
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Loved this little cabin! The soaker tubs in the back were awesome and it was very private. Will definitely stay again!
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"such beautiful little cabin. the heated floors were nice addition, the bed was very comfortable, and it has a cute aesthetic."
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Place is absolutely stunning. Who ever designed this place - well done! Everything is perfect, so well stocked, bed super comfortable, toilet might be from the year 3000. Decking out the back so lovely too. From the minute we walked in we couldn‚Äôt have been happier. Thanks a mil!"
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Wonderful cabin experience with new easy to use tech. We loved the soaking tubs as well. Thanks Allie!
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Our stay here was awesome. House is impeccably designed and surroundings were very peaceful.
Great hosts!"
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Beautiful place. You won‚Äôt regret staying here. Secluded, but close to town. Wish we would have booked an extra day. Quality everything right down to the pillows & hand soap."
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a wonderful stay and will definitely stay here again. The cabin is lovely and cozy and the location is quiet. We really enjoyed sitting in the back with a fire going. There wasn't anyone in the Lodge during our stay, so we don't know what it's like when there are other guests. But we'll definitely stay here again when we want a few days away. Highly recommend."
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Great stay, very relaxing and peaceful! Allie kept the place very cute, simple and everything we needed to enjoy our stay. Soaking tub was amazing. Definitely want to go back for winter experience!"

2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Wonderful stay in the woods. Very clean and super quiet. We loved the outdoor tubs and skylight!
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Such a wonderful spot not too far from Helena. We had the privacy we needed and took advantage of as many of the amenities as possible! We love the soak tubs, the fire pits and the smoker to make our dinner. The cabin has everything you need for a lovely stay. Highly recommend and can‚Äôt wait to stay again."
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"One of our favorite airbnbs ever! The cabin is in a beautiful, quiet and private ponderosa pine forest, but just a short distance from town (and a delicious bakery). We loved the outdoor shower, soaking tubs and fire pit, and the kitchen was well-equipped to make meals."
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Was such a cozy stay in Montana! Everything was perfect! Loved how updated, clean & comfortable this cabin made our stay. Exceeded our expectations! Will be back!"
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This cabin just outside of Helena is adorably eclectic with modern touches, making it the perfect home away from home. We loved the tubs outside and enjoyed sleeping under the stars thanks to the great skylight. We fell in love with Helena and will definitely be back!"
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"OMG, where to start! This place was incredible! My wife picked it based on the listing photos and details, but we were both still blown away when we arrived. From Casper pillows and Malin+Goetz products, to automatic blinds and perfectly placed outlets, the attention to detail is beyond anything we‚Äôve ever seen at an Airbnb property. It‚Äôs the coziest getaway with soaking tubs, a fire pit, and outdoor shower. The design of the space is so unique with efficient built ins, benches lining the front windows, an eating nook, and the sky light above the bed. They‚Äôve also thought of everything so you‚Äôll find extra towels, extra blankets, a space heater if wanted, and all of your kitchen necessities. Would 1000% recommend."
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Had an amazing stay in the Miner‚Äôs Cabin. The cabin was cozy, quiet and had well thought out amenities. Beautiful location! Will definitely stay here again."
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Just amazing! Such a peaceful, cozy atmosphere. The cabin is completely state of the art and perfect for a relaxing and romantic getaway. We will be back!"
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Allie‚Äôs Orofino cabin was a wonderful place to stay. It provided the perfect opportunity for relaxation. The views and atmosphere, right up against a National Forest, were incredible.
We found the small town feel of Helena to be inviting, and enjoyed visiting the craft breweries as much as we enjoyed hiking in nature. My wife particularly enjoyed spending time in the dual soaking tubs on the back porch area, which we jokingly referred to as ‚ÄúCialis Tubs‚Äù, from the commercials. The amenities provided in the cabin are comfortably modern. We would definitely recommend the Orofino cabin to anyone looking for a quiet (romantic) getaway in the middle of nature, with food, drink, and entertainment just up the road.
We had a genuinely great time, and would love to come back in the future."
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We absolutely loved this cozy little cabin. Had everything you could want or need. Solitude, serenity & beautiful night skies. Can‚Äôt wait to stay again in the future!"
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,My wife and I stayed for a week and loved the cabin! We were blown away with how clean and organized the place was when we arrived. The hot tubs and fire ring in the back were very relaxing and felt amazing after a long day. Helena is a comfortable place with an interesting history and a lot to do. It also sits between Missoula and Bozeman where we spent a day at each. Allie is a fantastic host who is very accommodating and is always available if you have any questions. It's easy to tell she cares about her guests and wants to provide them with a relaxing and comfortable experience.
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"My boyfriend and I almost changed our trip plans just to stay another night here. Absolutely stunning location, the view from the bed is incredible. Hot tubs are such a nice touch. Just mind the spiders !"
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"According to my four-year-old, the best part of the cabin was ‚Äúeverything ‚Äú"
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Amazing stay, beautiful property and lodging, absolutely recommend. There is the main lodge right across the driveway, but it‚Äôs far enough away where it‚Äôs still private. The tubs were amazing, as well as the back porch space in general. House was tidy, but kitchen supplies is limited so be prepared with snacks."
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,The dreamiest air bnb we‚Äôve ever stayed at. Pics are completely accurate. Very private. Would definitely return.
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"What a wonderful little spot! The cabin itself is located close to the main lodge and a few hiking trails. Unfortunately, our stay was only one night, but very happy with our choice to stay in the Miner's Cabin! Very spacious with almost everything you could possibly need. Lovely backyard/patio space that is VERY peaceful and quiet. My husband and I sat for a few hours simply enjoying the calm of the forest. You would never guess that ""the city"" is just a short drive away. Highly recommend for anyone - but don't do what we did - be sure to book it for more than one night so that you can truly enjoy the space!"
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We only stayed one night, but it was very clean & comfortable. Nice quiet get away."
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The cabin was very well curated, and absolutely beautiful! We really enjoyed our stay here, and would definitely visit again. Thanks for the lovely experience üíï"
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"A beautiful location and great cabin. Helena is centrally located to many scenic and historic sites. The city itself has great restaurants and other features, but don't try to get around without a GPS map application running on your phone: the street layout is challenging. Although there are other cabins in the area, because of the hills and trees, this cabin feels very private and the silence is great."
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Fancy little home. Nice and quiet.
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This cabin was incredible. The inside was adorable and modern. All the windows made it feel like you were outside when you were in. The skylight was a great feature that could be used during the day or at night. Allie was super responsive. You do not get cell service in the cabin - which I loved, but there is Wi-Fi. It was incredible stay all the way around and I can‚Äôt wait to head back."
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This is the best place to stay in Helena, bar none. Great convenient location - close to town but still a great getaway in the woods. It‚Äôs luxury glamping without being over the top. Very tasteful and every detail is clearly thought out. Feels like Helena‚Äôs version of Soho Farmhouse in the UK. Allie is a very hands on and helpful property manager with great local recommendations. We will be back!"
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My favorite Airbnb!! It was so magical. We used the soaking tubs and loved the amenities in the cabin. Allie is amazing, she left a little gift for me and was flexible with check in. You are close to hiking trails and several restaurants and grocery stores yet secluded. It was perfect to get pizza and stay the night at the cabin. Don‚Äôt hesitate to stay here!!"
2022-06-01,4.0,Stayed about a week,"This was a great little spot for our honeymoon- it would have been nice to know that there was another dwelling so close because it left a little privacy to be desired. We left the curtains closed on that side of the cabin for the most of the trip for privacy‚Äôs sake, but it would have been nice to have them open to enjoy the beauty of Montana. Overall, it is a great little cabin and there are lots of fun things to do in town, especially the 4 course meal at Bella Roma."
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"If you want an amazing experience out in nature while having the luxuries of modern life, this is the place to stay! The outdoor soaking tubs were amazing and sleeping under the stars made the experience all that more special. Would 100% recommend."
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Such an amazing and cozy place. The outdoor tubs are magical and it‚Äôs so peaceful here. The design/decor is amazing and hosts are awesome and communicate well.
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Must stay! This is the best Airbnb we have ever experienced. The land is gorgeous, the custom hot tub and cold plunge are highlights, the pantry was well stocked, the koi pond, everything was very clean, the comfy beds, the playroom, it had everything we could have imagined. Our family of four immensely enjoyed the peace the property offered as well as the town of Helena. We hope to be back!"
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,This place is simply amazing. Great place to just relax and enjoy some quiet time.
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a lovely time here for a weekend away. The location is great - just outside Helena that you can run into town for anything you need but far enough away that you feel like you're away from it all. The cabin is cozy with thoughtful and stylish touches, and the outdoor soaking tubs are amazing. Highly recommend and we hope to be back soon."
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"WOW what a great airbnb! Location isn't far from town and feels very private, the cabin is so well done! We loved the tubs after being out kayaking all day. The spa like amenities are what put this place over the top tho! We will definitely be back!"
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Absolutely the best Airbnb we have ever stayed at. So cute, so many cool features. The hot tubs were unbelievable. The setting was perfect. It was clean and well decorated. Kitchenette had everything we needed to make dinner together."
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,I can‚Äôt describe the beauty of each well thought out detail of Allie‚Äôs place. We will be back in the future! Thank you!
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We loved staying in the beautiful cabin! So comfortable and cute and in a beautiful area. We also really enjoyed how well stocked it was and the kitchen gadgets and hot tubs were a fun treat to use. Hosts were great to communicate with and the cabin is so close to town and trails.
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,The cabin is a slice of Montana heaven. It's close enough to town yet you feel like you're really in the middle of the woods and can unplug and unwind in the tubs! Can't wait to come back
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"What a beautiful place to relax and unwind for a few days! This little oasis spared no expense to create a unique place to stay. Floors are heated, blinds are controlled remotely, and high-end appliances round out this wonderful place! You will more than likely need to book this in advance, but definitely take the time to do so!"
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The cabin was very clean and cozy! We enjoyed the secluded area and seeing the deer right outside. There were multiple great hiking trails nearby.
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We wish we could have stayed longer, and will definitely book again. Beautiful design and efficiency. We loved soaking in the tubs and watching the forest"
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,The place was great!

2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,absolutely beautiful space and surprisingly modern with amenities inside. we loved our stay here!
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This is a perfect weekend getaway under the stars. Everything you need was present, the bed and linens fantastically comfortable, coffee of all types of available for you. Allie was very quick to reply and made us feel welcome. Ten minutes from town was perfect. I can't wait to experience this cozy little cabin in the winter months without the snow."
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great for a weekend getaway!
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great place for a group! Very cozy, very peaceful."
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful location, clean and comfortable accommodations. We will be back!"
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This little cabin offers much needed peace and relaxation. We enjoyed the well designed and functions interior, as well as the comfortable back patio with the fire pit. The shower was also phenomenal-piping hot water from a rain/mist shower head ü§åüèª everything was well thought out and top notch."
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great place!
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Place was top notch. Highlights were the hot tubs, the sky light above the bed, the nespresso machine, the June oven, the heated floors and the bidet. Place was very private. Decorated cozily and homey. Super close to town but, feels worlds away when you‚Äôre there. The dinner suggestion for the Mediterranean grill in Helena was great. Repeat stay in the future for sure."
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Absolutely loved it! g
Even though we were close to the main cabin, the way it was built makes it feel secluded. We loved the tubs outside and found them very relaxing after full days exploring! The water gets HOT, so be prepared to add some cold water to it. My boyfriend and I are small framed and were able to sit in one facing each other. The cabin has everything you could need outside of a washer/dryer, so pack accordingly. Close to town attractions. All the smart gadgets took some getting used to, but the book on the counter helped! Communication and instructions were on point. We had no issues throughout our stay with anything. Definitely recommend. It's magical."
2022-04-01,4.0,Stayed one night,We had a lovely and calm stay in the woods.
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Absolutely beautiful cabin in the woods. Loved all of the amenities, made it very easy for my husband and I to cook while we were there. Loved the convenience of the location. In the middle of the woods, but also so close to town."
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This cabin is amazing to get out of town for the night and relax. We are already planning our next trip back to it. It‚Äôs a beautiful secluded area and the cabin has everything you need to have a great time.
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Gifted this beautiful house to my parents for their 70th birthdays, they absolutely loved it and spent many hours soaking in the hot tubs. The owners even worked with me to special deliver a surprise cake and wine, what a treat!
We will be back as a family at some point!"
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I loved everything about this place. It was adorable, modern, and cozy. Perfect for a little getaway. There is properties near by but it felt so secluded in the woods. Yet still close enough to the town. The outdoor tub was so lovely and can get very hot. Other touches I adored included, outdoor fire, indoor fire, heated floors, heated toilet seat, the nespresso machine, and overall the place felt so clean. I‚Äôd recommend bringing board games, get some pizza to go, maybe some bubbly and s‚Äômores ingredients and just relax out here with no technology. Which reminds me I had no service, but there is WiFi available. Would hands down stay here again."
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,As advertised! A beautiful cabin with all the extras. My husband and I thoroughly enjoyed our stay.
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Wonderful cabin! The Orofino team was great to communicate with and our stay was delightful.
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Allie's cabin is everything it is described as. Beautifully appointed, well presented and easy in, easy out. The location is perfect - close to town but quiet in the woods. For anyone wanting to spend a a little time in Helena this is an ideal spot."
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place is great for a little getaway while also being close to the city. We never left the cabin except for some hiking around the area, mainly because of the steep snowy road that we could not get up upon our first arrival (we brought a 2-wheel driven car in the beginning of March)."
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This space was absolutely perfect. High tech amenities, beautifully decorated, peaceful, easy to get into town but by far the best Airbnb in the area. We came in visiting a friend and it was the perfect retreat from the town but gave us a real sense of Montana. We woke up to deer and had the most amazing views. Would definitely recommend if you‚Äôre coming for a fly fishing trip, hiking or just a mountain getaway.
Only bummer is that we didn‚Äôt get to use the tubs bc the hose froze over."
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The host was fantastic and The place was so beautiful! I loved all the colors and the size was perfect for 2. The tub outside was a wonderful treat! The heated floors were such a nice treat as well! Definitely will be back, longer next time! Amazing amazing amazing! Definitely check it out ü§ôüèΩ"
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"What a magical stay! Allie not only provided a super cute and luxurious stay, but she was extremely communicative and accommodating. We will be back!"

I would stay here again in a heartbeat. It‚Äôs a cabin in the woods, with all the quiet, wildlife and woodstove etc that might conjure up‚Ä¶ with the twist of modern ‚Äúsmart‚Äù amenities.
A thoughtful kitchen and everything you need for a perfect getaway, and only a quick 5 min to town for all your dining and outing needs.
This place is a must."

2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,I simply can‚Äôt recommend this cabin enough! Allie was very responsive! The cabin was perfect. My fianc√© and I loved the experience of being in a cabin/ cabin setting with nice finishes and smart technology that was super easy to use! The front of the cabin is off to the side so you really feel like you are alone. Perfect!
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This cabin is so cute and cozy! Would definitely recommend staying here and will keep it on our radar for future visits.

2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"The cabin is exactly as described, exquisitely designed and well-built. Comes with great amenities.

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Was perfect for what we needed
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Deanne‚Äôs place is perfectly functional with extra amenities. For example there‚Äôs a cooler you can use for the day. There were even a couple beers waiting for us in the fridge. But most importantly we had a restful sleep. If you care about sleep this is the place. The bed was very comfortable and the sheets were so soft. It was a very cozy home. We will definitely stay again. Thank you.

2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I can't say enough good things about this place. It's immaculately clean, super well-appointed (she has thought of everything and has it all there), bed is great, couch is comfy. Bathroom is a great size and has everything you'd need, the kitchen has everything including at least 3 different ways you can make coffee! It's such a comfortable and warm place to stay in a great neighborhood and close to everything. If I ever had reason to, I'd love to have an extended stay there. Communication was easy and fast. I've stayed at my share of AirBnBs, and this one is definitely the best one - hands down!"
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This is my go to place when I visit Helena! Deanna is a wonderful host super quick to respond and the place is really really nice. Close to hiking and great walking.

2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Everything was great. 5 star experience and would definitely stay there again
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My stay in Deeanne's guesthouse was one of the best Airbnb experiences I have ever had! The unit is beautiful. Cozy, peaceful, and had everything I needed. I was in Helena visiting family for Christmas, and the fireplace was so welcome during a chilly Helena winter! The apartment was well appointed and everything was organized in such a smart way. There are lots of windows, and tons of natural light. Also great views of the mountains and college! Deeanne was welcoming, helpful, and responded quickly. My family members who saw it also commented on what a perfect space it was. I was sorry to leave, and would absolutely stay in this Airbnb again."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The studio was a great place to stay! It had everything we needed and the location was very good and central.
Would definitely stay here again!"
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I've been doing AirBNB for many years, and have mostly had very good experiences. But Deeanne and Bill truly went above and beyond. The little cottage is gorgeous and perfect for a short stay (we were there three nights) but well-equipped enough to feel like you're not lacking for anything. I loved that almost everything we wanted to get to was walkable, including the cute little downtown and the beautiful mountain trails. Finally, when our rental car broke down and left us temporarily without a vehicle for an important appointment, Deeanne was creative and extremely generous in helping us figure out how to navigate the issue. I've rarely encountered AirBNB hosts this ideal. There are lots of other options (we looked at them and thoroughly considered them), but you should definitely stay here when you come to Helena."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place was super cute! The hosts went above and beyond to make us feel welcome and at home, and even left some treats for us! It is a perfect location. Very close to the college and downtown, yet it is private and peaceful. A million times better than a hotel room!"
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The stairs and areas where I needed to walk were 100% snow free. This was wonderful as it has snowed over 12‚Äù shortly before I arrived. I was grateful I didn‚Äôt have to deal with snow or slick ground from the car to the door. I needed a place that was more comfortable than a hotel and in the neighborhood, the studio apartment was perfect."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This space is lovely and well cared for, and the hosts go above and beyond with little touches! Perfect location for a conference at Carroll College, or anything in Helena, and (nice bonus!) they're not far from Sunflower Bakery! Also, Deanne and Bill are responsive, thoughtful communicators‚Äî thank you!
I'm hoping this space is open next time I travel to Helena, I'd definitely stay here again."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful location. Bill and Deeanne were super friendly and accommodating, would highly recommend their rental."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Great, easy place to stay."

2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We enjoyed our stay in Deeanne and Bill's studio. Very clean, organized, and had everything we could have possibly needed. We loved the info binder and referred to it for local restaurant ideas. It is centrally located. Nothing more than 5 or 6 minutes away, yet the studio itself is in a quiet and peaceful neighborhood. Would definitely recommend it, and I'm sure we'll stay here again anytime we are in the Helena area."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"As a fellow AirBnB owner I tend to look at rental units from a different perspective. Deeanne and Bill's property screamed ""Well run!"". Communication prior to check-in was excellent. The amenities were exactly as described. The unit was spotless and Bill was very pleasant and informative. And, best of all, the unit was quiet and comfortable resulting in a perfect night's sleep. I will definitely stay here next time I'm in Helena."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"Deeanne was an excellent host, and the studio was perfect for what we needed."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This place is PERFECT in every way!

2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This studio is absolutely magical its so cute and quaint inside its decorated perfectly and there were lots of amenities. The studio isnt attached to their main house which helped it feel more private. The location is absolutely perfect its got that fairy garden feel that was so pleasant. It was absolutely spotless as well you can tell Deeanne takes pride in her airbnb she was so sweet and attentive and recommended a breakfast place to us as well as a calendar of current activities and events happening in town. My one and only let down was the bed was to firm for my liking but my fianc√© thought it was perfect. This was my first experience with using airbnb and it exceeded my expectation. Thank you Deeanne and Bill for having us as guests at your place y'all were wonderful ‚ù§Ô∏è
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Deeann‚Äôs place was wonderful. The home was easy to find and checkin was a breeze. The condo had everything we needed plus some extra amenities that made us feel right at home. Every space was clean. The morning was quiet, the area perfect for walking and exploring. This was the best Airbnb of our trip. I cannot recommend Deeann‚Äôs place enough. I would stay again in a heartbeat"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Deeanne and Bill‚Äôs rental is the absolute best! I stayed with my husband and our toddler and we were so comfortable. The location is close to downtown, in a safe neighborhood and convenient to shops and restaurants. The studio is clean, comfortable, private and fully stocked with everything you could possibly need. They even had refreshments in the fridge, a welcome basket and a book for my toddler available (which she loved). Deeanne also gave us helpful recommendations for activities in town prior to our arrival and was great with communication throughout our stay. My husband has to be in town monthly for work and we hope to stay here every time if available. Thanks so much Deeanne and Bill :)"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"This place was amazing! The studio apartment was immaculate, well appointed, quiet, and in a great location to walk to hiking trails or downtown to restaurants. Deanne and Bill were gracious hosts, extremely responsive to any questions or needs, and full of wonderful suggestions and recommendations. I couldn't have asked for more from them or the unit itself. I would highly recommend this rental to anyone passing through Helena for a brief or spending a week in town like myself. I could not imagine a more desirable place or friendlier hosts in the area."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Deeanne is an amazing host. Incredibly friendly and very responsive. Her place is spotless, cozy, safe and welcoming. We had everything we could need and more. The perfect size place for a couple.

We will surely stay there again on our next weekend away."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This was a wonderful stay. The place was comfortable and spotless. The attention to detail was wonderful with things such as a small welcome basket and clear instructions/local recommendations. Despite being close to the main house, it still feels private. I highly recommend a stay in the studio and will definitely look to do so again if I am ever passing back through Helena!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Places like this and hosts like Deeanne are why we usually choose Airbnb. I wish I could have stayed longer and I would completely recommend her and her place to future guests.
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Deeanne's place was exactly as advertised. She was responsive and extremely helpful. I will definitely use her again if available.
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great place! We stayed one night while making our from Yellowstone to Glacier. Private space with a genrous washroom. Deeanne was extremely accommodating and gave us some great recommendations.
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Really wonderful little spot that is impeccably outfitted with anything you could want or need. Very impressive construction and furnishings and the attention to detail as far as amenities was top-notch. I was marveling the whole time at the high quality of everything. We really wish we could have stayed longer than one night in this gem! And Helena is truly charming! We had a lovely evening and morning walk around town checking out the historical sights, Last Chance Gulch, and hunting for various murals. Just an all around fantastic experience!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,What an amazing apartment. So comfortable and very classy. We truly enjoyed visiting with Deanna and her husband. Loved the apartment and the views from upstairs. It was a perfect stay!!
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Everything was PERFECT! The guest house is amazing, incredibly clean and has loads of nice perks like coffee and local beers. The host was the most helpful I‚Äôve ever had in lots of AirBnb experience. She accommodated our early check in, setting the place for my toddler, local recommendations and just a friendly visit.
We will stay here every single summer."

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This place is exceptional. Really lovely, impeccably clean, well-designed space, in a great residential neighborhood. Excellent little deck outside to have coffee. This place has lots of thoughtful touches throughout. For example a small cooler you could use for a picnic, and there were even cooling bricks in the freezer ready to go. Really appreciated the 3 different ways to make coffee and a few snacks and beverages available. Perfect size for 1 or 2 people. I can't say enough good things about it, and Deanne was super responsive to all communications. I honestly wish I could have stayed more than one night. I plan to stay here again without a doubt."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Loved Deeanne‚Äôs place, it was very cozy and homey and it was close to downtown! Would definitely stay again. It was clean and there was plenty of space."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This place was perfect for our night to break up the drive between Glacier and Yellowstone. So comfortable and charming. Walking to restaurants, we checked our Brewhouse. Deeanne was so sweet with great suggestions in the area. We hope to return and spend more time in the area."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This was a great stay for the price. Good overall location, with clean and well kept area. Host was prompt and helpful. Wife and I would stay here again when in Helena. Bed was comfortable."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Deeanne is a kind and wonderful host! She communicated everything we needed to know regarding our stay and recommend some lovely places and events to check-out during our time in Helena. This was a home away from home experience and we could not be more thankful. We definitely look forward to returning one day! üòä
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Was a great and it was quiet! A little respite in my travels. The host was really flexible as this was my first time using AirBnB.com and thought when I clicked two days, i thought it was for 2 night stay. That was not the case and the host was very accommodating for the fact that the second night i need to stay, the day had been blocked out. She extended the trip for longer!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Already wrote a fantastic review! Loved this place!
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Deeanne‚Äôs place was wonderful, it was a great location within walking distance of downtown. It was clean and comfortable and the hosts were absolutely amazing, we wish we could have stayed longer but we will definitely be back!!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Beautiful location and a beautiful space. Will absolutely visit again. Thank you!
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Friendly hosts with a lovely place. Right next to Mt bike trail network. Thx for the suggestion to visit the pottery centre- well worth seeing.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Excellent place to stay in Helena
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Amazing views and close to the trails for hiking or biking! Only minutes from downtown. Very quiet and the owner was friendly.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Great location, close to town, beautiful view, lots of room in a small space! Was perfect for our family! Jessica was super helpful and great at communicating! We highly recommend if you‚Äôre in the area."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Had a wonderful visit. Host very responsive and helpful!
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,So worth the price! The place has a beautiful view of the surrounding area and is situated next to a lot of great hiking trails. We were able reach the top of Mt. Helena from the back door
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Blue Pine served as a wonderful home base for our trip to Helena. The host was incredibly helpful before we arrived and during our stay. The space is beautiful and the layout of the house is incredibly functional and cozy. I will absolutely be returning to Blue Pine, because this is my favorite Air B&B in Helena. If this space was available for rent and the host was a landlord? It's a no-brainer! I can't wait to visit again and I'm jealous I don't live there."
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Was a beautiful stay just a little hard to walk around with our labs so definitely would recommend with smaller animals during the winter season with the snow being so high. Tried to walk around the property and kept getting snow down my boots but very great interior, loved the coziness of this space and the window lighting was beautiful we barley even used the lights unless we needed them during the night."
2024-02-01,3.0,Stayed with kids,Everything about it was fine until I found black mold in all the windows and window sills. They had it wiped down after I notified them however knowing what I know about mold I probably would have handled it differently. Even after they had it wiped down it appeared like there may still be some black mold between some window trim and the walls on some of the windows. However I‚Äôm no expert and don‚Äôt claim to be one. Black mold is just a non negotiable for me. And I probably would have chosen to stay somewhere else but we are moving to the area and we‚Äôre on a budget. Everything else was fine. The views are beautiful. We were visited by deer daily. It was nice to feel secluded but be 2 minutes close to amenities. They were super responsive.
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The musicians had a wonderful stay - thank you so much for being so communicative and accommodating!
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Really a great place. Even though the the building is shared with artists on below floors, it didn‚Äôt pose a problem at all. Great scenery and still so close to town. Available parking for 2 vehicles. It‚Äôs a place we would book again."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,An absolute gem if you‚Äôre visiting Helena.
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Jice private location and very quiet and peaceful
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great little getaway close to town but feels miles away
2023-11-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"I loved my stay here, it was so clean and cozy. The views around the loft were beautiful and a short distance away from some amazing trails to hike, close to the hot springs, and just far enough outside of town where it was quiet and peaceful but you could still run into town for groceries or to go out to eat. The only thing i didn't love was that because the studio was right under you, you could hear one of the artists working. Pounding clay, moving things around and their music. The noise starts around 10am and quiets down around 8pm."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"It was cozy, easy to access and had a beautiful view. Plenty of pillows, blankets, towels and hot water. I would definitely stay there again during another Helena trip."

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Lovely place up in the hills. Do not let the phrase 3rd floor unnerve you. You actually only go up one flight of stairs to the apartment. The view is amazing and the apartment is beautiful. My teenagers argued over who got to stay in the loft.

2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"I love this sweet little studio- I feel like the pictures don't do it justice! It's very roomy with beautiful views. The road also links into a beautiful trail that wraps around Mt. Helena. An exceptionally comfortable space for my summer work travel, I've already had two stays and expect quite a few more!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We were in town for basketball and this place was cheaper than a basic hotel and so much nicer. It was perfect for me and my two teens (who fought over the loft) and would have fit the rest of my family comfortably as well. The location and views were great and the beds and bedding were very comfortable. We only live 90 min from Helena but if we find ourselves needing to spend the night there again for early/late sports, I will check availability here first."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"LOVED this place! It was cozy, the beds super comfy, the view is spectacular! The little extras from the owner show how much care goes into the your stay. The location is perfect beautiful scenic walk to downtown where there are so many great places to visit and eat.
Would highly recommend!!"
2023-05-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"We found Blue Pine very appealing to the eye, both inside as well as the surrounding view. It was the perfect place for busy days being out-and-about and coming back to eat and sleep. Very peaceful with a walking trail. The only fault we found was in the bathroom, which I feel may have been a fluke."
2023-05-01,5.0,Group trip,I love this placeüíñ
2023-05-01,5.0,Group trip,Rented this Airbnb for my father and uncle for Carroll‚Äôs graduation last week. It was perfect. Jessica was helpful and reach out to make we didn‚Äôt need anything. Would stay there again ‚ù§Ô∏è
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Great space, great communication, trail just up the road, interesting pottery studio below, very comfortable, looking forward to staying here again."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great place for a small group. Beautiful views.
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"What great views from both the studio and from the short hike up the road. Peaceful surrounding. Many amenities and easy to prepare great meals in the kitchen. Didn't miss the tv at all. Enjoyed communication with Adam and Jessica as well as Ryan, the other potter. The first night, my dog wasn't sure what to make of the quiet! Great place to share with my canine pal. Definitely recommend this studio and can see returning here for another visit in the future."
2023-04-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"Beautiful place to stay, I didn't realized when I booked it there was no TV and microwave, but that was my fault. Trouble flushing toilet, very slow.... Almost flooded."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"Our favorite thing about this rental was the fact that it was on the 3rd floor and had lot's of windows so there was a lofty feel to it. The view were lovely and peaceful. It was so nice to have mature pine trees outside the windows, in the view. Secondly, we loved that we were so close to the Mt. Helena trail system. We walked, biked and hiked most days of our 12 day stay. You can walk or bike on the trails to town and have lunch! The place was well stocked and very clean. We slept great on the king sized bed. Everything was described in the listing."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Absolutely wonderful stay! The loft was beautiful and spacious, with amazing views all around. Gorgeous kitchen! Super comfy beds, my kids loved the lofted bedroom.
The location is private and nestled in the hills with mountains all around. Perfectly quiet and peaceful, just what we were looking for. Yet, only a short drive right into downtown Helena and 1.5 miles from the hot springs.
All three mornings we were there, we saw groups of deer right by our window, and spent a lot of time watching them retreat into the hills. Just awesome.
Our hosts sent us a couple of messages during our stay to make sure we were settled in nicely and to see if we needed anything, very nice of them.
The loft was stocked with all the essentials one would need such as cookware, spices, coffee, tea, shampoo, hair dryer, etc.
The rate was also very reasonable. Definitely couldn‚Äôt have asked for anything better!"
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Thank you for the wonderful stay! Such a beautiful, private, peaceful location and stylish space. We enjoyed our trip."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Darling place to stay! Loved it. My kids loved the loft.
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Unique and warm. We really enjoyed our time‚Äîthe quiet and studio ‚Äútour‚Äùwere exceptional.
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I would definitely recommend Blue Pine! The place is very comfortable and inviting, super clean, plenty of windows to enjoy the natural light and trees, and in a quiet neighborhood. We loved this place and would highly recommend it to any travelers coming through Helena."
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Great location, great views! Thank you."
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"The place was comfortable and cozy. It‚Äôs a small loft, but there‚Äôs plenty of room for everyone. It‚Äôs kind of cool being above their art studio."
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,It is a great affordable place in a good location and the host was super nice and helpful.
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We loved our stay here, very peaceful and a beautiful view. Very easy access to town but feels like you are in a secluded location. We would definitely stay again!"
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is my second stay at this listing! I love the quiet, the views and the comfortable space. If you don't mind being a little out of town (not much at all), this is the perfect spot. Close to hiking trails and 10 minutes (tops) from downtown.
Jessica is very communicative and I will stay here again!"
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Wonderful stay‚ù§Ô∏è
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Great weekend getaway. On the edge of town close to the hot slrings and just a few minuted from anywhere else in town.
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,We really enjoyed our stay here! The setting is super tranquil and the space is well-outfitted with everything you could possibly need. We only stayed for one night but would have loved to stay longer.
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Thank you so much for being such generous and communicative hosts! I would recommend your place to anyone. We appreciate it SO much!
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Great place to stay
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"If you like light and views, this place is for you. I could stand and do dishes all day long because the view from the kitchen window was incredible. I asked my husband (king of the understatement) if he liked his shower. He said ""it wasn't bad"" (HIGH praise from him) and then followed it up with, ""good pressure, lots of water, I loved it."" It was so out of character, I wanted to check his temperature.
Seriously, it's a large studio (with a small loft I never visited). What I loved best was seeing the sky from all the windows and the quiet dirt road that it's located on. It was the perfect place for me to take a walk as it's in the hills but close enough to houses and people that I didn't feel isolated.
Jessica and her husband were very friendly and accommodating. They moved a vehicle so our dog-sitter had a place to park. We'd love to have spent more time there and would love to come back, if they'll have us. :-)"
2023-02-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Jessica's place is lovely and quiet which was just what I was looking for. I had one small issue, which was taken care of nearly instantly."
2023-02-01,5.0,Group trip,Wow! What a place to stay indeed! Beautiful scenery and a cozy spot. Goes absolutely above and beyond what I expected. Perfect!!! Would stay here again in a heartbeat!
2023-02-01,4.0,Stayed one night,Great location and fast communication
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Great spot all around, would recommend this stay 10/10"
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"The view is spectacular! It is not walkable to most things (and it isn't advertised as such), but if you don't mind an out of the way place (we sure didn't!) it is fantastic. We were just there for a quick overnight, but it would be an outstanding place to stay for an extended work trip... it's quiet, gorgeous, and there is a TON of space inside the place... there is a nice closet unit that would be great if you needed to unpack and stay a while. The bed was very comfortable and the linens were cozy. There were lots of towels available, and the kitchen appeared well appointed - we didn't need to use the kitchen, but it looked very workable. There is some uneven ground from the parking spot, across the yard, and up the approximately 20 stairs (which is explained in the listing). It's just something to keep in mind if someone has mobility issues."
2023-01-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,Cute little studio
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Very nice comfortable place in a beautiful quiet area and beautiful view. This very spacious feeling open floorplan small apartment on the top floor, kinda feels like a treehouse! üòÅ You can stand in the middle of the room and see out of windows on every side! 360¬∞ round view - like in a treehouse or a watch tower! üòÉüòâ (Maybe I've stayed in too many basement apartments!) That makes the place bright but still private feeling, because it's off ground level.
The owners are very friendly and helpful.
I would stay there again."
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,A great place to stay! Very clean and stocked with anything you need. We loved that it was close to town but we felt safe and tucked away. Such a cool spot. Would recommend to anyone.
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This was the cutest little studio! Very cozy and quiet, perfect for our weekend getaway"
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,The Veterinarian I had reserved this for really enjoyed her stay and said even the location was perfect.
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful views and a great price!
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is my second stay here for work. I love the home, the location, and the owners. I would never hesitate to stay here again!"
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"The place was cozy & quiet with all the essentials, and a view that‚Äôs hard to beat! Jessica & Adam were super responsive, friendly, and helpful if I had any questions. A hidden gem in Helena, MT!"
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Probably one of our favorite stays in Helena to date. The location was peaceful and almost magical with fresh snow and breathtaking views. It was exactly what we needed to start our 10 day vacation before we flew out of Montana. I had one day of remote work from the Airbb and WiFi worked great for zoom calls and e-mail. The house is stocked with everything you need for a very restorative stay. The hosts were kind and we enjoyed touring the pottery studio. We couldn't have asked for more.
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Exactly as described. Would stay again anytime. Thank you!
2022-11-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"The place is absolutely lovely, from the layout and furnishings to the view.
Our only complaint is that it was rather loud from below during one day of our stay. Someone must have been working in the studio, there was music and banging for most of the day. This might not be too bothersome for some folks, but we have an infant who needed naps.
Also, there is no microwave. They weren‚Äôt misleading and didn‚Äôt say there would be, but they are so commonplace you just assume a rental would have one.
Otherwise, communication was great and the location is fabulous."
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"If you like interesting places and a rural feeling close to town, this is perfect. The space is clean, new, has a comfortable bed and an amazing view. No microwave or television, but hiking and biking right there. Be aware that it is on the 2nd floor and the stairs are steep."
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Jessica and Adam‚Äôs place was wonderful! We didn‚Äôt have much time there, but they were very accommodating with our changing travel schedule. The space was very clean and cozy and had a beautiful view of the valley."
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Really great space. Clean, well designed and decorated, great view, and awesome location."
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The beds were super comfy and everyone on the property was very friendly! The only thing I would say is that the shower water pressure wasn't very good, but that's really not a big deal in the grand scheme of things. The kitchen has a fantastic view of the mountains. The property is also super close to the hot springs if that's important to you!"
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This studio was perfectly clean and as cozy as could be. Check in was super easy and even though it‚Äôs a shared property I was given 100% privacy. Hosts provided coffee and tea which was much appreciated. Waking up and drinking coffee with the Mountain View was just what I needed for my quick stay in Helena. Just a couple minutes from town and the studio was super easy to find! Will definately stay again if ever in Helena
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We had a great stay! Everything was cozy, comfortable and really lovely. Would stay here again!"
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I cannot recommend this place enough. The loft had a wonderful, welcoming vibe, great views, superb decor and was so clean! Our visit to Helena was not under cheerful circumstances, but having the loft to come back to at the end of the day was a relaxing, calming space to rest. I want to invent a reason to visit Helena again so that I can spend more time in this amazing loft under better circumstances. Our interactions with Jessica and Adam were great and informative, but not overwhelming. Do yourself a favor, book this one right now!"
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,I loved being so close to hiking trails and in this beautiful studio apartment! So many thoughtful touches and lovely view!!
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Well appointed natural beauty. Lovely hospitality.
2022-10-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"We will be back, great place!"
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Jessica‚Äôs place is beautiful, cozy and well-equipped. The morning views from the bed and kitchen were spectacular. The location is a short drive from town. We were able to tour the pottery studio below, it was fascinating. I would highly recommend Jessica‚Äôs place."
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very comfortable and quiet stay! I loved how peaceful this place was while still being close to the highway and town.
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is a cute place to stay that feels off of the beaten path (it is off of a gravel road), but is still close to town, which is convenient. The apartment is above an artist's studio as noted in the description, during the evening and earlier morning hours it is quiet, but during the day if you are planning to stay in or sleep late, you can hear some occasional noise from downstairs. A couple of other things to note: it does not have a microwave or TV. These were not a huge issue for us, but may be drawbacks for some. Overall, we enjoyed our time there, loved the windows as they allow lots of light into the space and also provided beautiful sunset views."
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Everything was wonderful! The place was beautiful as was the view out of the window above the kitchen sink. I would recommend a stay here to anyone and would happily stay again üôÇ
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Wonderful stay! I wish we could‚Äôve stayed longer, after peeking into the ceramics shop below the Airbnb space‚Äîholy cow, what a talented artist! The space was immaculate, bright, open, and very comfortable. Check in was super easy and our hosts were so communicative and accommodating with parking. Thanks for a fantastic stay!"
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Great view of the valley out the kitchen window, especially as the deer grazed in the evening . Wonderful stay for the value! The ability to rest a few days and have laundry and cooking access was a huge benefit as we continued on our travels."
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Clear check in instructions. Clean and lovely place. Good for a quick stop on road trip. Would highly recommend.
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Really enjoyed our stay at Jessie and Adam's place. Really sweet apartment and they clearly have thought through all of the details. Adam gave us a tour of his pottery studio and there was a deer in our front yard to greet us when we arrived! Highly recommended and will stay again next time we are in town.
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We had checked in in the afternoon and didn't realize the pottery studio is just below the apartment so we weren't too sure what some of the noise was at first. However, Adam was great at communicating and quickly let me know that they were just working on some bigger pottery peices and would be wrapping up soon. By the time our trip was over we had met the other artist doing some work there...got to see some of the process and even purchased a couple pieces. We were in town to see a great show (Josh Turner), but then got such a cool experience at the studio apartment in addition...what a bonus! We would stay again for sure! Sidenote: It was quiet in the morning and evening hours...had a beautiful view and was very relaxing."
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful view, wonderfully stocked, great location, peaceful and quiet. We needed a last minute stay and found a gem. Will be back another time."
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We had a wonderful stay! Very close to downtown Helena, but in a nice, quiet area. Host was responsive and the place was very clean and well stocked! Would love to stay again!"
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Great location, easy access off of main thoroughfare in Helena, yet away from noise and busyness. Adam was accommodating when we asked to delay our checkout by an hour. We were there on the hottest day of the year in Helena, so the apartment was warm with no A/C, but fans took most of the heat out. Very comfortable- would stay there again."
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We loved the Air BnB!! Will definitely stay again if we are ever back in Helena.
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Adam's place was perfect for us. He had everything we needed to cook multiple meals prepping for a week of camping, which is hard to find in many airbnbs. Good knives and pots and pans and bakeware .... pretty much everything. And a lovely spacious setup with gorgeous views, to boot. There are stairs to climb to the entrance and it can ba a bit warm in the day without AC if the weather is hotter than usual, but the fans and the evening air cooled the place down nicely. I highly recommend Adam's place. Adam was very helpful and kind, looking for additional cookware, should we have needed it."
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We loved this place! Such a clean and special earthy vibe. Loved all the beautiful wood shelves and window trims and gorgeous wood kitchen counters. It all looks handmade with SKILL. Beautiful craftsmanship in this artist loft apartment. The big open space is so easy to hang in. And the morning view out into the valley is spectacular. We could easily stay there for longer but sadly had to fly out the next day. Thanks for also making our late check in super easy - it allowed us extra time visiting Glacier Park. Oh! And it was a comfie firm king sized bed. Thanks for sharing this home!
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,The place was nice and comfortable.
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great stay! Clean with a beautiful view!
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Adam‚Äôs place is lovely!! Very spacious and bright during the day. Loved the loft bed. Extremely comfortable space.
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Wonderful place to stay. Had the opportunity to stay here twice this summer and both times it was very clean, and comfortable, and had everything we needed for our stay. Love the location, nice and quite with nice views of the valley. Walking distance to hiking trails, and just a short drive to downtown. Looking forward to staying here again on our future trips to Helena."
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We loved our stay here, great location spacious room and communication was great from the host Jessica."
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This is a super cute stay if you need to be near Helena but still want pretty views and quiet.
2022-08-01,4.0,Stayed one night,Very beautiful and comfortable place
2022-07-01,3.0,Stayed one night,"Communication was poor. We almost didn't get our code before arriving for bedtime. There is no air conditioning and one of the fans didn't work, but it eventually cooled down. Everything is clean, the space is good quality, and it's a good distance from Helena."
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We stayed here one night during our drive back to Canada from Yellowstone National Park. We were tired when we arrived as we had spent 4 days hiking around Yellowstone during a heat wave so we were looking forward to some rest. This place was exactly what we needed. Adam's place is worth 5 stars for the view from the kitchen window alone. The apartment was quiet, spacious and peaceful. Our two kids (10 and 8 years old) loved the loft space. Just be aware the apartment is on the second floor so it's not a place I would recommend for my elderly parents or anyone with mobility issues. There is no air conditioning but there were plenty of windows that open so there was a nice cool cross breeze in the apartment during the evening. There was no TV but we had our own tablets/laptops and the wifi speed was fine for all our streaming needs. I should also note there was no microwave but there is a nice gas range. We were too tired to cook so we got takeout instead. Lots of dining/takeout choices located within a 5 to 10 minute drive from the apartment. It was a wonderful stay. We highly recommend Adam's place!"
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful studio with walking access to Mt. Helena trails!
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This is a nice comfortable space to spend a few days‚Äîquite and peaceful, clean and pleasant."
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This studio loft was great! Clean, airy and great views! This place makes you feel like your in the mountains but it‚Äôs close to shopping and restaurants. We booked it the day of our stay so there was a little confusion at check in but it was resolved quickly and Adam was apologetic. We only wished we were staying more then one night so we could have explored the trails around the loft a little more."
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great place and location! Everything was as it said it was.
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Great views, good location, nice place to stay. We were there on a particularly hot day but the breeze cooled it off well at night! Thanks"
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We enjoyed a wonderful stay with Adam. Such a beautiful location! The space was stocked with everything we needed and the sleeping arrangements were perfect.
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We very much enjoyed staying at Jessica's and Adam's beautiful place. This is a spacious and well-equipped loft with gorgeous views in a quiet neighborhood, minutes away from downtown Helena. If you're looking for a special stay in Helena, look no further."
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"What a great space to stay a few days in Helena! We stayed here for a refresher in the middle of 3 weeks of tent camping in a few National Parks. The beds were comfy, plenty of space for the 5 of us (2 adults and 3 kids/teens), and the studio was clean and cute. We really enjoyed the view from the kitchen window, too! Adam was friendly, helpful and responded quickly to any questions or issues."
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Minimalistic and artsy. Comfy beds. Nice space Could live in this spot it‚Äôs so welcoming. Hosts are friendly. Would stay here again
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"This is a great loft spot just on the edge of Helena. We were able to do laundry and it was a quick 5 min drive to restaurants and the theatre.
Gorgeous views and a nice hiking trail you can do right from the home."
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This Airbnb is in a beautiful location, on a quiet property, and is close to town. Directions were clear and check-in was very easy!"
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,The space was spotless and had plenty of room for four plus a dog. It‚Äôs conveniently located and sits near a walking path. We would definitely stay here again.
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Our stay here was great!!! Very easy to check in and communication was wonderful. Place was clean and stocked, we felt right at home. Location to Helena can‚Äôt be beat! Loved our time spent here!"
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This is one of the most beautifully and practically designed spaces I‚Äôve ever seen. As soon as we entered, we were struck by how nice, thoughtful, and cleanly entered everything was. Beds were comfy, kitchen had everything we needed, bathroom was nice, blinds blocked out all the light, and the heating unit worked like a dream - to list just a few. Perfect place - wish we had stayed longer!"
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Cool location, and clean. Not riddled with unnecessary rules!"
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great views around the Airbnb. My guys enjoyed a morning walk up the mountain road. They also saw a little chipmunk in the grass by the Airbnb. Everything you need to enjoy your stay.
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,LOVED this stay! Would recommend to our friends and family if they ever travel to Helena. Hosts were helpful and friendly!

2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This is a jewel of a place. Every window you look through shows the beauty of Montana. A lovely walk into the hills just up the road. Adam and Jesse are wonderful hosts. Definitely a place we would return to again and again.
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,What a wonderful stay! The loft is cozy and charming. The view from the kitchen is breathtaking. Jessica and Adam were so helpful and even helped return an item left behind. Such a great place!

2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Such a peaceful setting still very close to downtown Helena. Loved the views across the valley to Sleeping Giant and the nearby trail access to the system that surrounds Mt. Helena. Also so close to Broadwater Hot Springs. Comfortable beds and lots of kitchen extras!
2022-04-01,5.0,Group trip,"Jessica and Adam were so lovely! We had car troubles and they did not hesitate to not only check that we would arrive in time, but also let us stay a bit longer the next day in order to figure it out. Not to mention the studio itself was so cute, perfectly clean, and had amazing views. Would definitely recommend this place to stay if you‚Äôre in Helena!"
2022-04-01,5.0,Group trip,10/10
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I booked this place for my parents to have a weekend getaway, and it was a great choice! They had a wonderful time and the hosts were so accommodating!"
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Love the open floor scheme and loft. Also it‚Äôs clear they did not just stuff the place with second hand furnishings and kitchen utensils. It was really a nice stay.
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place! Clean and comfortable! Will stay again!
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful views!! Enjoyed cooking meals in the well stocked kitchen with quality cooking supplies and big windows. Near Broadwater Hot Springs where we enjoyed a nice hot soak under the stars on a cold evening. Would love to stay again!
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Love the edge of town, close to trails location. Super quiet, lots of privacy. Great bed!"
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Awesome views. Felt really unique with the set up and I personally really enjoyed it. If you plan on using the TV, bring an HDMI chord and your computer to stream anything. Super pretty too and had enough space for my guest and I. Would stay here again."
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Cute, clean, comfortable and wonderful views. We very much enjoyed our stay. Exactly what we were looking for."
2022-02-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Cute loft with beautiful views!
2022-02-01,5.0,Group trip,This studio is adorable! We only stayed for one night but absolutely loved it. It was super clean and comfortable. It's close enough to town but still feels fairly secluded. I would highly recommend it to anyone
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This is a great little apartment set up in a quaint area of Helena. Hiking trails nearby and the hot springs is not far down the road, which was a nice perk.
Great communicators, we did show up right at check in time because we wanted to get our son down for a nap, and they said they were running a little behind on cleaning, but it didn‚Äôt take long and things looked great for us.
The apartment had comfortable bedding, a very well stocked kitchen with utensils and a nice variety of coffee and tea, and lovely views out the windows. We would definitely stay here again if we travel to Helena again. We also really appreciate not heavily scented detergents, it‚Äôs always nice to use clean bedding that has a very neutral smell, unlike some of the Airbnb‚Äôs we have stayed in that used really strong smelling detergents. That always makes me really happy and sleep well when I‚Äôm not smelling something that is too strong for my preference.
Thank you guys!"
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Beautiful views! Great for a quick stay.
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,wonderful location with beautiful views

2022-02-01,4.0,Stayed one night,Cute studio apartment with lots of nice touches and amenities to make your stay enjoyable! Beautiful views!
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This studio loft is as described. It is clean, well-stocked, directions were good. There was ice/snow on road but good tires worked just fine. Nice views from the kitchen window, good beds/good sleep. We had a toddler with us. Blocked the stairs to the loft for her and otherwise the space is quite toddler-proof! Thank you!"
2022-02-01,4.0,Stayed one night,Such a cozy and well stocked loft! Wonderful views as well!
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Everything was easy; from selecting the place to check in to check out. we enjoyed our stay and loved the views. It was great being close to base and the hot springs. All the necessities of being home, like a hair dryer, coffee maker, coffee supplies (may have been left over from someone else), shampoo, conditioner. I was worried about the stairs but they were easy to get up and the view was worth it."
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,My friends had a wonderful stay!
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Such a charming place! Be prepared to climb the stairs to the Studio and definitely make sure you have a vehicle that likes snow if you come in winter weather. The view from the kitchen is SO incredibly beautiful ! Talk about a peaceful place to chill and be creative! Comfy bed and well supplied. Wish we had been able to stay longer to really take in the relaxing atmosphere! My teenager loved the loft space! Will definitely book in again at a later date. Such an incredible find and so glad it was available when we needed it!
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Great location and lovely place. Our son loved the loft!
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Easy location with an awesome view. Friendly and communicative hosts. All the essentials for a comfortable stay and some nice extras that made it even better.
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Excellent place
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Great spot with many nice touches. Amazing hiking/running/riding opportunities just up the road. We had a great stay!
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This was a quiet and fun location nestled in near some hiking opportunities. It‚Äôs just down the road from the hot springs, which was a bonus for us. The views from the windows were beautiful!
If you want away from the hustle and bustle of town or something a bit more open than a cramped hotel room, this is a great little spot! Our daughter, 3 year old, loved exploring the loft and all around it."
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place was wonderful! And Jessica was very responsive. On our last day we decided we wanted to extend our stay and she responded to our request within the hour.
The studio is delightfully arranged to maximize space. It was very comfortable and full of natural light. The kitchen had just about everything you could think of - we even prepared some of our Thanksgiving side dishes there and it was as comfortable as being in our own kitchen.
This is a wonderful place to relax, drink coffee, make meals, take in the views...it was perfect for us (but if you're looking to veg out in front of the TV, you'll want to find another spot. It's not laid out for that).
I definitely recommend this place and will hope to stay here again when we're visiting friends in Helena!"
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,This is a wonderful location with a great view.
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This is a wonderful location to stay. The listing is accurate, the only thing I would clarify before going is where the washer/dryer are located- I didn‚Äôt see them in the unit itself, but maybe they‚Äôre downstairs & available for use.
The directions are easy to follow even when arriving at night, the king bed is comfortable & the heater kept the space very warm. It was great for a night in town, close to everything & would be more than enough room for a longer stay! The view was wonderful!"
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My stay was exceptional! There are so many homey, thoughtful touches to this studio and it‚Äôs just as spacious as it appears in photo. It was the perfect place to unwind, sip some tea and enjoy the picturesque scenery through the big kitchen window. I lost my key on day 2 and they were great at taking care of that. Really good people who you can tell have put a lot of thought into creating such a sweet space. Five Stars all the way‚ú®."
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Lots of extras in the kitchen for cooking/preparing food. Lots of wildlife right out the back windows. A public access trail nearby makes it easy for a quick hike or trail run. Dog friendly makes it really easy to stay, stairs are steep so senior dogs may have a harder time getting up to the top."
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,It was a lovely stay in this studio loft! The view in the morning is beautiful looking out across the valley!
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Really good people, with a studio loft that overlooks the mountains of Montana"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"What a beautifully appointed place! The fixtures and everything provided is incredibly high quality and thoughtful, especially if you are bringing a dog. The water bowl was full, there was a full container of treats above the sink, extra leashes, and an incredible toy collection -- you name it, my dog was not wanting for it. She also loved the access to the side yard through the doggie door. The bed is comfy, the tea is collection and quality is excellent, the shower is very nice, etc. etc. And all of this is just a few blocks from all of the downtown Helena amenities. Can't recommend Nicki's place enough, honestly!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"I‚Äôve been to many bnbs, this was by far my pup and I‚Äôs favorite! Super great space for dogs and is super comfortable - Nicki is an awesome host, responds quickly and cares about the guest. I 100% recommend staying at this spot!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I had stayed one night and loved the space. It was very comfortable, with everything I needed. The description says it all. I would stay here again!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place within easy walking distance to downtown
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"I‚Äôve stayed in Airbnbs around the world, and this has to be a new favorite. The space is thoughtfully designed and clean. I had my dog with me for work, which is a big reason I booked this pet friendly space. The details were adorable and appreciated - a welcome basket with dog towels and toys, a treat bin in the kitchen, leashes, a dog bed, and a full water bowl. The private fenced in yard gave me peace of mind when we were walking around town. The location can‚Äôt be beat - great accessibility to trails, food and drink. I hope I work in Helena again soon so we can stay again!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great host!
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"This was easily the best airbnb either myself or my girlfriend have ever stayed at. Definitely the best my dog has ever stayed at too! Nicki‚Äôs attention to detail for the four-legged guests was amazing and so refreshing. And the place itself was amazing! The decor was subtle yet incredibly tasteful, the use of space was amazing, down to the swivel TV, bathroom tile, reading lights above the bed, it was all so perfect. Also, the bed was incredibly comfortable, and all three of us slept so so well. Couldn‚Äôt recommend this place enough, and the only negative I have to say about it is that we only had one night to stay. We could easily have stayed here for a week, or even longer honestly! If we are ever back in Helena we will absolutely be staying here!"
2024-05-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,Nicki‚Äôs place was so cute and welcoming. The studio is in a walkable neighborhood with many shops near by. Nicki was a responsive and friendly host. I would definitely recommend.
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Fantastic place! Super cute, modern, clean and dog friendly with a little yard for the pups. The house is walkable to restaurants and the Walking Mall. Nicki was very communicative and flexible. Loved this place, highly recommend."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,It was perfect.
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Nice studio appt that‚Äôs super clean and right in the downtown area.
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I would 100% stay here again the next time I'm in Montana! Parking was right across the street of the studio making it easy to be in and out. We only needed our car to travel farther distances, though the location of this Airbnb is a 5 minute walk (or less) from all the local bars, restaurants, and shops! Nice and quiet too (plus, the daybed was extremely comfortable)!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We stayed at Amy‚Äôs while in tow for Don‚Äôt Fence Me In. It was a 5 minute walk to the start of the race. The perfect location to anything you might want to do.
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Amy was a great host. Clean and peaceful stay. Will definitely book again!
2024-06-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,"The apartment was spacious and clean and the bed was very comfortable. The proximity to downtown was great. You could walk everywhere. Very close to Mount Helena and Mount Ascension trails for hiking.
Couple of things to note: Entrance to apartment is not the easiest. After climbing to the second floor you have to stop at a door, enter a code to a lockbox to get the key to unlock the door which is heavy and not easy to open. You then have to put the key back into the lockbox walk down the hallway to the actual apartment and then use a digital code to enter. This process was the same every time you came and went. It would be nice to just be able to keep the key for the duration of the stay and then place it back in the lockbox before leaving but we weren‚Äôt sure if other apartments were using this same method so we replaced it in the lockbox each time as instructed which after 4 nights became quite annoying.
If you need a fairly quiet atmosphere to sleep this place would not be for y"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Our new go to for our quick trips to Helena. Perfect location. Cute and clean.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great apartment in an awesome location. Highly recommend!
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great location!
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This was a perfect place to stay. I went to Helena for a wedding and felt immediately comfortable at Amy‚Äôs place! It was right in the heart of everything and parking was right across the street. It was very clean and quiet. I will definitely stay there again!
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Amy was very friendly and provided several recommendations for establishments in the area. Quaint and clean suite.
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Our stay at Amy's place was fabulous! It was super clean, cute, and attention to detail for a restful stay was evident. From the linens, kitchen ware, and best of all the extremely comfortable bed! Thank you for everything Amy."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We really enjoyed this apartment! The location, the space and the building were all beautiful. We had everything we needed and it was remarkably quiet considering that it is above a restaurant and in the city center. Very nice!"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My newest favorite option in Helena. Perfect location. Perfect for a solo traveler. Cute studio, exactly as described. Clean. Well appointed. Easy parking options. Patio is great with the nice weather!! Friendly host. Hope to make this my new go-to option when in Helena."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Excellent! Clean, comfortable, good value and secure!"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,So conveniently located to lots of restaurants and shops. The apartment is compact and has nice amenities. I loved that Amy left me local coffee and tea. Such a nice touch.
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"It was nice , and right above a restaurant that i was dying to try the food smelled grear"
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The location was perfect for downtown adventuring!
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My wife and I had a great time at Amy‚Äôs space. It was walking distance to so many restaurants and cafes. And it was cozy and comfortable for the evenings we stayed in. If we‚Äôre ever in Helena again, we would very likely stay there. Highly recommend."
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Very comfortable, clean, nicely decorated. It‚Äôs right downtown, walking distance from good restaurants and taverns. Amy was very responsive."
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"One word: LOCATION! If you want to enjoy Downtown Helena, this is the place to stay. Walking distance from everything that you need for a relaxing weekend, an amazing place to stay, and the right price! Looking forward to come back! Thanks!"
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Really bright, inviting living space on a couple of very cold, snowy days in January. Was able to cook a simple dinner one evening, and eat at On Broadway downstairs the other night--easy and cozy.
Parking was easy in the lot across the street, free from 5pm to 8 am, and $1/hr. during the day. Enjoyed walking for coffee and breakfast at The Hub on the ped. mall just around the corner."
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Super nice place. Very clean. Comfortable and well equipped.
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Amy was amazing! Wonderful place and wonderful host. Thank you Amy - I‚Äôll see you again soon!
2024-01-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"We loved it!!! Perfect for our occasion and just the right amenities we were looking for. Minus the fact that the dishwasher wasn‚Äôt working. We ate at home almost the whole time so that was a pain in the butt. Other than that, everything was smooth sailing!"
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"Here‚Äôs the thing. I locked myself out of the place ‚Ä¶ ON CHRISTMAS DAY. Amy was super quick to respond, come by and I was in, easy peasy. From there, I can‚Äôt say enough for the price, I was able to iron a shirt, had plenty of towels and Montago Coffee is about a block and a half away one way, and a Bakery is a block and a half the other. Amazing food is just below, and while I stayed in a chillier part of the year, the porch was still gorgeous. If you need a place to stay that‚Äôs easy to get to anywhere in Helena, look no further."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Excellent place.
Incredibly clean.
Beautiful decor
Comfortable bed
Excellent value"
2023-12-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,Very nice place. Loved the bed.
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Thank you for the stay wee love it
2023-12-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"VERY clean, tidy place, comfortable bed. Studio, living room is the bedroom. I was originally planning on traveling with a coworker, and this is advertised as having 2 beds. I‚Äôm very glad my coworker canceled on me, as there is only one bed with a small pull-out mattress under it. We would have had zero privacy, so I‚Äôd recommend only booking this property with someone you are comfortable sleeping in very close quarters with.
Location is AMAZING! Very close to the walking street. Of course this means there was loud music late into the night, but that‚Äôs not unexpected downtown. Also it is right above a restaurant, and the smell of Italian food coming into the apt was very strong, a little off putting.
Amy was VERY communicative the day of check-in, but then when I had an (albeit minor) issue the next day, it did take her a while to get back to me.
Overall nice place to stay."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,I hosted Thanksgiving.. I would even for just everyday stays stock the kitchen a bit more with cookware for the oven. There were no casserole dishes so I had to go buy some.. There was also not a rolling pin..Just a few extra kitchen essentials . Otherwise the place was very clean and host was super responsive. Super cute..Tiny little kitchen but fine for an overnight or just a few nights for one person
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,The apartment was perfect for me. Lots of places to eat and have coffe within walking. The restaurant below was very good and not noisy at all. I loved the balcony and look forward to sitting out there in the spring when I return. The bedding was very high quality and delightful to sleep in. I am a single woman and I felt very safe coming and going at night.
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,I came to visit my grandson at Helena College an I could walk to the college without any problems
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great location, extremely reasonable price, just overall beautiful spot."
2023-10-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Everything was great! The only thing to make our stay more enjoyable was the refrigerator was very noisy and made it difficult to get a good nights sleep. Other than that no complaints.
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,I loved staying here! We were in town for a soccer tournament. And it was perfect because it was within walking distance of multiple restaurants. The place was exactly as Amy had posted. And it was super clean and a cute little space. I would definitely stay here again. Great balcony to sit and have coffee on.
2023-10-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Cool place in a great old building, which means it has lots of character but you get a little noise from the other units and the access is a little funky. Nothing to complain about unless you don‚Äôt like the smell of amazing food from the restaurant down below!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Amy‚Äôs place was centrally located to all shops and restaurants in downtown Helena. I was there for work, and extremely close to where I had to go.

2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Amy's place was perfect. Such a great location and really perfect for 2 people. Nice deck to sit out on and plenty of room on the inside. Everything was well stocked. I would stay at Amy's again.
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Felt right at home, a great place to work during the day at the kitchen table, the beds and linens were of really nice quality.

With any type of questions I may have had, Amy was always quick to answer, and ready to try her best to make me feel as close to home as possible."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"For anyone wanting to enjoy DT Helena this is the perfect spot
We wish we could have stayed a few more nights.
Parking was easy. There is a public lot directly across the street for only $1/hour and the first hour is free. So we had until 9 AM to pay.
We will very likely be back again"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place with lots to due and just steps away from downtown Helena. The On Broadway Rest in the same building was amazing. Had a great Rib Eye on night and Pork Chops the next. The room was spotless and comfortable. I will be back !!!

2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great studio in great location. This was just as described and in pictures. Interior is beautiful, clean and very well designed & organized. I wanted for nothing, it had everything I needed. At night, it was quiet and I got great sleep. I will definitely book again when I come back!"

2023-04-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Wonderful, clean spot with perfect location downtown. Host was understanding when I messaged about my inability to get the trash out. The parking part can be tricky buy there's always a workaround."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Location was perfect. Could walk to everything I wanted to. I also appreciated that there were plenty of extra towels and linens which I don‚Äôt usually get at air bnb‚Äôs. Only downside is if you want to park right next to the building you have to pay Mon - Fri between 8-5, but it‚Äôs cheap. 10/10 would stay again"
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great studio apartment in the heart of downtown Helena. Clean, affordable and the host was easy to get a hold of. Side note: If you are 6 foot tall or taller you may not fit well in the day bed, although bottom hide-a-bed can be slide out and used."

2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"very clean, great location"
2023-04-01,2.0,Stayed a few nights,"During my five-day stay, there was a lot of noise that made it difficult for me to relax. I am from Helena and I knew that On Broadway, the restaurant located directly below the apartment, was a lively place. However, the issue wasn't the patrons, but rather the staff. They played very loud music while prepping for work and after work during the clean-up phase. On one occasion, I had to go down and tell them to turn it down at 11:30 pm on a weekday. In addition, the neighbor with the adjoining unit was a video game player and would often play a very loud game, even at 3:00 am. Although the apartment itself is lovely, the noise level is just too high."
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Awesome location and very comfortable and clean! Loved being right downtown and close to shopping and restaurants. Appreciated the fresh and updated accommodations!
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Our stay at Amy's place was excellent. It was in a great location, had all the amenities we could want and was the perfect place to relax after our long days.

2023-02-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is a quaint spot that's exactly what you see in the photos. I ended up getting stranded in Helena and she was gracious accommodating and helpful when I had to hold over. Beautiful interior. I did struggle with the shower and one of my greatest joys in life is a hot shower (its on a boiler and shares hot water with the restaurant below), but be honest with yourself about how reasonable the price is and for the price this was everything I needed.
This was an angst filled trip for me so I worried about the lack of dedicated parking, but it turns out there was plenty (there's a great lot just west of the building).
She's a great host, and this was a nice spot."

2023-09-01,4.0,Stayed one night,Love it. Only thing that stood out a little was the bathroom was a little smelly and that made it unpleasant. I would not let that deter anyone from staying there though. It was very nice.
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I loved everything about our stay, everything was well thought out including the way the outdoor bathroom and shower was built, as well as the cabins with our beautiful views beyond them.

Added to my favorites :)"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This is such a cute place! So unique and peaceful. Great location. The hand soap smelled SO good. They really did think of everything. From the pour over coffee to the folding table provided. I loved that they had eye masks by the bed, because the moon was so bright when we stayed. The outdoor shower was luxurious! Overall I‚Äôd definitely go back. Just wish the AC worked."

2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Epic back-to-nature camp! This is a great spot for a retreat in the woods that blends the best of camping and a unique tiny house experience. Orofino does a nice job curating the experience. Good host communication.
There is neighboring house quite close to the spot that you can't see in the pictures, but it didn't take too much away from the experience."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The photos don‚Äôt do it justice. There was ample firewood, great amenities, and we had a blast. Close to town so you can enjoy food and activities, and far enough out that you feel completely out of the city. There was an issue with the AC unit on out A frame but everything else was so great it‚Äôs hard to remove anything because of it. We would go back in a heartbeat."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great secluded area that was well worth the stay. All the facilities were clean and very nice. The host put a lot of time into this setup and it shows. Allie was very quick with responding and was a great host.
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Overall the place was great the only thing I would keep in mind is that the bathroom has no screen around it so bugs are absolutely everywhere. Other than that it‚Äôs gorgeous exactly like the pictures and a quick drive to many local spots.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Just a few minutes to downtown Helena yet still very peaceful & private surroundings. Loved the quality of the provided amenities, very comfortable beds & soft towels. Camping with all the comforts of a hotel experience."

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We loved staying at Allies A-Frame cabins. The details were so thoughtful and the experience amazing! Checkin and communication outstanding. It was a highlight of our 30 day road trip!! Kids stayed in one A frame and I stayed in the other. We brought walkie talkies which was so fun!!! Thank you.

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,What an experience! A great combination of camping and hotel amenities. The campsite was very private and in beautiful condition.

2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Allie‚Äòs place was one of the most enjoyable experiences we‚Äôve had to date. You feel like camping but enjoy a nice bed plus air-conditioning, and hotel amenities. You‚Äôre only 10 minutes from downtown Helena. It has an awesome bakery at the bottom of the hill (for coffee and
Pastrys), restaurants, coffee shops, and cool places everywhere. We loved the workout room and bike accessibility if you want to get some exercise. There are plenty of trails and beautiful scenery that surround this property.
If you want to enjoy the great outdoors with the amenities of a hotel room. This is the place.
It‚Äôs such a fantastic set up.
Thanks for the superb hosting Allie. Keep up the great work."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Loved it! As described. We will be back to stay again!

2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"The Oro Fino A Frame cabins was the perfect staycation for our family of 4. We had never been ""glamping"" so to speak before and we could've showed up with clothing and everything else was taken care of.
The thoughtfulness was clear at every turn to showcase nature, clever storage and architectural design. The less is more vibe paired perfectly with the environment.
The gear room picnic supplies and playing cards were utilized to make this a cozy, active, relaxing and enjoyable weekend.
Oro Fino hits all the bases for enjoying the outdoors and appreciating some major comforts at the same time! Looking forward to returning as our family grows up."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I‚Äôve stayed at airbnbs in South Africa, Paris, Costa Rica, etc- and this place was by far my favorite! Stunning location, everything we needed was there. The host had thought of everything! I will def come back!!"

2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place for couples and families! Would totally go back!!!
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We had an amazing stay in the A-Frames, they felt brand new and are super comfy and relaxing. The interior design was very cool, nice blend of cabin/western style with modern design touches. My wife and I couldn't agree if these were glamping or a cabin. For me having air conditioning puts this in the cabin realm, but she thought having to go to the bathhouse to use the toilette was more in the glamping style. Inside, the big triangle wall window was amazing and looks out on pristine forest. Our bed was comfy and there were power outlets on both sides so we could plug in. The bath house was very nice, the pump toilette was clean and didn't smell at all. The outdoor shower was amazing, very private, but still felt special showering under the big pine trees. The weather was hot , so we didn't get to use the fire pit, but it was large and had nice camp chairs around it. You could tell the hosts put a lot of thought into the guest experience, we had a coffee kit, fly swatter, magnetic door screen, games, speaker, bear spray and eye masks stocked. Very cool experience, I'm sure we'll be back."

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Jan's little place was more than perfect for just an easy one night stay, but could easily accommodate longer if needed. Spotless and well equipped with a crazy comfy bed and a great morning coffee and tea selection, as well as ideally located close to shopping and main roadways to get you wherever you need quickly. Very easy to check in and a quiet neighborhood. The homemade cookies and banana bread were an added plus! I couldn't recommend this place more. We will definitely be back."

2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I've stayed at Jan's place several times. One of the features I love about it is the consistency of comfort, cleanliness, and coziness.

2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,My wife and I loved it!
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Bring your slippers and comfy pants and enjoy the cozy little cabin. It‚Äôs a quiet spot out of town with trees and open area nearby. The cabin is well furnished with everything you probably need, we enjoyed ourselves and cooking a meal. The hosts were responsive and accommodating."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Kallie was super friendly, and her tiny cabin was clean, adorable and comfortable! We especially loved the kitchen set up with farm fresh eggs and oatmeal. We made soup on a chilly fall evening, and the kitchen had everything we needed! The cabin is slightly closer to the hostesses home than it appears in the photos, however it still felt super private. We loved seeing their chickens out of the kitchen window too! The Wander Inn is a perfect spot, that felt remote with super quick and easy fishing access to Canyon Ferry but it was still a quick drive into town for a dinner and a beer. 10/10 would recommend this AirBnB and we would love to come back! Super reasonable price too!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Cozy, clean, and comfortable, this little cabin has all one would need for a peaceful getaway or a stop during travel. The amenities, including wi-fi, laundry, and hairdryer were just what I like, with the added bonus of farm fresh eggs, extra blankets, a few games, handmade cards for sale, and some kitchen pantry staples. The host asked only the simplest of cleaning tasks‚Äîput towels in a basket, wash dishes, and put used sheets in the washing machine. The only potential negative I would point out was that the two main beds were both in lofts reached by ladders‚Äîthis might be difficult, dangerous or impossible to reach for the very young and others who are infirm. It was a bit of a challenge for me, with a bad back and weak legs, and my husband, who is tall, kept bumping into the ceiling. Overall, we appreciated the quiet location, open layout, cleanliness, and the modern appliances. We would recommend this cabin as an excellent place to stay."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Was driving home from a road trip through the national parks and found this spot as a great rest stop! Such a cute place with great relaxing areas inside and outside and comfortable beds.

2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"My family of 5 stayed one night in the cabin and my kids loved it! It was such an incredible use of space and my kids loved the loft beds. We live in a tiny space anyways, so we felt right at home. We were coming off of 5 days of camping, so I loved the washer/dryer and the shower and all the other amenities. She had eggs and oatmeal and coffee and cream ready for us in the am, which was such a gift. My husband and kids interacted with Kallie and her boys in the am and we loved the chance to connect with our host and her family. We had a great stay, our only regret is that we were only there one night!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great place to stay. Although the airbnb is next to the main house, there was plenty of room to park, and there was no issue with having our own privacy. The host was communicative and fexible with check-in. I highly suggest this airbnb if you're in the Helena area!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"everything went totally fine. my only small complaint was that there were small bugs on the ceiling. normally they wouldn't be noticeable, but because the bed was in the loft they were right in front of our faces. again, a small complaint that is easily fixed. had a great stay"

Would love to return one day!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Beautiful stay- felt right at home. I was not expecting small things like kallie having coffee on hand or bath products.
Beds are accessible only by ladder, I probably missed that in the description. Wasn‚Äôt an issue for me but something to keep in mind for seniors or those with disabilities!"

2023-07-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"The tiny cabin is very peaceful and the hosts thoughtful attention to little details were really appreciated. The loft for sleeping is lovely and the bed awesome but requires some physical maneuverability to get in and out. Would not recommend for those with knee or back issues or limited flexibility. We highly recommend Kallie's place.
Steve & Gay"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Just what we needed on our trek across the country. This is a delightful little spot that packs amenities (like a super functional kitchen) into an adorable log cabin! You do need to be able to climb ladders, which was not a problem for us! Kallie was super helpful and kind and even provisioned us with some delightful farm fresh eggs. If you need a place to stay while traveling like us, or want a cozy getaway I would highly reccomend the Wander Inn."

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Wonderful place. We enjoyed the host and the place! Only note is cabin is closer to their home than it seems in the picture, only a few feet apart but faces a different direction so you do feel secluded if that‚Äôs what your looking for. We will definitely rent again if we‚Äôre back in Helena!"

W.T. was very responsive to any text message from us. We we‚Äôre celebrating our wedding anniversary and we couldn‚Äôt have picked a better place. We would stay here again - it beats any hotel room we have stayed at in Helena before."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"This place is a GEM! Amazing location right on a trail network and walking distance to downtown. W. T. is a super responsive host and provided welcoming treats for both the human and the hound.

2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,W.T.‚Äôs home was perfect for our stay conveniently located and easy to find along with plenty of dining options close by.

We look forward to our next visit at W.T‚Äôs place.

2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I have always been hesitant to go for a private room at a residence, but this stay changed my opinion! With the separate entrance to the large suite in the lower part of the residence, I was very interested and it turned out to be that, private!
WT‚Äôs home is beautiful to look at and inside was no exception! The fireplace was going when I opened the door and I just felt this Host is Super for sure! Everything was as described and pictured, and more. The view of the lit spires of the cathedral and the rotunda of the capital building looming above the rooftops was amazing to look out at.
The bathroom is just around the corner from the room and was super clean and had all the basics. The bed and bedding was excellent and I drifted off in this warm nest of cottons. For a single traveler or a couple, this setup is ideal and beats a hotel room stay by miles. I know I slept much better!
WT had answers to questions before I even asked and made the whole experience seamless!"
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Absolutely love WT Place! He always has the fireplace on for me, I always feel right at home, it's so nice to get done with a long Busy day of Traveling and have a special place to stay and Relax"

Fantastically thought out. 10/10 would stay again."
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"What a lovely place! Just the right size and a great price. We walked in and immediately went ""Oh, this is nice!"". W.T. responded quickly and made check-in super easy. Just what we needed!"

2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,What a lovely place / stay this is. Lovely host. Everything was perfect :))
2023-02-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Traveling to/from a Montana State High School swim meet this met our needs perfectly. Convenient, easy enough access, great location, peaceful, and comfortable. Why people prefer hotels to Airbnb is one of the great mysteries of this century. Thanks W.T. for the opportunity to briefly converse with you and stay at the room with a view - the views of both the Capitol and Cathedral were appreciated."
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Perfect place in Helena! nice view! Fireplace was a cozy touch! Guidebook provided was very helpful. We visited a couple of the recommended breweries and highly recommend the hawthorn wine bar as well! Would stay here again!

2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Beautiful, convenient spot! We loved the mid-century touches. The bed may be a bit soft for some folks, but we slept well. The blinds on the windows shut out the light really well, which is a huge plus for those of us who need darkness to sleep. Very good deal -- it's a room in W.T.'s house, but it feels like your own space. Highly recommend."
2023-01-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,"Really nice spot, very accessible, centrally located, and great view."
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Way up on a hill. The drive way is about five car lengths long and steep. Just beware of that. In a previous review someone mentioned slipping , we had zero problems at all. If you have bad tires on a little slippery car ? This might not be a good fit.
The room itself was huge!
More like a studio apartment with out the connecting bathroom.
It is just outside the door so that‚Äôs cool. It also has a ‚Äúheat ‚Äú feature so you can get the washroom nice and warm before a shower. The water pressure was great and the hot water was super hot and plentiful!
The bed was very comfortable. There is a fireplace heater plus a electric heater and a regular fan so adjusting the room temperature is very easy. We kept the room nice and toasty.
Back to the parking ? It was great, I felt my truck was super safe and could probably have left it unlocked all night. The driveway itself is private and away from the street, that‚Äôs always a plus while traveling with tons of stuff in the truck.
Book this spot."
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,W.T.‚Äôs property was exactly what I wanted. I arrived late but the property was easy to find and the self-checkin went smoothly. All instructions were clear. The room is spacious with a beautiful view and nice amenities.
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This is the second time we've used this accommodation and it won't be the last. It's a fantastic value in a quiet part of Helena in a beautiful home. Easy in and out for us, and the host is great. Always recommended!"

2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,it's very atmospheric and inexpensive! stayed 2 times
2022-12-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"Can‚Äôt say enough thank-you‚Äôs to W. T. and his coming to our rescue when we left his home the next morning. His driveway was completely clear of snow and ice, but the street was covered in ice. I slid downhill next to a parked car and was afraid to move it further for fear of sliding the remaining few inches into the parked car. W.T. helped me straighten out and keep moving down the road to the dry main street a block further. Whew! I so appreciate him! A great host!"
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This room is beautiful, I got a great night's sleep. The location looked great for walking in better weather, with a trail system right there! WT couldn't have been more friendly or helpful. Would definitely stay here again."

2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"So nice, I stayed twice!"
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Well, I will start with myself in this review. I made my reservation for the incorrect dates (I had myself checking out one day earlier). Not only was the host EXTREMELY understanding, kind and accommodating, but through excellent communication (mostly on his part) I was able to book another night!
I was grateful for the opportunity to continue staying here. I had everything I needed and felt at home. This place is as cozy and comfortable as the pictures. I am a very private person and was extremely pleased with the level of space I was given!
The house (outside) was decorated for Christmas and it made it EVEN more enjoyable! I love Christmas!
Parking was AMAZING! There is a guest spot in the driveway and it‚Äôs only a few steps from the door. I felt safe walking in and out and was also able to do so in my work high heels, mid winter! The driveway and sidewalks were shoveled and very well maintained.
I can‚Äôt say enough GOOD things about this host and the place."
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Nice place, awesome host!"
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We had a great time in Helena!
W.T. is such a helpful and caring host, and the place is so comfortable and cozy, we felt right at home!
The view from the house is amazing, with the mountains in the background and the capitol which is lit at night.
The space has a little fireplace and is very reasonably priced, which is special for airbnbs nowadays, with hidden fees all over.
We will want to stay here again, you can't go wrong with this place if you're thinking about it!"
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The place was very easy to find and in a beautiful quiet area. We really enjoyed our stay, lovely warm room and nice bathroom also. I had to do some laundry and W.T. said it was no problem to do so. Very accommodating host, helped us out with a extension cord for our diesel truck. Will definitely be staying here again when we are next in Helena! Highly recommend this place. Thank you W.T.!"
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"W.T.'s place might be the best deal in Helena if you prefer peace and quiet. Very attractive space in a scenic location with thoughtful amenities in the lower story of a beautiful home. Queen bed is on the soft side, but very comfortable with quality bedding. The location couldn't be better for active guests, as it is bordered by open space with access to an extensive trail system right out the door. Since we have family in Helena closeby, this is a place we will definitely be booking in the future. Great communication with host as well even though it was a holiday weekend. Thanks, W.T.!"

The bed and bedding were amazingly comfortable, Montana books available to read, comfy chairs in front of the window and fireplace; great value!"
