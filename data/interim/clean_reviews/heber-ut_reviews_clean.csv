2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We loved staying at Kara’s beautiful cabin home—it was such a treat! The cabin is a sweet space, nestled into a beautiful naturescape, and had everything we needed. Kara was timely and caring when we reached out about a concern and made us feel taken care of and right at home."
2024-06-01,4,Group trip,Very nice place inside with workable kitchen and nice bedrooms. Great location if you have activites in Heber City or don't mind the drive to Park City for skiing. It was base of Timber Moose lodge where our family was gathering for a wedding so it was conveniently located.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,Super cute A frame cabin. I stayed her with my husband and 2 daughters. This cabin had everything we needed. We even saw deer one morning.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Loved the design and how clean the place was! Felt very warm and peaceful.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We really enjoyed our stay in the A frame house. The cabin is cozy and beautifully decorated, with a well stocked kitchen. The location is secluded , about a 10 minute drive from downtown Heber, which we liked.
Highly recommend!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,Absolute perfection from start to finish! Kara is the perfect host with just the right amount of communication. The space is an amazing mix of cool 1970's construction with updated interior design. It's a great place to unwind with lots of fun shops and restaurants close by when you are ready for something else. Loved our stay!
2024-02-01,5,Group trip,"Kara's home is elegantly designed with comfortable beds, a large, easy to navigate kitchen, and a beautiful deck for watching the sunset. The location is close enough to the ski slopes to not be a schlep but far enough to experience the beautiful scenery and views. Peaceful but not isolated. Recommended."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Incredibly designed and comfortable! Great location! Will definitely recommend and return!
2024-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,We had such a wonderful time in this peaceful snowy sanctuary. Such beautiful views of nature. The cabin felt like a home away from home. It was a perfect getaway for a great weekend. Would definitely recommend booking this place. We’re hoping to book again to experience spring in this gorgeous spot. Thank you Kara.
2024-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,This place is magical and so convenient. I highly recommend this spot!
2024-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We loved this cabin, it is beautiful, we enjoyed our stay, everything was beautiful"
2023-12-01,5,Group trip,"The A-Frame Haus is a beautiful, cozy place to get away, relax, and spend time with family & friends. Beds and pillows were super comfy and there was plenty of room for 6 to enjoy time together playing games or to spread out and have some quiet time. And there are plenty of activities just a short drive away.
Kara is a great host and is quick to respond to questions. Thank you for sharing your beautiful A-Frame Haus with us, Kara!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Kara’s home is gorgeous and beyond cozy! The beds are super comfortable! I also appreciated that the upstairs bedroom had a fan in it for sleeping as it does get warmer up there than downstairs. Kitchen was updated and pristine. We saw deer and other animals outside since the house is all glass. Really wonderful stay and would recommend!
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Awesome stay at Kara's Aframe. Really lovely and clean space. It is situated nicely to get to ski resort towns and Provo. Beautifully designed, really comfortable layout and bedding. We will be back!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"I’ve been eyeing this place for years! What a beautiful, peaceful, comforting place to drop anchor and relax. We didn’t want to leave and hope to come back soon. Kara is a great host and has done a beautiful job making her place feel like home."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We had a wonderful stay here! The space was very clean and surrounded by tons of things to do. We will certainly keep the place in mind if we ever stay here again.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,it was great
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very private and good place to stay.
2023-09-01,5,Group trip,"The most idyllic little a frame in Heber. No detail is spared in Kara’s cabin. The aesthetic and finishes are unmatched. It is warm, cozy, and just feels like home. The beds and linens were a dream while falling asleep looking out the many skylights connecting you with the nature surrounding. Many cups of coffee and glasses of wine were enjoyed while starting and ending our days on the beautiful back deck. If you want to feel like you have truly escaped but still have the convenience of being just outside of town, this is the spot for you."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The cabin was cute and well maintained, with great bathrooms and kitchen. It was very clean, including the deck, and there were fewer insects than expected. Kara was a great host - very fast and friendly responses to my questions/comments but with limited expectations and demands on me, which made for a comfortable and stress free stay. I was a little disappointed about the level of road noise heard inside and outside the cabin, but I’m assuming this depends a bit on the time of year (perhaps an unusual amount of side by sides around Labor Day, for example)."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We had a wonderful stay. The home is surrounded by trees that give privacy and is beautiful all around
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Kara is an amazing host. Very responsive and helpful. The A-frame is charming and has beautiful natural light. Clean, nicely furnished and we highly recommend a stay!"
2020-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Kara was extremely responsive. We had to cancel the trip due to coronavirus situation and Kara was extremely sympathetic. She waived the cancellation policy and provided the full refund to us. It was much appreciated. In the midst of this challenging situation, it is good to know there are great people out there who would make things a little bit better for others. Thank you, Kara. We will definitely try to find another opportunity to stay with Kara in the future."
2020-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Super cool house and location is great. Nice to feel like you have your own piece of land on vacation. Good proximity to Deer Valley, cup of coffee ride time. Get home from the slopes to have a beer and watch the sunset over the mountain, hard to beat. We’ll be back."
2020-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,Cozy & dreamy. Can’t wait to stay again!
2020-02-01,4,Group trip,Really cool space in a great location near Heber. The water is clean but it does have a sulfur smell to it. I wouldn’t recommend to people who are sensitive to smells.
2020-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Cute, cozy place in an excellent location! It was remote enough that the A-frame felt peaceful and we had undisturbed views of nature, while within a very reasonable driving distance from various sites and tasty places to eat. A very nice home to stay for our first time in Utah."
2020-02-01,5,Stayed about a week,A perfect getaway location. Beautiful views of the mountains from the home. We loved staying here in the winter.
2020-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Kara’s place is absolutely amazing. So stylish, so clean, the best set up ever. The views are UNreal. We got engaged on this trip - best. cabin. ever. ❤️"
2020-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,Kara’s place was so nice! The cabin was charming and super clean! We loved the cabin and found that it was very kid friendly as well.
2020-01-01,5,Stayed about a week,Just as pretty as the pictures. This was a great house. Kara is an excellent host. We enjoyed using this as a base camp for a ski trip. The driveways were plowed and there was even a complimentary laundry day. Search the kitchen for the game drawer and end the day with a festive Uno game. Being in the A-frame Haus during a snow storm was great fun!
2020-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We had such a wonderful winter stay here! A gem of a place. Clean, stylish, and cozy. Not far off the road at all and an easy drive into Midway (one of our favorite nearby towns, we discovered) as well as Park City. As others have mentioned, the water does have a sulfuric smell to it, but it wasn't too bothersome and bottled water was provided. Kara was very quick to respond with any questions we had. We will definitely be back!"
2020-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The most adorable cabin; comfy beds, a toasty fireplace and the best views!"
2019-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Our stay at the Aframe Haus was perfect. The space was so clean, designed so well and was the perfect place to relax. The kitchen was beautiful and had everything we needed. The location is perfect for a day of skiing or heading to Park City. Would highly recommend staying here!"
2019-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,what an amazing experience from the hospitality to the view a holiday my family will never forget.
2019-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,This place is great... My family loved it. Super cozy and cute. You don’t really have to leave but the ski areas are close by... Do your self a favor and go for a visit to this lovely A-Frame...
2019-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"Second time I've stayed here, and it was just as great as the first. Last time was the summer and now there's snow on the ground. Such a great location and you can't beat that view of Mt. Timp from just outside. Definitely making me consider cabin life."
2019-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place is a must. Expertly designed and styled! Cozy/fun! A must see, and a must experience. Kara is responsive, attentive and friendly. 5 stars."
2019-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Such a beautiful place that feels like a home away from home! Highly recommend!
2019-11-01,5,Group trip,Another beautiful holiday at Kara’s cabin.
2019-11-01,5,Group trip,Loved our stay here. The house exceeding our expectations. Definitely will book again.
2019-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This cabin is just secluded enough to feel like a cozy retreat without being a burden. Heber’s Main Street is a ten minute drive away.
The updated interior is a dream. I enjoyed cooking in this kitchen more than my own, and the natural light just flows through the house.
Kara provides lots of games and movies as well so this would be a perfect place for kids!"
2019-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great accommodations! Kara's A-frame is beautifully decorated and sparkling clean. We had a lovely family vacation and enjoyed plenty of mountain biking in this beautiful part of the world.
2019-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Such a lovely place. We came here on our honeymoon in the Fall. My (now) wife wanted to come here ever since it was only $100 a night. We absolutely loved it. It’s a whole lot more expensive now for whatever reason so we could only stay a couple nights, but man this place is beautiful. We would definitely love to come back. I’m sure it would be a lot of fun with a small group of pals, but even for just the two of us, it was such a cozy little temporary home."
2019-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful and peaceful mountain home!
2019-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Absolutely beautiful house. Easy check in and out procedures. The house was completely spotless - everything was in perfect order and sparkling clean!
2019-09-01,5,Group trip,"So cozy, so beautiful! We had the best time."
2019-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,Great spot to stay! So peaceful and lovely!
2019-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"Kara's place was the quintessential upscale cabin in the middle of nature! We loved how updated the space was, yet still held so much of it's character from when it was first built. It was very clean and modern, the upstairs loft was very comfortable and the decks were great to hang out on. I would definitely recommend this to anyone - from a couple (like us) to a family!"
2019-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"Spotless, comfortable beds, and relaxing interior. Everything lends itself to a casual retreat. The layout makes the most of the space and makes it feel extremely functional and spacious. Don't be surprised if you find yourself daydreaming about A-Frame living after staying here."
2019-08-01,4,Stayed with kids,"Relaxing, stylish A-frame. Close to all sorts of adventures. We very much enjoyed our stay!"
2019-08-01,5,Group trip,"Celebrated my birthday here with 5 girlfriends. The perfect space to hang out and enjoy each other. The cabin is downright adorable, very well done and comfortable spaces. Really enjoyed the big deck and cooking together in the nice open kitchen/living area. My only gripe would be no door on the upstairs bathroom or bedroom, I get it was for space, but I am a fan of just a wee bit of privacy. Kara responded quickly and everything was just picture perfect. I would definitely stay there again!"
2019-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,This place was such an inspiration. Really beautiful and serene. We enjoyed our time there away from our usual noisy life.
2019-08-01,5,Stayed one night,This place is AMAZING! So gorgeous in a beautiful location. Very spacious but keeps the cozy cabin feel.
2019-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Kara’s place is just as beautiful as the pictures, and she is an especially responsive and gracious host. She was really quick to respond to our texts and was kind about the things that came up.
Our kids had a blast. They cried when we left because they had so much fun and didn’t want to go. The cabin is quiet and peaceful but close to town, and we enjoyed eating outside on the deck and watching movies."
2019-07-01,4,Group trip,Exactly as expected. Perfect space for a family of six. Nice touches including board games and toys to keep our grandson entertained. We will be back!
2019-07-01,4,Stayed one night,Lovely bright sunny space. Loved being at the cabin!
2019-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Cute cute cabin! The upstairs was pretty hot so turn on the AC as soon as you arrive to try and cool it down... we had the sliding door open at night, but closed it due to some spider friends coming inside. Otherwise a great stay! Kara provided bottled water for us which was super helpful. Beautiful views. Not really anywhere to play outside (the brush is super thick and high), but we went into town to play at the park and ride the Heber Creeper Train. Great cabin for playing board games and watching the sunset and relaxing. Kara was a great host!"
2019-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What a treat to stay in Kara’s place! The perfect blend of form and function. Thoughtfully equipped cabin with aesthetics and use perfectly balanced! Heber is a short drive away, but the cabin feels secluded and private! Thank you!! Can’t wait to stay there again! Kara went above and beyond in her service and genuine kindness."
2019-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This place is a dream!
2019-07-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Kara's beautiful a-frame cabin was a dream! It's so thoughtfully designed, it's like you walked into a modern interior design magazine. We loved all of the thoughtful touches! If you're looking for something tranquil, that evokes slow-living and calmness look no further! The cabin is located on a private lot and is super close to Sundance, Park City and a reservoir that you can paddleboard/boat/kayak for miles! Enjoy, thanks Kara!!"
2019-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,I have nothing but positive things to say about staying here. It was incredibly clean and everything we needed for our stay was provided. The house is really one of a kind and it was a pleasure staying there. All the architecture and design touches were really impressive as well. I'm hoping to make it a yearly tradition to visit this beautiful place.
2019-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Lovely space with beautiful light. It's the perfect place to relax after long summer days (even if the outside sometimes makes it in). Kara was very responsive to questions and provided some useful basics. All three of the nearby towns are charming, and Park City is particularly beautiful in summer. Highly recommend!"
2019-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The cabin is perfect. It's not only beautiful in the photos, but well crafted and carefully put together for a lovely place to stay. The skylights framed beautiful views of the surrounding trees. Kara was easy to communicate with and quick to respond, check-in was a breeze. Everything was very clean and well kept. I would definitely recommend!"
2019-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Cozy, clean and very comfortable! It’s light, airy and so relaxing, easy check in with the lock box, and our 3 kids had so much fun exploring and loved taking walks down to the river that is just a short distance from the cabin. We brought our side by side and rode trails near by and one of our favorite, Snake Creek above Midway- less than 30 min drive. Great places to go out and eat that are fairly close but you still feel secluded from near by towns. Our kids were so sad to leave and we really enjoyed our time at the A-frame!"
2019-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,One of my favorite places to stay! So peaceful and the home is beautiful! The attention to detail and the comforts provided really made this the perfect weekend away!
2019-06-01,4,Stayed with kids,Space is beautiful and Heber location is gorgeous. Lots of thoughtful touches throughout but a couple of enhancements would have made a big impact on our experience. The door on the downstairs bathroom is not that private and there is only a curtain on the upstairs bathroom. Also while the skylights are beautiful it would be really nice to have some kind of shade covering in the bedrooms. All in all we enjoyed our stay.
2019-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"A sanctuary for those looking for a peaceful , beautiful, rustic yet chic place to get away from it all. This cabin with its amazing floor to A line ceiling glass, washes the whole space in natural light while the clean modern touches compliments the space like no other cabin out there. Even close enough to charming towns like heber or midway if you feel like venturing to the more populated human side."
2019-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Kara's place was exactly as expected: beautiful, clean and relaxing. I had one of the best nights of sleep while traveling. Everything was clean with stylish touches that made it feel like home instead of a sterile Ikea situation. Location was a bit out of the way but close enough to the town center and a reasonable drive to Park City, but it's perfect if you just need some time away and clear some headspace. Thank you, Kara!"
2019-05-01,5,Stayed one night,The place was exactly what we were looking for! It’s adorably decorates and such a great getaway. I’d highly recommend staying here if you can!
2019-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"A stylish, yet classic and cozy home in an amazing, natural setting. Beautiful surroundings and beautiful interiors - the best of both worlds! The A Frame Haus is perfect for all types of guests, from a group of friends (that was us) to couples or families. A versatile, functional and highly enjoyable house. We loved it!"
2019-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great cabin! Quite stylish and very comfortable. Really enjoyed our stay.
2019-05-01,4,Stayed with kids,"The cabin is wonderful. It has an outstanding style which makes it perfect to spend your day reading, cooking, writing, just being inside. The location is also great, you are actually close to Heber but it looks like if you were in the middle of nowhere. Whereas going outdoors could be appealing, its wonderful interior will make you want to stay inside the cabin enjoying the nature through the big window of the living room. That is the biggest pro to me.
However if our stay was not perfect was because some amenities (stove, dvd and grill) did not work well. We also had an unexpected guest (mouse) which was more a surprise than an issue since we understand it can happen in a cabin like this. Nevertheless, when you pay such an amount of money you expect everything to be perfect. It was not the case. We informed the host about these problems the night before our departure. Being true there was probably not time to fix it, we would have appreciated they had made the effort to try it and not just an apologize text."
2019-05-01,5,Stayed one night,A fantastic mountain getaway! Perfect for a family or group of friends. Would highly recommend!
2019-05-01,4,Group trip,Perfect spot for an evening with some girl friends :) super easy to find! Apple maps took us right to it.
2019-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"This place is honestly amazing. It will exceed your expectations. It’s beautiful, clean, absolutely love the interior design. I want to live at this cabin!"
2019-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,A-mazing place!
2019-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We came to the cabin for a business retreat. It was the perfect space to step away from busy lives and think clearly. We loved the trees and bubbling creek outside, and the beautiful interior of the cabin. We highly recommend it to anyone wanting to get away!"
2019-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This cabin is beautiful and cozy, it was the perfect weekend getaway"
2019-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"If you're looking for a beautiful place to stay tucked away in the nice quiet hillside just outside Heber City, this is a place for you. Just a short drive from SLC, the A-Frame Haus is beautiful inside and out. Kara's communication was super quick before and during our stay and we hope to visit again!"
2019-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,Adorable cabin. Super stylish and cozy. Perfect location away from hustle and bustle on beautiful property.
2019-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,Super clean and stylish. A perfect getaway location for my family. I left relaxed and with decorating ideas for my house!! Such a beautiful place to stay.
2019-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Wonderful kid free weekend! But I think we might be up for bringing them along next time 😄. Cute place! So many great things to do. Skiing, snowshoes, hikes, views, train rides, crater soaks, cozy, restaurants, shopping, close to park city. Just book it, you’ll be glad you did."
2019-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Kara’s A-Frame was so dreamy! We had a great couple days relaxing and enjoying the home. Our 2 little boys loved playing in the snow, right outside the deck, and we loved slowing down here! This house lives up to its social media hype! We can’t wait to come back and stay again."
2019-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I would stay again in a heartbeat! Perfect location outdoors, beautiful exterior and interior. The beds were comfortable and it had everything we needed. Love this A-frame!"
2019-03-01,5,Group trip,"A frame haus is the perfect place to get away from it all but still be close to the city. The layout and decor are stunning as well as the views from the cabin. If you’re thinking about staying here, do it, you won’t regret it!"
2019-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great and super cozy cabin with good space!
2019-02-01,5,Stayed one night,Such an amazing space. Had the best time!
2019-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,"I had pretty high expectations, and they were still exceeded by the A-Frame Haus. Everything was perfect, and you could not find a better place to stay near SLC. Kara also went above and beyond to accommodate us. If you ever have the opportunity to stay here, don’t think twice, do it. We’ll be back for sure!"
2019-02-01,5,Group trip,Gorgeous! A quiet and relaxing getaway. The space is beautiful and comfortable. We got groceries at Smiths and chilled for a couple of days enjoying the views and deer sightings. This space was a recommendation and we would definitely recommend!
2019-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,We had the best time at Kara’s A-Frame! It is so open and comfortable. We had a small party for my son’s first birthday and the A Frame was the perfect setting for a private gathering. I couldn’t recommend it highly enough!
2019-01-01,5,Group trip,"Loved it! Charming and cozy, the perfect place for 3 couples!"
2019-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Fantastic place, excellent host, clean, well-stocked, cute decor, friendly and responsive host!! We hope to go back year after year! Also, there were so many touches that were great for our small kids!!"
2019-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Above and beyond beautiful! You will not regret your stay here. It’s the perfect cozy retreat. Super beautiful and tucked right in the mountains. It’s a quick drive to park city for skiing or other activities. We would come visit again in a heartbeat!
2019-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Worth every penny! The perfect place to recharge.
2019-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Amazing amazing amazing! I hosted a girls retreat here this past weekend and everything was perfect, we had so much fun. The location was beautiful and secluded, the space was even more beautiful than I imagined (and I’d been following along on Instagram for awhile) The a-frame was super spacious compared to ones I’d been in before, very clean, Kara was so nice and helpful in the planning process and she was great with communication too. I’d highly recommend staying here, expectations were met and exceeded!!"
2019-01-01,3,Stayed with kids,"The home was charming physically but there were a few downsides.
The heat didn’t work well , the water smelled of sulfur and the WiFi didn’t completely work. You could text but not call.
I feel like this house is perfect for a short stay but not for a long term location!"
2018-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The A frame haus was such a magical holiday escape for our family! The cabin is absolutely gorgeous, very comfortable and located near some very cute towns. We stayed for Christmas and there was a sweet little tree under which to place presents for our two year old. Kara was extremely sweet and accommodating, providing two humidifiers for us to use. The cabin was a bit less remote than I had expected, it’s right on the road. I would also be aware that the property is on a well and the water will have a sulfur smell to it. Bottled drinking water is provided though so that helped tremendously! Loved this place!!"
2018-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,We had an amazing stay here. Secluded yet still close to town. The space is just as good as it looks in the pictures. Highly recommend staying here and hope to be back sometime soon. Thanks Kara!
2018-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Worth while and had an unbelievable time.

2018-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Absolutely perfect location for our Thanksgiving holiday. We love this little house.
2018-10-01,5,Group trip,"Maybe the most magic place in Utah, highly suggest going in the fall the yellow trees around the cabin were amazing. And the cabin was filled was so much charm, and was completely stunning."
2018-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The A-Frame Haus feels like a home away from home. It was so comfortable and private, but yet not far from Heber City."
2018-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Such a great place! So comfortable and stylish. Really loved the location and proximity to everywhere we wanted to go. Will definitely stay again!
2018-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We loved our stay at the a-frame! We stayed in the midst of the changing foliage and the cabin is situated PERFECTLY among the colorful trees. There is also a creek that runs near the cabin where my husband, myself and our toddler spent lots of time exploring. The cabin itself has everything you need for a relaxing vacation. It's a perfect place for children as there are books, toys and puzzles along with the secret room upstairs that my toddler spent lots of time playing in. Kara has done an incredible job curating the spaces to feel modern, clean, peaceful and comfortable. We will definitely be back!"
2018-10-01,5,Stayed one night,We held a small elopement and had family photos here - and spent one night. Such a cute place in a gorgeous area that’s still close to restaurants and stores. Kara is great. We can’t wait to come back next year for our anniversary!
2018-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Every bit as beautiful and darling as the photos show! We stayed two nights for our mini-moon and it was perfect, such a memorable experience in a gorgeous setting. The rich fall colors outside every window were the icing on the cake. We had everything we needed and didn't leave the cabin once! We can't wait to come back to celebrate future anniversaries here. Thanks again Kara for offering up your lovely Aframe!"
2018-09-01,5,Stayed one night,Kara’s cabin is beautiful! It’s such a great place to get away. We had so much fun there. We love modern cabins so this was a treat for us!
2018-09-01,5,Stayed about a week,The A-frame blew our expectations away. I surprised my wife with this as our honeymoon spot and I definitely am thankful the for the space. It was the most beautiful honeymoon we could have imagined. Thank you so much!
2018-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We loved our stay! Great house and great setting.
2018-09-01,4,Stayed with kids,"Kara’s place is comfortable, modern, and cozy. It is beautifully decorated and a peaceful, quiet retreat."

2018-08-01,5,Group trip,"Great and open space, a lovely decorated place that was fun and contemporary. Lots of parking, very communicative host and very accommodating to our large party size. Internet and cell service a bit spotty, so enjoy being off the grid. Beautiful setting too."
2018-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,This is our second time at this cabin and it is such a great place to get away. It’s very comfortable and well designed. The private setting is very nice. Our kids love walking down by the dry creek and and collecting rocks and sticks. Great fun for families and we will definitely go again.
2018-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"This cabin exceeded my expectations. It was clean, styled so well and had everything we needed as far as amenities went. The location is beautiful and a little secluded but close to any main roads and the city. We will definitely be back!"
2018-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The space was even more amazing in person. We had a great weekend getaway with plenty of R&R. Kara was very responsive and helpful. She also came through with some great local hotspots. We can’t wait to come back!
2018-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"While the pictures of this charming cabin are what drew me to book it, it was even more charming, cozy, and magnificent in person. All the personal attention to detail with the decor, and the wonderful amenities made our stay delightful and comfortable. We enjoyed the peaceful location so much!! This is definitely a spot we will be returning to."
2018-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"You will not be disappointed at the A-frame Haus. It is simply wonderful, clean, cozy, and quite spacious inside. The porch out front on the west side is enormous and the house is filled with natural light. We had two 5 year-old boys here for the weekend and they found plenty to do with the blocks and games available for kids and enjoyed collecting sticks/rocks outside. Kara is an attentive and accommodating host. We did not have any cell phone reception on Verizon or AT&T at the cabin, but the wireless internet worked great so we could take care of any quick communication needs back home that way. We'll be back for another stay for sure."
2018-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This is a very clean rental in a great location--very peaceful and yet close enough to town.
2018-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This home is a dream. The location is quiet and secluded but a close drive to groceries and restaurants when needed. It’s absolutely breathtaking, cozy and beautiful. Kara is quick to answer questions too. Such a sweet getaway from Salt Lake City with our two little girls. We will be back!"
2018-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This is such a beautiful home! Pictures were an exact depiction of this wonderfully thought out and well designed cabin. Definitely will stay there again.
2018-06-01,3,Stayed one night,"Cool place, could use a little upkeep for the fees paid."
2018-06-01,3,Stayed one night,"A remote location in a scenic environment near ammenties. Beautiful interior remodel, perhaps the outside remodel is next."
2018-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The A-frame is a perfect, stylish cabin getaway. We had high hopes for our stay based on all the positive reviews and beautiful photography and the house certainly lived up to it and then some. It’s easily accessible yet still feels tucked away, and the styling and finishes of the house were very well done. We loved our weekend there and hope to be back soon!"
2018-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Our stay at the A Frame Haus was great! The place is better in person than even the amazing photos. Our kids loved the “ladder loft” upstairs and the toys and games that are provided. There is no cell service, but the WiFi was great. We didn’t want to leave and are already contemplating a winter visit. We highly recommend the drive to Sundance along the Deer Creek Reservoir. Go early while the sunrise is striking the mountains. And be sure to take a soak/swim in the Homestead Crater."
2018-06-01,5,Group trip,"do yourself a favor & STAY AT THE AFRAME HAUS! it's a total dream that feels like a home away from home. so cozy with allll the amenities you need! kara was so kind, helpful & prompt in her communication. already dreaming about when i can come back!"
2018-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Beautiful space, so happy to have stayed here"
2018-06-01,5,Stayed one night,This place is a beautiful little home. It was so fun to see what Kara has designed. We loved it!
2018-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,Kara was a fantastic host that was super quick to respond to me if I needed anything. This place is awesome and we definitely will be coming back. It is so cute and fun to just hang out and relax!
2018-06-01,4,Stayed with kids,The haus is as beautiful in person as it is in pictures. Very clean too. Kara was extremely prompt in responding to communications. Heber City is small but you can check out nearby Midway and Park City each with its own character. Salt Lake City is 45 minutes away. This place is a great jumping off point for multiple day trips.
2018-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Love my stay here, it is the perfect getaway but close enough to Heber and even Park city if you wanted to get out"
2018-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Our family of 5 had a wonderful 4 day stay at the A-Frame over the Memorial Day weekend. Kara has done an outstanding job of renovation and decor, as she has her finger on the Scandinavian Modern look. You can see a lot of love went into the house. Kara was very helpful and quick to respond. She was a great host! I can really recommend staying here, and visiting the Wasatch Back! So many things to see and do in nature."
2018-05-01,5,Stayed one night,A gorgeous space with breathtaking scenery. We enjoyed every minute there. A quick drive to Heber and Park City for some fun entertainment but once you see the stunning cabin you will not want to leave. Highly recommend!
2018-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,"My husband, son, and I were here for a night over the weekend before a camping trip. We live in salt lake. The place was pretty secluded, like past the area with all the other houses, but not too far from town, so perfect location for us. Space to toss the football etc, board games, tv and WiFi, bath, lovely patios and amazing everything! Just a little pricey considering the area... Definitely recommend! Thank you!"
2018-05-01,5,Group trip,We loved our stay here! My kids are already asking to go back. Kara was very easy to work with and super responsive to my emails. Great experience!
2018-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place is amazing. From the location to all the details in the space. Away from the city, the amazing views and space what more could you ask for. We definitely loved this place and hope to come back again."
2018-04-01,5,Group trip,"Our family had a great stay at Kara’s adorable A frame Haus! It’s just beautiful inside with such cute bedrooms and living space. The cabin has great views over the Heber Valley. We weren’t expecting Heber City to be such a nice area, but it’s lovely and we highly recommend staying at the cabin and exploring sometime if you can. Lastly, my family and I laughed out loud when we saw the entire collection of The Office in a basket by the TV, it’s our favorite show. Kara definitely has it all down:) checking in was easy and she communicated fast and nicely. Thanks again!"
2018-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This Airbnb has a page to follow on Instagram with fun pictures of the remodel and pictures from people who’ve stayed before. It’s really such a beautiful cabin right off the road, it was super easy to find. It’s completely been remodeled and is stunning. It’s super clean and had everything we needed. They provided linen, towels, even shampoo and conditioner. It has a fully stocked kitchen. We were able to prepare breakfast and dinner in the spacious kitchen. They have a drawer full of games and dvds and kid toys which was a bonus! It was warm when we got there, especially upstairs but the cabin has a Nest and only took 30 minutes to cool down. Check-in and check-out was super simple. She gives you the key box code and you go right in and lock up when you leave. She only asks that you take out your garbages and put your dishes in the dishwasher before you leave. Overall I loved our stay and I highly recommend. We will definitely be returning in the future."
2018-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The A Frame House was so perfect! I hosted a creative workshop and we did a lot of cooking in the kitchen and it was such a dreamy kitchen! It was the perfect space!
2018-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"10/10!! You have to stay here! Honestly all my cabin dreams came true haha. So much love put into this place. So bight, modern and clean! We honestly didnt even want to go anywhere because the cabin was so cute, cozy and fun! Kara was so awesome at always being there/responding whenever we had questions! All around this was amazing! We will for sure be returning."
2018-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This space is even more magical in person! We had a group of three girls and decided to do a mini weekend trip and the A-Frame Haus was the perfect stay. It was much larger than you'd expect an A-frame to be (can probably accomodate 6 people comfortably), extremely clean and well-stocked with all the necessary items (shampoo, clean towels, coffee, The Office DVD's), and the views were just great. The best part of all this is the host, Kara. We notified her that we'd be coming in very late at night due to a late flight and she drove up to leave the lights on for us so we wouldn't have any issues finding the house. She responds quickly and provides all information clearly.
I will definitely have to come back. Highly recommended!"
2018-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,We loved how quite it was here. The linens were awesome and we felt very comfortable. The view of the mountains and the stars at night were amazing. We loved exploring the little nearby town and Park City.
2018-03-01,5,Group trip,"THIS PLACE IS AWESOME! It exceeded all of our expectations we had for our girls get away! It's super roomy, plenty of space to sleep the 7 of us! Kara has done such a good job with all the finishes, it's so modern and clean! No neighbors, so we really felt like we had the mountains to ourselves! And the VIEW is amazing! Kara as a host is just the sweetest, and did everything possible to make us feel welcome and at home! Thanks Kara!"
2018-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Absolutely loved this cabin! Everything that you may have seen on Instagram is what this place is. Super cute, clean, tons of space, great layout, warm, welcoming and cozy. Thank you for your terrific communication Kara. We loved our stay!"
2018-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,What a dreamy getaway!
2018-02-01,5,Group trip,"The A frame Haus is awesome with a Westward facing glass wall which you can catch the whole sunset in if you don't want to chill on the huge front porch. Super spacious, beautiful furniture, clean bathrooms. Very cool."
2018-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,Kara's A-Frame-Haus is stylish and fun. Kara was always quick to respond and we felt very well hosted.
2018-02-01,5,Stayed one night,Everything about our experience here was perfect. I surprised my wife by taking her here for Valentines Day. Kara was so quick to respond to my questions and the place itself looks like it's straight out of a magazine. It snowed all night but we were perfectly warm and enjoyed waking up to the huge windows looking out to snow covered trees. We grabbed dessert at Snake Creek Grill which I highly recommend and is only about 15 minutes away. The amenities were perfect. I imagine this won't be our last trip to this amazing home.
2018-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Kara's place is beautiful, loved spending time there! Also, Kara was very responsive with my numerous questions which made for an even better experience."
2018-02-01,5,Group trip,The A-Frame Haus was the perfect getaway for our girls ski trip. Kara was extremely responsive before & during our stay. The space is just as beautiful as the photos and has all the comforts of home. We’ll be back!
2018-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Amazing house..We will be back! Kara were there at every step of the process and quick to answer any questions we had. Location is amazing as these is the perfect retreat spot but yet very close from all major attractions and spots in the area.
2018-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We LOVED staying in the A-Frame Haus. It was such a cozy, fun, and relaxing weekend. Kara is an amazing host who was very quick at responding to my questions. The space is very clean and we had a great time cooking in the beautiful kitchen. It’s a place we’ll definitely want to visit again someday!"
2018-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Super clean gorgeous space. Kara was super quick to answer any questions.
2018-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This cabin is special. It has beautiful interior space and is very nicely appointed and stocked. Kara, the owner is very nice and responsive. It's far enough out of town to be private but close enough to run into town to eat or shop. Everything worked well and was in good condition.
Thanks for a great place to chill Kara!"
2018-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,"beautiful cabin the in the woods. Very clean, well maintained, newly renovated. We had a great time there in the snow. Kara was a great host and communicated very well before we arrived. No problems of any kind. We had a relaxing and fun couple of days in Heber City."
2018-01-01,5,Group trip,"The cabin was the *perfect* spot for us to spend NYE. We went from a group of 6 to being a group of 8 pretty last minute, and Kara was so nice to accommodate for the 2 extra people (with the additional person fee). The cabin is really spacious and we were able to make our NYE dinner comfortably. There was also a bunch of games and puzzles—we worked on the 2 puzzles and played some Uno :) Location-wise, the cabin is pretty secluded, but still close enough to spots like Park City and Sundance.
The interior of the cabin is as dreamy as it looks in the pictures. We would definitely stay here again!"
2017-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This place was beautiful and inviting. It wasnthe perfect place to end our holiday break! Kara was always quick to respond. We plan on returning!
2017-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We very much enjoyed our stay at the A Frame house. It’s in a beautiful setting and very quaint. The aesthetic is wonderful! We felt like it was secluded but glad that many amenities were just 10 minutes away.
Kara is a lovely host. She was patient and helpful when we had questions and concerns. She was also very understanding with us about an issue we had that was not communicated prior to arrival. She worked with us to get the situation resolved in a very generous and thoughtful way.
My only heads-up comment would be that there is not a washer/ dryer on the premises, and although the listing doesn’t say there is one in the amenities section, I just assumed. Which was my bad.
Overall a wonderful experience."
2017-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,Most darling Airbnb we’ve ever stayed in!! Hope to be back soon 😍❤️
2017-12-01,5,Stayed one night,This is such a beautiful place! Would definitely stay here again
2017-12-01,5,Group trip,"Such a beautiful place to unplug and relax, just what our family needed."
2017-12-01,5,Stayed one night,So clean and the host was very accommodating. Would reccommend!
2017-12-01,5,Group trip,The A-frame Haus is absolutely stunning. So cozy and picture perfect. Kara is a fabulous host; she's always quick to respond and easy to reach. Ideal for a family retreat or an adventure with friends. Can't wait to come back one day :)
2017-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"I cannot even BEGIN to describe how wonderful this Airbnb is. The house incredibly cute, stylish, and decked out. The full kitchen came in handy for the Thanksgiving weekend. And the home was warm and inviting as soon as we walked in. If you're feeling adventurous... there is a creek within steps of the house, and a backyard that rivals the open fields in Little House on the Prairie :-) The Aframe Haus is my favorite Airbnb experience yet! If you're having reservations about reservations here... don't.. It's perfect. BOOK NOW!"
2017-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We had a wonderful 3 night stay!! The place is beautiful! We loved all the natural light that comes through the big windows.
It’s pretty secluded yet pretty close to Main Street, Heber and Park City.
I like to cook therefore, the size of the kitchen is a plus because it’s very spacious and clean.
Kara was very responsive to all of our messages whenever we had a question or concern.
We definitely plan on booking this cabin again in the future!"
2017-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"Kara's A-Frame was beautiful and provided such a homey feel for my family and I when we were traveling during the busy Thanksgiving holiday weekend. It was the perfect place to stay that was close to the mountains and quiet, but close enough to a small down and just 45 mins away from Salt Lake City, which we ended up heading to the next day.
Her place was stylish and clean and kept us warm, while the temperatures outside were a little nippy. I would recommend this place to families or for a group of friends traveling together and want to be tucked away, but just close enough to the city!"
2017-11-01,5,Group trip,"She has a gorgeous place. Absolutely no complaints. We loved our stay. Close to park city, which was really nice!"
2017-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We loved staying at this cute cabin. Thank you for an amazing and magical weekend!
2017-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The space was perfectly suited to a romantic getaway. Accessible yet secluded and full of natural light and cabin charm. Interacting with Kara was always a delight via message and in person. This place is an Heirloom enhanced by caring owners and beautiful surroundings. It was a privilege to visit.
2017-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,Very charming and clean!
2017-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Love this place! We had the best time relaxing, playing games & spending time as a family. The house is clean, adorable, & so fun for the kids. Kara is an amazing host too!"
2017-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,We loved our quick getaway to the aframehaus...it was perfect for our little family. The space is beautiful and clean. Our kids loved playing inside and out. My only complaint was Kara wouldn’t sell me the cabin!!!
2017-10-01,5,Group trip,"The home is exceptional, extremely clean and in a great location. Every room is perfect - I’d highly recommend staying here!"
2017-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a wonderful few days at the cabin. It is exactly as pictured and just as wonderful as I had imagined. We hiked Stewart Falls with our two kids one afternoon. I would highly recommend it, nice long hike but not too challenging for the kids with spectacular views! Kara was very responsive and helpful whenever we had a question."
2017-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The most adorable Scandinavian-ish designed Aframe. Close enough to Park City but away from the hustle-bustle, and very close to many great trail systems. Spent a gorgeous fall weekend at the cabin - though it was hard to leave the quaint and cozy space to do anything else! Perfect place to curl up w/ a bottle of wine (or a plethora of) and catch up w/ friends. LOVED IT and will be back!"
2017-10-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Clean. But no curtains to the outside
2017-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"Place was GORGEOUS and dreamy! So cozy and the perfect mountain escape.
Gorgeous views and natural light!
Loved all the space for parking and being tucked away in the pretty trees!
Will definitely stay here again!"
2017-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The A-Frame was awesome, exactly what we hoped for. We stayed with friends for a weekend getaway and had a great time exploring the grounds, snuggled by the fire, and enjoying the beautiful remodel they’ve done. Will definitely book again!"
2017-09-01,5,Stayed one night,Amazing place to stay for a great price!
2017-09-01,5,Stayed one night,Beautiful home! Super accommodating and friendly hosts. Thank you!
2017-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"our second stay at the a-frame was different as we had friends with us to fill up every room other than just my wife and I going, but the house/hosts were just the same as before... unreal amazing.
such an inspiring place to stay. love every inch of this house."
2017-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Such a stellar place. Loved everything about it. We'll be back!
2017-09-01,5,Group trip,This place is incredible and so fun to stay. Treat yourself to a getaway in this gorgeous cabin!
2017-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,It was so beautiful! Great rooms and the beds were so comfortable! Garrett and Kara were so helpful with anything that we needed. We are definitely booking again!!
2017-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,An Architectural stunner! I had a great time at the house. Very beautiful and spacious. It was a perfect place to get away and write. Would love to stay here again.
2017-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Such a serene getaway nestled in the mountains! The home was beautiful with lots of natural light. We enjoyed exploring the national forest and going into town for lunch. Also close enough to Park City for a fancy dinner. Garrett and Kara exceeded our expectations with how attentive they were to our needs and THIS HOUSE IS BEAUTIFUL.
2017-08-01,5,Stayed one night,Such a beautiful place! Thank you.
2017-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Loved the beautiful simplicity of the cabin itself! The hosts were gracious. We would love to go back!
2017-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place to relax with your family. We really enjoyed it.
2017-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Cant say enough good things about this place!!!! It's the perfect modern cabin in the mountains that's secluded but also close to so many amazing outdoor activities. We're going to come back once a year! You will be so happy you stayed here :) just perfect!
2017-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was an exceptional place to stay. The house is amazing and very well done. We stayed there with our 4 kids and everyone loved it. The kids enjoyed playing in the little nook above the upstairs bed, and they really enjoyed hiking down to the creek bed just below the house to go exploring. There's no water this time of year but they collected rocks and sticks and had a great time.
My wife really enjoyed the kitchen and cooked meals every night. Everything she needed was there. Everything is well furnished and decorated.
The proximity to downtown Heber is very nice. It feels like you are further away than you are. Just a quick drive in to get ice cream or anything else you need.
Garrett & Kara were always very responsive and polite with any questions we had.
We will definitely be going back."
2017-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Secluded but within proximity to Heber and Park City (and plenty of outdoor activities), the location of A-frame Haus is incredible for your next getaway. But it is the architecture, design, and overall feel that will have you falling in love with this place. There is attention to detail everywhere, but it doesn't deliver a busy feeling, more so a minimalistic, peaceful one. The style is sophisticated but comfortable and the white, beach cabin-esque open areas serve as blank slate for new ideas or forgetting your troubles. The hosts are so friendly and were quick to respond to any questions I had. They live nearby and can be at your service in a jiff. Also noteworthy about them, you really just feel like you have known them for years once you meet them. I can't wait to go back. -JJ"
2017-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Garrett & Kara were great to work with, and their property is beautiful! The A-frame Haus is super clean, modern, and fun! If you want a great experience in the Heber City/Park City area, this lodging arrangement is a must!"
2017-07-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"The A-frame is one of the most beautifully designed spaces I've had the pleasure of staying in. Just spectacular. It's off the beaten path, quiet and cozy, and has beautiful views. My only tip is that the windows, while stunning, don't have curtains so be prepared to wake early with the morning light (or bring an eye mask ;)"
2017-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We cannot tell you how much we loved staying in this amazing cabin! It is so cozy, welcoming, quaint, and decorated beautifully. My 8 year olds first words when we walked through the door were, ""Please say this isn't just a dream!"" There is a cute ladder that goes up to small storage space in the master bedroom. My kids turned it into their playroom, and must have climbed up and down it 500 times during our 2 day stay! We were all sad to leave but will definitely be back again (hopefully very soon)!"
2017-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"A-Frame Haus is just as lovely and cozy as it looks - a perfect setting for our girls weekend! We wanted to take pictures in every room and from every angle of the property because it was such a beautiful and exceptional space. My friends and I scrapped our plans to go out to dinner in Heber City and opted instead to bring groceries home and eat meals in their fantastic kitchen to maximize our time in this environment. Just spending time in the house itself is an experience and I think it is an ideal location for a family reunion, romantic getaway or any other experience that is focused on intentional quality time with people you love!"
2017-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We really enjoyed our stay. Had a great time with the kids and grandkids. A beautiful home and a beautiful location. It was great working with Garrett.
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Cute little place within an hour drive of so many fun things! We had our three little kids and having space for them to hangout was a huge plus while we were visiting family. The kitchen was well stocked with everything needed to save some money a couple of nights during our stay so we could cook there. A couple of parks nearby offered options for the kids. On-site washer and dryer allowed us to keep up with the laundry and host had some baby items available in the rental so we were able to save some room in the car. 10/10, would use this place again."
2024-06-01,5,Group trip,Cute space! It was clean and spacious.
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Best AirB&B we’ve ever stayed at! Very clean and modern place. Has all the appliances you’ll need. 100% recommend
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,I loved this place! It’s very homie and comfortable!
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,The house was very clean & nice. The host was quick to respond when we needed something. I would love to stay here again!

2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,Beautiful! Wonderful place to stay!
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"VISITING FOR A SECOND TIME - WE STAYED HERE LAST MARCH AND JUST LOVED IT. WE HAD A WONDERFUL TIME ONCE AGAIN. WE DROVE THROUGH TOWN AND SAW THE BLACK AND WHITE MAGPIE AND TONS OF DEER, AND WENT TO THE BACK 40. THE FOOD AND TENT ROOM WERE AMAZING, WE LOVED IT. WE ONLY
WISH WE COULD HAVE STAYED ANOTHER NIGHT.
THANK YOU SORENSEN FAMILY!
DEFINITELY WILL BE BACK
CLINT & JENNA"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great place to stay! Impressive hot tub and theater room. Kitchen was also just what we needed to cook a nice meal. As stated by other reviews, bed was comfortable. Spectacular views off the back of the home.
We knew this going in, but kids / family live above so there is definitely noise from upstairs but host fully disclosed ahead of time. Would stay again."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Loved staying here and will definitely stay again!
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,Great place!
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,Clean and comfy!
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Absolutely beautiful property. There’s something about the location itself that calms you. You’re surrounded by trees and green fields with a beautiful mountain view. The place was pristine clean and the bed in the theater room was made up which made us feel welcomed right away. The theater room was spacious and cozy. The kitchen was well equipped with everything you’d need even kid friendly dishes, and bakeware. The gas stove was a nice perk. And the shower was heavenly. The attention to detail was greatly appreciated as there were clear instructions on how to operate everything. Sitting around the fire with tons of firewood to roast marshmallows with was a wonderful experience. Our favorite thing was hopping inside the hot tub every night. What a way to relax. Really set us up for a good night’s sleep. Another favorite was having breakfast outside on the patio furniture. We enjoyed every minute and can’t wait to be back!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The place was clean and amazing! We loved it! Such fun amenities. The hosts are very thorough - Everything was well thought through.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Awesome little place. It was very easy to get in and I felt I could reach out if I had questions, although I didn’t need to. Instructions were clear and the welcome sheet was informative! Definitely loved the hot tub and theater room! I was there with my small family but I’d gladly go back for a girls’ weekend."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"My boy and I had a wonderful time at Jake’s basement apartment! The movie theater room was lots of fun and we really enjoyed spending time in the hot tub. Jake was very kind and a great communicator, and he also came outside and lit the fire pit for us. We’d love to stay again sometime!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,Great place!
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Was definitely an awesome stay! Really enjoyed the movie room, fireplace and hot tub. Would definitely stay here again!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Place was perfect for a family of four. It's a cute little place and nice family. Liked that is was a quiet neighborhood to get away from the city and enjoy the surroundings of Heber/ Midway area. Had everything we needed to make meals, hot tub towels, room to play games and a nice shower :)"

2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"Jake's place was just absolutely beautiful! We came to celebrate my birthday and have a weekend getaway with my husband and I, and we're so happy that we found this gem!
It looked just like the photos and even BETTER in person. The place was SO squeaky clean, and felt so comfortable! We loved using the hot tub at night and the patio with all the lights, made for such a beautiful romantic getaway! The theater was so much fun and so comfy, felt like we had our very own private movie theater. They had everything you could need for a home away from home. We didn't want to leave! Would absolutely recommend this place to anyone!
We definitely will be coming back to visit soon! Thank you again for being amazing hosts!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"Very clean space, and the movie theater was awesome!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed over a week,"This is a spacious basement apartment with a marvelous outdoor hottub. It's surprisingly private, and the view looks out to undeveloped ranchland. Jake described it well - there is a family upstairs, but they are very considerate and quiet - much more so than some apartments I've stayed in. The theatre room is pretty awesome, as well!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Jake’s basement apartment was just what we needed. The area was incredibly peaceful and quiet. We enjoyed the built-in theater room, gorgeous surroundings, and quaint local food spots. Would definitely stay here again, and highly recommend this lovely home! Thanks Jake!!!"

The stone steps down to the patio and entrance were so grand and really made us feel like we truly were in the mountains! The fireplace in the corner was wonderful as it allowed a view out of the large picture window at the same time we were enjoying the fire. Everything felt so comfortable. It was really a wonderful experience!

2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Our stay exceeded expectations. This suite is as advertised, and the privacy and serenity of the location were better than we expected. The suite was clean and comfortable, the hot tub and theater room were awesome. Any noise from upstairs was minimal and not disruptive or inconvenient; in fact, we hardly noticed it and felt like we had the place to ourselves! We would definitely recommend this suite to other visitors, and we would visit again."
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The cleanliness of this airbnb matches some of the nicest 5 star resorts I have stayed in. Greatly enjoyed our time here & exploring the town while we skied in Park City. Wonderful hosts as they shoveled the steps daily with the snow.

We loved the views, the hot tub, centrality to so many wonderful places (we went to Park City for drinks and shopping)…Wasatch Mountain State Park for hiking/snowshoeing thanks to the recommendation from Amanda…and took our last day to drive to Solitude for skiing (but even more skiing closer). The hosts were attentive and quick to respond. The place was perfect and the amenities were wonderful (fire pit with wood, hot tub, TV room, fireplace, toiletries, coffee) all the big and little things just really made the stay! Will definitely be back!"

With a theater room, hot tub and a well stocked kitchen, what more could two friends who live far apart need for a relaxing getaway? But most importantly, the hosts were always quick to respond and weren't bothered by any texts and late night movie noises. I hope they realize what a gem they have created. We'll be back, for sure!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is a wonderful place to stay. It is extremely clean and looks just like the listings. The hot tub is great, especially on a chilly night. I would definitely recommend this to anyone looking for a peaceful place to stay."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"Beautiful place and wonderful stay. The hosts were super friendly and very helpful as well as responsive to last minute questions! It was a bit smaller than I was expecting, especially for the price, but it was still a wonderful place and I enjoyed my stay very much."

2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was my second time staying at Jake and Amanda’s place in Heber. It was just as wonderful as the first time. Everything was very clean.

2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Dat shower!!! If you book this place for nothing else, do it for the shower. Overall the place was great. Everything we needed was there and enjoyed watching some vids on the giant screen. But that shower…nice!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"A truly beautiful spot! Private, comfortable and roomy.
So many lovely ""perks"" (hot tub, movie room, private patio). Wish we could have stayed longer. One of the nicest Air Bnb's we've stayed at. Jake was super responsive with answers to any questions. We kind of want to live there!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay. Beautiful views. Awesome theater room. Place was clean.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed about a week,"This was a beautiful Airbnb, we were there for a family gathering, It rained so our outdoor plans did not come to be, but we made other plans that worked out. Jake is correct about having an active family upstairs. You hear all of the footsteps. Kids do run everywhere, but it was not bothersome. Almost a laugh at wishing we had half of their energy."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"We absolutely loved our stay at Jake’s place, this was a pit stop for us en route to Moab from Jackson and it was ideal, wish we could have stayed for longer! Absolutely pristine, well equipped and super private. Thank you so much!"

I do wish the kitchen has a few basic seasonings available other than salt and pepper. Also, some ice would have been nice to have available too. But those were small things. We really enjoyed our stay."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,Very nice location and beautiful place
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,Jake's place is wonderful! The kids enjoyed the playground we enjoyed the sitting area as well as the hot tub and the movie theater
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We could not have asked for a better experience and place to unwind and celebrate my birthday weekend. The whole process was seamless and the host’s thoughtful attention to detail was immediately noticed and appreciated. Our children absolutely loved the theatre room, the property was tranquil and beautiful, and we loved everything about our stay. Already planning a time to go back!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great space, beautiful area, loved the theater room and hot tub, and easy to use both. Really enjoyed my time there."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"What a great place! Pristine. The hot tub and private patio were a bonus! The grounds are beautiful and they even have a fire pit with roasting sticks. We loved everything about the space. And who doesn’t love watching shows in the theater room!
We would love to stay there again!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Such a beautiful stay. We hiked, played at Deer Creek reservoir, visited local restaurants from Jake’s recommendations, and tried to find a way to be their new neighbors! Ended up in park city for a dinner - super quick and easy to get to! Drove home through Provo, also really easy, short drive. We can’t wait to head back and explore more!"

2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Jake and Amanda have created a beautiful getaway that was perfect for our little family. The kids had a great time playing in the yard and playground, roasting marshmallows in the fire pit, exploring on the trail and watching movies in the home theater. The work they put into the property is very apparent and has created a tranquil place to stay.
A vey welcome surprise was how well the hosts treated any questions we might arise from us guests. They left laminated instructions highlighted everything from controlling the air conditioning to using the hot tub and the home theater which was extremely helpful.
Lastly, the hosts were very accommodating, communicative and responsive. We will definitely be coming back to stay here the next time we visit if we can and I would recommend the same to anyone."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We really enjoyed our stay. His home is surrounded by mountains on all sides. It's located in a nice neighborhood. We enjoyed the theater room. We had a hiccup with the AC initially, but Jake was proactive and everything worked out. We would definitely stay again. Overall, we liked the rental, location and beautiful Utah mountains. We would not hesitate to book again and recommend to others. Thank you Jake!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"In a beautiful location and an amazing neighborhood. The rental itself was spotless and everything felt very nice inside. The home theater was a real treat too!
One thing that I saw at least one other reviewer mention too is that you don’t really have full (any?) control over the cooling/heating system within the place. The vents were blowing cold air when I had the thermostat off. Fortunately the owner was out of town so they were able to have someone local come over to turn off the upstairs system and that resolved the issue for me."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed about a week,"This was our second stay at Jake’s place. Last time was March when there was lots of snow on the ground. This time, middle of July with beautiful mild mornings and hot afternoons. When not fishing on the Provo, we relaxed on the Adirondack chairs in the shade enjoying a beautiful breeze. So peaceful and relaxing. The apartment was wonderful…as before…very clean and well appoint. We made good use of the bbq grill and the TV room. We hope to visit Jake’s place again soon."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,Great place. Nice yard and lovely views. There is a small playground area on the property that was great for our 2 year old. Not too far from town and very quiet neighborhood
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We loved our stay here! It was very clean and they were quick to respond. The movie room was really fun and we loved using the hot tub and fire pit.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Extremely pleasant. Lovely hosts.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"This was an excellent place to stay! Just far enough from downtown to have the peacefulness of the country while still only being a 5 minute or so drive to restaurants and amenities.
The basement apartment itself was very clean and comfortable- the theater room was great, and the hot tub was the perfect place for us to relax in the evening.
The hosts were also very friendly and willing to help if we had need of anything. We will happily stay here again and recommend it to others as well!"

2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"Really enjoyed my time at Jake’s place.
I took advantage of the hammock outside by the fire pit and listened to the frogs croak and birds chirp in the evening.

2023-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Our little family needed a place to stay along our cross country move. We appreciated the travel baby setup and really loved how clean the property and living space was. Probably the cleanest properties we have stayed at which is a plus.
Thank you Jake and family for allowing our family to stay a night. Also our toddler loved watching Harry Potter on the big screen. The view on the morning was amazing. Would definitely come back if we pass through again.
Thanks"

Jake and Amanda were exceptional hosts… so warm and friendly and genuine. We would definitely stay here again!"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Wonderful place! Highly recommend it to anybody who is staying in the Heber or even park city area. Feels far away enough where it’s quiet, but also you are still very close to lots of things to do. A very clean place. The theater room is also a lot of fun. The price as well is also very good.

2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My husband and I have been to quite a few airbnbs in our time and this one ranks as one of the best! The private hot tub and amazing theater room takes it to another level. It was spotlessly clean and very comfortable. If we ever find ourselves in Utah again, we would absolutely hope to stay here again."

The property backs a large open undeveloped area where we had plenty of deer visit each day. The place is very clean with nice amenities like a convection oven/microwave, rainfall shower, echo dot for music, fireplace, leather recliners, 3 rows of theater seating with one folding out to a bed, large picture window that made it nice and bright, dedicated parking area and separate entrance. Great location to get away but within 10 minutes to downtown Heber.
Definitely recommend staying at Jake’s place and would book it again."

This AiRBnB is so clean and the views are beautiful and incredible. The bed is cozy, the hot tub is nice, (with towels provided) the theater room was a lot of fun too. We can’t decide which is our favorite part! The shower is it’s own little element and. Now I wish that I had the same one at home.
We also went into to town (Midway) and ate at Lola’s. It was very nice and it’s a little happening place with amazing food.
Thank you Jake, we can’t wait to come back!"

We really appreciated all the little details Jake included, from the list of local recommendations, to complimentary chocolates, to easy-to-follow instructions for everything. Jake was also very easy to communicate with. The space itself was so cute and comfortable. We loved soaking in the hot tub and using the home theater room. It felt like our own private space. Unfortunately it had snowed recently, meaning that the fire pit and chairs were totally covered and not usable, but there was still plenty of other great stuff to do. This is definitely one of the best Airbnbs I've ever been to and I highly recommend it."
2023-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"It was a wonderful, peaceful get away. We went to one of our favorite restaurants - Back 40, and spent a quiet evening in the fabulous home theater. The place was perfectly clean very comfortably beautiful. We would book this again."
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"A very nice space, private and with amenities not usually found in small rentals like a big private hot tub and huge theater room! We were there to ski Sundance Resort which was a short easy drive from the house. Location was also close to the good restaurants in Midway.
Jake does specify that his family with kids live upstairs and to expect some noise, but we found that the noise was only noticeable during the early evening when we were up making noise of our own. The kids settled down well before our bedtime and it was quiet and peaceful. Thanks Jake and family for a wonderful stay!"

The suite has everything one could need for a private getaway. We enjoyed the steaming hot tub right outside the door and a movie in the home theater. The kitchen and bathroom were well-appointed and the suite was a complete home away from home. The home theater was also the perfect dark and quiet place where our baby could nap!

The hot tub was very comfortable, relaxing, and easy to use. Also we loved the tile shower with multiple heads. The only slight complaint we had was that there was some thumping from upstairs and also a long walk from the Airbnb entrance to where the car was parked. (We realize that the host said there would be noise upstairs in the ad.) But all in all it was a very nice welcoming stay in a beautiful environment."
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was such a great place to stay! The movie room is absolutely perfect. We wanted a weekend “away” and this is just what we needed. Plus, the shower is amazing. The truffles left for us was such a fun surprise! We felt welcomed, safe, and at home!"

It was nice to have the full stove and oven--the small fridge and dishwasher were totally fine for us.

We were less than 1/2 mile to the Homestead Crater. Our primary trip goal was for my 16 year old nephew to become Open Water Dive certified. Which we accomplished - yay! Melynne’s home was the perfect “home” away from home to relax. The kitchen was one of the best stocked kitchens I’ve seen at Airbnb rentals, although we didn’t use anything because the suggested restaurants in town were delicious! Great host, crater and town. We would highly recommend and would definitely return! If your trip involves the Crater, Rich and Lori are amazing!!!!"
2023-03-01,5,Group trip,So happy we found this. It is beautiful and clean. I was worried it would be too small for our froup of 6 but it was perfect. We loved it.

The staircase to get to the apartment is long. One of our party brought a huge suitcase and struggled getting it up and down. She was told there were stairs, but apparently thought she could manage it (and she did. I'm just mentioning it for others to consider).

One consideration if you have heavy or large luggage: the stairs are a bit steep, and may be tight maneuvering."
2022-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The loft was exceptional. We enjoyed our time here. Midway offered great activities (I recommend the crater, snow tubing and lunch at cafe galleria in the globes). The trip to Park City for shopping or skiing is short. Perhaps most importantly the space provided by the loft was comfortable for our large family, sparkling clean and unbelievably well organized and stocked with essentials. You will enjoy your stay here."

2021-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"Fantastic little loft! Me and my gf wanted a quick getaway from work/life/kids to recharge and have some time for just us. This was perfect. We loved the view and the place is so cozy. My gf loved it.
Cleaning fee was steeper than others I’ve seen, but it wasn’t a big enough deterrent when booking because the nightly rate was very affordable. Would definitely stay again if I was planning to visit midway again."
2021-12-01,5,Group trip,"My wife, three adult kids and myself had an incredible stay at the Loft. Great location, fantastic hosts and a 5 star facility that was in my budget.

2024-06-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Definitely worth the price. Located in a quite neighborhood.
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Jeannine’s Zen Den was perfect for us. We couldn’t ask for anything more in an Airbnb. This is not only now our favorite place to stay in the Heber/Park City general area, but it is easily in our top three Airbnbs.
Here are some examples of the nice things we experienced:
1. Personal welcome note inside
2. Rack for shoes at the entrance
3. Refrigerator with a good freezer - we love ice!
4. Convenient washer/dryer
5. Notification of some cool local events
6. Nice temperature control system
7. Sound machine for sleeping
8. Comfortable bed, sheets, and pillows
9. Nice shower and tub
10. Very peaceful and quiet
We basically needed a place to sleep and get cleaned up, so we didn’t use the full-size kitchen and well-furnished TV room, but if someone also needed those then this place would be awesome for that.
Jeannine is an excellent host."

2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,Lots of personal touches. Very cleans.

Even though this is a basement apartment it has such great natural light so you don’t feel like you’re in a cave. The bathroom is AMAZING! Hot hot hot water, huge tub, spotless. Loved waking up in the morning to see the hot air balloons in the sky and the gorgeous mountains. Plus you literally drive right by Dutch Bros Coffee on your way out to your adventures. Close drive to Jordanelle and Park City without the price tag. City has public transit and location is 2 blocks from shopping and restaurants."

The one thing to be aware of is that it can be a little loud when the air kicks on. Which was only an issue the first night, but we didn't notice it the second night.
Other than that, a fantastic place stay! We'd love to stay here again in the future."

Nice quiet neighborhood and felt very safe. I’d stay here again for my next park city trip."
2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The photos of the Zen Den don't do justice for how peaceful this little escape is. The Zen Den is in one of the most convenient locations in Heber, right near anything you'd ever need, and it's well-stocked with all the basics (plus some) you'd need to feel at home. The entire suite was spotlessly clean, welcoming, and quiet, and the bed was divinely comfortable. There were cooking utensils in kitchen drawers, a mini pantry of non-perishable essentials in the cupboard, and a full-sized fridge with a variety of condiments. Jeannine was a fantastic host—she replied to messages immediately, and she was respectful of our privacy while also eager to help with anything she could. Overall, it was very comforting to know we had this safe place to stay while visiting family in town. We'd love to stay again were we invited back."
2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Fantastic option in Heber. Super comfortable bed and one of the best equipped AirBnB kitchens I've encountered. Will definitely consider staying here again.

Everything we needed was there and, of course, I have to mention the heated floor in the bathroom and the great shower. Comfortable bed, nice neighborhood, plenty of parking space. It is a basement apartment but the stairs are easy, well-lighted and have a railing. Despite being a basement apartment it has big windows and lots of light."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,.
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Mariah offers a spacious basement apartment with a wonderful bathroom, comfortable bed and well equipped kitchen. There is nothing to improve on."

The apartment was spotless clean!
The linens are amazingly soft !!!
Other nice touch was , multiple Kleenex boxes which come very handy when the weather is freezing outside.
The heated floor omg!!! Amazing .
We will be coming back !
Location: close to many restaurants, grocery stores and many things to do around the area with in minutes.
We traveled with 2 kids 5 and 8
We visited the cheese farm ? Kids loved !!! Hanging out with the cows and see with their own eyes farm to table milk process.
We also visited the crater in homestead, took a train tour by the lake , had lunch ate the cafe galleria in Midway.
20 minutes from Park city and 38 from salt lake .
So if you like to explore, Mariah’s places is the perfect spot to stay."

2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We really loved Mariah’s place! Her apartment is beautiful and she was very responsive for any questions that we had. We loved the warm floor in the bathroom, that was awesome specially over the winter. She had everything that you might need for your stay.
The apartment is beautiful decorated, the kitchen was well stocked. Definitely we would stay at her place again."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The place looks just like the photos. Mariah has added touches that made the stay feel high end - plenty of spices in the kitchen, decent cooking utensils, quality linens, fresh robes, shampoo, conditioner, & body wash in the shower, cozy throw blanket for the couch, easy outlets for phone charging.
Other reviews made me a little nervous so I’ll add the bed was slightly more firm than my purple mattress. We slept great! And the sound proofing of the house is great! We heard very little from upstairs except a few muffled running steps of their toddler during the day.
I was able to get a 90 min massage from Mariah during my stay. I would highly recommend it! Her rates are a steal. She was communicative ahead of time about logistics and arrived on time. Her easy manner put me right at ease. She varied the pressure to my needs and incorporated these beautiful extras that made it feel very spa like (aromatherapy, heated table, hot stones, and even a hot towel for my feet!)"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This was one of the most clean/ spotless Airbnb’s me and my husband has stayed in! Clean everything! The heated bathroom floor was such a nice touch! There was everything we needed there. Definitely worth it.

Definitely book!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We absolutely loved our stay at Mariah’s place. Everything was brand new and spotless. Mariah had detailed information for us at a table by the front door. It was so nice to have everything laid out for us so that all of our questions were answered right there. The place had lots of little extras that I enjoyed. My favorite was walking into the bathroom and finding that the floor was heated. Being from Arizona that’s not something we experience. It was so nice and toasty. I also loved the bamboo wash cloths that were provided for taking off your make up. It felt like we were at a spa. In fact, I have ordered some for myself now at home.
Mariah was great to communicate with us when we had questions. I loved that she let us know about a local festival happening in town that weekend. We attended the festival and had a great time.
We enjoyed our little home away from home for the weekend. We liked hanging out and just playing games and being together. Amazing weekend. We’ll return!"

2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We loved our stay at Mariah's place. The space is beautiful. Mariah thought of everything...

We will definitely return to Mariah's place."

But quite the opposite is super bright, well kept, cozy, very clean and very well conditioned, as we roamed the -10º below zero for several nights and we were very comfortable at all times. Definitely one of the top 10 houses of my stays. Recommended!"
2021-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Really nice place to stay. Quick access to the restaurants on Main Street and the major roads, while tucked away in a nice neighborhood. Modern furnishing, very clean, luxurious bathroom with heated floors, and super soft towels. Sound proofing between the levels is well-done—we only heard the host a couple times.
Our only issue was the mattress. It was very uncomfortable.
Everything else was perfect."
2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Would highly recommend staying here! It was a nice getaway and very nice stay.
2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Our stay with Mariah was fantastic! We loved the beautiful new, clean space she created which had a very spa-like atmosphere and was very soothing and calming to be in. The kitchen has all new appliances and had everything we needed to prepare meals during our stay. The bathroom is functional, elegant and warmed with heat lamps and the added surprise comfort of radiant heated floors! My friend, who stayed in the bedroom, repeatedly commented on how comfortable the bed was and the pull out couch in the living room provided both a large comfortable sleeping area for me and a nice place to watch movies with my friends. Communication with Mariah was friendly, prompt and accommodating in all instances. The two friends who shared this space with me during this visit both asked me for Mariah's contact information for future visits to Heber for other friends and family. Mariah is also a massage therapist and offers massage by appointment to those who would like that. While I didn't have time to take advantage of this, this option is definitely an added plus to staying in this space. After thoroughly searching for AirBnB accommodations in Heber City, the value for the price is also second to none. There is no need to search for a better place to stay in Heber, you've already found it!"
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Just as described. Loved it. Will return.
2024-06-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Perfect location for our visit with family.
Very clean and welcoming.
Gift basket with snacks and lovely assortment of teas in the cabinet after a day of traveling."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The unit is centrally located. It’s close to supermarkets, restaurants and everything else you could need. It’s 25 mins to Park City Main Street which was great for sightseeing. The unit is very comfortable and it has very nice views from pretty much every room. The host was very proactive, responsive and very professional. We highly recommend this property."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed over a week,This is a beautiful condo with beautiful views. We were there for 3 weeks skiing and it was perfect! Very clean and comfortable and had a private garage which was great! The hosts were extremely friendly and very responsive! I highly recommend this condo!
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Valene was amazing and very fast responsive. Very communicative. The space was very clean. Great place to stay and nicely furnished. We had a great time, this is a newly place. We felt right at home from the moment we walked in. The treat basket, the decorations, comfortable beds and well stocked kitchen made for a delightful carefree stay. Highly recommend!"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,It was super clean and easy to get to! Valene is so nice and responds to messages quickly! This condo seriously has everything you need and more! Highly recommend!
2024-02-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Thanks for the stay, loved your place!"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We brought the family to celebrate my husbands 40th birthday. It was the perfect distance from the ski resort and such a quiet and peaceful place to stay. It is tastefully decorated and felt just like home. We loved our stay here! Definitely exceeded expectations, and we all can’t wait to come back again☺️"
2024-01-01,5,Group trip,"Great place, great location, and great hosts. Super responsive and lovely extra touches in the place made for a great visit. Would definitely recommend and would stay again."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Beautiful place to stay with everything you could need! Lots of room for the whole family. Games and toys for the kids. Very close to the library, aquatic center and Walmart if you forget anything. We were very pleased and would stay again!"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Location met all of my expectations and was a great value.
2023-11-01,5,Group trip,"Valene was a great host. She checked on us daily through text and offered any help we might need.
The condo is very new, in a quiet neighborhood, close to Heber and Park City. Valene has thought of everything: kitchen supplies, great towels, nice decor, and lovely soap and lotion.
Our family stayed at Valene’s over Thanksgiving. There were six of us, and we were so comfortable. We’d come back in a heartbeat."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,"What an excellent place to stay! The kitchen, bathrooms, linens- everything was well stocked. The unit is brand new and well appointed. The owners were very friendly and proactive- they even offered us a flexible checkout time because of a winter storm coming through! We would definitely stay here again!"
2023-10-01,4,Group trip,My only complaint was that two of the bedrooms had full beds instead of Queens. The pictures didn’t indicate that clearly. The beds were too small for two adults. The condo was new and beautiful. Plenty of parking. Nice amenities. Well stocked kitchen.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The place was lovely! The host provided some fun extra’s like a basket with a few complimentary snacks and drinks. Also some bathroom and personal hygiene items in case you needed them. Plus several games, cards, a few toys and some books were available for use. The place was quiet, well decorated, clean and a fun place to stay. I would recommend it for any small group wanting to enjoy Heber City."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,Nice condo with plenty of room for our family of 5. Walking distance to main street Heber and a short drive to park city. Overall great location.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What a gem!! Close to Provo, several parks, and many great restaurants, but quiet with beautiful surroundings. The apartment is sparkling clean and so well stocked! The little extra thoughtful touches like spices, extra bags, spare toiletries, etc. You can tell that the hosts truly care about their guests! Highly recommend!"
2023-09-01,4,Stayed with kids,"The place was in a perfect location for our needs this past weekend. My toddler loved watching the planes come into the small regional airport. It was clean and spacious. We loved the little touches throughout the home. From a bowl of goodies to the organized cabinets, fun books on the side table, and the kid toys—it was a great place to stay. We weren't in the rental long, as we were there for a wedding reception so we spent most of our time out and about, but it was a nice place to come lay our heads at night."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,Very clean and nicely decorated condo! Beautiful views from the master bedroom too! This was one of the cleanest airbnbs we’ve stayed in! My daughter appreciated the coloring book and reading books too! Valene was a great host and we were very happy with our stay!
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,Ver modern and spacious. Oversized shower in master which was great. Very close to town.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great Airbnb, we really enjoyed our stay here. It’s spacious and had all the amenities we needed! The location is great, in a new and quiet neighbourhood. I would definitely stay here again."
2023-09-01,5,Group trip,"I was visiting for work, I was only sad I couldn't spend more time in the condo. It was super cute, inviting, and comfortable! Great place to stay! Great host too, she got me all the info needed to check in, very clear instructions!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful condo that is nicely appointed, very comfortable beds and lovely furniture. Also, drinks, snacks and toiletries were available for us! That is a very nice extra offering to guests! There were plenty of towels. Great parking and we loved the view from the balcony! However, the road noise is quite loud but couldn't hear it from inside. The smart thermostat is easy to navigate but only allowed to turn down to 69 and only for 3 hours before it returned to the default 72 so I woke up hot to reset it. It should be noted that this condo is on the 3rd floor and it's 1 mile plus walk to main street so I wouldn't consider this location walkable. Great hosts, very responsive with clear check-in and out instructions. Overall, great property!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"It worked out well for us. Kitchen had everything we needed to cook, which is one of the main reasons we needed an Airbnb. The garage is small, but it fit our small truck (another plus for us with outdoor equipment in the back). It is at the top of multiple flights of stairs - just something to be aware of but not an issue for us."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had an awesome time here at Valene’s place! Very well kept apartment, and overall a fantastic experience! Would definitely stay here again!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This property was better than expected. The coffee and tea were a nice touch. I am not a coffee drinker and it is rare that a place offers tea much less a variety! Love the town of Heber City. The beds were very comfortable. The only suggestion I could make is maybe a few more hangers in the closet. Highly recommend this place!
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This condo is beautiful. It has everything you need to be comfortable and cook your own meals. We appreciated the snacks and water that were left for us. Super easy to communicate with our hosts. Would definitely stay here again!
2023-07-01,5,Group trip,"What a perfect place! My daughters and I and our significant others stayed there for a family wedding in Midway. Everything was perfect - attractive, modern, clean, and comfortable. The kitchen and bathrooms had everything we needed. We enjoyed sitting on the balcony in the mornings, soaking up the mountain views. Thank you!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We had a great experience staying at this location and would definitely recommend it. Valene was proactive at reaching out and giving detailed instructions on the property. The condo was brand new, super clean, and spacious. Would definitely stay here again."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was a great place to stay. It was close to the Uintas and hiking, Park City, and Provo Canyon. It was a great get away for the weekend.
It was very clean--brand new! Everything about it was easy. It is on the third floor, which I think it says that in the description.
We love our stay and would stay again. Much nicer than staying in a hotel. It would be really great for a family. They had everything you need to make yourself at home!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,This property was fantastic! The Host was very responsive and answered all questions quickly. This property is new and spacious. It was perfect for our family getaway. We definitely recommend this place!
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Valene's place was perfect for our stay in the Heber Valley. It was very spacious, clean, and quiet and had a lot of special touches that made it stand out from other AirBnBs I've stayed in.
Valene was very communicative prior to and during our stay and really made us feel welcome and at home. She was very flexible and worked with us prior to our arrival to accommodate a change in itinerary, which we very much value and appreciate.
The unit itself is very new with plenty of amenities both in and around the place. The beds were super comfortable and it was a cozy place to return to after our day out. Thank you so much for your wonderful hospitality, Valene and co-hosts!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This place was beyond beautiful! So spacious and very clean. Lots of amenities. Fully stocked kitchen… Comfortable bed. Lots of towels. Laundry on site. Overall a beautiful place! There is a lot of stairs to get to the unit but it’s good exercise. We would definitely stay here again!!!! Great host! Everything you need. Including shampoo, conditioner, and body wash!!!! Can’t beat it !"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My husband and I stayed at this great condo for our anniversary for a few days and it was perfect! Immaculately clean, quiet, all amenities as listed and then some. Hosts were excellent to work with and very responsive. Will definitely stay here again and would give this my highest recommendation."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We enjoyed our stay. It was easy to find, very clean, kitchen fully stocked with possibly needed cooking items. It was a quiet, peaceful unit. Had one issue with the garage keypad and Valene was quick to respond. A very spacious place."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Our stay was truly enjoyable from the incredible accomodations to the kindness of our host. The property itself was kept in great condition, exceptionally clean and well stocked with all manner of supplies, including extra bedding, blankets, towels and a wonderful welcoming gift basket. All instructions for the property were hung on the wall for reference. There were games and books which were a nice added touch. Our host really put thought into the presentation and upkeep of this property. The hosts' communication with us was always very quick and positive. This stay is by far one of our favourites!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Perfect place for a stay in Heber! Very clean and well -stocked. Provides the extras the others sometimes miss, such as Kleenex and lotion in the bathrooms, throws and pillows on the couches, extra towels and blankets, k-cups and half n half, water bottles and snacks, ECT. Communication was proactive and caring, readily available when needed yet absent when not. We stay frequently in Airbnb's and this was one of our favorites!"
2023-04-01,5,Group trip,"Beautiful brand new condo with beautiful views of the surrounding mountains! Host is friendly and responsive and amenities are just as listed. Located in a great area, about a mile off Main St. in Heber, though be prepared for stairs being on the third floor, definitely doable but might be tricky for older people. Spacious and decorated so beautifully, wonderful place to stay for families!"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The host was responsive and sent out all the needed info a couple days ahead. The place was exactly as described with lots of cute added touches throughout. There was plenty of cooking supplies to make pretty much anything. The bathrooms were very well stocked with towel of all sizes if needed with soap and lotions. The apartment is on the third floor so get ready for some good exercise going up the stairs :).
The location is easy to find and set on the outskirt of Heber so you don't have as business of the city. The area location has a lot of new construction but it wasn't bad. Definitely would recommend staying here and working with the hosts."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed over a week,"Excellent place to stay, brand new and cozy. The hosts were terrific and very helpful. They are the best hosts I've had along my trip over the last ten months. Great location if you want to get around the mountains or head into the city. I will definitely stay here again!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Very spacious, enough room for our family of 5 with room to spare. The beds were extremely comfortable."
2024-06-01,4,Stayed one night,"The space is very large and big. The couch was super comfortable and big we definitely enjoyed watching some movies on there. The ONLY thing I would say is read all of the details about the basement. There is not a separate door to lock or shut to separate the owners living upstairs, it was only separated by a curtain. It felt a little weird to us. Again I definitely didn’t read that there wasn’t a door and only a curtain for a door (until we got there) so just make sure to read all of the descriptions. Just with 3 woman we felt a little unsafe knowing anyone could come downstairs and we didn’t have a door or anything. But if you don’t care about that then it’s totally fine! The space really was nice and big and the beds were super comfortable!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"very nice, peaceful, and fun place to stay ! felt like a home away from home 🏡 great hosts !"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Ross was easy to work with, and communicated well. Place was nice and had plenty of entertainment options."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,Beautiful home and neighborhood. Great communication and easy to access.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,nice place. Clean and had some fun stuff for the kids to do. They liked the pool and the basketball shoot and the xbox. Conviently located to city center but still peaceful and quiet.
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Wonderful stay! So welcoming, felt like home! Clean and comfortable beds!
Great instructions on location, how to access home and how to use all amenities provided. Ross was quick to reply with helpful answers and kind. Definitely recommend! 5 ☆☆☆☆☆'s !"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,As described and was a large space. Everything worked out well.
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"fantastic place to stay! felt like a welcoming, peaceful home & place to be. clean, decorated, and well-loved and taken care of. ross was very welcoming with fast response time and so helpful with any questions. close to so many activities & deer valley & park city are just north."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Let’s just say the ping pong table was put to good use! We had such a blast at Ross’s place. The amenities and location were perfect for us. Ross was an extremely attentive host. We’d be very likely to stay again.
2024-02-01,5,Stayed one night,Ross was a great host. Let us book last minute and took great care of us.
2024-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Ross’s place was awesome for our family of two kids (ages 7 and 4) and two adults! The games kept us all entertained, and the bedrooms, family room, and bathroom were clean and comfy and inviting. We had a great time!"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed one night,Last minute getaway and we lucked out by finding this place. Lots of room and spacious. We enjoyed the pool table and ping pong table and basketball game (balls need a little inflating😉). Lovely tub with jets and great shower pressure. Comfy bed and we brought things to cook for dinner and breakfast. Great little kitchen…a can opener would have been helpful but maybe we just overlooked it. Love sac chair was super comfy to watch tv. Would have been a little more comfortable with a door to the upstairs but it wasn’t a big deal. All in all a lovely relaxing stay! Would definitely book again!
2024-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"Ross communicates well, nice location. Comfortable place with lots of room. Very clean.
We enjoyed our stay.
We would stay at this location again."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We spent several days at Ross’s place and would definitely recommend it.
The entire place was comfortable, and inviting. Check in was easy and effortless.
I am personally someone who doesn’t feel comfortable staying at my friend’s house, much less a complete stranger, but I was completely comfortable at this rental.
The pool table was fun, and utilized. Coffee pot was small enough to please the coffee drinkers in our group, but not large enough to waste coffee.
I really liked having the fridge with the built in ice maker, and water.
The rooms were very spacious, and the single bathroom was perfect. Someone could take a shower while someone else was using the sink area, and it wasn’t an inconvenience.
Great place to lay your head while exploring the area."
2024-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This was our first time staying in Heber City, UT. Ross was a great host. He was very responsive from the start. The Home was easy to find and access. We actually thought the space looked better in person than in the photos. The place was very spacious with two bedrooms and a great living space with fun amenities to keep everyone busy."
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Ross was a spectacular host, to say the least. He was quite responsive when I messaged him. The place was absolutely amazing. It is a great place for families or people with several guests. The basement mother-in-law suite was clean, spacious, new, fresh, upscale, and made me feel right at home (I like nice places). I would HIGHLY recommend this property. Even though it is in Heber City, I found it easy to drive to Park City for skiing. The surrounding community is quaint and friendly. Overall, I highly recommend this property and would stay here again if my travels bring me to the Park City area! Thank you, Ross!!!"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Great, safe, clean space for a great price, and the host was very responsive and friendly!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Everything was as expected. This is an extremely nice location close to Main Street. If we are back in Heber, we will definitely look up this location again."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Our stay at Ross's was exactly as described. The place was clean and comfortable. Ross was great at communicating and very flexible. I wish there was a door instead of curtains, separating to basement, just because our granddaughters are loud and I was worried about disturbing anyone upstairs. Other than that, everything was great and we really enjoyed the space. We would stay here again."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"Long story short - we loved this place so much! My partner was hesitant to book via Airbnb over a hotel, let alone share a house, but he and the kids have been raving about it ever since we left. The amount of thought which went into making our stay comfortable meant so much, and honestly the space was so spacious and private.
If ever we are in the Heber City area again, we will look Ross up to see if we can stay at his home again.
Highly, highly recommend!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Enjoyed our stay here, just wish we were able to be in town longer and really enjoy it more as it had such a great setup. The space has a great layout, beautifully clean and very comfortable - king size beds were a bonus I was not expecting. Ross was also so accommodating with our mountain bikes being safely stored & replied promptly to messages. The neighborhood was easy to navigate (maps took me right there). It was a little difficult to find the house itself as it was dark & not many street lights, but that’s on me because we arrived much later than planned & I have terrible night vision. It was much easier in the morning light to easily see the house and numbers. Would most definitely stay here again next time we come up to Heber City."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great place in a nice neighborhood. Clean, convenient and very comfortable. Would recommend."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Ross’s place was spacious and very comfortable. We had privacy and felt at home. The decor was beautiful and new. Ross thought of everything. We couldn’t have had a better stay. The floor bed was in a fun space and was a welcome extension of one of the bedrooms. It would be a great place for kids to sleep near mom and dad. Heber city is beautiful and near many recreational areas.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Ross was a great host! We felt right at home. The location was super close to many restaurants and things to do/see, yet tucked in a quiet neighborhood. It was exactly what we wanted. The fireplace, basketball game, and pool table were great additions and heightened our experience. I’d definitely stay here again."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,We enjoyed our stay and would stay here again. The pool table was fun. The beds were comfortable along with the couch. It was quiet and very cozy. Highly recommend.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"Very nice and spacious place, exactly as described in the listing. Clean and quiet. Host is responsive. Feels like home!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great place! Lots of space, has select board games, and a ver comfy Lovesac! Easy to get in, awesome instructions for device use as well as getting in."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,We had a great time! I would stay there again. So nice to have the Bullard table and basketball game. It made it a lot of fun! Very close to town and the shops. And the place is plenty big!
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Absolutely perfect was close to everything easy in and out I would stay there again. Had lots to do for my 3 kids which was a huge bonus kids had a great time and kept themselves entertained
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great spot with lots of space and cool themed rooms. Loved the pool table.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The place was very spacious and nice entertainment pool table and a mini basketball hoop game. The rooms were big and beds were comfy. Only thing was there wasn't a door the basement, but a closing curtain at the bottom of the stairway. But even with just the curtain still had privacy and was quite."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,Ross was amazing. The place was spotless and felt very comfortable and welcoming. Ross was very helpful when we arrived in town early and was very and responsive and accommodating. Will definitely stay with Ross again next time we are in town.
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We had a great time at Ross’s place! We have 4 kids under age 11 and we had plenty of space. We all really enjoyed the ping pong table, pool table, basketball game, and Xbox. Our 3-year-old also loved the space under the stairs with toys and a little guitar. Ross was very responsive when we had things come up. Fireplace isn’t currently working and the kitchen faucet was a little tricky as the handle is broken. Neither was a big deal to us. Before coming, I was worried about how private it would be. But it felt very separate once we were downstairs. The host was respectful of keeping the space private. Thanks for a fun trip!"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"This place was comfortable, spotless, and beautiful. Several amenities and an amazing jacuzzi tub. The beds were extraordinarily comfortable and it was nice a quiet. Ross was responsive and gave excellent instructions. The location was gorgeous there were even deer in the neighborhood that greeted us ☺️. Location was close to restaurants and entertainment. We will definitely be back and will stay even longer. Excellent property and host you can not go wrong. There is a ton of space and all comfortable."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Last year, we rented an Airbnb in SLC (which was great), but this trip we were doing winter activities (x-country skiing and snowmobiling) both southeast of SLC, and booked Ross's place in Heber. Pictures and descriptions looked too good to be true, but ALL WAS SPOT ON! The full kitchen, comfy leather sectional, large smart TV's in all rooms, pool table, comfy king beds, large bathroom with good water pressure were as described and amazing. While there, we took ski lessons at the Soldiers Hollow Nordic Center, snowmobiled out at Daniels Summit Lodge, and took two trips to Park City, and all were super easy to get to and only 20-25 minutes away. I absolutley would recommend Ross's Airbnb, and hopefully it is available the next time we visit the Beehive State!"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The host was awesome and very responsive. The area was much larger than I expected which was a nice bonus. Definitely recommend staying here.

2023-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"Clean, fun games, great space. There is no door to the basement so it's not as private as I would have liked but it's very nice and comfortable and clean. The living space is large and fun for gathering. Highly recommend!"
2023-02-01,5,Stayed one night,lots of space.. impressive accommodations for the price. Great Christian atmosphere.

2023-01-01,5,Group trip,Great stay. Everything as listed. Would highly recommend.

2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Ross was super helpful and kind. The place was a perfect place to rest our heads during Sundance. We had a car and was able to drive into park city. It was exactly as pictured and very spacious.
2022-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"We loved staying here! Lots of fun games, clean, and great communication."
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Clean, comfortable and spacious. We'll be back"

2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Perfect spotless spot in a beautiful location! Thank you!

2022-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"This is a luxurious place to stay. Very clean and very comfortable. Very easy check in, and easy communication with our host. We wished we had had our grandchildren with us so they could have played basketball and ping pong in the rec room."

2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is a wonderful place to stay! Safe parking in a private driveway There is plenty of space to spread out. Lots of windows so it doesn’t seem like a basement area at all. Very clean!
Close to a grocery store, coffee shops & restaurants. They checked to make sure we had everyone we needed. Los of games for kids & adults. Bedrooms are very spacious. We’re definitely going to rebook for our next visit."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"Awesome stay, host was super tentative with helping us and recommending areas to go. The suite is clean, comfy, and homey."

2022-07-01,5,Group trip,"We were there for just one night but if we ever come back for more time we'll definitely be staying here! Ross was great at communicating with me regularly. I was a little concerned that it might not be very private when we had to access the basement through the main house mudroom but it was actually a very private and homey basement. The ping pong table and pool table made for an extra fun evening in with my teens!
Highly recommend! 😊"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,Wonderful home! Convenient locations for our baseball tournament. Has everything we needed.

2022-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Ross and Holly were very kind and thoughtful. They'd been waiting for a new mattress to arrive for one of the bedrooms, but the delivery didn't come the day we arrived.

2022-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"This listing is very accurate! The place is huge, and very clean. The host was friendly and helpful in our communications."
2022-04-01,4,Stayed one night,"A full basement with lots to do! This seems to be ideal for larger groups. I’m not sure if the description was updated after I booked or not, but I didn’t realize that there is no separation from the rest of the house from the basement. It has two bedrooms, and one of them is difficult to lock because it connects to the bathroom and has a children’s playroom/ wall cut out that leads to the rest of the house. That is the only reason I gave 4 stars, because I would prefer rooms that can easily be secured, but everything else was clean, had lots of activities, and the host was very responsive."
2022-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Awesome location for a getaway to Heber for a family. My kids loved the basketball and pool, and Xbox. Heber is awesome for hiking and family activities. Check-in was easy and the neighborhood was nice and quiet. Loved it!"

Not much else to say. We didn't have a super long stay but really enjoyed our time"
2022-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,We loved staying here. The space was just right for our needs. Easy to come and go as we wanted to. Easy to communicate with the host. He would send us a message everyday we were there letting us know that they cared about our experience and if we needed anything or if there was anything they need to change for us to give them a five star rating. I would totally recommend this place to others and will use it in the future if needed
2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Excellent place to base for the weekend. Lots of room to spread out and good beds. Tv, pool table and basketball game were fun.
Super clean!"
2022-03-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Clean, comfy space. The beds, couch, and beanbag were great for lounging after a day of skiing. Bathrooms and rooms were all well maintained and clean. The place is a perfect ski “homebase” for accessing the Jordanelle Gondola — very reasonable price for the area.
[Note that it is the basement & is not separate from the house (stairs have a curtain). However, Ross and his family are very peaceful.]"

No door separating you from the upstairs, but not a big deal once you're in the space with the room-darkening curtains drawn. GREAT value for the price, and a good location. Would 100% stay again."
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a great stay in this spacious, well-lit, comfortable, and clean home. The arrival was smooth and instructions were clear. I also appreciated the nicely decorated environment that was welcoming but not cluttered. Thank you, Ross."

The neighborhood felt very safe and clean as well and we enjoyed jogging around this beautiful town early in the morning. Ross and his wife were very kind and always available to help. Truly a 5 star Airbnb it is!"

2021-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"This is my favorite Air BnB I’ve stayed in. We booked a stay with my parents who are older. A note for those who are less mobile…this may not be the place for you. There are quite a few stairs to navigate :).
But if you are able to go up and down several stairs, the location is beautiful; the basement is incredibly spacious; the beds are quite comfortable and it’s a bonus that there is an additional floor mattress. We had fun with the basketball game. It was also extremely clean.
Overall, the feeling of this airBnB is luxuriously comfortable. I’d definitely stay again."
2021-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We were very pleased with our stay. The place was clean. Ross responded promptly to my communications.

What a great experience!!
2021-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,What great place! We had such a good time and made some great memories. My kids really enjoyed the basketball and the pool table.

We definitely would stay here again if in the area!

2021-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The place was great and fit our group of three adults, three kids perfectly. The apartment is much more spacious than I expected, everything is in good condition and very clean. The beds were super comfortable. The kids loved the ping pong table and basketball game, and while I was worried about the amount of noise they were making, Ross assured me that the apt was very well insulated and they couldn't hear us. The location has very easy access to Park City and there's a grocery store and bagel place a mile away."

The check in instructions were extremely easy to follow. I was working remotely and the desk in the larger bedroom had plenty of space for 2 big external monitors and a laptop, and I had no issues with the WiFi during the week. The neighborhood is quiet and very nice, and the location is convenient to Park City. Ross is very nice and responds very quickly to any questions. Could not have chosen a better place to stay!"

2021-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We loved our stay here. It was so close to all of our winter activities, skiing, sledding, and the ice castles which was so nice. Me and my kids really enjoyed the pool table and the basketball arcade, we spent countless hours playing and there was a great game collection too. I was a little worried about noise but they must have extra insulation because we barely heard anything and hopefully they didn't hear my noisy kids too much. I loved all the thoughtful touches from the popcorn in the kitchen to the games and toys for kids available. We had a great week and would definitely stay here again."

There was a giant love sack to relax in a super comfortable sectional and amazing king size beds to sleep in. Ross responded quick to any questions we had. The location was so close to everything we wanted to do for the weekend. We saw the ice castles, and went sledding at soldier hollow and had breakfast at the cafe galleria in the globes, and everything was just a short 10-15 minute drive."
2021-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The space was incredible! Super convenient to everything. We came out to dive, but it would’ve been an easy drive up to Park City as well. The place was clean, spacious and comfortable. The ping pong table was a huge plus."

He was quick to answer back, and even came downstairs to help us figure out how to set up the TV to be able to watch the online seminar we were there to complete. It’s located in a nice quiet neighborhood. I am a very light sleeper and thought I would be disturbed by people upstairs, but I never heard anything upstairs during the night.

2020-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Great place for adolescent thru ten kiddos to stay, the pool table, ping pong, XBox, and other ""toys"" to play with. The kitchen was well outfitted for us to prepare our own food. My mom has a hard time with long drives and we discovered that there wasn't a good place for her to sit that provided good lumbar back support (the couch was too soft and the chairs at the table too hard...sounds like a famous fable, I know), but she found a solution. We enjoyed ourselves and the trip went well because this place met our needs."

2020-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Ross was a great host and the home was very comfortable with great amenities. My elderly parents stayed here while we were camping in the area and they loved the home and the hospitality and care that Ross provided. It was very spacious and the beds and couches were very comfortable. The neighborhood is beautiful and we loved the big screen TV and pool table and reclining couches. Ross was very cordial and came and gave us an overview of everything at our request when we arrived and made us feel right at home. We would highly recommend staying here and look forward to coming back.
2020-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is more of a man cave than a mother-in-law suite. It has a full kitchen and two king-sized beds, but the best part is that it has toys and games for all ages. It was a really fun place to stay. The neighborhood is great for walking, and the scenery is spectacular."

2020-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great spot in Heber which is about 20-30 minutes from Park City. If you want a quaint town to hang out in that’s away from the crowds, this is the perfect spot. The downstairs was spacious and comfortable for our visit of skiing and snowmobiling. It was much better than the two queen bed, 600 Sqft condo we stayed at in Park City, and for about 2/3 the price. Also, go to the Dairy Keen in Heber..home of the train!"
2020-03-01,5,Stayed about a week,"This space was exactly what we wanted and more! Close to skiing was a top priority for us. Also, the ping pong table was a HUGE hit for our family and we loved morning walks in the neighborhood. It was great to have a full kitchen as well so we didn’t have to eat out for every meal. The place was outstanding and we definitely will book this again when we get back to Utah!"
2020-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The apartment was even more spacious than we had thought, clean, and totally decked out with everything we needed for our 5 day stay. Ross was very accommodating and friendly.
The apartment is in the basement and only accessible via the main house, but we had plenty of privacy and the side entrance ensured we could come in and out as we pleased without crossing paths with anyone in the main house. A thick curtain covers the entryway at the bottom of the stairs to provide added privacy.
For being 20 minutes outside of Park City, this was a really great value for our ski trip."
2020-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,This is such a perfect Airbnb for families. It was sparkling clean and had some pretty nice amenities! Super private and it has its own little kitchen with a big fridge. Two huge and comfortable beds and one room has a little bed on the side with a play nook for the kids. Super close to Town. We went to the ice Castles and it was about 15 min away. Not to bad at all. The price was great too. We absolutely loved our stay.
2020-02-01,5,Group trip,"Great family place to stay. A lot of fun things to do. We enjoyed board games, pool table n b ball hoop."
2020-02-01,5,Stayed one night,Reasonable priced and with a full basement with a full kitchen. You cannot go wrong with staying with Ross. We added his home to our list and will use his home again if it is available. -Mack

2024-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,This was a great place to stay. We will definitely consider this quaint little place again.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,We loved staying with Ana. It’s an amazing location. Hidden gem in Heber city. So quiet and private. You will love it. Just book it already!
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,It was a nice cozy place to stay. Just the right size and the price was great.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,The place itself was awesome. We definitely enjoyed the solitude and beautiful surroundings.
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,We really enjoyed our time here and being able to have our pups with us! The place was cozy and had just what we needed for our stay. Our host was very responsive and friendly.
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This provided a perfect stay for my girlfriend and me when booking a last-minute stay near Park City for one last ski trip of the winter. A perfect-sized property with a beautiful backyard for the two of us to enjoy & cook meals to avoid eating out at ski resort prices. Would stay here again in a heartbeat.
2024-03-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Perfect location, just a quick drive to the slopes! Ana was great and kept communication. Would definitely stay there again."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"Our trip was kind of last minute, and I’m so thankful Ana’s place was available so we didn’t have to travel home from a dance competition in the snow. The house was cozy and welcoming, and exactly as described. I was happy that when we got there and when we left the sidewalks were cleared for us, and bonus…the snow was removed from my car. Extra blankets were easy to find and the couch set up was great for relaxing hand chatting. We went to Dairy Keen for dinner and their sweet potato fries were delicious. If we do this dance competition again I will for sure stay here again."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Overall we enjoyed our stay. We had an open line of communication with Ana and everything was easy. We found a few additions in the kitchen would be helpful and Ana expressed a willingness to get what we needed. For those where the backyard being fenced is important, know it’s not fenced all the way around. It didn’t impact us, but is good to know. Much appreciated them taking pets!"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Highly recommend - great host and super cozy home. Close to the ski resorts as well.
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was such great stay! Beautiful, private location, very close to everything around Midway and Heber. Fantastic, friendly and responsive host."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Ana was the quintessential hostess! We couldn’t be more happy with our stay this time, and will definitely be back to the cottage again!

2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a wonderful stay at the cottage while in town for my son's mountain bike race. It was just the 2 of us and the accommodations were perfect. The cottage is really cute and comfortable with everything we needed. We cooked several meals in and also walked to restaurants and the grocery store that were nearby. I left a few personal items behind on accident and received a massage from Dustin letting me know before I even realized I had left them.
We would definitely stay here again if back in town!"
2024-04-01,4,Stayed a few nights,The place was very clean and modern. Dustin and heather were nice. Not too much interaction with them. The response time was a little long. The bedroom bed and pull out bed were very comfortable. They had tons of bathroom and kitchen items stocked. Lots of clean linens and towels. I would stay there again !
2024-04-01,5,Stayed over a week,Dustin and Heather’s place is delightful and they were very helpful. They have created a beautiful and efficient place to stay.
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"It was an amazing place to stay. My 7-year-old son absolutely loved the place and felt at home there. It was so charming and had a lot of little extras that were pleasantly surprising. For our needs, it was a perfect fit!! We were both quite sad to leave..... many thanks once again..."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay and worth every penny!
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Dustin's place was the perfect spot to unwind and get a good night's rest after skiing. Would highly recommend staying here.
2024-02-01,5,Stayed about a week,"The hosts are very conscientious and caring people. The communications were easy.
This was a very welcoming space, small yet rich with tasteful design choices. It was so nice to make meals in the kitchen, with utensils, cookware, and an assortment of tea and coffee. The simple accommodations made possible some wonderful adventures while also offering a sense of comfort and safety. The bed was really quite nice to sleep in.
We found the mountains here uniquely beautiful with a quiet divine presence. We go home with a bit of peace, awestruck by the beauty of the area, and the kindness of the hosts."
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had 4 wonderful sunny Skidays in Deer Valley and enjoyed to come ""home"" to a very quiet, well equiped cottage in a safe neighborhood.
Great place as starting point for skiing in Deer Valley or Park City.
Thanks a lot for hosting us.
We're felt us very well in this cottage and would come back every time."
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Dustin and Heather were wonderful hosts and very responsive. They went above and beyond for accommodations. They even delivered olive oil because we ran out and a sponge while we were doing dishes to replace the old one. We especially appreciated all the available spices since we cooked the majority of the time during our stay. We will be coming back in the future.
2024-01-01,5,Stayed over a week,"This is a great location for those who value privacy and want to ski Park City at an affordable price. The kitchen implements were especially valuable, better than usual Airbnb: everything you need, nothing you don't. The hosts were extremely thoughtful and responsive: the hosts even cleared my car from snow!"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This cottage was a perfect little get away from the city for us. The home was very clean and had everything you would need in a home in regard to kitchen items and everything else. We had plans to do some activities in the Heber Valley and we felt so at home that on the one day we just relaxed at this home. Very quiet and warm home.
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"A home away from home! This spacious cottage is such a gem. We absolutely loved every bit of our stay and hated to leave. The bed is SUPER COMFORTABLE, the decor is cozy and tasteful, the kitchen has everything you would need. The cottage is 20 minutes from Sundance Ski Resort and 25 minutes from Park City, making a ski trip super easy when you want to ski, but far enough that you are not bombarded by crowds. Heber City is cute, with a great local market, coffee shops and restaurants. Dustin was very friendly, helpful, and communicative. If you are looking for a cozy cottage retreat, look no further. We can't wait to come back!"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Fantastic. The perfect intersection of quality and value. The house is well-equipped with high-quality linens, a comfortable bed, and nice bath products. We used the kitchen nearly every night and there was actual nice cookware (not just the cheapest items from ikea present in many airbnbs) as well as spices. Heber City is an established town with many shops and grocery stores, yet the cottage is on a residential street that was very quiet at night. Best of all are the hosts, who are kind, responsive, and live right next door—we felt like we were visiting extended family! Skiing at Park City was an easy 20 minute drive. Recommended!"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We loved staying here! It’s the cutest little cottage and within 10-15 minutes of a lot of great restaurants and things to do! I would highly recommend this to anyone!

2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I thoroughly enjoyed my stay with Dustin and Heather. His cottage was extremely comfortable and it was exactly what I'd hoped for. Dustin was extremely communicative and we had a great chat when we ran into each other outside. The location is perfect if you want to explore Heber City or the surrounding area. I also thought, and I might regret this comment, that it was extremely well priced. All in all one of my top three favorite spots of all time and I've been to a few. Would stay there again if I'm ever in the area."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed about a week,Great place to stay in Heber City. Close to everything and the hosts are awesome people. I’d definitely stay here again.

2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Jace’s place was a great location in between Park City and Sundance! Also, Heber City has a wonderful train ride for the kids! The place was spotless and easy to get to and we felt right at home. It is located right off of Main St in Heber City, so you will hear some traffic if you’re a light sleeper. Otherwise, it’s a great place to stay as a hub for your adventures in/around Park City."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Excellent bnb- the host was helpful before we got there, we will definitely be back"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,Wonderful stay! Thank you!
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We were very satisfied with our stay. The Loft was clean and cozy. Perfect for what we needed for our trip.
2024-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This is the second time we’ve stayed at Jace’s Chick’s Cafe Loft. It’s such a cute little place. There are 2 bedrooms and one bathroom. Laundry services on site. Two couches in the living area that fold down into beds. We try to do a little wintery “staycation” every January/February, and Jace’s place is perfect for this. We’re from Cottonwood Heights, so we’re about a 45 minute drive away. This location is right in the middle of all the the awesome things you can do in the Heber valley. We went to the Ice Castles, swam in the Homestead Crater, toured a dairy farm, rode the Heber Creeper train, and ate pizza at Cafe Galleria in an alpenglobe. This is just an awesome place. The kids beg to come here. Your stay also includes a $20 voucher to eat at Chick’s Cafe. We just have so much fun every time we stay here! 10/10. Will stay again."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great spot and I highly recommend for anyone staying in Heber City.

2023-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Second time staying! We love the location. Centrally located, super close to shopping, minutes from the Heber creeper. Super clean and comfortable!It can be loud on the main road but we didn’t mind at all! The water pressure can fluctuate due to the restaurant below, would recommend showering after closing time if possible. We’ll be back again!!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This place was perfect. Right on main street and close to restaurants and activities to keep everyone busy. Walking distance to a park for the kids.

My kids are already asking to stay here again next year! thank you!!"

2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I was in Heber for a workshop. This location was about 5 minutes from my event.
I wanted a restful private place that gave me some room, kitchen and comfortable bed.
I have no regrets. It was easy to park on the street right in front of the entrance most nights.
I would stay again. Hosts are very responsive."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We absolutely LOVED our stay here! Communication with the host was excellent, fast and easy! It was awesome being able to look out the windows and seeing the beautiful mountains! We really had a bonus, because the October 14th solar eclipse was clearly visible right outside the front window! Everything looked exactly like the pictures and the whole vibe of being above a cafe and so close to everything was the best! The water pressure was not a big deal, and would not deter us one bit from staying again! Just loved this place so much and thankful to the hosts for making our stay here an unforgettable one!"
2023-10-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Nice place with easy access. Checkout/cleanup was simple.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great cozy beautiful place
2023-09-01,5,Stayed over a week,"The Loft was great for what I needed as I was living and working in Heber. It is right downtown and walking distance to everything. It was clean, comfortable, modern, has a fully functional kitchen and is extremely well kept. Because it is right on the main street it can get a little noisy, so if you are looking for a peaceful retreat, you might want to head closer to the hills. If you want a wonderful, convenient, clean place to stay with extremely responsive and friendly hosts, look no further!!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,It was exactly what we needed.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"A great place to stay! On main street, so walkable access to shops and places to eat, but quiet at night. Close to the park and the Heber City train. Beautiful scenery n every direction. Super clean, comfortable beds, and perfectly stocked kitchen."

This was the perfect location and very thoughtful of the hosts. It was clean and organized neatly. The host was so helpful and responsive to any requests. We would definitely love to come here again!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Great stay! Very clean, comfortable, bright space. It was nice to have the washer/dryer, and breakfast at Chick’s was delicious!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Jace was more then helpful on multiple occasions! He was quick to respond, and never once was I a burden! My only recommendation is to have a designated parking spot for the Airbnb guests only because it does get quite busy behind the cafe. However even with that, we loved the loft and the cafe below was amazing! Having the meal voucher was a great added bonus and we will rent from them again if ever we get the chance to!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The loft was the highlight of our visit. It was a wonderful retreat during a stressful trip. Plenty of amenities, very clean and cozy. Conveniently located."

The entire unit was incredibly comfortable even though the weather was chilly! The beds and pillows allowed us to sleep well and the family room was stocked with blankets to curl up with while we watched movies on the flat-screen TV.
When we return to Heber City we will definitely be rebooking with Jace!"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Excellent location and excellent Airbnb. The Loft at Chick's Cafe is a great way to ski at Park City and enjoy real Utah away from the resorts. Enjoyed Back 40 Roadhouse, Melvin's Pub, El Guero, Chick's and the local Pioneer museum. Excellent hosts."

2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,It was a great place to stay! And only a 25 min drive to park city
2023-02-01,4,Stayed with kids,"Great little loft on the heart of Main Street in Heber. Close to many fun winter attractions. Space was clean overall and had nice amenities.
The queen beds are quite firm and I personally didn’t sleep great on them. Because the loft is over a restaurant, we did hear some noise in the middle of the night the second night we stayed there, with what we assumed some maintenance work on something on the roof. Other than that, it was more quiet than I thought it would be with it being right on the busy road. We enjoyed our stay and it was a new looking, fully furnished place for the price."
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Jace and Jordan were super nice hosts! We loved the place- nice, clean and excellent location with tons to do around. Park City and Deer Valley are only 25min away. My 14yr old son and I had a great time. Totally recommend staying at the chicks cafe Airbnb- the food at chicks cafe was amazing as well btw!"

2023-01-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Nice place. Small size beds
2023-01-01,5,Group trip,"This 2 bedroom loft was everything it said it was and way more. I booked it to go to Sundance, and it was the perfect place to stay. Easy to get to and far enough away to be out of the busy Park City, we had no problems getting in and out of town.
Jace and Jordan were very responsive, kind, and all around a dream to do work. Everything I'm coming to the Park City area, they will be my first pick if available!"
2023-01-01,5,Stayed about a week,Great place to stay near park city! Has everything you need and a awesome cafe downstairs. We had so much fun!
2023-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We enjoyed our recent stay at this 2 bedroom place above Chick’s Cafe. Located on Main Street going through Heber City, with several restaurants within walking distance. Safe area, some street noise. Parking available right behind the building.
Living space was clean and comfortable, able to sleep 4 to 6 people comfortably. Only downside was that there was only 1 bathroom, and the water pressure fluctuates throughout the day due to the restaurant below."
2023-01-01,5,Stayed about a week,Fantastic place and hosts!
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We would definitely stay here again. Parking can be an issue depending on the time of day. Could a spot be reserved for the loft?
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Amazing value! We love Heber City! This place was perfect for our family. Very easy to find, enter, etc. Open and light. We loved that it had a washer/ dryer, and thank you for the restaurant voucher!!! We will definitely stay again. Close to everything!"
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This is a great spot for a low key ski visit to Deer Valley. The DV Jordanelle base is less than 15 mins away and you can skip the Park City traffic. The cafe has a great breakfast and there is a good bar within walking distance. Everything was as described in the loft.
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Spacious place, well-outfitted with all supplies, comfy beds and very clean. You can hear some traffic in the living room, but the bedrooms are extremely quiet. Jace's place is a great find and value and a diner is conveniently located right downstairs. We would stay again!"
2022-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,So spacious! A great location for Heber with a quick 20 minute drive to Park City. SUPER clean! Would definitely stay again!
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Stayed here to do my scuba certification over in Midway 10-12 minute drive. Worked out perfectly for me.
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great property! Directly on top of chick’s cafe but you don’t hear the kitchen or diner AT ALL. Property has been renovated and is very modern. Place was spacious for us 3. Bed and sofa couches were very comfortable we felt right at home. There’s plenty of shopping and dining options nearby so you don’t have to worry about anything when you’re staying here! Hosts were great and responded to questions immediately! Thank you!!!
2022-11-01,5,Group trip,"Loved this stay! Such a cozy, clean place in a great location. Only 20 minutes from the mountain."
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Absolutely amazing! I had Thanksgiving with my daughter at the loft. We were so excited and when we walked in, we both got emotional at how it looked. I would absolutely stay there again."
2022-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,Great place overall. the road outside is very noisy especially at night. I highly recommend earplugs if you're a light sleeper 😉. This is totally out of the owner control. Otherwise a really great place to stay. would recommend.
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very amazing place to stay. It was warm and cozy!
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This was a really great place to stay at. It's in a perfect location to get anywhere in the area. Everything you need is within walking distance or a short drive. We would definitely stay here again.
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Perfect! Loved the location!! Loft is very spacious, clean, and accommodating... and CUTE! Thank you so much! We WILL be back!"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Loved this place! I have stayed in many vacation rentals and this is my new favorite. Great location in Heber, very short drive to Midway and Park City. Rental was clean, and well appointed. I will definitely try to rent this property again when I come back to Utah!"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,Great place! Super clean & perfect location.
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We almost don't want to rave about this place so the secret doesn't get out! Amazing space, clean and stocked with everything you could need. Having the washer and dryer is a plus so we got to travel home with clean clothes! This was our second time here and it was just a clean and comfortable!"
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great location! Clean and quiet. I plan to return to Heber and I would definitely return to this loft.
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great apartment with great location. Very clean and great food just below at the cafe!
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is a great place to stay: clean, well maintained and spacious. One of the best airbnbs we've stayed in."
2022-08-01,5,Stayed over a week,"The Loft at Chicks Café will be a great choice.
The location was wonderful. We chose Heber City out of the blue to spend the month of August. We were not disappointed with the Heber Valley OR the Airbnb we chose.
Very central to everything in Heber City/Midway/Park City/Provo.
We contacted Jace twice during the month and he responded w/ in an hour or two both times.
We plan on returning for a summer month next year.
We only gave it 5 stars because there aren’t more to give.
Ron & Lorraine"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay! Clean and comfortable! We highly recommend it.
2022-07-01,4,Stayed with kids,"Great location, great food downstairs. This was perfect for our young family."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beautifully, tastefully done. It was clean, which is super important. It also had everything we needed to be comfortable. It was spacious and very comfortable. We would love to come back. The water pressure is weird. Especially when showering but it wouldn’t stop me from coming again."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,Host and place were amazing.
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We had a nice time at the loft.
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"It was so cute, and cozy, we loved being so close to everything- and we will definitely be back! It was great!"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is such a perfect place to stay. We loved the location, the breakfast at Chicks Cafe, the convenience of a washer/dryer, kitchen, iron, books to read etc. After staying here, we would never choose a hotel when we come to Heber. The water pressure thing is such a small problem. It lasts for less than a minute and then comes back on."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Jordan was an amazing host, very easy to work with. The place was super cute, well stocked with everything we needed. Definitely recommend this place!"
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This place is beautiful and clean and has all the comforts of home. Very spacious and open. Love staying here.
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful, spacious, comfortable apartment conveniently situated in downtown Heber. Strong internet for working remotely, very stylish and cozy. Chick’s Cafe below the unit was a bonus! Loved it, would stay again!"
2022-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This place is absolutely stunning! It was perfect for our family of six, with kids ranging in age from 4 to 14. It is VERY clean. We personally loved the location. The kitchen is well stocked and there are plenty of towels and extra linens.
There were a couple of complaints from others reviews that I thought may have been potential issues, but they seem to have been addressed or resolved before we arrived. The first one was that people mention that it was very noisy because it’s on Main street. That may be the case but it was not a deterrent at all for our young family. There is a white noise machine that we used for our kids and everything was just fine. We really did not notice the street noise at all.
Also someone had mentioned that the stairway up to the unit is very dark. Actually, it is very well lit. There is a light switch at the bottom and then another one at the top inside the unit, so lighting was not an issue at all.
Jace and Jordan are great hosts!"
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We loved it so much last year, that we rented Jace's place again! Two bedrooms, a big living/dining kitchen area, a nice bathroom, and a laundry room! Plus, you get a $20 voucher to Chick's cafe downstairs for a good meal! It is SOOOO much better than staying in a hotel! It was just my son and I, but we could easily fit our family of five, and still not feel cramped! Clean, decorated perfectly, comfortable beds, and centrally located! We will be back!"
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Perfect location in downtown Heber City. Newly and nicely renovated space, it was cozy and comfortable for a weekend in the area! great café downstairs, would highly recommend this Airbnb to anyone!"
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Such a darling, chic place in a charming town, above a ‘from-scratch’ cafe… a setting perfect for a book!"
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Nice modern place. clean and well maintained.
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Was an amazing stay. The location is so awesome. But it’s the little things that make this one a gem. Don’t pass it up. It’s beautiful and charming. And the food at Chick’s Cafe is out of this world
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great stay and cute place! The iffy water pressure wasn't advertised, but it wasn't a huge deal for us."
2022-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,Great place to stay
2022-05-01,4,Stayed a few nights,This place is good. Good location and everything was good except the water pressure but other than that. Great place to stay for sure
2022-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Lovely apartment!
Such a fun place to visit!
Great accommodations!
Would stay here again!"
2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful and updated place with all the extras of home! We really enjoyed our stay, thanks again!"
2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This place is great! There is plenty of space and it is very clean. We really enjoyed our stay!
2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"A much needed staycation was made perfect by our stay in the loft. Perfectly situated in the middle of Main Street, our commute was always easy to and from. Even took a walk to explore Main Street.Everyone down in Chick’s Cafe is so nice and happy to offer suggestions to better your stay. Let’s not forget how delicious the food down there is!
We had a great time taking the Heber Valley Railroad to get a great view of Heber. Also went To Zipline Utah for a fun adventure. If your a foodie like me you’ll definitely enjoy all the local food joints nearby!"
2022-04-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Awesome place to be close to most everything in the valley. My daughter said it was what she thought New York would be like with being above a restaurant. An awesome experience and great place for a home base. The parking is a little tight and you have to be patient with the water pressure.
2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This space is fantastic. Well designed and welcoming. Lots of space and light. We felt very welcomed and cared for by the hosts. The food from Chick’s Cafe is excellent and worth checking out even if you don’t stay.
2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Place was nice, clean, and updated. Short drive to park city and other awesome attractions. Would definitely stay here again."
2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We enjoyed our stay at the Loft. Easy commute to Park City for a short ski trip. Jace and Jordan were accommodating to requests and always responded timely. Water pressure dipped occasionally (as expected and communicated by the hosts) but didn't bother us much. Great value!
2022-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"It was a nice place, large and clean. The restaurant downstairs was great for breakfast."
2022-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,About twenty minutes from park city. We enjoyed the location next to the park was great for our toddler to play.
2022-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The Loft above Chick’s is a hidden gem in Heber City. The loft was perfect for our weeklong ski vacation. The beds were super comfortable and we ate downstairs each morning before heading off to the mountains. We cannot wait to come back next year.
2022-01-01,5,Group trip,Everything was great!
2022-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,We had an excellent stay at the Loft for a ski trip to park city. We absolutely loved Heber City and our home base at the loft. Other reviews mention the road noise and trucks but frankly if you ask our three year old son the variety of trucks to spot on the road was a real asset. He spent hours in the window calling out what he saw. The apartment is very well furnished and laid out. The restaurant was nice enough to let us borrow a child’s seat when we needed it. We loved our stay and Heber City. It’s a quaint friendly town that you can tell booms with community and personality.
2022-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,Love love love this loft!
2022-01-01,5,Stayed about a week,Loved our stay! It was clean and in a great location for our ski trip at Park City!
2022-01-01,5,Group trip,"Really great stay. Perfect spot in town, super clean and bright with way more space than is viewable in the photos. Washer and dryer are a huge bonus."
2021-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Really lovely apartment in Heber—loved our time there! Would definitely stay again, such a nice spot for a getaway."
2021-12-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Great place, cozy, clean, comfortable. Good value for the money. Experienced the hot water problem with the dishwasher at the cafe below, but that's a known issue. If you plan to use the sofa in the main room to sleep - be aware that the sound insulation from the street is not good, you will be able to hear all the traffic. Other than that, we loved staying at the loft."
2021-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,Location was perfect for walking to stores and restaurants. Very spacious for our family which included a toddler.
2021-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Jace's apartment is just perfect! On the main street and above a cafe with delicious food, lots of thoughtful touches as well as laundry and very comfortable beds. The hosts are friendly, quick to respond, and it is clear they care about your experience there. Would love to stay again someday!"
2021-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,Best value and location in Heber City!
2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The Loft is a great place to stay. Very affordable and a great value.
2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Wonderful upstairs apartment! Very clean and well organized. Everything you could need ready and available.
2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The place was so cute and clean! They had everything you could think of in case you needed it! They were so responsive with questions we had! We are definitely renting it again and telling all of our friends and family about it!
2021-11-01,2,Stayed a few nights,"This is a lovely home if you are deaf you are literally on top of a freeway with trucks going by 24 seven the noise is overwhelming if you’d like to sleep this is not a good place to stay if you wanna come and enjoy a beautiful appointed noisy apartment this is for you I have been staying in Airbnb’s for many years I have never had someone not disclose how much noise is coming from the street.
Also a little issue with security is they literally leave the doors to the street hallway entrance to the unit unlocked I absolutely was locked out one late evening because a roofer decided to lock the door not acceptable.
I would’ve absolutely given this home five stars if they could pick up the unit and move it to somewhere where there’s zero noise or even a little bit of noise but not something overwhelming when you had to wear earplugs to hear yourself think good luck"
2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Couldn’t ask for a better place to stay! So friendly and accommodating
2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Super cute, spotless loft. Would definitely stay here again!"
2021-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,We loved this place. The two couch beds were a lifesaver for my two teenagers.
2021-10-01,4,Stayed with kids,"Nice place, nice location right next to all the restaurants you'd want to eat at in Heber! Really close to the Heber Train Station. Midway is only about seven minutes away and has a really great bakery there! There's also a park within walking distance of the cafe if you have little kids with you. This was the perfect place for us to stay for a little family vacation."
2021-10-01,5,Group trip,"Such a beautiful place to stay. It was so cozy, and a great place for a weekend getaway!"
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay in a cool town
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Spacious, clean, and great central location for all our explorations. Super quick response time for questions and recommendations! You won't be disappointed in a stay here!"
2021-09-01,3,Stayed a few nights,Loft is very nice. The noise from the traffic was more than we could stand! We almost left a night early just to get some quiet.
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My wife and I stayed for 3 nights. Great stay!! Perfect location for seeing the area!! We hiked a local state park and drove the incredibly scenic Mirror Lake Hwy and Guardsman Pass. Park City is 20-minute drive. The included meal voucher was perfect for a delicious and filling breakfast for 2 at Chick's Cafe. Melvin's is a short walk and was a friendly stop for a beer and appetizer. Heber Valley Brewing was a nice stop as well, less than a 15 minute walk up Main St. We can also recommend Bagel Den for breakfast. Back 40 Ranch House Grill had great food, service and views for our 31st wedding anniversary dinner.
About the host and space: the host was great and provided everything we needed for our stay. Communication was great. Check-in was easy (tip: if the stairway is dark on the way up to the loft, there is a light switch at the bottom of the stairs). We had a few questions after check-in, and Jordan responded almost immediately. There is plenty of free street parking or you can park around back. Plenty of K-Cups were provided for the coffee maker. The space is exactly as shown in the pictures, clean, comfy, and nicely renovated (note: there is no dishwasher, which didn't bother us).
Final notes: There are 19 steps from the street to the loft. That's OK with us but could be a consideration for others. The water pressure was a non-issue. The periods of low pressure last less than 30 seconds, but it's good to know about it in advance so no surprises. Also, Main Street is a 4-lane highway through town. You will hear it in the front living space, but not from the rear bedrooms."
2021-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Had such a great time here! We just live in the SLC valley, but wanted a quick weekend ""staycation"". This was a great option. Heber/Midway are cute little towns with lots to do.
Apartment is great - everything was clean and as described. Would definitely recommend!"
2021-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Such a cute, clean and bright space! Very affordable for me, and I loved the voucher for the cafe. Great location as a base for hiking and exploring."
2021-09-01,5,Group trip,This place was so great! Great pricing and lots of fun things to do in Heber and Park City. Very clean and cozy. We loved everything about it!
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Very spacious new construction with a great view of sunrise from the open kitchen and living room, and lots of thoughtful design details. Jordan was so accommodating to bring us a tea kettle so we could have our morning and afternoon teas. Would stay again!"
2021-09-01,5,Group trip,Great place and location. We’ll stay here again.
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great accomodations! Location in terms of things to do... Perfect. Location of the apartment was on a busy street. We didn't mind it but I could see it being a sticking point. The apartment is spacious, beautiful and has all the amenities you need. You're in walking distance of food stores, restaurants, etc. Parking is not a problem."
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,loved this place. so clean and well thought out. thanks!
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great stay
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very cute place! Location made us feel safe as well.
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The loft was a great stay in Heber! It was within walking distance to many great restaurants and shopping, and a quick drive to anywhere else in the area. The loft was spacious, clean and well-stocked. There was some mild construction going on around the building, but they did communicate that to us.
We had a great time! I would recommend this stay."
2021-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This is an awesome space, big, clean and in a great location."
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Loved staying at the Loft. It was very nice, super comfortable. Great location and we enjoyed eating at the Chick's Cafe. I have never had such a great breakfast."
2021-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,Cute and comfortable. Fun to be in walking distance to the park and restaurants in downtown Heber.
2021-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Great location, updated modern space. We loved being right in the center of town and close to everything. The place was really clean and well taken care of. The beds were very comfortable and all the amenities were updated. We did have crazy water pressure issues, a known issue because of the restaurant downstairs, which made for some interesting showers, but it was mostly funny. Overall, this was a great experience for us."
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great communication - easy check-in/checkout. They even let us know when the place was ready early. Chick's was so fun - we had dinner & breakfast there.
2021-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Great location for our vacation covering lots of locations in Heber, Park City, Deer Creek Reservoir, and Midway. Everything was close by, and there was lots of great food in the area, including the cafe downstairs that we stopped at twice.
The hosts are fabulous and very attentive to any needs. I'd definitely stay here again."
2021-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,Great place in a cute city. Lots of great hiking not too far from the area.
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This apartment was beautifully decorated and extremely comfortable. Very happy with the location and people were very friendly.

2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great host! Great place!
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay! Really clean and spacious loft right in the middle of town. The hosts were great and very responsive.
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had an amazing time staying here. The AirBnB was decorated beautifully, there was ample parking, the cafe downstairs was yummy and the staff was really friendly and helpful...I def recommend the chicken fried steak for dinner and the scone with breakfast."
2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place is amazing. It's so spacious and still so cozy. Perfect setting, everything within walking distance. Already booking for next year."
2021-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,Beautiful property. We have a young son who really enjoyed the open space to practice his weakling l walking. :)
2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This loft was so beautiful and comfortable. The bed provided a great night sleep. The place was very room and so greatly decorated. I wish i would have stayed here for my whole time in Utah. It was so convenient to the Heber Railroad, and the Homestead Crater. Definitely gets my 5 stars!"
2021-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,Thank you for the fun weekend. Your place is great location and was so much fun for my family to visit. Thanks for the voucher it made a great breakfast!
2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"If you have read the reviews, we have established that the water pressure going in and out is annoying. That being said, I would stay here over and over again. Darling décor, very clean, has everything you need, and it's the perfect size! The meal voucher that comes with your stay is the best ""hotel breakfast"" you'll find! My son and I stayed here for our final three nights, of our ten day golf tournament trip, and it was the perfect place to end! It is SO much better than staying at a hotel. Although the Loft sits on the busiest streets in Heber, the bedrooms are at the back of the loft, and my son and I both slept fine and the road noise wasn't an issue at all! The hosts were great, friendly, and communicated well before, during, and after our stay."
2021-06-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay!
2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"If you’re looking for a clean and comfortable place, interesting setting above a nice cafe, and a great location in town, all at a reasonable price, look no further. We will be back!"
2021-05-01,5,Stayed about a week,Don't be spooked by the noise from Main St. The bedrooms are in the back and it's a non issue. The loft is extremely comfortable and inviting. Such a great location! We walked a lot of places. Highly recommend the loft!
2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We had such a great time at the loft! Such a nice central location and a beautiful space.
2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"very new, and easy process!"
2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The Loft was perfect for my wife and I for our quick trip to Utah for a wedding in Midway. Check-in was as easy as it gets and Jordan communicated well and was very responsive. The place was very clean and comfortable. We wanted something that didn’t feel like a hotel and this place fits that perfectly. As many have mentioned, the sound from the traffic on Main Street was noticeable, but really dies down after 11pm or so. We both had to laugh as we tried to take showers mid-day to get ready for the wedding. Unfortunately, we timed it perfectly with the Cafe running their dishwasher which literally took all the water pressure away from the shower. There are several signs warning us this could happen so we were not surprised. Chick’s Cafe breakfast was very good. Thanks for providing the great space. If we are ever back in the area, we will stay there again."
2021-05-01,5,Group trip,"Absolutely loved staying here! While it faces Main Street, the bedrooms are in the back and it’s very quiet. The bed and linens are SO COMFORTABLE . Really enjoyed my stay here!!"
2021-05-01,5,Group trip,This place is great and the hosts are responsive and friendly. One of my best Airbnb experiences.
2021-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Wonderful experience! The checkin was seamless and our stay went well. Very happy with our stay.
2021-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very nice place.
2021-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What an awesome experience! We loved the location, how clean it was, and communicating with Jace. We'll absolutely be staying again soon."
2021-04-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"We stayed in the loft checking in on a Saturday and checking out on a Tuesday. Check in instructions were easy to follow. I was worried with this being right above the cafe that it might smell like a fryer/ the restaurant below. It does smell like the restaurant in the hallway leading up to the loft and a bit inside the loft. The smell, while noticeable, wasn't terrible to begin with but if it's too much for you they also have one of the wax warmers in the loft to combat the smell. In our 4 day stay we only used it twice. The location right on main street is easy to get to, and central to other activities. Parking was rarely an issue. However, the loft is on mainstreet and it sounds like it's right on main street. You can hear the traffic from the street and them setting up in the morning at the restaurant throughout the loft so if noise is an issue for you when you sleep you would want to bring ear plugs. They have a nice TV in the loft which we were able to hook our Xbox to. I think the TV is a smart TV that comes equipped with the streaming apps that you can log into. They have a washer and dryer in the loft and also provider detergent. We brought our own shampoo and conditioner because I have very long thick hair and the tiny bottles aren't enough for me. However, they had full sized bottles of shampoo and conditioner so you can save the space in your luggage. They have hangars in the closet so you can take your close out of your bag and air them out. They also have a guide to Heber city which was super helpful! Overall we enjoyed our stay and the meal voucher was a nice plus and a great way to finish out our trip. The $20 voucher is given to you at the beginning and can be used anytime during your stay. We just chose to use it as our last hurrah and it provided for an excellent breakfast."
2021-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This place i would give 5 stars on everything. It's in a historic building downtown but newly renovated upstairs loft. Perfect location in the central business district downtown. You can pretty much walk to any place in town. Perfect neighborhoods to walk in and close to the park. You can't go wrong with this place. Highly recommended !
2021-04-01,5,Stayed over a week,We stayed for 4 weeks and the loft was a perfect place to stay so that we could ski at four different mountains. The loft gets great light and there are great views of the mountains once you're on Main St. Multiple restaurants to choose from within walking distance. We ate at Chick's Cafe each week. In-unit laundry was so convenient. The loft was beautifully renovated and feels very comfortable. Jordan was so quick and easy to communicate with. He bought an iron and ironing board for the loft when I asked if I could borrow one from him. We loved our time at the loft and would happily stay here again.
2021-03-01,5,Stayed over a week,"I stayed here for a month and would definitely go back. The space was really large and well designed/laid out. The ceilings are pretty high and there were a lot of windows so it was bright and airy. Internet speed was great. It was on a main road, but I never had a problem with noise - the bedrooms are all in the back and it was extremely quiet. The location was good too - lots of hiking trails around and a short drive to park city and deer valley. I also went to snowbird, Alta and solitude while there and none were that far away. If you go to deer valley there is a gondola about ten minutes down the road which takes you over the hill and onto the mountain. Very friendly and helpful hosts too."
2021-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Got my parents a trip to this loft for Christmas and they absolutely loved it! They said it’s newly remodeled, beautiful and clean. It was the perfect relaxing weekend in an adorable part of town.
Jace was so easy and helpful to work with. Can’t recommend enough"
2021-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The loft was perfect. Super clean, updated space. Parking was easy. Everything just simply worked as it should. We had a classic comfort food dinner downstairs at Chick’s. Great little spot to crash at on a ski trip."
2021-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We loved our stay above Chicks Cafe! Very central to many food spots and activities in Heber. The place was clean, on trend, and very comfortable. Full kitchen, washer and dryer, and comfortable rooms with plenty of extra blankets and towels. We will definitely visit again!"
2021-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,Excellent host. Their place provide all a family needs traveling with kiddos. Thank you for your accommodations and quick response to any questions. We look forward to book in your place in our next Utah trip. Highly recommend!!!
2021-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Beautiful apartment, comfortable beds, prefect stay."
2021-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great large space! We were only 2 but 6-8 could easily fit. Enjoyed awesome Milkshakes from Chick's Cafe and a large kitchen!
2021-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,Great location. Chicks cafe was an amazing place to eat!
2021-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The rooms were very clean, comfortable, and spacious. The kitchen was well stocked (with equipment) so we could cook for ourselves. Loved the interior design and stone countertops. The diner downstairs was also convenient and had a fun ambiance. Loved having a washer and dryer. Very charming!"
2021-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,Very clean and as advertised. Close to Soldier Hollow. Jace was very responsive and check in was clear and easy. Some quirks - at times water pressure so low that you had to wait to wash your hands and kitchen a bit sparsely equipped if you do a lot of cooking. Overall we loved our weekend and would rent again.
2021-01-01,4,Stayed with kids,Great location and cool apartment. Good diner food at Chicks! Owner very responsive.
2020-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The place was extremely clean, parking was easy, and great access to the ski areas. Only a 20 minute drive to Park City and 10 minutes from the Deer Valley gondola. There are plenty of restaurants, bars, and a grocery store within walking distance. The only negative comments I have is the apartment is located on a busy road with a lot of road noise so any guests sleeping on the pullout sofas may have a hard time sleeping with the noise. The bedrooms are on the backside so road noise isn't an issue. Also there are some water pressure issues in the shower from the Cafe below but it's manageable. Overall, I would definitely recommend this loft apartment."
2020-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,Cute place above the cafe. It was nice having 2 separate rooms and the 2 couch beds. There was 6 of us and we had plenty of room. It’s right on the Main Street in Heber making it convenient. We were able to make meals with the kitchen and even went down to the cafe. Great hosts to work with by responding quickly.
2020-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,This is a beautifully updated place that has a lot of history behind it. It was a lot of fun to stay here.
