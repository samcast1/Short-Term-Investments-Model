2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Bethany’s place was amazing! Extremely clean, and perfectly matched the described listing on airbnb. Host is also very communicative and responds timely. For the price you’re paying, it’s definitely worth the stay!"
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Recommended!!! We had a late night check in, and Bethany proactively communicated with us & made sure we have a smooth self check-in process. The place is very clean, well equipped & has everything we need for a one night stay."

2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This place is lovely. Clean, all kinds of extras, spacious. It is a remarkable bargain. We loved it."
2023-11-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"Great stay for crashing after a long day. This is a room below a residence with children above so it can get a little noisy when quiet hours expire, it was peaceful during quiet hours. Bethany provided everything we could have needed which was very nice. Such as k-cups, shampoo/condition and body wash. Not a lot is required for checkout which helps get you moving on with your day. If you are traveling with someone that is more handicap the couch is not friendly to them but is great for a family as it can be used for an extra space for someone to crash!"

When we went to book the next night it was booked sadly. We would definitely stay here again. Thank you, Bethany, for hosting!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We had a fantastic stay. There is a driveway that enables you to park directly in front of the unit. You have a private entrance and the unit feels very private. The space is clean and the bathroom is nice. There are two queen beds both of which have super comfortable mattresses. There is a refrigerator and many other amenities. The room was also very cool. We just stayed one night passing through but I wouldn't hesitate to book for a longer stay. Really, it doesn't get much better than this for the price. We were completely satisfied and highly recommend this option. Just book it!"

Bethany was accommodating given our request was last minute due to a family emergency. She was responsive and helpful. There are plenty of restaurants close by and close to 1-15 freeway. I highly recommend Bethany's place if you are visiting Cedar City.
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"It was more beautiful than the pictures! Bethany went above and beyond! Love the personal touch, leaving a personalized welcome note! It had everything we wanted. We only needed to stay one night, but we would comfortably stay longer! Worth the price!"

2024-02-01,2.0,Stayed a few nights,I’ve stayed on both places before and have always had a great experience. This time was different. The stairs were very icy and it was dangerous getting to and from door. The heaters would not work and the place was terribly cold. Despite this Rick was responsive and returned the money.
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Ricks place was perfect for me, walking distance to SUU, downtown and grocery store. He was very responsive to any questions I had and the place was perfect for me. Clean, well laid out and even had washer and dryer."
2024-01-01,4.0,Stayed about a week,Apartment met our needs quite well. Neighborhood is quiet but older and not too appealing visually. Apartment is quiet-- except when the garage door below operates. Outside stairway is rather steep.

2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Had a wonderful week visiting Cedar City. Saw 7 plays at the Shakespeare Festival. Although we would have liked to walk to the venue, 3 blocks was 3 LONG blocks. We have aged since we began coming to the Festival 20 years ago. 😊"

2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Everything was perfect!
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,My wife and I were at the final stay on a long road trip and had an evening booked for a play at the Shakespeare festival in Cedar City and found Rick’s place the perfect spot to stay. Clean and quiet and close to the theater. Check in involved a key pad with a code that was a little difficult to enter which might be partially attributed to my 75 years advanced age but patience paid off and we found ourselves in a very comfortable environment for a few days. We are both retired actors and were impressed with the show we saw at the festival and a day exploring the Cedar Breaks National Monument provided good hikes and spectacular views. The bed and the air conditioning system were much appreciated during our stay!
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Everything went smooth. Very clean and nicely furnished. Rick was responsive and helpful. Great location.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Rick’s place is a cozy, quiet, comfortable place for two. It’s walkable to the Shakespeare Festival and anything you need in Cedar City is less than five minutes away by car. The off the street private parking is a real plus. Rick’s communication is excellent. Great host!"
2023-07-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is our second time staying here, last time was probably 4 years ago. Great location to Historic Cedar City and approx. 15 minute walk to Shakespeare festival, which we did two evenings. There are very steep wood stairs to apartment and light was not working so we used phone light and did notify Rick. It was fine but would have been dangerous had we arrived in dark and hauling suitcase up the stairs. Rick responded quickly and I am sure having checked. There are two air conditioners in unit which kept the place very comfortable. The bed has a very soft pillow top, I personally prefer a more firm mattress. Also a very great location to driving to Cedar Breaks and hiking."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We always enjoy staying at Rick's place when we attend the Utah Shakespeare Festival. Everything is within walking distance. We also found some new excellent restaurants.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Had a great stay at this cute little place in Cedar City. Well-appointed, cute decor, and fabulous location (I was there for a funeral which ended upping just 5 min. away, and it was also within walking distance of all the Shakespeare Festival happenings.) Bed was comfy and everything was very clean. The only problem was that the first night there was a very noisy dog barking in the backyard of front house (on the premises) until 2 am. I messaged Rick and he was great, he spoke with the property manager and I did not hear the dog again. My second night's sleep was much better. I appreciated his prompt attention and realize this was something out of his control.
I would stay here again."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,A lovely stay right in the center of town.
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was a great place to stay. We were visiting our daughters in town, and we even got to see one of them perform in her first USF play! Staying here made that experience even better. The accommodations were clean and comfortable–– more so than any other motel I've stayed in in Cedar City. The price was reasonable, the neighborhood quiet, well kept, and in a great location. We will be staying in this place again the next time we visit Cedar."

It's near Historic Main Street, with fun shops and eateries. The apartment is decorated so nicely. The kitchen is fully stocked. We used the blender to make smoothies in the mornings. The bed is so comfy.The neighborhood is very quiet. We very easily could have slept in but with all the beautiful mountains and National Parks near Cedar City we were up and going every day. Rick was great at communicating. His place was easy to find and parking is right next to the unit. If you are planning on visiting Cedar City, Utah and surrounding areas check out Rick's place out. We plan on visiting again in the Fall."

2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We had a wonderful stay. The most important thing for me is that a place is clean. This place was very clean and had everything we needed for a great stay in the area. My husband especially loved the recliner after a day on the trails!

2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was an amazing place to stay! I loved cedar city, everything was very close and convenient. The place was very clean and easy to access.

2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Rick's place was amazing. It is in a quiet neighborhood and you get your own private parking spot right next to the door. You are in the middle of town too so there are plenty of places to eat at that are within walking distance.
2022-04-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"The space is very nice and actually bigger than I anticipated based on the photos. All of the amenities I expected were there with plenty of room to cook, relax, and enjoy an evening after being out hiking. Rick was very quick with his responses and made the check-in process smooth and seamless. The only thing, in my opinion, that could be improved was the bed, which I think just needs a thicker topper."
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Rick’s place was impeccably clean and beautiful inside! The kitchen counters and the shower were fabulous. Stayed here for 3 nights when hiking in Zion and Bryce. East check in/out procedures and Rick was available via text and responds quickly. The kitchen was well furnished with dishes, cookware, spices and coffee! The only minor thing was that the mattress was not very comfortable at all and the sofa was very dated. But that didn’t stop us from thinking this was a great place to stay!"
2022-04-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Location was a 10 min walk to town, where there are great local shops and restaurants to eat. Also around an hour drive to Zion which was a big plus. Accommodation had everything that I needed. The beds were comfortable. I would definitely stay here again in the future."
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"The location was convenient to downtown Cedar City for groceries, the post office, and all that one needs for a lengthy stay. The place was large enough for two people, and the separate bedroom/layout was nice. The kitchen suited our needs well. The neighborhood was pleasant."
2022-02-01,3.0,Stayed over a week,"Things may or may not be broken when you arrive. Rick is responsive in getting someone over to start/continue repairs. I kind of gave up after finding random corners cracked, fire alarms missing from kitchen, A/C filter that have never been cleaned, etc. It is a space to put your stuff in, sleep and shower. If you have asthma or allergies. Bring your inhaler and some pray. And clean before you do anything else!
The dogs at the front house start barking at 7:30 AM and do not stop until about 10:30 PM. Rain sleet or snow their owners just keep them outside. Saw 1 of the women try to beat the pitbull with a belt. If you can’t train your dog to be inside in sub-20 degree weather then don’t get a dog! The other neighbors seem somewhat normal."

2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I was looking for a quiet place for a short stay-cation. Rick's place was the perfect choice. The apartment is clean, comfortable and tasteful yet simple in decor. Very quiet, good view of the Cedar mountains, nice bed and well stocked with all the essentials. The convenience of the location and parking (at the entrance stairs) are a big plus. Rick was super quick to respond. Definitely at the top of my list for future getaways."

2021-12-01,3.0,Stayed over a week,"The house is wonderful and the host is very responsive! All of the checkout requirements/expectations aren't clearly listed. This has been a bit confusing since he expects more from his guests than other hosts I've stayed with. He's great to talk to though, so just keep open communication and it's the best!"
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Great spot.
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"This is a great space - private, clean, and well-equipped. Good, centralized location just about an hour from Zion NP. Rick is communicative and quick to respond as questions arise. Recommended if you are looking to stay in the area."
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Rick’s place is located in a wonderful spot for those wishing to explore major area sites such as Bryce Canyon, Zion, and Cedar Breaks. It’s also just a minute or two from local shopping, dining, and other services. One could even walk to many. The apartment is spacious, comfortable, and is well-equipped for anyone wanting to cook their own meals, pack light—given the benefit of laundry machines—or research things to do in the area by way of provided literature. Most importantly for me, as someone traveling alone, I felt safe there, as well as coming and going at all hours.
Thanks to Rick for his kindness, communication, and care."

2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The perfect place for a couple on a quick weekend getaway! My husband and I were just in town for a couple days to see some friends at the Shakespeare Festival, and we managed a day at Zion as well. Very clean and nicely updated space with a well appointed kitchen, living area, and separate bedroom. Super close to the festival/downtown area. We weren’t there long enough to use the laundry, but always nice to have that in a space! Only very minor complaint is that the bed is situated between two doorways such that there isn’t space for a night stand on either side. Like I said, very minor, but I’m rather attached to having my phone, charger, and some water by my bed. Overall a beautiful, perfectly sized, and very well located place!"
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Comfortable, clean upstairs garage apartment in a good location, within walking distance to the Shakespeare Festival."

2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We loved the place. The kitchen was well stocked with dishes, flatware, condiments, filled ice trays in refrigerator. Loved the layout particularly the bathroom with entrance from both the living area and the bedroom. We even had soap and shampoo provided in the bathroom.
if and when we called Rick he responded right away.
We were in Cedar City for the Shakespeare Festival and hope to return in future summers as the Festival was a great experience and are planning on continuing to use Rick's place. It was very much as advertised."

2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The location is excellent. We went to Zion, Bryce Canyon, and Red Canyon, and it worked great for all. Rick is helpful and communicative.

Everything else about the place was great!"

2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place was pretty perfect. The location was great with dining, groceries, fuel, and outdoor amusements all close by. We got to play on some nearby mountain bike trails which were tons of fun and less than 5 minutes from the door. The place itself is way bigger than we were expecting. It isn't huge enough for more people but two people could hunt for one another for a minute with the walkthrough bathroom. Really no complaints."
2021-05-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Good location in pretty dense downtown neighborhood. We appreciated the off-street parking.
One morning we were awakened at 6 am by a neighbor’s very loud TV?radio? This was not our best day.
Bed is okay not great.
Sofa bed worked well for our son once we found the sheets"

2021-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"By far one of my favorite air bnbs the past couple of years. We appreciated the small touches in this apartment and appreciated the cleanliness and hospitality The location was close to family in Enoch, and close to main street and downtown where we enjoyed eating some Thai food and walked down to a small wine tasting room. We drove to Zion which only took about 45 mins. and also drove to Cedar Breaks National Monument which was about 30 mins. away. The location was perfect! We also enjoyed the Keurig for quick coffee before our drives to Zion that week. We will definitely stay here again!"

2021-03-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"Good stay especially for the price!!
There was no dish washer. Place could’ve used new dish soap and sponge. Minor hiccups with heating and wifi (was super slow one day), but host was very communicative and resolved the issue immediately. The TV was super small so did not use. The place seems clean but on further inspection could be cleaner.
Place was more than enough for two. Kitchen had all dishes and utensils that we needed along with spices for cooking."
2021-02-01,4.0,Stayed over a week,"For stays over 30 days, host requests you to bring your own linens or will charge a weekly cleaning fee of $40. If near 30 days, host requests you wash the linens weekly. I was happy to do so, but guests might want to know since it's not in the listing.
Wifi wasn’t great for video calls, but okay for streaming and everything else. Overall the place was recently renovated with a convenient washer and dryer. Kitchen has plenty of dishes, seasonings, and things to cook with, however, the soap was watered down so I bought my own. Great location."
2021-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Would highly recommend this for any stay in cedar city! Great location and close to any shop or restaurant in town. The space itself was very clean and felt like a home. Any trips I take up to Cedar City I will definitely be staying here!

Part of the reason we chose this place was because of its proximity to Zion, among other parks which we had to drive a few hours for, but the landscape is gorgeous so we didn’t mind.

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Such a hidden gem, especially if you plan on heading out to Zion for the park. One of the best Air BnB visits I have ever had. It is a bit far from Zion, but for the amenities, cleanliness, comfort, and responsiveness I found it to be worth it. It is clean, modern, and cozy. The hot tub is a huge plus after a long day of hiking! Will definitely be staying here again for my next trip near Zion."
2024-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The place was exactly as described, I really liked the hot tub area and yard. Main reason I got this Airbnb. Loved the lighting and the interior was very clean and crisp"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Kade’s place was beautiful. We spent the first 15 min walking around and admiring it. The attention to detail was perhaps I’ve ever seen in an air bnb. The private hot tub was 10/10, exactly what was advertised and even better. The spot had everything you needed to show up and feel at home. We became comfortable immediately. We plan to stay here again in the future since we had such a good time. Definitely recommend."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,One of the best places I have ever stayed! Everything was prepared perfectly for our comfortable overnight stay. I wish we had more time to try the jacuzzi.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Why would you ever want to stay in a hotel if Kade's place is available? So clean and many thoughtful little touches like the generous snacks and chilled bottled water, some pet basics and extras like a sewing kit, basic first aid/pain relievers, and more hygiene items than any hotel I've ever been so you have as many comforts as possible. You can tell they've put a ton of effort into thinking of little things to make each traveler's stay the best it can be. We only stayed for a night but this would be a wonderful place to land for a week or more. The hot tub is amazing and private (there are even robes!) Yes, we could hear the family move about above us but it was never loud and was silent between 10:30 p.m. and 7:00 a.m. and was less than typical for noise you'd hear in a hotel if the room above was occupied. Exceptional property!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Just as the other reviews, gret place to stay! Absolutely spotless and easy to get to, just off freeway. Didn't get a chance to use the hot tub but it gives me a reason to comeback!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great place to stay! Thanks for the hospitality
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place is as described. Very clean and spacious. The snacks, water bottles and hot tub after hiking were a plus! If you like to sleep in a pitch dark room and no noise bring your eye mask and ear plugs. The bed is comfy.
FYI this place is around 1 hr 10 mins away from Zion Visitor Center."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Beautiful place. Would love to come back
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay! Everything was easy and simple! Would stay again!
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This home was extremely cozy, the host thought about everything for our needs even had some snacks. There was an area for our dog to play while we soaked in the jacuzzi. We will definitely be staying here again if we drive through.
%100 satisfied"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"It was amazing! One of the best irbnb's which we ever had) And cherry on the cake was hot tub, after 5 hours hike in Zion, it was the best. Everything was new, clean and cozy. Comfortable bed and fully equipped kitchen. A lot of details were covered, snacks, first aid kit, pills and etc.
We really like it and recommend to everyone)Believe me, you won't regret it)))"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"I have been to a lot of airbnbs and this was one of my favorites so far. The host went above and beyond to make it feel like home. The hot tub is a plus and fun , fully stocked kitchen and bathroom. Clear instructions to help assist and provide recommendations. Our family and dog just loved it! It is a lot closer to town than it seems with some great restaurants which were recommended by the host. There was nothing missing for me. I wish all airbnb hosts can follow their lead."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Charming space to relax between national park trips. Little snacks were available, toothpaste, toothbrush, etc. Felt all we needed were our clothes, which was such an inviting feeling at the end of a long day. Would definitely stay here again when in the area."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This was a great place to stay! The instructions for checkin were very clear and we had no trouble getting in. The apartment was clean and beautiful, and they thought of things to provide that just made the place feel like home. There were even a few things to eat in the pantry, which was amazing, as we checked in late and didn’t bring much food in with us. It was a beautiful space and I would definitely stay there again."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"The basement apartment was spotless and full of amenities—snacks in the pantry, toiletries, etc. The layout was really nice and comfortable, and we loved a lot of the special touches like the ‘where are you from’ wall decoration, gym equipment, and the robes for the hot tub. We would stay here again for sure."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The place is amazing!!!!!! Extremely elegant, everything you need for your stay!!

The Airbnb has everything we needed.
10/10 overall."
2024-03-01,5.0,Group trip,"Had a wonderful stay at Kade’s place. We were visiting our brother at SUU, and this was only a 12 minute drive from the campus. The hot tub was probably our favorite part! The apartment was clean and had plenty of amenities. It didn’t bother us, but it’s worth noting you can hear the family above running around. If you’re looking for a really quiet place, this might not be it. Again, it didn’t bother us at all, and they mention the noise in the description! Overall, a very pleasant stay :)"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,This is a great stay! We used this fabulous apartment as home base as we adventured in the National Parks and Las Vegas. Kade and his hospitality team had so many home-like supplies available and made our stay so comfortable. We recommend this place to couples and small families and will definitely stay again next time we’re in the area. The private hot tub was always available and icing on the cake!
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This apartment was so beautiful! One of the best places I’ve stayed through airbnb. Very clean and beautifully decorated. The hot tub was wonderful after a long day. Thank you so much for sharing your place!

We loved the hot tub and the gated back yard was private but easily accessible for check in. Definitely would stay here again if we’re ever down this way!"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Absolutely amazing stay! Every detail was so thoughtful from the usb outlets next to the bed to the shower soap dispensers. Comfortable mattress and TV in the bedroom. Very easy to get to off the highway.
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This was the best air bnb I have ever stayed at.

I would definitely stay here again and recommend it to anyone."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This is by far the best Airbnb I have ever stayed at. The host was extremely helpful, even when I got lost. The house was wonderful. I loved the separate entrance, the whole house was filled with updated furniture, and signs with all the instructions, including recommendations. She had snacks in the cupboard and literally took care of everything.
Very very impressed with this place, the host responded to me immediately. I would definitely recommend this place and stay there again."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,One of the best Airbnbs I’ve stayed at! Felt right at home and the hot tub was the cherry on top. Excellent!
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Look no further folks, this is your air bnb! There is not one thing that Kade and co-hosts didn't think about - a lovely hot tub, functional home gym, delicious snacks, incredible privacy (considering it is a basement suite), pet friendly amenities, all laundry essentials and so, so much more. This is an amazing little spot. It's located a quick drive from the national parks and it is close to a corner store for any quick needs that pop up. The hosts were responsive, helpful, and reasonable. My partner and I had an amazing time! Not to mention, it was also very reasonably priced for the value they provided. A+++++"
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"This place was just like the pictures. Very clean and spacious. It was very comfortable and felt at home. It has a yard outside next to the hot tub for pets. The place is downstairs with a private entry. We did hear footsteps or running upstairs but it was clearly stated beforehand and wasn’t an issue for us as it was once in a while and not too late. It has a heater in the living room and a small one in the room which made it real nice and cozy.
Overall great experience and easy to check in and check out. Would definitely stay here again if I have the opportunity."

We texted Kade for instructions and with in a few minutes we received a response .All the amenities were as mentioned in the description and exceeded our expectations!

2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This was the cutest and cleanest Airbnb! The private hot tub was so relaxing after a long day of hiking in national parks! Would definitely stay here again!

2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Enjoyed a wonderful stay at this new Airbnb. Although the address wasn't on Apple Maps, the host provided a pin for easy navigation. The hot tub was a delightful touch, operational from 730am-1030pm. This separate guest area from the home had new appliances, a comfortable bed, and TVs with Netflix ready for use. The bathroom was amazing, toothbrush’s and paste were both provided and hotel style towels. Only minor noise from footsteps upstairs in the morning and evening, but overall, a great experience"
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Was a fantastic place and very clean! Also host was very responsive!
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"The perfect stay for a couple of travelers and a corgi. Clean, spacious, comfortable, warm, and exactly as described. Private, safe yard for our pup was a nice bonus. Nicely located in a quiet neighborhood and not too far from the interstate."
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"This airbnb was great. It was beautiful and clean, and had a lot of space. I really appreciated the fenced yard and private entrance. Would definitely recommend staying here."
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We loved Kade's place. We used it as we were traveling up to Brianhead to ski and it was a perfect place to rest the night before. The unit and entrance were private and easy to find and check in. The place was very well maintained and decorated. The amenities were great and they had thought of everything that you could possibly want/need. The hot tub was awesome. It was turned on, warm and ready to use. The bed was comfortable and the place was squeaky clean. We did hear footsteps overhead a couple of times but it was hardly noticeable and never disturbed us. We really enjoyed our stay here and would definitely stay again. We did make an extra loop around the neighborhood before we found it because our apple maps didn't locate it exactly right (the owner even sent us a link with a pin, so it was probably more our mistake) but it was still easy to find. Highly Recommend."
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,This is a great space! So much room and everything you could need for one or two people. Highly recommend for anyone looking for a stay in the area.
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"It would be difficult to overstate how fantastic ""The Grand Ranch"" is. Everything from the space itself to the animals to the little extra details that are thrown in to add to your experience--just fantastic. We've stayed in a lot of airbnbs over the years, and this is easily the best experience we've ever had.
If you're going to be in the area, don't hesitate to stay here. Honestly, adjust your plans to stay here. Just magical."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Don’t even think about it, just book it!! My husband and I spent the first leg of our honeymoon at The Grand Ranch and it was absolutely incredible. What a beautiful ranch with the sweetest animals and friendliest hosts! It was so peaceful there, just what we needed to relax after our wedding. We were so sad to leave! We can’t wait to come back one day!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The best air bnb we have ever stayed in! The atmosphere was beautiful. Waking up to great views of the mountains and cows! Brandon and Hollie were so friendly along with their farm animals. We even got to see the one hour old baby highland cow. Their air bnb was definitely a highlight of our vacation.
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Wow… just wow. This place was the absolute best place we have stayed in ever. The attention to detail was incredible! We only stayed for 2 nights but will 100% be back. The area in general is great but in reality, you don’t even have to leave this little sanctuary. It is so peaceful. Freshly baked bread with a hand written card upon arrival, the cleanliness and “at home feel” the hot tub, the animals. Everything was absolutely perfect. Thanks so much for thinking of absolutely everything!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Lovely stay at the grand ranch! Had so much fun playing with the animals. Was so peaceful on the ranch. Views were absolutely amazing!! Hosts were great, so responsive and helpful!! Hope to return again some day"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Farmhouse #3 was perfect. Cozy and comfortable inside, with an amazing deck (complete with hot tub and access to a sweet cow and her calf!). And the location is great--close to Kolob Canyon and Kanarra Falls, an easy drive to Zion Canyon, and right outside of Cedar City for dinners.
To top it all off, Brandon was a gracious and thoughtful host. He and his family welcomed us to the farm, introduced us to the animals, and gave us great local recommendations."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,If you’re looking for a really cool and fun place to stay with great hosts and a super clean and cozy spot then this is it. Nothing about this place made me disappointed and wish we never had to leave!
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My husband and I loved The Grand Ranch. Brandon and his family , the hosts, were very friendly and made sure we had everything we needed. The Ranch was pristine! At night, lights light up the Ranch for an amazing experience. The animals were adorable and friendly! Amazing view of the mountains. Our favorite Airbnb to date!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"I cant reccomend this ranch enough. I wish we'd planned another night to stay! The area is absolutely gorgeous, and waking up to the sunrise over the mountains, with HUGE windows was unreal.
Not only are there the adorable cows, but the central area has goats, sheep, pigs, chickens and more that are all super friendly and fun for us all to interact with.
Brandon & Family are actively taking care of the animals on site are super friendly, and awesome to have a conversation with!
It felt very private, while having an unobscured landscape view, and an area to be social right next to you.
Would love to bring our kid back again when shes old enough to remember!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"A truly magical place. Wish we would have stayed two nights but we had to keep truckin along to our final destination.
The price is definitely worth every penny. We were greeted with delicious fresh baked bread that his wife makes every morning (ice cream in the summer) and the tiny house is cozy and warm, just perfect for two.
The animals were the star of the show! From the cows, Taffy and Pippi outside your front door, to the alpaca just over the fence, the adorable baby lambs and the goats! I could not get enough of the goats. All the animals are friendly and very safe to pet.
I cannot say enough good things about this place and the family that keeps it together. They truly have something special and you can feel the love and hard work they’ve put into it. How lucky to have such a beautiful property, we are envious for sure haha"
2024-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,this place was absolutely stunning! it was everything i pictured it to be and more! brandon was super helpful and very responsive.
2024-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We spent an unforgettable night here and look forward to returning again in the future to see the Brandon family and a more diverse farm experience.
Here, we see newly born goats and sheep, and the goats play on our backs together. What kind of life is immerse ourselves in a quiet, clean, and natural environment here. There is a feeling of home here, returning from the hustle and bustle of the city to nature and tranquility.
I wish this family all the best in the future and look forward to seeing you again!"
2024-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"AMAZING. I can’t recommend this place enough! We had so much fun interacting with the animals! We would make laps multiple times a day to say hi and pet all the sweet animals! The donkeys are huge love bugs!
Very peaceful and beautiful surroundings. We enjoyed the hot tub immensely.
The hosts are so kind and were always down for a chat! They made our stay incredibly easy, relaxing and fun!
We’ve already decided we’ll be coming back!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Wow! 5 stars all the way! What an amazing place. The scenery was breathtaking, the animals were precious and Brandon was so kind to greet us when we pulled in.

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We only stayed one night, it was like feeling at home, the cows outside the apartment (Belle and Bean) were very sweet, we absolutely recommend the stay,!!! if we didn't live in Italy we would come often 😍"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Wow! This place is the best! The setting is beautiful and the accommodations were perfect. My husband and I stayed in #3, the treehouse. We had a friendly greeting from Brandon when we arrived. The bed was so comfortable and there was homemade bread from Hollie on the kitchen counter. There was so much to do here! The hot tub was fun and my husband and I had a competitive corn home match :) The sweet animals really made my stay. We were fortunate to have a baby lamb born during our stay, which I got to hold. Brandon was so friendly and kind explaining the history and future plans he and Hollie have for this amazing place. We highly recommend staying here. We will be back!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Don’t walk, hurry up and run to reserve this place. This was by far my best air bnb experience. The host was beyond helpful, responsive, and accommodating. The tiny home felt so comfortable and cozy. The property itself was breathtaking in the views. You just can’t find elsewhere. I can’t wait to come back!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,The grand ranch was definitely one of my wifes and I favorite airbnb we have ever been. So coming back and stay at the grand ranch. Love that style of farm. Has always been our dreams to have a farm on our own.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Loved this property highly recommended.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This place is very cute. The setting is beautiful and wholesome… the house was nice and clean with personalized touches from the hosts.
Would highly recommend if you love farms and animals."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Our stay was exactly what we were looking for when we booked. It’s close proximity to Zion NP and Cedar City was ideal. Beautiful surroundings and the animals on the farm were a fun addition. Brandon couldn’t be more friendly and gave great suggestions on restaurants and hiking. Would highly recommend.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This place was so cute and so fun! We visited for our anniversary for something different and had such a nice time. I would love to come back again with my kids and stay in one of the larger units!
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We absolutely loved staying here for 2 nights on our honeymoon. The last place we stayed before heading back out of Utah, it was the perfect end to our trip. The house was very nice, clean, cozy, and luxurious. Brandon was working with the animals when we arrived and walked over and greeted us. Extremely friendly and welcoming. Walking into the house on the counter was a freshly baked loaf of sourdough bread and butter, was seriously some of, if not, the best we’ve ever had. Also a tub of ice cream in the freezer that I wish we would have ate more of. The views of the mountains from the great windows were magnificent. The hot tub was quite a highlight, especially after a week of backpacking and hiking. The location couldn’t be better, close to the national parks, off the beaten path but also only 15-20 mins to Cedar City. The animals were very friendly and fun to feed. We can’t wait to return, which we definitely will, God willing."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Everything was amazing! My daughter especially loved being able to interact with the animals! It was a wonderful stay and I would absolutely recommend it and return again if I’m in the area :) thank you Brandon!
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"After having a long drive from Colorado and making a pit stop for a hike along the way, Brandon’s place was a great ending to our drive. The loft was cozy. The animals around the ranch were amazing. Our loft’s backyard had 2 friendly beautiful cows. It was such fun experience. The hot tub was a great touch after hiking esp having hazel (cow) keeping us company while we were relaxing in the tub. I definitely will be coming back. I recommend all of Brandon’s ranch Airbnbs. There are others nearby and felt private. Brandon’s was a great host. Don’t miss out on this great experience, you won’t regret it esp if you’re an animal lover."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great house with a lot of amenities - animals on location were a plus! All around very pleased with the stay
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,My daughter and I stayed here for one night. We wish we had time for a longer stay. Great downtown and restaurants are only about 15 min. away. Such a fun experience with the animlas
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This place was a dream! I've never stayed anywhere like it. Loved the space, the ambiance, the little notes, the cleanliness. I came with my two teenage boys and it was one of their favorite things about vacation too! Thank you!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Great place to stay! Wonderful experiences
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Our family loved the stay at Brandon’s place. We have never been somewhere so unique! I will recommend it to anyone traveling in the area! Our kids are already asking to go back!
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful location, awesome rooms, great animals and helpful suggestions for enjoying Zion!"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We loved our stay at the farm!! Our only complaint was that we wish we could’ve stayed longer. The sourdough bread was the best we ever had and we loved meeting hazel. Thanks Brandon for a great stay!
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We certainly enjoyed the trip the animals added a real fun atmosphere.
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We were welcomed with fresh sourdough bread and butter. That’s the way to my heart. The home was stocked with everything we needed. The animals were so much fun. My kids enjoyed the trampoline. The owners were so kind and helpful. We can’t wait to come back!
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We enjoyed our time! Brandon and family were great hosts, the cows were fun, and ot was a perfect location for our hiking itinerary."

We’ll be staying here again!"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We really enjoyed ourselves here. It was a good home base for a lot of hiking in surrounding area and unique. Brandon was quick to help. The views can’t be beat and we loved having our own cows.
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Brandon was a great host. Beautiful property, loved the cows and other animals. Such a memorable stay.
Thank you"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Where do I start?! I loved everything about this place!!! The cows, hot tub and mountain views is what drew me in to renting this location and it was everything and more than I could have imagined!
We loved all the details; animal food, fresh baked bread and a whole farm of friendly animals to love on. I took full advantage on purchasing more animal food from their vending machines because I could not get enough of feeding them all!
This is the perfect location to book with friends, spouse and kiddos! I enjoyed spending two days here with the hubs celebrating my 40th birthday!"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I have stayed in many Air bnb locations and most of them are great. This location however added an extra level experience. We loved the animals and the fun that surrounded us. It wasn’t just a stay, it was an experience."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Absolutely loved our stay. My main reason for staying was for my love for animals. It was totally worth it! Weather wasn't the best but we made the best of it! Beautiful views of the mountains and extremely peaceful. 10/10 recommend and I hope to be back in the future.
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Absolutely stunning property in every way. From check-in to check out from the to the property to the tiny house everything is as described and better than expected. We were thrilled to see the cows as we pulled up a little bit later than expected the area is easy to find via Waze but Brandon provided a solid GPS location in case we had any troubles. The ranch is easy to find with cheerful lights lining the drive if you arrive after dark. Each residence is marked clearly so there was no confusion as to which one we belonged to, and everything is well lit. We loved feeding the animals and saying hello. The stars at night are amazing, and so stunning to see, especially from the hot tub. It is rustic and beautiful and everything that we hoped it would be and provided a great starting point for our north Zion hike. Cedar city is a nice little town 10 min away with nice restaurants, grocery stores and outdoor stores if you forgot anything for your hiking activities (shoutout C-A-L Ranch)."

2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This Airbnb stay blew my expectations out of the water! The tiny home was very nice, beautifully decorated, Brandon and his wife left so many sweet personal touches behind from the treats for the adorable cows that you can feed on the patio, a handwritten note, fresh local sourdough bread and butter, and a cute scrapbook with a Polaroid for guests to add to. The location was stunning! Pictures don’t do it justice. The mountain surroundings are breathtaking, and my husband and I really enjoyed the serenity, peace, and privacy we experienced here. The highlight of our stay was getting to feed all the animals on the ranch and watching the sunset in our hot tub. We had the pleasure of being greeted by the hosts who were so kind and helpful and did a great job communicating proactively with us and giving us local recommendations. Could not recommend this place more. My only regret was not staying longer. We will be back! Thank you so much for everything!"
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Great stay! My kids loved it. They got to feed the cows first thing in the morning with the sunrise. It’s at a beautiful location as well near Zion. Also less than a 10 min drive to Cedar City, UT. Would highly recommend it."

2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Such an awesome experience! Loved all the animals! Enjoyed being able to explore the northern part of Zion- the part people don’t usually go to. Also got to hike Kannara Falls - off season so it wasn’t crowed. The hot tub was awesome after daily hikes! Easily one of my favorite AirBnbs!
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We had a great time! So peaceful and a great escape, plus all the cute animals the we got to feed and pet. We will most likely be staying here again!"
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Brandon’s tiny home was all around amazing! We loved the house, the view, the homemade bread, the farm and most importantly Hazel & Bell. It was our first adventure out west and Brandon and his family made it very memorable!"

2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The Grand ranch was an amazing place to stay. I enjoyed every bit of it, it was so peaceful, with beautiful views. I loved all the animals they were adorable. Especially the goats jumping on my boyfriends back. I also was very surprised to see they have a built in ground trampoline, which was so much fun. Everything was clean and so cozy. The hot tub felt amazing on my sore bones from snowboarding. Drinking my coffee every morning with the cows is something i can get used too! And the home made bread was so delicious, we had it with two of our dinners, it was definitely a trip for the books, I would 100% recommend staying here. Wonderful ranch With wonderful people and wildlife. Will be coming back soon!!"
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"If you are looking for an amazing, serene, beautiful, private ABNB, pick this. I can't say enough great things. Worth every penny. How can you not love sitting in a spa and feeding the highland cattle."
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Brandon’s tiny farm home absolutely exceeded all expectations! From the moment we checked in the host went above and beyond to make us feel welcomed. We were greeted with a hand-written note thanking us for the stay in addition to homemade bread- amenities you don’t typically find at other airbnbs. The rooms were as described and everything was clean & tidy.
The farm was also incredible! My wife and I brought our toddler along who absolutely loved all the animals and had the time of her life petting them. We 10/10 recommend this place for anyone looking for a unique vacation getaway near the mountains."

2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I wanted to surprise my girlfriend with a unique stay and saw this place. I can confidently say that the Grand Ranch exceeded absolutely all of our expectations! The property was beautiful and everything about it was breathtaking. Brandon, the host, was really helpful and very nice he answered all of our questions really fast. The space was very clean and the mattress was actually so comfortable that we couldn’t get out of bed and ended up being late to our snowboarding trip! Being able to see the animals and feed them right off the porch was such a beautiful experience. Overall this has been one of our favorite trips and we will definitely be planning to return in the future! Thank you for such an amazing experience Brandon!"
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"First of all - I thought the bed was comfy and the bathroom was spotless! This place deserves 5 stars overall.
This Airbnb is an entire experience. You wake up and your view is a beautiful sunrise paired with mountains and cows waiting for you to pet them. Their entire farm is filled with sweet mini animals and that in itself is incredible.
The family who lives on the property is very attentive. We got our car stuck in the snow and the son came out immediately to help us. Brandon (the host) was also so friendly and answered all of my questions almost immediately. They also had fresh bread and butter for us upon arrival.
The home itself is incredibly thought out. For a tiny home, there’s a lot of storage space. Hooks in every corner, door, mirror, just where you need it to be. The design and layout was very efficient and same with the Hot tub placement. You’re relaxing in the hot tub and all of a sudden your nudged by a gentle cow lol
10/10! So worth it."
2024-01-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Such a cute little place! It was really fun to hut tub by the cows, walk around the ranch and see all the animals.

Every detail of this Airbnb is SO well thought out. The tiny home was so beautiful and cozy, it was decorated so sweetly for the holidays. I had been worried about my partner and me being too tall to be comfortable in a tiny home, this was totally not an issue. Not only does the house feel very spacious, Brandon had replied to me very promptly about the ceiling heights prior to our stay. Brandon and Hollie are the best hosts- so friendly and engaging. And the animals are just the icing on the cake. This trip was so, so special and we can’t wait to return."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This is probably our favorite AirBnb we have had. The only downside is we only had it for one night. Brandon was super helpful and accommodating.

After a long day of hiking, it was great to come home and soak in the hot tub next to the cows! We also loved hanging out with all the other animals - goats, sheep, kittens, Alpacas, pigs and the very social chicken, Heihei. Brandon was an excellent, super friendly host and goes above and beyond to give his guests a unique experience. The cherry on top was the yummy bread that he left us!"

The home itself was the perfect size for us, and the hot tub was a nice added touch after a day of hiking. The highland cows and other farm animals were an added treat and super friendly. every single detail of the home and property was just beautiful and well thought out. It is easy to see that Brandon and his family love this ranch and work hard to upkeep the property. The home is less than an hour to the main entrance at Zion and less than 15 minutes to the Kolob Canyons. So many outdoor activities to do, we hope to make it back one day!"

The hot tub and outdoor lighting made it so cozy to spend time outside the unit enjoying the night air and privacy. During the day it was so nice to explore the grounds and visit the other animals, the goats, sheep, alpacas and some kittens following us along the way. The grounds are just as beautiful during the day as they are at night. It is a hidden gem that we would love to visit again!!!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"In one word… Magical. This place is an absolute must to stay at. The hosts are the most kind, genuine, attentive, people I have ever had the pleasure to meet. Upon arrival we were greeted not only by cows, alpacas, and two tiny kittens but by freshly made bread and butter. The only complaint would be that they don’t have extra loaves of bread to be able to purchase because it was the absolute best bread and I wanted to take some home to my family. I’m so thankful to have been able to stay here, it was such a pleasure to be able to just sit under the stars with the animals right at your front door. My girls really enjoyed the stay as well, they had an in ground trampoline, with a petting zoo on the property. Bring quarters for the goat food but the treats they provide are good for them as well. They also had the largest pig I have ever seen. This is not just a place to sleep, it’s an experience, an adventure. We loved every bit of it and I cannot wait to return."

2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Ivie was great!! We had to cancel our stay at the last minute due to a winter storm affecting travel. She was a pleasure to work with. We are planning a return trip and will definitely look to stay here in the future.
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The apartment is very well equipped, we had everything we needed to cook our breakfast . Bed was comfortable, the place is very well maintained everything looks like new! instructions were very clear , we spend one night only I definitely recommend."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Peaceful. Flexible and great communication.
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was a great place to stay for our Zion/ Bryce Canyon trip. Even though it is about an hour drive to the national parks, the airbnb was well worth it. Very cute and spacious, nicely decorated, and a ton of towels/cooking supplies. The location was so close to many restaurants and had a great view of the mountains. Would definitely recommend to anyone."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This is a perfect stay right in the middle of Cedar City. Ivie is responsive host and the home is just like the pictures. We highly recommend!
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We enjoyed our stay at Ivie's! It was spacious and comfortable, with lots of cooking utensils and supplies in the kitchen. The neighborhood is quiet but close to the main street and easy to navigate to and from. Ivie was very friendly and responsive, and we enjoyed our sauna session in her massage studio below!"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"It was a short stay, but we would have gladly stayed longer. Ivie was very friendly and responsive. Allowing us to use the sauna was particularly lovely of her."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This was my first time staying at a Airbnb and I loved it. So much better than a Hotel. Very private and peaceful. No more Hotels for me.
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This Airbnb is a gem. Ivie was an amazing host and great communication. It had everything you could ask for and enough space for multiple people. It was very clean and organized. They are different from a lot of Airbnbs and provide an amazing service.
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Overall well rounded airbnb for the little time we spent in Utah. No complaints, easy to find and welcoming."
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Ivie’s place is probably the best Airbnb I’ve ever stayed at. The place is super clean, and looks just like the pictures if not better. Ivie went above and beyond to make us feel at home and comfortable. She even has a sauna guest can use. Must let her know in advance as it is part of her business on the first level. Peaceful neighborhood surrounded by breathtaking sights. Perfect place for a great getaway!"
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Loved our stay! Ivie was so accommodating and responsive. Highly recommend!
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I loved this place. So clean and quiet. I felt right at home.
Next time I am in town for work, I will stay here again if it is available.
Highly recommend!!!"
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Our brief stay here was incredibly comfortable! This stay exceeded our expectations. It was even better in person than the pictures. The temperature upon check-in was just right, a thoughtful detail particularly appreciated during the winter season. The beds were cozy, the bathroom spotless, and the kitchen was perfectly equipped with everything we needed to make a quick breakfast before heading out. The host kindly offered to allow us to return after check-out to freshen up with a hot shower following a full day of snowboarding. We're already planning our next trip to Brian Head and will undoubtedly choose to stay here again. Thank you!"
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We enjoyed this house. It was definitely worth the price and the house was clean and comfortable.
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Staying here was great! The photos don’t do it enough justice bc they need more of them, but it was a great space! Very lovely and perfect for what we needed."
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Great people, Great location, we will be back."
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"What a great stay!! This was the cleanest, most well put together place we have stayed!! The decor, the amenities, the cleanliness, oh and the hosts..amazing!! We will be coming back here for sure!!!"
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Worth the stay and could not complain about anything! Would definitely stay here again when in town!
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,I was in town for doctoral candidate interviews so spent most my time out of the house . However when I was there it felt like home away from home. Very clean and cute place! I was able to have a brief encounter with Ivie outside. She was very kind. Was bummed I didn’t have time for the sauna or booking a massage :) I will for sure want to stay here again! Walkable to downtown and suu when there isn’t a snow storm :)
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"basically…… you NEED to book Ivie’s Garden if you’re staying in Cedar. Period. Everything was seamless, we checked in later in the evening and she still left the door unlocked for us. I loved sleeping on the third floor. It’s so cozy and the window has a great mountain view. The house is equipped with everything you need. no need to ask for trash bags or paper towels! She has your stay completely considered. Yes it’s the back house, but we really did feel like we were apart of their home. She even offered us late check out due to a snow storm but i’m proud to say this cali girl made it to the highway on snow covered roads 💪🏾Cant wait to see Ivie’s Garden in the spring and maybe play on her trampoline!"
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Absolutely beautiful. Everything was just as listed and described. Host was flexible with my checkin. Would definitely stay again.
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Great place and very clean!
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Second time staying here. Owners are very kind and responsive!
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,It took me a while to write this review because life gets busy and I wanted to make sure I had the time to give a review of Ivie and her beautiful family. From the moment I saw this place it reminded me of home. When we arrived there was dedicated parking space and a cute lighted path to the entrance of the air bnb. We didn’t even feel like we were renting another persons home it felt like home and it was so peaceful and cozy. Prior to arriving Ivie was very communicative and responsive offering suggestions on activities to do as well as offering the sauna after our long hike of Kannara falls. My friend and I stayed there for my birthday weekend and Ivie and her husband were so friendly and turned on the fire pit for us the second night so we could roast marshmallows. There were plenty of towels a washer and dryer and the beds cozywere I cannot even put into words the kindness and comfortability we felt while staying here. Thank you again Ivie and we will be back when we visit utah!!
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,I recommend it 5☀️
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Ivie's garden was a delightful place to stay. I love how light and airy the whole apartment is. It has a delightful balcony with a small table and a couple of chairs that one could enjoy breakfast outside. The garden surrounding was pleasant, and the ducks were fun. It is a half mile walk to the Shakespeare Festival on pleasant, tree-lined streets, and also within walking distance to the grocery store.
We were very comfortable, and everything seemed high quality. It was especially pleasant to have high quality appliances and dishes in the kitchen.
Ivie was very quick to responded to our questions and needs. We would definitely stay here again."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We would definitely want to stay here again! Located on a quiet street in walking distance to the Utah Shakespeare Festival and restaurants. Space has everything you need including washer and dryer. Loved the back deck for bird watching. Cool loft area used by our kids. Host gave us a great restaurant recommendation we used on our first night in town. Cozy, clean and homey space. You won’t be disappointed!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Ivie’s place was exactly as described. She was immediately responsive to our questions. We had a very positive experience.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Great place, perfect for what we needed. Peaceful surroundings, Ivie has fruit trees all around the property. We will visit again"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We thoroughly enjoyed ourselves and thought the apartment was terrific. The beds were comfortable and we will definitely book Ivy Garden again next year when we visit Cedar City for the Utah Shakespeare Festival.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We were in town for a play—it was very close. It was conveniently situated. It was a great experience and I would definitely recommend this place to others.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I could go on and on about how great this place and its hosts are! The building is new construction - everything inside is new, and it's very nicely appointed and designed. The kitchen has: full sized fridge with ice and water, dishwasher, pots/pans, gas oven/stove, microwave, Keurig, spices. There is a washer and dryer in the bathroom. You can set the a/c in several different areas with individual remote controls (in the bedroom, loft and main living area). The bedding was very cozy. We enjoyed the balcony in the mornings and evenings. We didn't take them up on using the infared sauna, but my husband did schedule a massage with Ivie, who was very thorough and knowledgeable.
Ivie and her husband were very accommodating in several ways and we are very thankful for them. If you choose to stay here you will never regret that decision.
Ivie doesn't advertise this, but she makes the soap that is in the bathroom, and she does have some for sale. Buy some if you have the chance!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Beautifully decorated apartment with a bright, modern, relaxing feel. Comfortable bed and sofa, gorgeous kitchen area with everything you need to prep a meal. Lovely deck with nice chairs for reading and taking in the sunrise (overlooking the coolest ducks I’ve ever seen).
Walking distance to downtown!
HIGHLY recommend booking a massage with Ivie while you’re there!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"It was a perfect location for our party. We spent a few days at Shakespeare festival (just down the road). The property is newer and very bright and clean. We enjoyed the back patio as often as we could. Full kitchen was most helpful. The hosts were very accommodating and kind. We have stayed at several locations in Cedar, this is our new favorite. We will be back."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We booked this place kinda last minute as we surprised family for the holiday but it was a true find.
Not only we’re her instructions clear the property was clean and looked liked the photos. We all know there’s nothing worse than booking something and then you get there and it’s not what was advertised but this was not the case.
The property is located so close to town and easy access to shopping and restaurants. The best place we ate at was THE PIZZA CART! Sooo yummy! A little bit of a wait but so
Worth it!
We really enjoyed how quiet the location was me how it was so easy with getting in and out of the property. Everything was tidy and we had only 1 issue with the Roku provided but that is no biggie we watched our computer.
Great stay!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We had a great stay! Would stay here again.
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place! Clean and well furnished. Very comfortable. Great hosts!
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Great place. Perfect for me and my kids. It had everything I needed.
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is a wonderful place to stay. The place is first class, in a quiet and friendly neighborhood, and close to restaurants, stores, the university and the great outdoors. I had a perfect stay."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Ivie’s place was absolutely a refreshing stay! Newly constructed and clean.
Enough space for you to stretch out and enjoy the comfort. Beds were very comfortable. And a beautiful kitchen.
Laundry facilities we’re a plus. Dan and Ivie were very friendly and helpful with our stay."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Loved this AirBnb. Ivie was a wonderful host. She was attentive and nice, and check-in process was very convenient. Best part of this place was that it is relatively new, and therefore very clean. Extremely spacious and comfy. There is a full kitchen with everything you need + nice bathroom with washer/dryer and comfy beds + large TV! Ivie also let us use the dry sauna she owns downstairs in her parlor after a long day of hiking at Bryce. Location wise, Cedar City is ~1hr from Springdale (Zion) and ~1.5hr to Bryce National Park. We thought it would be a bit closer, but we didn't mind the drive. However, if you are looking for a closer place to the national parks, Cedar City might be a bit farther than other areas. Cedar City has everything you need (Walmart, Starbucks, restaurants, etc.,) which was nice. The location is also very quiet and peaceful, with lots of stars in the night sky. The patio/balcony is also a nice touch. We loved our stay here and we highly recommend it!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Really enjoyed our stay here. Everything was exactly as presented. ALSO- and this is a big one for me- the kitchen was both clean and fully stocked with everything short of the actual food and she even had spices. Really appreciated that, because sometimes you come to stay at a place with a kitchen and you forget you need seasonings and you're eating saltless eggs for breakfast."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,absolutely amazing! we can't wait to visit again!
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Super cute place and convenient to everything you need.
2023-04-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Ivie and her family were very welcoming. Her husband met us as we arrived to check in to help explain a few things. The building is brand new. The interior was nicely decorated. New furniture!
Their AirBnB is above Ivie's massage studio, were she sees clients. Although it is listed as a separate house, it really has more of an apartment or guest house feel as the building is located in the back yard of their home. The backyard and garden surrounding the unit is a work in progress, and included a chicken coop. We heard neighborhood noises and nearby traffic noise at times.
Two coworkers shared the space and realized it was better suited for a related couple or small family to share as their was not a door for the loft bedroom area. We were also counting on the use of the clothes washer and drier during our stay, however they were still inoperative when we arrived. :(
Otherwise, it was very clean with a well stocked kitchen and all new appliances and furniture! Good base camp!!!"
2023-04-01,5.0,Group trip,This was a great place to stay! The owner communicated well. It was clean and everything was new. The kitchen was stocked well. The beds and pillows were comfy with nice soft sheets. It was very nice for them to allow a free infra red sauna session at our stay.
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,The place was clean and well organized. Host was very friendly and helpful.
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great place to stay! East access to things in Cedar. Care and thought out into the place. Will definitely stay again. Owner communicated well!!!
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a great time here! It’s peaceful and beautiful. We loved the cows, especially the babies! The place was very nice and comfortable, and the hot tub was great! We would love to come back sometime."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Great place to stay
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Two adult couples in our family stayed at the Smart Blue House for 4 nights early in May. During this time we made daily excursions to the national parks in the area. We enjoyed the accommodations at the Smart Blue House and it served our purpose well. The home was very clean, secure, and conveniently located. Kitchen was well equipped and had everything we needed to cook meals. There are lots of places to shop and eat nearby in Cedar City and it was a good location from which to make trips to Zion, Kolob, Bryce, and Cedar Breaks. I do not hesitate to recommend this vacation rental and would stay there again if we are in the area. It was a good value and Nathan responded immediately whenever we messaged him. It is obvious that he takes pride in keeping the property in good condition and accommodating guests."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Nathan was quick to respond. The home has activities and a nice backyard. 5 min drive to downtown. Thank you.
2024-04-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"House was quaint, it had some unfinished work in the basement that made it seem dingy. The temperature was 80 degrees in the house when we got there and there was no cooling system. The host did come by the next day and hook up the swamp cooler. Beds were very firm if you like that. The host was responsive to questions."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"The house was really nice! It was clean, and comfortable. We loved the games in the basement. It was really nice to park in the garage."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Would have had more time to spend at home, but we could not due to the tight timelines of our trips. The home is simply great for families, excellent location and neighbourhood"
2024-04-01,5.0,Group trip,A great location and a perfect house for a group of people!
2024-03-01,5.0,Group trip,Stayed here for a spring break trip to hike the national parks. Fit exactly what we were looking for. Was a little over an hour to get to both Bryce and Zion National Park’s entrances so it worked perfectly to hike both. Loved it!
2024-03-01,5.0,Group trip,This place was great! Nathan and Beatriz were great hosts - very proactive and responsive. The description and photos of the home are accurate. The games in the basement were a nice added bonus as well. Would stay here again!

2023-10-01,5.0,Group trip,Great stay. Exactly what we needed during our time in Cedar City. Thank you.
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Great house! Clutter free home that had everything necessary for a comfortable stay. Ping pong, board games, and a study nook all appreciated by the kids. We enjoyed the master suite in the basement away from the bustle. Clean bathrooms and linens, nicely accessible kitchen. Smart tvs to use our streaming services. Also really appreciated the garage to lock away our bikes while we were in Cedar. Thanks Nathan!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We loved Nathan's Blue House! Our young kids had a blast exploring the back yard and we had fun playing ping pong with our teenager in the basement. The location is great for exploring Cedar City, heading down to St. George for a day and/or exploring nearby National Parks. We look forward to staying at Nathan's again!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Group trip,"All was just as depicted/expected. Space was ideal for our family group of 7. We were just passing through and it worked great for us. The garage is big enough for 2 full size SUVs. The 2 TVs worked well. The extra table allowed us to all have dinner together. Nathan answered the one question I had quickly. Not everything is fancy, but it's nice, had everything we needed, and the price was right."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great price, great place!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This home was very clean, well stocked and perfect location for us. Not only was Nathan super prompt but also super kind in willing to work with me to adjust head count and dates. thank you!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Nice place. We enjoyed our stay.
2023-08-01,5.0,Group trip,"The little blue house was perfect for our family. Plenty of comfortable beds, well stocked kitchen, use of the garage was a plus."
2023-07-01,5.0,Group trip,"Beautiful home! Host was quick to respond and communicate when need popped up. House is in a great, quiet neighborhood with lots of activities close by. Home is very spacious! Big backyard for kids or a nice evening outside relaxing. The ping pong table was a hit!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Perfect place for our group of 8! The home is easy to get to. The kitchen had so many helpful appliances if you didn’t want to eat out every night. Nathan and his co-host were very responsive and helpful. I’d definitely stay there’s again!
2023-07-01,5.0,Group trip,"Nathan was extraordinary and SAVED US. We arrived in Cedar to stay at a different AirBNB, and the air conditioner was not functional. The host was unresponsive, and the heat was unbearable ( 94'F inside, which is crazy even if I wasn't pregnant!). We contacted Nathan at 8:00 PM in desperate need of a different place to stay, and not only was he sympathetic and sweet, but he was ready for us to come immediately to the house. It was wonderfully clean, AND he even ran over to the house before we arrived to open windows and turn the AC on full blast to cool the house down even more. It was so thoughtful and I feel truly indebted to him for his quick response and preparedness. The house was lovely and we had a great place to rest during our busy time in Cedar. Thank you!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We booked this place not knowing the area at all. Coming from Australia we planned to visit Zion and Bryce Canyon and use Cedar City as a base. Nathan and Beatriz’s place was a perfect place to do that. Clean, tidy, heaps of space so everyone could have a bedroom, well stocked, good cooling for the heat wave, even a table tennis table and a work space (we were on holiday so unused!). It was about an hour to Zion and about an hour and a half to Bryce Canyon. And the unexpected extras like Kolob Canyon (western part of Zion and only 20 minutes away) and the beautiful Cedar Breaks National Monument (like a small Bryce Canyon). We had a great stay and would definitely recommend this place."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Cute little spot!
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Updated, clean, quiet neighborhood, 5 minutes from Shakespeare festival, perfect for a quick weekend stay"

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Super nice and clean place!! Lynn is a great host.
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We absolutely loved this Cowboy Cabin. I was raised watching John Wayne and this place was awesome. I had a few questions right when we got there and Lynn was extremely quick to respond. And come to find out the directions were there all along and I just didn’t realize it. He was so nice about it. I didn’t need to bug him, but it was great to know he was only a message away.
Perfect location for what we were doing. Super clean. Loved the decor. I’m secretly hoping my wife wants to redo our home into a cowboy theme after staying there. Can’t wait to go back. You gotta check this place out, but not all of you. I want to be able to book it next time we pass through."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Saddle up and dive into the cowboy dream at this charming A-frame log cabin.
From the moment we arrived, we were enchanted by the rustic charm and cozy atmosphere of this authentic cowboy retreat. The cabin comfortably accommodated our group of 7 providing ample space to relax and unwind after days filled with adventure.
Speaking of adventure, the location couldn't be more perfect for exploring the wonders of the Wild West. Every day brought new thrills and excitement.
But what truly stole our hearts were the little touches that made us feel like true cowboys and cowgirls. From the friendly horses greeting us across the street to the mesmerizing stargazing opportunities at night, we were transported back to a simpler time, surrounded by the sights, sounds and smells of the frontier.
Our experience at the cowboy cabin was nothing short of magical. This charming retreat is the perfect place to hang your hat and immerse yourself in the beauty of the American West. Thanks for hosting!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,My kids LOVED this place and the loft was perfect for them! Such a cute little cabin. Would stay here again.
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Cowboy Cabin is great! Lots of open space in the house so our family felt like we could spread out.
We travel with our 5 kids so it’s important to be able to find a family friendly place. They had a stocked with toys play room where my kids could re-enact lightsaber battles or relax with stuffed animals and read a book.
I loved the overhead rain shower head in the main floor bathroom added with the on demand water heater and I had a rejuvenating shower.
There are fun details everywhere from the backsplash to the painted cows. You can tell the hosts are detail oriented from the layout to designs.
You’ll have a restful time and feel that the cabin rejuvenates you. 10/10 recommend.
The area is so fun with horses, sheep, and other farm noises and gives an authentic experience.
Have fun!"

In the middle of cooking, we ran out of gas for the grill, and they immediately fixed it.We loved this place!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Absolutely stunning place. If the real prancing pony had been this nice the ringwraiths would have downed a cold one stead of trying to kill Frodo!

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was the 3rd Airbnb that we’ve stayed at in Cedar City while visiting my daughter who attended SUU. Our first night, it was so cold outside and our room was nice and toasty inside. Everything we needed was available. Tara messaged us that if the place was ready early, she would let us know. Sure enough, it was! We were able to drop off our things before heading out for graduation festivities. We will definitely book again when we come back into town!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,such a homey and clean place to stay
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Our stay at The Prancing Pony was absolutely perfect! Tyra’s place went above and beyond in so many ways including the Lord of the Rings themed decor and especially the cleanliness (and we are very detail oriented people). It was so cozy- we felt like we were in our own home and it was the perfect place to curl up under a cozy blanket after long days of hiking in the National Parks! Thank you so much for opening your home to guests like us! We will not hesitate to come back or recommend this stay to others!

There is a boxed set of Tolkien, and I enjoyed reading chapter 7, which confirmed that the oldest creature in Middle-Earth is Tom Bombadil. I’m approaching Tom’s age myself, and I really enjoyed the creature comforts."

We arrived after three days of outhouses, swimming/kayaking in the Colorado River, dirty hikes, and a below freezing campout at the Grand Canyon. It was HEAVEN to wash up in the full bathroom, do a load of laundry, check in w the high-speed internet, and cook up a storm in the full kitchen. Tyra recommended an AMAZING hike at Kanarra Falls Slot Canyon and told us how to get permits online. They were booked up, but we were able to get them in person. This was the best hike of our trip!!! The bedding was especially soft. The Hobbit Cottage yard was gorgeous. And our hosts were friendly and helpful! Thank you Tyra and Chris!!!"

The only issue we had was finding the place at first. Our map app considered the whole block the same address. Once we figured out what was going on and understood the directions, it was super easy.

2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Lovely space! I was passing through on a road trip and stayed here after checking out Zion. The decor inside makes it feel very welcoming. Had no issues with the amenities and the bed was comfy. Glad I stayed here.
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The Prancing Pony was such a wonderful spot to stay! It felt like home with many personal touches and was clean and cozy. It has a great location with easy access to downtown Cedar City via city bike trails. Tyra was easy and quick to communicate with. We will definitely be back next time we pass through Cedar City.

We will be back for sure, and we highly recommend this space for anyone looking."
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"This was a perfect setup for us. The room was very comfortable and made note that it would make an excellent mother-in-law suite. We were able to come and go without disturbing anyone. We met Tyra a couple of times and she was very friendly. The location to the National Parks, Cedar Breaks, Kolob Canyons and Zion was perfect. We will definitely return. Local restaurants we liked the best was Amber Kay's breakfast."
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Such a cute and comfortable property. Friendly host and little touches that made all the difference! Will be back!!
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,Fantastic little place that feels much bigger than it looks. It’s clean and modern with a fun aesthetic. Highly recommend for anyone looking to stay in Cedar City or as a home base for trips to Bryce Canyon/Zion/Brian Head. Would definitely stay here again!
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,This was a great place to stay. The room was so comfortable and private. The decorations were amazing whether you are a Lord of the Rings fan or not. Everything was updated and it felt brand new. I loved staying here.

2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This is the best place to stay around this area. Super clean, very cute and comfortable. This was our favorite Airbnb 🙂"
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay. Very close to national parks and lots of other outdoor activities as well. Came down for an anniversary and was not disappointed. Love the Lord of the Rings decoration
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"If you’re thinking of booking this- DO IT. This is by far the best Airbnb I’ve ever stayed at. It was clean, comfortable, so thoughtful. Tyra was an amazing host.
We went to Zion, Bryce Canyon, St George, and more! A little bit of a drive to some locations, but TOTALLY worth it to stay at this Airbnb.
If we’re ever in the area again, we will absolutely be booking this place.
Can’t say enough good things."
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Such a great stay! My boyfriend and I wanted to find a place in between Zion and Bryce and were super impressed with this airbnb. It’s clean, new and cozy! Felt like home the minute we walked in. Has everything you need and more. Tyra and Chris are great hosts -very communicative. I 100% recommend this stay!!! Thank you for a great vacation :D!!!"
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is a lovely place. Sometimes basement units can be noisy, but honestly this was the quietest basement unit I've ever stayed in (and I've stayed in quite a few). Tyra has worked really hard to insulate the upstairs from the downstairs. There is also a white noise machine if you need a little extra, but I didn't need it at all while I was there. We got to talk to Tyra for a little bit as we checked in. She's a lovely host! They've obviously put a lot of care into making the space comfortable and well furnished. The king size bed is very comfy, too. 10/10 would recommend! This is a great little space."
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great place, very modern, clean and comfortable. The kitchen has everything you need and more, we were even able to enjoy some waffles in the morning! Thank you very much!"
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Private, clean and perfect!"
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Wow, the Prancing Pony is by far the best Airbnb experience we've been to. Tyra & Chris offer a home away from home, well supplied and with every amenity including a washer & dryer. They deserve to be fast-tracked to super host status."
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Very cute, cozy decor. Brand new, very clean bathroom and kitchen areas. Right in the middle of Cedar City, plenty of food places nearby. Check out Kolob Canyons just 20 min away! Underrated part of Zion NP."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We enjoyed the stay in this wonderful smart home. Great place to stay if you’re visiting to Zion. A very modern house with all the smart facilities and we loved the esthetic’s and decor. Master bathroom was very well done with modern touch of stand alone tub and smart bidet. Outdoor is well planned for family entertaining with golf area and fire place. Will revisit again on my next visit.
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Great host, easy to work with and very helpful"
2024-05-01,5.0,Group trip,"Great place to relax and spend time as a family. Very modern, clean, and a bit futuristic. Very comfortable - we wish we could have stayed longer."
2024-04-01,5.0,Group trip,This was a beautiful smart home. It gave me so many ideas for things I want to do to my own house.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,we had a pleasant stay in this charming house in a very quiet area. I recommend it.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,The house was great! Clean and cozy. Peaceful neighborhood. We loved all the smart amenities. We found this airbnb while looking for somewhere to stay to visit Zion and Bryce. It’s about an hour drive to Zion and an hour and thirty minutes to Bryce. We didn’t mine the drives because the house was so worth it and the scenery along the drive is beautiful. Would definitely stay again!
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This was a great experience! Loved every moment. Will be booking again.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We really enjoyed our stay here! The house is about an hour from the main entrance to Zion National Park and all of the restaurants/shops there, but the drive to the park was beautiful and quite enjoyable. It is located about 20-30 minutes from the northeast corner of Zion (the Kolob Canyon area), but we did not explore that area.
The house is close to restaurants and shops within Cedar City, but also tucked away in a cozy neighborhood. We actually saw 5 deer walking across the street one afternoon!
It was very clean, updated, and comfortable! The massage chair was a nice touch after hiking the canyons all day. We loved our stay and would book again if staying in Cedar City.
Side note: the Alexa in the master bedroom only plays sea shanties to wake you up if you want to use it to set an alarm. Could be a pro or con depending on your swashbuckling preferences."
2024-04-01,5.0,Group trip,Overall the stay was short but nice
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,roomy and comfortable. will stay again when visiting..

2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Thank you for sharing your beautiful home with us! It was so cozy and a perfect location!!!
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Our daughter has been a student at SUU for 4 years so we have stayed at several Airbnb’s in Cedar City. All have been great but this one has been the very best exceeding all of our expectations. We very highly recommend this home! Lots of fun features and very clean and well maintained.
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Great place with great location. My only thing was that my kids tried to play with “their” kids and were told “you can’t go past the fence” like my kids were disease ridden feral kids after their kids SURROUNDED our house the night we checked in.
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This was our second stay and we were even more pleased with it the second time.
We have two little ones and it’s such a kid friendly house. The room with the three bunks is great, the 2.5 year old loved all the toys and thought the bottom bed was really fun like a fort.
Cedar city is a good stay as well, really nice parks by the hilltop lake area and the Main Street/community center area.
Idk when but we will definitely try to stay again."
2024-03-01,3.0,Stayed with kids,"Pros: Beautiful, clean property! Kitchen was beautiful & nicely stocked with cooking utensils. Nice view!
Cons: Ideal for 1-2 small families. The bunk beds are hard to get in & out of ideal for children, but not adults. One “room” is considered the front room with a pull out bed. Not enough pillows & towels for 10 people. Air mattress had a hole & was not usable so someone had to sleep on the floor.
Considering what we paid, the sleeping situation could have been better, but the house was lovely & very clean!"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We were a family of 6 (grandparents, parents, and kids) staying in Mike's house in Cedar City, Utah, in mid-March. Mike's house is lovely, but the circumstances of our stay were a bit stressful. The house was farther than I expected from Zion, and as we arrived, we realized we were driving into a snowstorm. Then when we arrived, we got in just fine and the house was lovely, but the thermostat was disabled. That was a little scary as it was snowing and 20 degrees outside. Monica answered my call and was able to reset the thermostat remotely.
Otherwise, it is a really nice house. My kids enjoyed the massage chair, and my son especially enjoyed all the smart devices throughout the house. We ended up leaving a day early because we weren't prepared for the snow, and we had an early flight out of Vegas the following day. We still enjoyed our stay though - especially the warmed toilet seats!"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We had never stayed in a smart home before and it was quite an experience! Everything from the refrigerator to the toilet was high tech. The home was spotless and absolutely gorgeous. The neighborhood seemed safe and quiet. The hosts provide clear instructions and local recommendations, as well! My family and I stayed at Cedar Park to be within proximity to Zion and it worked out perfectly — short drive. I highly recommend this home to others."

2024-01-01,4.0,Group trip,"Our stay here was great! The house was very clean and looked just like the photos. The master bedroom was comfortable and the message chair was very nice after a long day or snowboarding. The fridge has Spotify and speakers within it and made getting ready in the mornings very fun! The backyard was great for boys to hangout in and play a little mini golf. Overall, this was a great place to stay for the weekend and a lot of fun for a group of friends. We would absolutely stay here again!"

We enjoyed our stay through Christmas and appreciated the little touches they added for us to enjoy as a family through the holidays. We love Cedar city and would not hesitate to stay here again. The house is extremely comfortable with lots to do, fully stocked kitchen, comfortable beds/couches, and just about everything you could want. Our kids loved the basketball hoop, putting green, and we enjoyed the short drive to brian head for snowboarding all week!"

2023-12-01,5.0,Group trip,"The house we were supposed to stay in fell through last minute, and we needed to find an alternative. Not only were Mike and Monica super responsive, but they saved the day and had the house ready within an hour. Upon arrival, it was even more beautiful than the pictures and the home was spotless. All of the upgrades and technology made the time spent there even more relaxing and enjoyable. The living room was perfect for game night, and the massage chair was everyone’s favorite part! The backyard was also super spacious, and provided a perfect opportunity for us to enjoy the beautiful scenery and views, and sit around the fire pit catching up. Mike and Monica were great at providing recommendations for nearby Restaurants and super responsive to questions and needs. We are already planning our next girls trip there and this will always be our first choice! Highly recommend! 10 out of 10."

The warm bidet toilets, masssge chair in the master suite, the kids room and fun games that entertained them. The pictures online were great did not do it justice.

It’s equipped and stocked with everything you will need. The backyard was really nice too. The fire feature had snow under the cover it will take a while to get it going and to clean but it’s nice. Make sure you remind who ever sleeps on the bunk beds that since there are three beds the space between them is very small so they won’t hit there heads lol. That room with the bunks beds it’s really cool and has lots of games my kids loved it. Some spaces are a lil small but it’s a really nice space and

2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Mike’s house is by far the best Airbnb house I have stayed in and honestly don’t think will be able to find a similar one easily. It was very new and clean ( and I am quite picky), beautiful, modern, comfortable, and pleasant. The house had everything you may need in a trip and was nicely located close to Brian Head ski resort that was our destination. It had large windows and was very pleasant just to sit there and watch the snow. It was perfect for 2 families with two separate bedrooms on different sides of the house. Just to summarize, I highly recommend Mike’s place if quality and cleanliness of the place matters to you."
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"My experience was AMAZING!!!!!
Communication with the hosts is effective and fast.
Everything was exceptional, from the first moment we saw the house, it is the same as the photos on the website. Every corner of the house is perfect, and its design is spectacular. Each of its areas is fully equipped.
We didn't have any problems during our stay. Thank you very much, I would definitely come back again."

2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We were on a road trip to visit the National Parks / Canyons for 3 nights / 4 days driving up from California. In terms of ideal distance to points of interest we should have stayed just for 1 night and moved to an closer location thereafter but based on the pics we felt at the cost of driving a few more hrs we will base ourselves for all the nights and it was a good decision. The house is absolutely great, equipped with one of the most modern variety of equipment. Grocery store's a 10 mins drive away. Highly recommend this place."

2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Most places always look a little better in pictures BUT not this one. It exceeded our expectations in in real life. The pictures don't do it justice on just how nice it is. Everything is brand new and so clean. It is very organized and so nice. There's lots of things we purchased for our own home while staying here! You will not be disappointed! It is clean and in a nice neighborhood. My kids had the best time with all the fun activities and amenities! We will for sure come back!
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"What you see and read on the web-site is what you will find. Plus, it cannot begin to express the partnership you will have with Dan to make your stay comfortable and relaxing."
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This beautiful home was the perfect retreat for our family during our Cedar City stay. It was impeccably clean, and even though it’s not huge, the use of space makes it live large, even with a big group.

We had local family over to visit and they were all very impressed with our accommodations. We would definitely stay here again!"

2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Perfect! The house is in a great neighborhood, lots of neat and tech features, and very clean; also a weight set to stay up on fitness. Highly recommend."
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This beautiful home is everything it says it is, and then some! We’re a large family with a few young kids who took a day trip to Brian Head Ski Resort, only 35 min away. Perfect location and many stores nearby.
Home is well equipped with everything you need for a comfortable family stay. We were able to cook breakfast and dinner each day and even got to bake brownies!
Rooms were perfect and kids had a blast in the bunk room. And that master bedroom - love every single detail, from the different lighting options, to the toiletries, the throne (yes, the “throne”) and that massage chair! Definitely came in handy after a day of boarding.
Great neighborhood, great home, great stay and wonderful hosts. They were very accommodating and communication was quick. Glad we met, Mike!"
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Unbelievable home!!! I was stunned with every single detail of this gorgeous home.

2021-12-01,5.0,Group trip,The house is very beautiful in a nice peaceful neighborhood. Highly recommended!
2021-12-01,5.0,Group trip,"This place was probably one of the best stays that i've ever had. We were going to Brian Head for a quick getaway and at first were searching for something closer to the resort itself but after finding Mike's beautiful property, we will keep coming back here every time we go to Brian Head - regardless of the 40 minute drive (which is quite beautiful and easy).
The house was easy to find, close to main shopping areas and the highway, SUPER CLEAN!!!!!!! and more than accommodating. Kitchen was beautifully stocked with really nice kitchenware, extra towels and sheets, the beds were like clouds and the massage chair in the master bedroom was BEYOND any expectation. After a day in the mountains, this house is the best place to relax in and recharge for the next day. The design of the house is amazing and we could tell that the renovation couldn't have been cheap. The master bath is a whole world of its own - impossible to get out of. Everything about this house, from the technology to the vibe and the view in the morning - is absolutely perfect.
Highly recommend this place for a quick ski getaway or vacation with family and friends."
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This home was perfect! It snowed the night we arrived, we got to see the putt putt and hours later it was filled with snow! The home has Alexa through out so you can say Alexa turn on the fan! Alexa play Adele. You can see the Temple! The location to the gas station, grocery store, and fast food chains was less than 5 mins. Very modern. Had games, a beautiful butter fly puzzle, pots, pans, measuring cups, extra trash bags and more! After all the fun we used the magical massage chair! We loved it so much it’s on our need list! Thank you for sharing this beautiful home. Mike was very accommodating!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The Zen Den absolutely delivered! This place is truly a gem, in a private and beautiful setting. The place is so beautifully put together with thoughtful amenities to ensure a relaxing and calming stay. We went out to Zion and Bryce Canyon and had a cozy place to come back to and enjoy stargazing from our private and beautiful patio with a fire pit, hammock and chairs to enjoy. Cedar City is a cut little town with some food and coffee gems for sure. I give this place 5 stars and look forward to coming back sometime. Will also be sharing with all my friends when they visit Utah."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Honestly, this is the cleanest and coziest airbnb I have ever stayed in. You can tell whoever cleans it does a really good job and the bed was soooo comfy. I only really slept here on my way to Idaho Springs, but I wish I spent more time as the fire pit and hammock looked super inviting + the surroundings were gorgeous!! Also - the dirt road is very leveled for those of you with a smaller car (I have a Honda civic) - it is completely accessible. I’ll definitely be staying here again should I be coming this way in the future!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"It’s more than make me feel like home. I wish my home can be as beautiful as the zen den! The devil’s in the details. The design is so thoughtful and on point, I even can remember the scent of the towels. Highly recommend!!"

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This is our new favorite AirBNB - hands down the best! It is so peaceful and stress-free!
We felt so comfortable and relaxed during our stay. This place is so clean and I love the smell of the lemongrass! It has everything you need - we loved the fresh eggs, soooo good!
Chris and CheyAnne are sweet, respectful, and communicative! They both have done an amazing job with this place. Thank you for having us - We will be back! :-)"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We enjoyed our wonderful stay at CheyAnne and Chris place! Love the attention to details, we walked into this cute and cozy studio with the humidifier running, the lemongrass smell and the zen vibe let us be able to relax right away.

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This is an absolutely beautiful little home, with a lovely host. They thought of every detail. A big thing for me is a comfortable bed, and the one here is top notch. I would absolutely stay here again."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We can’t say enough about how wonderful this rental is. It is exactly the type of stay we enjoy. Beautiful and clean, all the kitchen appliances were clean, worked and were not over used (like new and in great condition) located away from town and quiet, gorgeous surroundings, private, close to outdoor activities, the private patio, fire pit and grill were just an added plus. Unfortunately it rained while we were there so we couldn’t enjoy it as much as we would have liked but we will be back. Cheyanne was amazing to communicate with and the farm fresh eggs were just one more added plus. We definitely hope to be back and soon."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The Zen Den was the perfect place for us to come & relax 🧘 We can not thank CheyAnne and Chris enough for the incredible stay!! It felt like home away from home.

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The Zen Den was amazing!
Would recommend it to everyone.
It’s welcoming, quiet and clean.
There’s everything you need to cook and the snacks and farm fresh eggs provided were a great touch."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Cheyanne’s place was absolutely spectacular, even better than the pictures. At night it was absolute quiet with an incredible view of the stars. I have stayed in several Airbnbs and I can say without a shadow of a doubt that this place was the best. They left us a note, farm fresh eggs, a humidifier with lemongrass already going, and tons of treats. Our only regret was that we couldn’t stay longer. If you ever get the chance to stay here, do not hesitate!!!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Staying at the Zen Den was exactly what I was looking for, peace and tranquility. Cheyanne, the host, has thought of everything. The Zen Den comes equipped with everything you need from cooking a meal, to enjoying a soak in the tub. I was extreamly impressed. The bed was super comfortable and the bedding was better than any hotel I've stayed in. In the evening i ejoyed the outdoor space and the fire pit. The sky was clear and the stars were AMAZING. I will definitely be going back as soon as possible."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The Zen Den was an adorable, comfy, and clean place to stay the night prior to a long bike ride. Wish we could have stayed longer and explored the area more! The host was very responsive and ensured everything was perfect. We really loved staying here!"

2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This hidden little gem was everything i had hoped for and more. A Very clean and well kept/zenful space. So many options of places to enjoy/visit that are nearby from Three Peaks Recreation Area (great hiking/mtn biking), to 2 of my very favorite National Parks (Zion & Bryce Canyon) as well as a local ski resort (Brian Head) all of which are just a short drive from this place. I highly recommend checking this place out. I already can't wait to go back!!!"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The Zen Den was perfect for our adventures hiking in Zion, Kanarraville Falls and the surrounding area. A beautiful, peaceful retreat that was clean, well organized and had every thoughtful amenity. CheyAnne is a wonderful host, we would come back again in a heartbeat! The sunrises and sunsets from the Zen Den were incredible!"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is all I could dream of for a stay away from home. It's a sublime, magical sanctuary with a view of the snow capped mountains. Every need was anticipated and more by the hosts. It's a shabby chic wonderland. I will only stay here when in Cedar City, Utah. I've stayed in many airbnb's around the world and this is 5 star hands down. Run don't walk. Well.. walk and enjoy the country life."
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place was dream-like! It was so peaceful, private, and homey that my husband and I forgot we were on vacation at times haha.

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Perfect space for my wife and I and our doggo! Suite was very clean and instantly felt like home. Great neighborhood close to many food choices and shopping.

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We really loved this place and were sorry we were only there for one night, leaving early the next morning. It was super easy to get to from the freeway and was close to services such as gas and much needed caffeine. We really loved the look of the place, it was very unique in an awesome way from other places we have stayed. It was also very clean and comfortable. We really appreciated the back yard for the dogs. Elena made sure the heat was on before we got there, so it was a perfect temperature with the rather chilly time we arrived."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Elena’s place was very conveniently located - very walkable, minutes to restaurants and groceries stores but tucked away in a quiet neighborhood. Under 10min drive to the cute, old town of Cedar City and local hikes. 20min to Kolob Canyon and 1hr from Zion.
Super clean and had all the necessary amenities. We enjoyed our stay very much! Thank you!"

2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We’re so happy we stayed at Elena’s place! The space was larger than we expected, full of charming decor touches, and overall very comfortable. It was a bit cold in the space when we first checked in, but with all the heaters going, it was warm and cozy by the time we went to bed. Definitely would stay again if we’re passing through Cedar City."

2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Elena was an excellent host! Very communicative and friendly. The space was homey, comfortable, very clean, and larger than I expected. The area was central to many restaurants and attractions in Cedar City. I would definitely stay here again."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is our second stay with Elena, and it's definitely our preferred place to stay when in town while our house is being built. Thank you so much! :)"
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Elena was very responsive and friendly. We had everything we needed for our brief stay. The place is close to the freeway and restaurants. We brought our dog and she was able to roam outside the yard which we appreciated. Zion national park is about an hour away and Bryce Canyon is about 1.5 hrs away. Both beautiful places to visit!
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,An amazing place.
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Had a great stay. Great little studio type rental. Had everything we needed. .

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"The studio is a great space and great value for the money. Elena is a gracious host, even after my pup had a behavior issue. Thanks again Elena!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"elena was very nice and accommodating for me, my boyfriend and our dog. she was very responsive and the space was super modern and clean!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Great host and a great place to stay! It was a perfect place for me to ""work from home"" while being on a roadtrip. If I'm ever in the area again, I'd come back here."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Such a great place to stay! This was perfect place for my partner and I to stay the night and check out the Cedar City downtown area.
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Thanks for the quick overnight stay. Much appreciated
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The Airbnb was in a nice part of town and is only about 45 min away from the Springdale entrance to Zion National Park. Would highly recommend!
2023-10-01,4.0,Stayed over a week,"host was friendly, kind, and especially accommodating when there was an issue with my reservation. great location on a quiet, dead end street and within walking distance to a lake and park. street parking right in front.
as another review noted, the bathroom needs a facelift - needs new paint, grout, and a deep clean at the very least.
one thing to note is there are chickens on the property so there are droppings on the walkway and yard. they freely roamed the yard during the day so i had to keep my dog on a leash to walk around the yard (since my dog can’t be trusted). host notified me they built a run for the chickens - so maybe this won’t be an issue moving forward."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Perfect location between the national parks. Elena was so quick to respond and checked in to make sure we didn’t need anything. Our small pup loved chasing the chickens around the yard in the afternoon :) highly recommend!
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great stay
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,What a beautiful place to stay! We really enjoyed ourselves and made friends with the backyard chickens.
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Elena was a wonderful host! She proactively communicated when the AirBnB wouldn't be ready for early check-in, and she made sure to take care of it herself. I appreciate all the hard work she did to get the AirBnB ready and the effort she made to communicate. It was delightful! Would 10/10 stay again."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Elena’s place was great! It was well decorated and homey, and it was clean. It seems that the space was renovated from the old garage, and it was well done. The environment felt very safe for me as a solo female traveler. It was private and easy to get into and Elena was very responsive. It was an hour long drive to Zion, so for me it was worth it to stay there and drive to and from Zion each day. Overall, it was my favorite place that I stayed on my trip out west. I definitely recommend staying here! The only critique I have is that the shower could use a little bit of a face lift but again, everything was clean and it didn’t detract from my experience. Elena was a great host and I would stay again!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Super cute and very spacious. This was a perfect hiking getaway for me and my doggo. I would absolutely stay here again.
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Cute and well appointed large open room studio apartment. It appeared even bigger than photos showed. The location was a quiet street that provided easy access to the freeway and nearby shops and restaurants and downtown (including the Shakespearean Festival) was 7 mins drive time. There were ample kitchen appliances and space for cooking and storing food as well as a large kitchen table. The yard was especially nice for my dogs. There are also a few paths and open grassy areas to walk them within a few mins. If 2 people were staying for more than a day or two they may not have many places to hang their clothes so perhaps a portable clothes rack would be helpful, but there were a few hangers provided and there are many spaces to place bags or folded clothing. There is a unit above so if you are especially sensitive to noise you may hear footsteps, but overall the place was quiet and private and had everything you’d need. Elena was friendly and I appreciate her opening her space to us."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,The location was absolutely beautiful and the space was clean and cozy. We loved our stay and would definitely stay again.
2023-09-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"Just slept there for a couple hours. Some cute touches, but not a luxury resort."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Pulled in after midnight in the rain, and left at sunrise, but it was easy to find, easy to check-in, clean, and comfortable for a good night's rest. If I came back through I'd stay again for a night or more!"
2023-08-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Perfect place for a quick trip if visiting national parks or surrounding areas. We loved exploring the Dixie national forest and Zion! We stayed here for two nights out of our 10 day vacation throughout Utah and California! Check in was easy and Elena responds quickly to messages which is helpful. I will say the bathroom and bed aren’t great. My back hurt each morning but I’m also pregnant and sensitive haha. The unit in general though is worth the price and pretty neat!
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Elena was extremely accommodating. We had an issue with checking in on the day of, but she worked really well with us. She was super friendly when we crossed paths and never seemed intrusive. Our dog loved her back yard, and we felt very comfortable the whole trip."

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Thank you so much Elena for an easy and peaceful overnight! I had no idea how much cute stuff was in Cedar City! We walked to the lake, had a short drive down to a local pizza restaurant. I was having issues with my Airbnb account and was unable to communicate with her while we were on the property, but would have loved to meet the host, she seemed incredibly sweet and was very thorough. Easy 5 star experience."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a fantastic stay at this Airbnb! The neighborhood was lovely, providing a nice atmosphere for relaxing walks.

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We really appreciated having air conditioning and a shower after our long days at an outdoor family reunion in July! The rest of my family camped, so there was lots of jealousy. 😂 There were plenty of towels, and the kitchen was clean (although we only used it to make coffee). The neighborhood is very nice and quiet, the house was easy to find, and the unit easy to access."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Awesome place to stay. Highly recommended. Very dog friendly.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I love the garden in the house. It's a peaceful and pretty town, different from heated areas in Zion Park. One plus is that the TV has Netflix, Amazon Prime, HBO accounts ready for use."

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Elana’s place was perfect for our night of passing through with our pets. Would definitely stay again
2023-07-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,"The finishes were a little rough, but could be expected for the price. The bathroom was small, and the toilet and tub were raised about 8-inches, leaving a small square of floor at regular height just as you walk in. I found it awkward. The tile got a little slick when wet, which could be dangerous combined with the awkward rise. I liked the neighborhood feel, and it was very quiet. Only a queen bed (prefer king) with light comforter. I was glad I’d brought an extra blanket. Host communicated timely and. well."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Such a lovely place to stay! Elena was considerate of my needs and a great communicator. I felt like I’d met a new friend.

It was super quiet, we couldnt hear the people above us at all. The space had everything we needed. The bed was comfy. The location was great, easy access to shops and the interstate."

2023-01-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,"Good location between Bryce and Zion. Responsive host. Any questions we had, she responded quickly and took care of any issues that came up. Decent price.
Not a lot of light at night in the backyard, but it was a good place to let the dog out. The owner has a small dog as well so there was some poop in the backyard - which is understandable. There was a dead mouse at the front of the door outside one night (perhaps left by a cat), but the owner cleaned it up quickly. They also were proactive about snow and ice on the stairs.
Since this spot is below another Airbnb rental, we heard the other guests running around above us. However, the host let the guests know that we were below them. Overall, we were happy and felt comfortable, warm, and taken care of. They also had plenty of towels and a hair dryer which was nice to warm our shoes after hiking in the snow!"
2023-01-01,3.0,Stayed with a pet,The place was perfect for the one night we were in town. The stairs leading up to the door had a bit of ice on them so keep that in mind before booking! Other than that it’s cute and a perfect stay!

2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Beautiful neighborhood, home, and backyard. Great communication with Elena and in walking distance to eateries. Our pup loved the yard and is fully fenced and shared with the main house and the upstairs unit. This is a walkout basement studio, so there is occasional noise from the upstairs unit. Overall it was a great stay! Thank you!"
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Loved staying here!
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Elena and family were very welcoming and pleasant to interact with. The house was exactly as pictured, I would say this was one of the most accurate postings I have encountered in my experience with Airbnb. Highly recommend!"
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is a great place to stay. Close to EVERYTHING! Clean, accommodating, beautiful area and Elena is a great host. 10 out of 10 stars!"
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Really lovely place to stay while we drove across the country! Great access to Zion and Bruce Canyon from this location and Elena was incredibly friendly.
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"The studio was very spacious, clean and comfortable and had everything we needed. Although we did not bring our dog, the backyard has a large green lawn that would have been perfect for her."
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Elena's place was the perfect resting spot for a night on a long road trip from Colorado to California! It had plenty of space, was easy to find, and I found a really great coffee shop on my way out of town the next day."
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Place is amazing. Everything you need is in the place. Great place if you need to be close by the freeway.
2022-07-01,2.0,Stayed with a pet,"I had a vacation planned for 6 months to visit the Utah Shakespeare festival. (I travel around the country for this hobby.) The host makes no mention of having an upstairs unit above the one I rented, and said she was dog friendly. But when he barked, for a short time while I went to the store, she suggested I take my dog with me whenever I went out. I could not leave my dog in the car in 90+ heat! to go to the grocery, the play, etc. She was worried the barking, which was short lived, could make the other tenants give her a ""bad rating"". Elena was a nice enough host, she just didn't communicate well. The space was clean, but only had a shower liner with broken rings in the bath and plastic plates, in the kitchen. For 20 bucks, she could have a shower curtain and some ceramic Walmart plates, really!? I would not recommend this unit if you have a pet while traveling."
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,This Airbnb was very clean. Had very good amenities. Well stocked kitchen. Lovely yard. Safe neighborhood. We enjoyed our stay and I would recommend this to others. It was a great stay!
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great location!
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Great location. Our standard poodle enjoyed running around the big backyard. It was the perfect size for me, my husband and our dog. We like the industrial look with comfortable furnishings. This is a bottom unit so there was some foot noise from upstairs every morning."
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Highly recommend
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"What do you want in an AirBnB? I want it to look like the pictures, be easy to find, good communication with the host, no surprises getting in, and to feel safe. And this trip I needed someone who would let me bring my cat. If you’ve ever travelled with a cat, you know that’s a BIG deal. Elena delivered on everything I could have hoped for. This is the PERFECT place. Very roomy, and it would be easy to stay for a long period. I was sad because it was only one night."
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We felt very safe and comfortable in this charming studio apartment. Beautiful, quiet and peaceful neighborhood with great parking. Loved the view out our front window of the delightful back yard. We would stay here again next time we are up this way."
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,The place was clean and as it was pictured. Elena was very timely with her responses and easy to communicate with. Would definitely stay here again.

2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The place was great and communication was top notch
2022-05-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Elena's place is very beautiful and convenient. The home in Cedar city has everything you might need in a 3 minute proximity. Also, Zion national park is 1 hour away from this home, but the drive goes by in a blink of an eye due to the beautiful scenery around you. This is a very cozy studio for two and it fit me and my wife perfectly. The host responds very quickly and is very accommodating to anything you might need during your stay. I would 100% come back here if we go to Zion National Park again."

2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We enjoyed our stay in Cedar City! Elena’s place is exactly as described in the listing. It is well-located — walking distance to the pool and nearby restaurants/shopping centers (Starbucks, Cafe Rio, Chipotle, Crumbl cookies). The place is clean, and communicating with Elena was nice and quick. She was courteous with her check-ins making sure we had everything we needed, while still giving us a sense of privacy. Merci beaucoup, Elena! We hope to visit Cedar City again in the future."
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This place is exactly as listed. We had a nice stay and the place was very comfortable. It was quiet and located in a nice area to take an after dinner walk.

Elena was a great host and checked in a few times to ensure I had everything I needed. Would definitely recommend!"
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"CAAAA-UUUTE PLACE! We loved this cozy quaint stay on this beautiful property. Private, clean, and one comfortable bed! Loved the uniqueness of the concrete walls and roll up window. Great location near the freeway and communication with Elena, our host, was great!"
2022-03-01,3.0,Stayed with a pet,"Overall the studio was very spacious and cozy considering it was a studio. The garden and the view were very nice and cozy. The location is also perfect - 30min from skiing. However, it wasn't as pretty as in pictures since it was in the garage. There is also no heating, but rather through fans. Having so many fans plugged in also caused the power to go off couple times.
Solid for a short stay :)"
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We really needed a place that would allow for dogs and Elena’s was just the place. Our puppy loved to run around the backyard.
The space accommodated us perfectly."
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Elena's place is a great stay with or without your pup. It is large, private, comfortable, well located and quiet. The host is responsive and helpful. There are steps down to the place and up to toilet and tub so anyone with mobility issues should carefully evaluate whether it meets their needs."

2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Elena’s place was the perfect stay - Nice and cozy!
,,,"Walked into what felt and looked like a model home. Very clean. Quiet neighborhood. And properly furnished/equipped with the essentials for your stay. (Could use more blankets for outside in my opinion) However, there were some things I noticed upon arrival: a broken gadget piece in the front door (which was reported to the host) and a lack of detailed instructions for unlocking/locking the door. Took a couple tries with the basic instructions provided but not the easiest to figure out, given it’s not a standard door knob. Another thing I noticed was the carpet in the rooms - very cool aesthetic but strange in my opinion as one could mistake the design as stains.. The rooms were nice but the pillows felt flat and after a day in the slopes, we wanted to sleep in comfort. The area felt safe but given the hilly location, I noticed neighbors could see down from their windows so remember to close the blinds! The backyard was beautiful, very relaxing and welcoming - we did notice someone’s car parked on the driveway so we figured someone was also in the vicinity. It wasn’t until we saw a light coming from below the deck that there was another area being occupied by someone. And mind you, we had originally booked for the “entire place” or so we thought. Overall, very clean, modern, and well-equipped place, even had a mini gym but the tire was flat on the bike."
