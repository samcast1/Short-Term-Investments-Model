The setting (a beautiful area for being outdoors) is peaceful, relaxing and a true “get away” while being conveniently located to whatever you want and need.

2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Olen's place was located in a beautiful home in a lovely neighborhood, and it just gets better when you go inside. They have given so much attention to every detail, but the centerpiece of it all is the incredibly comfortable, luxurious king sized bed! Really hated leaving that bed for the long drive home! Really appreciated the coffee and add-ins, oatmeal, hot and cold water dispenser, the detailed directions for everything and more... Thanks!"
2024-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The CCS was very quiet, clean and comfy!"
2024-04-01,4,Stayed one night,Good place
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I enjoyed my 2-night stay at Olen's place in late April. It was clean as a whistle, private, comfortable, and very peaceful. His directions to me, along with help from my GPS, were spot-on, which was important since I arrived after dark. If you're unfamiliar with Athens, I'll tell you that the entrance to Olen's subdivision is off the Jefferson Highway, just a few miles outside the bypass. It's worth noting that the house is in the very back of the subdivision, and it is among the nicest houses in the subdivision. Once I looked at the pictures and again confirmed I was at the right address, I pulled right in and parked just a few feet from the door. I didn't have any problem backing down the driveway in the morning. From Olen's, it's no more than 15-20 minutes to the heart of the UGA campus, which is what brings most folks to Athens anyway. I wouldn't hesitate to stay there again."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"Classic City Suite is super clean, very tastefully designed & decorated, and convenient to all things Athens. The neighborhood is peaceful. Olen’s lovely home is surrounded by stunning landscaping. And the bed… so very comfortable!! Highly recommend this place!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,Olen's has a great set up! We were very impressed with how well everything was laid out and the quality of everything from bedding to linens. There is a great hot/cold water dispenser that is a wonderful touch to an already impressive number of extras that are provided. The bed is very comfortable and the room very clean. We were staying in town for one night and this was the perfect place to do it!
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,My wife and I enjoyed our brief stay in the Classic City Suite. The room was exceptionally clean. Would highly recommend staying here.

2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"The Classic City Suite is the premier stay in the Athens area. Easy to access, private, cozy with all the necessary amenities. Olen really thought of everything. It will always be our first choice when visiting Athens."

2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,Honestly this was the perfect spot and it was such a peaceful stay! I enjoyed Olen’s house and it was exactly what we needed for our stay in Athens! Will definitely book again!
2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"I am an owner of 2 AirBnB beach houses. I know a little bit about this business. I must say Olen is amazing. The place was beautifully done (real plants, coffee maker, water dispenser, microwave, fridge, all the essentials (cups, creamers, etc..)). Squeaky clean. Alexa driven lights. Perfect instructions.
Loved it."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"Olen’s place is FABULOUS!!!! The photos don’t do this lovely place justice. It was so quiet and peaceful. Oh, and that bed….soooooooooo very comfortable!!! Olen himself is a fantastic host…responsive, and respectful. ⭐️⭐️🌟⭐️⭐️"

2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,Nice place just within the border of Athens-Clarke county. Quiet and not far from UGA and downtown. Not so far from Jackson county.

2024-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"Just in town over night. But the place was perfect. Had we needed them, there were restaurant recommendations on the desk. Tv had Netflix. Hope we can stay again."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"My stay here was absolutely wonderful! The bed was EXTREMELY comfortable and the whole vibe of the atmosphere was phenomenal! I really appreciated the amenities, because the night of my stay, my husband and I went to eat prior to coming to this Airbnb. In the middle of the night, I had a SERIOUS case of acid reflux, and it was so great have the mints and hot water all ready available so that I could quickly do what I could to take care of that horrible feeling. My ONLY concern was the height of the bed. I am super short and had to climb to get to the bed, but I am short so everyone obviously will not have that issue, like my husband. However, I brought that attention to Olan and I know that they will be willing to take care of that small con. The overall area was SUPER quiet and calm. The organization was great also! I will definitely be staying here again!!"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"We loved staying at the Classic City Suite! It was exactly as described on the listing and had everything we needed and more! Olen went above and beyond with the amenities. The water cooler was a nice surprise so we can have nice, purified water! The bed is huge and so nice. We will definitely be back in the future! You won’t regret booking the Classic City Suite!"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"Olen is a friendly, responsive host who sweats the details. It’s evident that he strives to make sure his guests experience the most clean and comfortable of accommodations. As frequent visitors to the Athens area, there’s a reason that The Classic City Suite is our “go-to” choice.

2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was the perfect place to stay a few nights while visiting my family. Since they live around the corner, it was really conveniently located for me. The Publix nearby and the nice fridge made it so I could eat breakfast in peace (with coffee pods provided by host!) before I went out for the day. A quiet, clean and comfortable retreat to decompress and relax after a long day with the fam!
Host gave clear instructions, friendly communication via app, and easy access for self check in/out. I’ll be back! Thanks 😊"

Olen is a friendly and responsive host. I definitely recommend staying here!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I'm happy with the stay. The neighborhood is quiet, the bed was comfortable, and the host was very clear about what was expected of me, which I appreciate. My only complaint was the desk was small, and the stool at the desk was uncomfortable for working, so I'm not sure I'd recommend it to a remote worker who intends to work from the space. Not a big enough problem to knock off a star though."

2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great stay!
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"The Classic City Suite was perfect for my husband and me. We were only in Athens overnight to see a show at the Classic Center. It was very private and secure feeling in a lovely neighborhood, attached to the house, but on the other side of the garage so quiet and private. Olen was very responsive to any requests, but also left us alone. The bed was super comfortable and the whole place was very clean. We would definitely stay there again when in Athens."

2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"Beyond perfect accommodations! After a long day sitting in a hospital, The Classic City Suite was just what the doctor ordered. Directions were easy to follow and led to a quaint, established neighborhood that had me missing my walking attire. The suite decor was superb, go DAWGS, clean, and comfortable. The coffee bar and oatmeal treats were nice extras and allowed me to stay in and not worry about dinner or breakfast. I look forward to booking again!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The neighborhood is peaceful, the unit is clean, parking is available, the restroom smells good and most of all they got everything that you need for your short stay."

2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,Olen is a terrific host—everything was well-done and every need anticipated. Olen was quick to respond and in fact was proactive in communicating. The neighborhood is beautiful and peaceful.

2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great stay! Clear instructions, Great communication, very comfortable bed, and easy process for check in and check out"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"I had an amazing stay! I stayed for one night with my mom and the airbnb was exactly as pictured and described. In addition, it was very clean!! As someone who dislikes how hotel sheets (especially pillow cases!) and towels can be dirty and full of lint, you will NOT find that here. The bed, bath, closet, and overall area was very clean. I'd also like to note that when waking up, neither my mom or I, woke up with that stuffy grimy feeling you get when you stay at some hotels (or even some airbnbs) which was great! Lastly, we did wake up very early around 6am and i had messaged Olen a question and i was nervous i might have texted too early to the point i might have not gotten a response before checkout but Olen was able to immediately respond! Overall, totally recommend Olen's place and he was a good host."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,This is such a nice place! Safety is my main concern when traveling and I felt so secure in their home. Extremely clean with great decor. Had everything I needed and very comfortable. Would absolutely stay here again. Thank you!

2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Luxurious room, gorgeous neighborhood, and fantastic hosts!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Had a lovely stay at the Classic City Suites…it was a 7 minute drive from Bishop Park where I was exhibiting as an artist. I’m super picky about decor and linens as a designer and everything in Olen’s place felt clean and modern.
I’m an AWFUL car backer-outter as it turns out so next time I may just park on the road, but that’s my own issue lol. The extra touches were nice (fridge/micro/coffee and creamer/makeup wipes) and checkout instructions were clear and easy. Would highly recommend for someone just needing a soft landing place to sleep between activities!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"Perfect, relaxing cozy stay on a road trip! Loved it. It was spotless and charming. He had everything I needed and beyond. ❤️ highly recommend"

2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,Great relaxing place to stay. Easy to find and easy to check in. Everything was clean and exactly as pictured. Would stay again if in town.
2023-04-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Great stay, but knocking off a star for underwhelming internet speeds and cell service which wasn’t good for a remote worker like me who always need to be connected. Shower also had hair from someone else. I’ve also never seen check out rules where the host threatens to leave guests a negative review because they don’t remove a pillow case and put it in the laundry. Usually that is the hosts’ responsibility. Otherwise, the bed was pretty comfy."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,Great
2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"If you're ever in the area, I would definitely recommend staying at Olen's listing, it is beautiful and peaceful. The interior design is stunning and the price is something you cannot beat. I know that I'll be coming back if I'm ever in Athens again."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,The room was incredibly clean and felt like home away from home. Would love to stay again.
2023-04-01,3,Stayed one night,It was a good stay everything was clean and well described as pictures it’s more of a good way to stay with your significant other if you don’t wanna go out when going out everything is a little far including food places but over all good stay also A little more stricter then most air bnb stays
2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,It was a beautiful room and perfect for what I needed.
2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,Great place to stay at. Very stylish and clean. Also a nice neighborhood to go for a walk. We can only recommend staying with Olen and Melissa✨
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Overall fantastic stay!
2023-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"Really could not have been better. Very modern and clean room with equally clean bathroom. Everything available (water cooler, coffee, q-tips, cotton balls, soft toilet paper, etc)! Bed was super comfortable and nice made up. Towels were even awesome. Can’t think of any improvements. About 100% chance I will stay again!"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Second time staying here and it was perfect once again. The bed is so comfortable and the suite is extremely clean. Definitely a hidden gem that is always booked out. Very affordable and will be back whenever it’s available.

I recommend them 100% ❤️"

2023-03-01,5,Stayed one night,Absolutely wonderful place for a visit in Athens!! Extremely well decorated and appointed. Book it!
2023-03-01,5,Stayed one night,1
2023-03-01,5,Stayed one night,Beautiful and clean place! Felt like a room at a resort.
2023-03-01,5,Stayed one night,The suite is just as shown and the bed was super comfy. It is in a quiet residential neighborhood. The only problem we had was there is a large curb at the end of the driveway and it scrapped along the bottom of my car when pulling in and out. I drive a small car and an SUV would not be affected. We were in town for a college visit and if our child decides to go to UGA I would definitely stay here again.
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The place was perfect for a getaway and I would definitely book again if I am in the area!
2023-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great stay! It was a bit farther from the campus/downtown Athens than I realized but still worked well for our quick trip. Clean, cute, private. Would stay again!"

2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Incredibly clean and quiet stay! Would definitely recommend.
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is a beautiful space! Lovely, private neighborhood. If you’re a light sleeper like me, you’ll appreciate how quiet it is here. The space was clean, the bed is comfy, and we loved the water cooler for fresh water that wasn’t from a tap. The owners have dogs, but we never heard them make a peep."
2023-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"This place was exactly how it looks in the pictures and even better. It was clean and all the amenities in the apartment was what I needed such as a microwave refrigerator, and a coffee maker and water fountain. Toiletries where in abundance and the bed was very comfortable. I enjoyed watching the Roku TV and I enjoyed having Alexa to command lol."
2023-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"My friend and I loved our stay here! From start to finish, the whole process/place was perfect for the two of us. The bed was super comfy, everything was clean, and we felt right at home here. Definitely recommend!"
2023-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"My stay at Olen’s place was great! It’s extremely clean, peaceful and quiet! I appreciate the detailed instructions and the layout of the overall space.

2023-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"What a beautiful place. It was immaculate! The decor is beautiful and has everything you need. Water, coffee, oatmeal. Olen is so responsive. Great communication with him. We were there just one night for business purposes just for one night and it was perfect. Thank you for the hospitality."
2023-01-01,5,Stayed one night,Very convenient and nice room!
2023-01-01,5,Stayed one night,Great place and stay!
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Olen's place was beautiful! in a lovely neighborhood 10-15 minutes from downtown Athens by car. Communication was great. Coffee bar was a nice surprise!
2023-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"Clean, comfortable, and safe… just what this lone traveler needed."
2023-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"I had a great time at this place. The communication was super easy and quick and the place looks exactly like it does on the pictures. And everything was super clean.
I definitely recommend it!"
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"It was just as it was in the description, it was a good experience"
2023-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"Olen’s place was amazing! It was very peaceful and homely, is in a super nice location, and was very clean! He was very responsive and gave awesome recommendations when I asked about local places to try out. 10/10!"
2023-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"Very clean and beautiful room.
Check in was very easy, close to downtown and easy to Uber.
He has a little more rules than other Airbnb’s but it made me feel comfortable that he puts in so much effort for his guests. The little things like make up remover wipes, q-tips, cottons balls, etc, shows he anticipates his guests needs."
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,It’s was a really nice stay.
2022-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"This was a perfect spot to stay for when we were in Athens. It's in a nice, quiet location that's not too far out from downtown. It was clean, had everything we needed and had the perfect amount of room for us. We would definitely consider staying here again in the future."
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I have stayed here several times. It is always a great place to stay.
2022-12-01,5,Stayed one night,Comfortable & cozy!
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Perfectly accurate description. Immaculately clean. Luxurious linens on bed and in path. Super quiet. As many amenities as you could comfortably pack into one bedroom. Super Host!
2022-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Clean and fresh room. It smelled amazing, some may not like that who are sensitive to fragrance but we loved it. The bed was super comfy! I also appreciated the easy to use Roku. Thoughtful touches from decor to necessities you may have forgotten were stocked. We weren't comfortable with the Alexa we had to use for lighting because we don't use that in our home, but it's probably a great touch for others. Olen was kind and communicative. Follow the rules and you will enjoy your stay."
2022-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"If you’re looking for a well kept, extremely clean, comfortable and safe stay- look no further. This well appointed suite is located in a quiet neighborhood; if you’re lucky, you’ll see a deer or two. Classic City Suite is an Athens gem. Thanks again for a great stay, Olen!"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I really enjoyed my stay here! The host provided a clean environment as well as extra touches that I appreciated such as a coffee station and makeup wipes. I think my only note would be that the location is a bit father out of town than I was anticipating. It took approximately 15-20 mins during peak hours to get to downtown Athens. I only saw the host once which, in my opinion, is how I prefer my Airbnb stays to go aka fairly private. The room was decked out in Athens decor which I loved. I would stay again!"
2022-10-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Very clean! Nice neighborhood. We saw deer when we drove into the neighborhood at night. Olen was super responsive. The room is attached to his house so you can hear some noises from the house but we didn’t mind that. If you are traveling alone it might be reassuring to know someone is so close by. It has its own entrance on the side. The room is small but comfortable. We were out & about all day so the size didn’t matter to us. You definitely need a car to get to town.
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"So, this was a solo stay as I was int own for a conference and wanted to avoid the 1.5 hour drive to and from my home for three days. This ended up being a fantastic choice for me, as the location is perfect, feeling far enough from the city and also so close to everything. The neighborhood is absolutely adorable and there is plenty of wildlife and walking nearby if that is something you are interested in. The amenities are exactly as presented as well as extra little touches that I didn't know I needed. The room was spectacularly clean, as I am somewhat of a germaphobe, and the bed/ linens/ and mattress were amazing. I would recommend this property to anyone I now and will also keep it as my first option when visiting Athens again. Also, the owner was very easy to communicate with, and while I did not have any problems during my stay, I would have felt comfortable enough to reach out with any needs."
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Very clean, quiet and comfortable. We would definitely stay here again!
Thanks Olen"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"Could not have asked for a better overnight stay for my boyfriend and I. It was a quick decision to stay the night in Athens as we were driving, and Olen was so quick to respond when we needed a place. The rate was great and the environment was clean, safe, and well-stocked. Nice showers, good wifi, roku tv, and comfy bed as well! Definitely suggest for anyone coming to Athens!"
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great place, felt very much like a quality hotel room while being only a fraction of the cost."

I arrived really late so my stay was short but I have no complaints and would recommend to anyone looking to book."
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Place was beautiful and very clean. Olen was responsive to every message I sent. The place was a bit further from campus than I thought it would be, but it worked out.
*FYI - if you have an aversion or allergies to fragrances, this might not work for you. It smelled good to me (plug ins I presume?), but may be too fragrant for those with allergies."

2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Just WOW! A beautiful room in a beautiful home in a nice secluded secluded neighborhood. The king size bed is firm for the back with a great pillow top for the comfort. The towels are thick and luxurious. There is a fridge, microwave, water cooler, and Keurig with all the makings for a nice cup of coffee and even oatmeal if you want. The host was very accommodating and responsive. What a wonderful place to stay."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Room was perfect! Had everything I needed plus some nice added touches. Host was great and very accommodating to my needs! Would stay here again!

2022-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Olen’s place is the quintessential private room, where you have everything you need in your own private space that is truly private, no walking through shared spaces or using a shared bathroom, it felt like my own place! Bed was extremely comfortable, and I had an excellent stay. Thanks!"
2022-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Such a great place to stay! So close to downtown Athens, host was excellent about reservation, check-in and check-out, and the room was so comfortable and clean. Hands down would book again if coming through Athens, GA. Thanks, Olen!"

2024-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"Enjoyed our stay, cute place and very very close to the Georgia Theatre— only a couple minute walk. Thank you Shirley!"
2024-04-01,4,Stayed one night,"I thoroughly enjoyed my stay at Shirley's place. It was very peaceful and calm. I was actually in Athens to take a professional exam and my stay attributed to the calm energy I had to take my exam! I later found out that I passed at the professional level!! YAY!
My ONLY and I mean ONLY con to this stay was the parking situation. I am so glad I know the area so I knew exactly where to go/shortcuts. The parking suggested by Shirley was at least a block away. I know for
most that would not be a problem, but this AirBNB is in the city of Athens. I could imagine feeling unsafe walking to/from the parking deck with a bunch of bags late at night or early in the morning as a solo traveler. Although I was given the option to put the emergency lights and pick up my stuff upon check out due to me asking if I could do so, when I checked in, I walked with big bags to the AirBNB and I did not appreciate that. Thank goodness it did not rain like it had planned to..
Other than that...GREAT STAY!!"
2024-04-01,4,Stayed with kids,"Perfect location close to everything. Parking was nearby and had no issues. Some loud noise for college students late at night kept us up some, but to be expected in a college area. We enjoyed our stay and had no issues getting into the building or out of the building. Was clean and just like the pictures. We always stay at one of Shirley's listing and haven't been disappointed yet."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"Easy, clean, and convenient; all you need for a place to stay!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Loved staying in Athens. Only thing i disliked was the view out the windows was a brick wall. Place was very clean and reasonably quiet. Location was great. Host was very easy to work with. Would love to visit Athens again!
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great place, great stay. Only hassle is parking. Don’t love paid parking as the only option but I guess that’s the train off of being downtown."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,Conveniently located to everything and anything. I loved the fan next to the bed for noise and air!
2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"Ms. Shirley is the perfect example of an Airbnb host… the unit was spotless and adorable. She laid out precise, clear instructions on how to gain access and find the apartment. The location is great - you are within walking distances to great restaurants, lots of shopping and entertainment, or if you are visiting the college, walking distance to the college and football field as well."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,This is a perfect place for an Athens trip! Right in the middle of everything. Great value. Shirley is an awesome host!

Easy to find and access with good security, and the hosts provided everything we needed with a few nice touches like toiletries and coffee accessories. The walls were a little thin as might be expected in an apartment building, but we put on a little white noise and slept soundly."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"It’s not very big, but it has everything you need and it couldn’t be in a better location if you want to take advantage of the downtown area.

Shirley, the host gave great instructions on how to get to and inside the condo. Target is right next door so it was super convenient for grocery shopping. The condo itself was the perfect size and extremely quiet for a condo in the city. The furniture was comfy and clean. There is also a nice area across the street to walk your pups!

2023-04-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Don't book this location if you like natural sunlight and a view. It has neither. Also thought there was an outdoor space available to use on top of the building, but that was not the case. Other than that, it was a nice stay, and knowing what I know now, I would probably book again, but with those factors in mind."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great location and great stay! My fiancé and I stayed for less than 24 hours but it was so nice having a close by, comfy home to sleep in. Great walking distance from the Civic Center and to lots of bars and restaurants! Lots of space for the 2 of us. Perfect stay!"

2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"It’s all true about the location! Once we parked, we walked everywhere until we left. We came for a show at the Ga Theater, which is a literal stones throw, and enjoyed walking around downtown beforehand. The unit is well done and comfortable, and after an initial cleaning hiccup, was spic and span. It’s a busy area so you’re going to have some traffic noise, sirens, etc bleed in from outside but it wasn’t bad at all. We enjoyed ourselves and will recommend this unit to our friends."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Shirley’s place was as nice as described and the location is fantastic. I didn’t need a car for my whole stay. The bed was a highlight, as it was super comfy with nice linens. If I ever return to Athens, I will definitely stay there again."

2024-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"Originally had a local hotel booked for a college visit trip to Athens. At the last minute I found some recent reviews that were concerning. I panicked and began looking for another hotel. At the late date, I couldn’t find any to accommodate our party in a similar price range to my original booking. I turned to Airbnb and found Michael and Suzanne’s listing. After reading all of the wonderful reviews, I booked! We were so relieved to arrive and find that everything was exactly as described and most importantly, safe, private and clean. The hosts were very responsive to my couple of inquiries upon check in. The stay was very comfortable and the hosts had truly anticipated most any need a guest could have - impressively even up to stadium bags if you were going to a game. I shared with all our DAWG family and I hope we get the chance to stay again!"

2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is a hidden gem! I usually stay in downtown Athens and I enjoyed the change of scenery. Most notably, I slept well, felt safe and had the privacy of my own home away from home. I enjoyed driving in looking at all the historic homes and having my car right outside the living room as I headed out each day opposed to a parking garage downtown or hotel parking. Gusto down the road, TJMaxx and Orange Theory is a perk too! ☺️ I look forward to another stay."

2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We checked into the “Dawg Suite” late afternoon on July 20 for a 4 night stay. Directions were perfect and check-in was easy. The neighborhood was beautiful and the “suite” was as pictured. We unloaded our vehicle, put food in the fridge, and started to put our clothes away when a storm started to blow in and intensify with 70 mph winds. Power was knocked out. This is when the best part of our stay began as Suzanne reached out to us and kept us up to date on the prognosis for power restoration. It would be 24 hours before power was restored but communication from Suzanne was exemplary, making sure we were ok. The suite was clean and comfortable. The shower was forceful and hot (once the power was restored). The 5 Points location made all our destinations easy to get to. Suzanne and Michael went “above and beyond” during a difficult situation. Kudos to you both."

2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place is really great and checks all the important ‘Excellent Airbnb’ boxes: SUPER comfortable bed, like all-around top notch, Smart TVs that are easy to work, towels that are quite possibly the best thing I’ve ever smelled, (I want to know this laundry magic!) make-up towels, an excellent shower with lots of hot water, enough decorations so it feels homey without feeling like someone’s home, and a well-stocked kitchen with Brita water (nice!) and snacks and laundry machines. Oh and it smells really good, too!
Stay here and you can be one of the first to discover this new Athens gem!"
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Michael and Suzanne are great hosts! They made sure I had everything I needed and that check in was easy . The cottage is well appointed and has a very comfortable feel. The location is perfect , you are close to so many great restaurants and activities that take place on the campus of UGA. I will definitely be booking another stay in the future. Go Dawgs!!"
2021-08-01,5,Stayed about a week,"This suite is lovely. It is located in a very convenient neighborhood that is near to grocery stores, restaurants and shopping. It is very quiet and private. The unit was clean and had a well-stocked kitchen that contained a washer and dryer that was very helpful. Rest was easy on a comfortable bed. It was a perfect place to stay for a work trip in Athens. Michael and Suzanne responded rapidly with any requests or questions we had. They are gracious, attentive, and hospitable hosts. I would definitely stay here again."
2021-07-01,5,Stayed one night,The guesthouse was great! It has everything we needed at a great location.
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,This was a comfortable space for a one night stay! Close to UGA and downtown Athens. The mosaic pieces and other artistic touches made it unique! I loved the tea/coffee station with a filtered water tap!
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This cozy studio was completed thoughtfully with all necessary amenities. We throughly enjoyed the garden with Krysia’s outdoor art as well as the vibrant interior of the studio.
She made wonderful suggestions for enjoying Athens based on our interests.
Highly recommend."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,I had a very comfortable and cozy stay. The garden and the surrounding was very beautiful. I loved the greenery. The host was awesome and kind.

2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Colorful and comfortable place. I enjoyed my stay.
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"My husband and I were nervous about going on a road trip with our puppy but Krysia’s place made it a great experience—from the flexible check-in time to Krysia’s responsiveness to questions and messages. I especially enjoyed the lovely flowers and garden! A couple hours after leaving, we noticed that we accidentally left something behind and messaged Krysia who let us know that she found the items and would mail it back to us. We are grateful to have been able to stay at such a cute and convenient place with our pup!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Krysia’s place is a throwback to the days when flower power and the B52s ruled Athens. You can easily walk to downtown and the University of Georgia campus. The wildflowers are beautiful and the city is very interesting. It’s not a modern industrial Airbnb, but a homey comfortable place. I liked it a lot."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"This was a beautiful place! The garden and kitties were lovely, plenty of parking, and Krysia’s art garden and mosaics are gorgeous. She was very accommodating to our needs, and had everything we needed and more. Really liked the touch of the available sparkling water! Want to come back and stay longer!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,Communication and location were both excellent. Krysia’s place is very quirky and artistic. Easy to find and just a 15 minute walk to downtown Athens. We were only there one night but we had everything we needed. The shower wasn’t the most powerful or cleanest we’ve ever had but it wasn’t an issue for the night we stayed. Would stay again if we were passing through Athens again.
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,Krysia’s place was great! Had everything I needed for a comfortable stay. She was very communicative and understanding. Would highly recommend. Thank you!
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The space was so cozy & clean. Krysia took the time to think of anything you could need . Filtered water , beverages stocked in the fridge . The bathroom is beautiful. I fell in love with the art pieces. Out back was so peaceful & decorated with more beautiful art pieces . It was only a 10 - 12 min drive to Trader Joe’s ; and other stores . My wife & I both said we would Love to visit again. It felt so relaxing & secluded; we really didn’t want to leave . ✨"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Awesome location very close to the action of downtown Athens but on a quiet street. This place has everything you need and nothing you don't. Krysia has done a thoughtful job of curating the things you will like such as coffee pods, creamer etc... It's not a large space but it works just fine. She was a great host who communicated very promptly and was easy to work with. Five stars!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Always a “5 STAR” stay! The garden / yard of flowers were delightful to look at while having my morning coffee :)

2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,Place was as described—cute and cozy—and Krysia was very responsive.
2024-04-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"This was ultimately a lovely stay. The host obviously takes great care of their guests and space, and left very detailed notes and instructions. The space is well appointed with a lot of nice touches including filtered water, cold sparkling water in the fridge, fans, etc.! The biggest drawback of our stay: there is central air conditioning, but the guests cannot control the temperature, and instead have to message the host to request adjustments. The host was very responsive, however it was pretty warm outside during our stay and even with the fans provided and requests to turn the AC cooler, the room was uncomfortably hot almost the entire duration of our stay. We would stay again, but only during the fall/winter :)"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,Cozy spot near downtown Athens
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,This was a lovely place for a quick stay. The art everywhere was fantastic! ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a wonderful time in Athens and enjoyed our stay at Krysia’s. She is an artist and had a garden party displaying her work the weekend we were there. She informed me of the event beforehand and even invited us! There were zero problems with parking (had our own space without issue even with the event). The room was large enough for the two of us for the weekend. The small refrigerator, microwave and assortment of tea and cold bubbly water was very welcoming for a short stay. The room was clean and well equipped. I would definitely stay with Krysia again!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,Awesome place! The artistic touches make it a warm and inviting place to stay. Krysia is a great host and was proactive in communicating about checking in and out.

2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Always a peaceful and comfortable stay at Krysia’s AirB&B :)))
2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"I feel like if I really tell ya'll how wonderful this place is then the secret will be out and I won't be able to book it when I pass back through Athens! It's beyond in every way. Location, safety, beauty, ease, amenities, and the most amazing vibes from the art, mosaics and room decor. I'm a single woman traveling cross country and this was BY FAR the best stay I've had. I walked to town twice and walked on the nearby trails to enjoy the river and the woods. I felt extremely safe and tended to and Krysia had lots of recommendations for fun and live music and creative play time. The value of this space is extra awesome. You won't regret this stay. Cheers and thanks Krysia. I hope to stay again sometime."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,I can’t say enough good things about this Air BnB. Krysia has created a magical space. Her artwork and style shines everywhere you look. Super comfortable and amazing location. I loved it here!

2024-01-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Great place that was better than the description. I would consider this an entire (studio) apartment vs just a room in a house. Private entrance and all the amenities needed. Host was extremely helpful also. Will stay again.
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,great guest room in the heart of downtown athens
2024-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"I can't believe I was lucky enough to stay here. The house itself is adorable! A historic home that's been artfully renovated with warm, fun colors yet keeping true to the original charm, like the hardwood floors and doorknobs. The bathroom is brand new, immaculate, the tile floor is a stunning piece of art, plenty of extra towels and to, great water pressure, fast hot water, good lighting. The art! The queen bed was comfy and there is even a small kitchen-like area. Noise from outside wasn't noticable. I easily walked to and from campus from here. The wifi was plenty fast for streaming videos and video calls. So many small details were accounted for (3 different phone chargers provided, drinks in the fridge, a dedicated filtered water line! 5 star treatment!) And best of all, Krysia is a gem of a person - so conscientious and a top notch communicator. I can't recommend this place enough. Oh, and all of this for a steal of a price without a gounging high cleaning fee. Book this!!"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"She was great, the place had everything you could need. Really great, I’d stay again."
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The space was beautiful, and Krysia was an amazing host."
2024-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"I adored this stay. The pictures accurately show what you can expect but still leave room for you to be impressed. The suite is thoughtfully furnished and stocked with everything you need to be comfortable. Having a space heater available was extremely considerate and appreciated! It's within a 5 minute drive to campus, a 5 minute walk to the greenway and local parks, and a quick access point to anything you're looking to do in Athens."
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I had such a lovely and peaceful stay here. It was very cozy and was super happy there was a small oven there to warm up leftovers. Five stars!!
2024-01-01,5,Stayed one night,Great stay
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This was a fantastic stay! The newly installed handrail enabled me to go up the two stairs with no issues. I have some physical disabilities that causes balance issues and I really appreciated the walk in shower. I loved the filtered water and the universal phone charger. The place was decorated so cute and the garden is lovely. Krysia is very responsive and helpful. I hope to stay here next time I come to Athens.
2023-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"Krysia's place is the ideal room for a night in Athens. Clean, convenient, and eclectic."

2023-12-01,4,Stayed one night,"My Guest and I loved the inside the place , especially the bathroom. She had everything you need and some. The only thing that was a problem and out of our control was the driveway the host made, it’s kind of a dip. But other than that she was great. We didn’t go in the garden due to it just being there for one night. The restaurant she recommended mamas boy was great too."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed one night,Krysia was wonderful and accommodating and made my stay very pleasant. I was able to have a great graduation experience thanks to her
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This was our second time staying with Krysia. We love this spot — Krysia embodies the best of what hospitality can be & makes me think fondly about the good-ol’-days of Airbnb where it was about human connection & exploring new space. Krysia is welcoming, kind, respectful, and full of great recommendations!
Great price for a super cozy, private room & bathroom. Walkable to downtown Athens; I spent most of the day on foot. The kitchenette is so functional — we prepped food to bring and heat up to save some money by not eating out every meal. Make sure to visit the beautiful backyard & keep your eyes posted for Krysia’s art all around town.
If you’re looking for a comfy hideaway for your next trip to Athens, stay here. Especially if you have a doggie!"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Krysia’s place was just perfect for our weekend! It was located close to the downtown area but was in a quiet neighborhood. The room was well stocked and had everything we needed. Krysia herself was just so sweet and understanding.
2023-12-01,5,Stayed one night,We had a great cozy stay!
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The place is so charming and cozy. Would totally stay there again - just a hop and a jump away from the 40 Watt and the Georgia Theatre; what more could you want?!
2023-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"Krysia’s lovely haven was one of my favorite AirBnb stays I’ve ever had! Such a charming and colorful space. Very clean and tidy, lovely bathroom and shower. The tile is gorgeous!Krysia was also super kind and accommodating. Overall fantastic experience!"

We easily walked to downtown from here where there are many shops, restaurants and nightclubs to enjoy. There’s a beautiful park nearby as well the entrance to the firefly trail. The whole yard is one amazing garden with beautiful plants and gorgeous mosaics everywhere. We have stayed here many times and will definitely be back whenever we are back visiting family and friends."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Clean and cool mosaic art to look at
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Krysia was very welcoming and friendly, and the room had everything needed for a comfortable stay. The place is a stone's throw away from Broad Street where you find nice restaurants and things to do. I traveled with my labradoodle Sasha, and she was also very welcomed by Krysia."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"Wonderful host and house with lots of character, priced exceptionally well for the location."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Great location and host

2023-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"The Art House was great for our one night stay! It is a beautiful room, decorated in a cool and unique way. This definitely is the Art House. The space had everything we needed. And there were some nice extras with a mini-fridge, microwave and toaster oven. Great room at a great price.
The location is great for Athens. We could walk to downtown if we wanted to.
Krysia is a great host. She answered all my questions ahead of time. We very much appreciate the extras she had in the room for us. And she took care of us after we had left when we found we had left an item behind. She is a super host."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed one night,Great place to stay for a quick over night! Very comfortable and clean!
2023-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"I absolutely loved this location and Krysia's hosting! She was very communicative and easy to message. I liked that the location is quiet and out of downtown, but still in walking distance to downtown. The apartment, although small, had absolutely everything you needed. Krysia clearly put a lot of thought and care into her place with all the little touches (noise machine, optional nightlight, tea and coffee, charger, etc)."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"My spouse and I needed a place to lay our heads after a concert at the Georgia Theater, and this was literally perfect. We didn’t need anything more than a bed and a bathroom, and this was that plus the serotonin boost my artist and gardener brain needed! Also want to add, while the space is small, it doesn’t feel tight at all and we really appreciated the filtered water tap and kitchenette. Sad I didn’t meet the kitties, but I’ll definitely save this location for future Athens trips, especially in Spring or Summer when all the beautiful flowers are in bloom! :)"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Nice little private space for a quick one night stop. Responsive host. I appreciated the filtered water tap, and the decent internet."

Thanks for not having a tv in the bedroom.
It was nice to just chill."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"Krysia was a very friendly and accommodating host and this place could not have fitted my needs more perfectly. I was in town for a concert and just needed a place to crash for the night. Krysia’s cozy and colorful little place was the ideal and most comfortable way to get a good night’s sleep. I especially loved the decor of the bedroom, featuring funky and visually captivating works of art. It was also very close to downtown Athens, so if anyone is looking for a nice place to stay nearby, I would definitely recommend Krysia’s place."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"Really enjoyed my overnight stay in Krysia’s cute, funky space. I enjoyed the wild beauty of her peaceful garden, a nice peaceful urban space for enjoying nature. The bed was comfy. Fridge and microwave available. Bathroom impeccably clean. In close distance to the campus, coffee shops, delicious food, and bookstores. Krysia was very patient and helpful when I had questions, “Like how do I get this garden gate open?” Lol. Responds almost immediately. I would definitely stay at Krysia’s again."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"Lovely spot in a great location.
Great hosts ♥️"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,Amazing room! Perfect access and close to downtown
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Krysia’s place is delightful, and the location is fantastic! I enjoyed two peaceful nights with everything I needed right there in the room/bathroom. There is even a little spigot of filtered water! The location is very close to downtown Athens, and the trip is walkable that’s your jam.
If you’re a longtime Air BnB fan, Krysia’s room will remind you of how things “used to be” - personal, thoughtful, and welcoming. I highly recommend it!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,What a cute place! Very walkable to downtown. I visited for a show at the classic center and walked there and home and felt safe the whole time. Clean and lots of extra amenities. Thank you again for a great stay!
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,My 2nd time here. One of the best values in Athens. This place is a half mile walk into downtown and off the beaten path enough for a restful night sleep. So many thoughtful amenities and really comfortable bed. You won't be disappointed!
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Krysia was a great host! It was the perfect setup for our quick trip to Athens. We had a nice walk through the nearby park to a local brunch spot and enjoyed the garden and art. We’d be happy to stay here again.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Krista's place is delightful. Loved all the thoughtful touches like the filtered water and electric kettle. The garden was great for morning tea and my dog loved exploring the area. Very close to parks, trails, and downtown."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Such a great place and awesome location
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I had a wonderful stay at Krysia's! I arrived on a rainy evening, so it was so nice to walk into such a warm, inviting space of brilliant colors, beautiful art, and high ceilings.
Though the space is adjacent to the house, it's very private and it mostly felt like I was in a house by myself. I slept great! The space had everything I needed, from a desk to a space heater and perhaps the best tea selection I've ever had in an airbnb.
The location is ideal: Quiet and peaceful with trails nearby, yet a quick walk up the hill and there I was in the heart of historic downtown Athens.
Krysia's communication was superb both leading up to check-in and during my stay. We got to meet in person once and it was lovely chatting with her.
And her art garden is amazing! I'd love to stay at Krysia's again next time I'm in Athens."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Love the art and the location.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,What a cute little spot. Exactly as described. We loved all the artwork. We would love to come back.
2023-10-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Krysia’s artful place was decorated beautifully with her own personal art. The room was perfect for our short stay to watch the Dawgs play. A short distance Uber drive to the stadium (3-4 min). Krysia was also very nice. The room had an oscillating AC tower which worked since the nights were cooler. Krysia did cut the thermostat down in the main house during the day to help cool the room down. We would stay again. Thank you Krysia!
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Krysia’s place was cute and cozy! It was close to all the places I was intending to visit. And I felt very safe coming and going. I wish I spent more time in Athens to actually enjoy her garden, but my visit was short."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"Super comfy room for a one night stay after a concert at the Georgia Theater. Lots of nice little amenities that you wouldn't even get at a hotel (much more colorful too). I wish I checked out the garden but I had to leave early in the morning.
Unfortunately the walk to downtown is entirely uphill... that's really the only complaint and it's not at all the fault of the property 😅"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"Easy to access, convenient location, private, very clean and comfortable. I’ll definitely try and stay here again!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Thank you for the stay! We were able to relax and I loved walking to the park in the morning.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"We loved our stay at Krysia's place, as first timers to Athens, it was a perfect landing spot! The art garden was magical, the space was quiet, and we appreciated all of the thoughtful details she'd considered. We were able to be entirely on foot, exploring trails and the amazing bike path, walking downtown for drinks at the best queer bar we've ever been to, followed by a great dinner and a punk show- special shout out to Sister Louisa's and the 40 Watt Club! 10/10 we'd definitely stay here again!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,Great stay!
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,One of our favorite spots to stay when visiting Athens. We will be back! Thank you!!

2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,Had a great time staying here for a UGA game. Walking distance to downtown and the stadium.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Krysia was a wonderful host! Her room was neat and tidy. We loved the filtered water and the ice in the tray! That seems so small, but it was a hot day and cold ice with filtered water was the best thing we could have asked for. 😀"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"Cozy room, perfect and convenient for my stay in Athens. Thanks!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Krysia’s place was very charming and had so many small thoughtful touches (chargers, hair dryer, sound machine, ice in the freezer, etc). It was very clean, and just what I was hoping for. She clearly has put a lot of consideration into making this a great space for guests. 😃"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Perfect for a quick stopover on a longer road trip - easy checkin, beautiful flowers and art garden, restful spot. Great communication, no issues. Would stay here again!"

2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,One of the most detailed and artistic Airbnb I've been to.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"I had an outstanding experience during my stay! Krysia is extremely friendly and helpful.
The place is immaculate, well-kept, and beautiful. The surroundings are very peaceful and full of nature and close to everything. I highly recommend staying at her home, and I assure you that you will have an incredible experience!"

2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"This place is cozy, artsy and has lots of character. It's about a 20 minute walk from downtown. Great affordable stay for a single or couple in Athens!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,It was a pleasure staying in your home. It was very convenient to get to UGA for my son's college orientation. Thank you.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"Honey, comfortable and great energy abound!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Krysia's place was just what I needed: a comfortable and stylish place to stay for the night, for a great deal. If I ever come through Athens again, I'll be sure to seek this place for me and my pup."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"No tv, but heck for a 2-day stay, you can use your computer.
Very convenient to tranquil walking trails (I saw a deer - in Athens!) and to the convention center. Quiet neighborhood."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,Spotless. Utterly charming and unique. Many special touches.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Nice stay, would stay here again."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"This was a return stay at Art House and Garden, after 3+ years. There were some changes to the room, all positive, and the first place I've ever been to that supplied a white noise machine. It was the real thing, too -- mechanical and not electronic. I don't use them at home, but always want one when traveling, so very nice touch. The mosaics everywhere are beautiful, and especially in the bathroom floor."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,Such a creative space. This place has lots of amenities. Krysia put a lot of thought into the space.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"I am so glad I found Krysia’s cute Airbnb! It is close to downtown Athens. It’s soooo clean. The bed was very comfortable. The bathroom was clean and so cute (totally want to have a bathroom now with beautiful tiled floors). The mini kitchen has everything you need. It’s easy to get in. Very spacious. We felt comfortable - it was perfect. I will say it was almost 100 degrees outside and I was afraid the room would be hot, but the temp in the room was absolutely perfect. The fan is glorious and gives off lots of air. We will definitely try to stay here again, but I’m pretty sure it’s booked for a long time!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"One of the coolest places I've stayed, it's clearly an artist's space and Krysia uses that space to create a warm, comfortable and welcoming environment. Comfortable bed and pillows, spacious room and local guides make the room ideal for a long weekend. The art garden showcases her work in glass, and is well worth a visit. Based on my brief time, this is a perfect Athens space for an Athens visit."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Krysia's apartment is cozy and comfy, and very close to downtown Athens. Over the last year, we have stayed at several airbnbs, and Krysia's place is by far the most colorful, unique, and interesting yet. There is beautiful art hanging in the room, and I would argue that the tile in the bathroom is a work of art as well. The bed is comfortable, if a bit squeaky. We had everything we needed for a quick stay in Athens. Krysia is an excellent hostess, considerate and communicative, and has created a really beautiful space."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"Cozy, colorful and comfortable location near Firefly Trail/Dudley Park and the North Oconee Greenway. An easy walk up to restaurants and UGA."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Krysia was a great communicator! The place was spotless and comfortable, and super cute to boot! Perfect for what we needed, a peaceful place to relax after being in the mountains for a few days. Would definitely stay again next time we’re in Athens."

2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Another peaceful and comfortable stay at Krysia’s :)))
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Krysia's place was exactly as described. It had a private entrance with everything necessary for a quick weekend of work. Having the screen door was great if I wanted more sunlight and the sound of birds. The garden area was a bit unkempt, but Krysia is recovering from an injury so it was completely understandable. I would definitely stay here a gain."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"very nice, thanks for the stay."
2023-06-01,4,Stayed one night,Krysia’s place was great! I loved the extra little details like lots of tea bags and a very detailed info book.

2023-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Perfect spot to rest your head in Athens. The garden was tranquil and beautiful. Super peaceful and comfortable, with thoughtful touches like tasty coffee pods, nice natural body wash, and cold bubly in the fridge. Really loved staying here!"

2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Another comfy stay at Krysia’s AirB&B :))

2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great place to stay in Athens. Easy walk to downtown, a thoughtful and helpful host, and everything you need in a compact location."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Krysia’s place had a wonderful vibe - Full of art & garden beauty. Our visit was for a college graduation & consisted of moving a child out of Athens. At the end of two busy days, it was a haven for serenity. Our space was very well organized & equipped with all the essentials we needed. Awesome location. Super experience! Amazing garden."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Outstanding host, authentic experience! Krysia is genuine."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Krysia is an amazing host! She went above and beyond to make sure that I was comfortable and had everything that I needed. Her place was very clean and comfortable, and the garden with her art was a beautiful and peaceful place to relax. She made time to meet with me, and we had a wonderful conversation. Her place was convenient to downtown Athens and the University of Georgia, and I will definitely stay when I’m in town again."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with a pet,It was one of the best Airbnb stays in our travel across the country. It’s a unique and artistic place with a beautiful garden. I would definitely love to visit again and highly recommend it.
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Such a charming beautiful space! Krysia really thought of everything to create a comfortable, welcoming space. I didn’t have a chance to walk downtown but noted that it would be very close and easy. LOVED all the artful decorations and attention to detail (even the coasters on the bedside tables were works of art!) and the magical garden spaces."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The place was recommended by a family friend who had already stayed there. So glad I did! Cute room, clean, well thought out, an easy walk to a beautiful walking path along the river, quick access to the highway, good parking, beautiful garden and the mosaic pieces made by the owner were stunning. Communication was great. The room is as described separate or closed off from the house. Access using the electric lock was easy. I needed to work remotely, which went well. The kitchen items were exactly what I needed for the week. Little touches added to the experience, and you can tell she took the suggestions from previous guests. We interacted a few times during the week and thankfully got to meet the last day. Other than some intermittent noise from work they were doing on the house across the street (daytime), it was quiet and quaint. I didn't walk downtown, but it's definitely possible. Being that close was very convenient. It would be tight for 2 ppl IMO, but to just sleep- perfect."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,Great place to stay
2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"Krysia’s place was perfect for what we needed - walkable to downtown, clean, great Internet, and comfortable bed. She was extremely responsive and accommodating. I will definitely be back!"

I appreciate the privacy of the space and friendliness of Krysia.
I always enjoy Krysia’s creative yard and whatever is blooming and the happy singing birds in the morning :))"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed over a week,Krysia is a great host. She is incredibly kind and helpful. I stayed six weeks and it felt like home just right from the start. Downtown and Campus is in walkable distance and there are plenty of nice trail starting close by. I can highly recommend Krysias place and will stay there again whenever I am back in Athens.
2023-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"Krysia was friendly and responsive to questions. She has the cutest nook in the room with tea, coffee, water, microwave and fridge. The room looked and felt super comfortable from the moment I stepped in. She has some local guides in the room as well as clear instructions for the white noise machine, heater, coffee maker, and all the other amenities she offers. Super super comfortable stay. I also felt very safe because you get a personal code for the door. Overall, best Airbnb I’ve stayed at by far. Absolutely wonderful"

2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Krysia's place was perfect for my stay in Athens. I came into town for a series of board exams and her place was quiet and peaceful. It is a close drive to downtown Athens for easy dinner trips. Her home is also close to a creek front park and trail that make for a great evening run or walk.
As a host she is quick to respond and communicates clearly. I ran into her while enjoying the Art Garden and she is just as wonderful in person. I would stay here again and recommend to others!"

2023-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Krysia was super friendly, and attentive to any questions, or needs, we had during our stay.
A wonderful host, who created an environment mix of relaxation, and imagination.
My nine year old son, and I, enjoyed exploring Krysia’s art garden, along with cooking hotdogs on the fire pit next to it. The indoor space was very clean, comfy, quiet, and relaxing. Tons of walkable amenities. Very cool artwork, inside and out.
Great place! I will definitely be booking the Arthouse, when I come back to Athens!"
2023-01-01,4,Stayed with a pet,Great place!!
2023-01-01,5,Stayed one night,If you love art this is a wonderful place to stay. The tile floor in the bathroom is beautiful and the bed is very comfortable.
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We loved our stay at Krysia’s place! Communication and check in were easy. The space was decorated well and very comfortable, and it was nice and quiet, we both slept great. I especially loved the shower. The garden was a lovely spot to walk around in on a nice day. The location is perfect for easily getting to anything you’d want to do in the middle of town. We are already talking about visiting again and staying here!"
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This was one of my favorite AirBnBs I've ever stayed in. Krysia did an amazing job making the space comfortable and including everything someone might need during the stay. I would definitely stay here again if I'm ever in town.

2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I really enjoyed staying at Krysia’s place! Being able to walk to town was my favorite part :) super cozy and she was very responsive!
2022-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"This was my first-ever booking on Airbnb. I came with my girlfriend for a quick post-Christmas getaway. So glad we found Krysia's place. She's an amazing artist whose artwork fills the room and an adjacent art garden and can be found in public spaces all over town.
We came during the Artic Blast of 2022 and worried if the heat in the room would be okay. There's central air/heat and a space heater, so we were plenty warm. Already planning on coming back in the spring when the garden is in bloom.
The noon checkout time was a huge plus. We slept in, walked across the park to Mamma's Boy for breakfast (a great Southern-style breakfast joint), and back along the river without worrying about rushing to leave."
2022-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"This was a perfect space for our overnight stay. It was decorated so cute, comfy and had everything we needed. Thank you, Krysia for opening your home to us!"

I really appreciated being able to have my dog. Thank you, thank you, Krysia."
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great place, and a cool cat"
2022-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"Probably our best Airbnb in years! Ideal spot for newcomers to Athens or frequent visitors. Perfect location and amenities. Krysia is helpful but not intrusive & we especially appreciated the binder of local spots. Also, her artwork is gorgeous, and the room is a great sneak peak into her work!"
2022-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"Had a lovely night at Krysia's place. There are so many beautiful artistic details, because she's an artist and did a lot of the design work in the space herself. Bed was comfy and room was quiet.
Krysia was friendly, flexible, and very communicative. And her yard is GORGEOUS, so much beautiful art (as in pics in listing).
I totally recommend Krysia's place and will stay again next time I'm in Athens."

2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"It was a great place, the neighborhood was peaceful. For the price I paid, I was happy at how my room and bathroom were prepared. Communication was also good and there were clear instructions for checking in and out."
2024-03-01,4,Stayed one night,"Everything about the location and room was fine. There wasn’t any bathroom sink soap, so I used body wash that I found under the sink. It was very hot in the room and bathroom. I had to close the vents and it was still warm. Maybe get an additional fan for the room. Just hard to control the heat without a thermostat. We will be back! Super convenient to UGA!"
2024-03-01,4,Stayed one night,"We needed a place to crash for one night in Athens! Bed was comfortable and there was enough room for two girls with luggage’s. Perhaps a bit thin walls, but earplugs could solve that :)"

2024-01-01,3,Stayed one night,Luis’s place was as described.
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place was a perfect place to stay while attending a conference. Much cheaper than a hotel room and had all the necessary essentials of a bed, private bathroom, bed linens, bathroom linens, and hangars to keep the wrinkles out of clothes. They also left nice touches of complimentary toiletries, snacks, and drinks.
Fire extinguishers available at both levels of the home added to a sense of safety. Overall very nice place to stay and I would definitely stay here again!"

2024-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"Manny was very proactive in making sure I was comfortable and warm enough. I told him it was a little too cold, and he immediately raised the temperature and brought over a blanket. The only thing missing was a coffee maker and supplies, but I mentioned it to Manny and he said they would look into getting one. Bed was comfortable and room was clean. Perfect for my night in town."
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I stayed 5 nights in Beautiful room 3 at Louis and Mannie's place. The place was so clean and located in a very calm neighborhood.

2023-12-01,5,Stayed over a week,"Really friendly hosts make sure you have everything you need, nice room and bathroom for short period. The only drawback is the poor sound isolation but still really recommend place!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The space was exactly what I needed. It was clean and tidy Luis was friendly and helpful. I will definitely stay again if I’m in town!

2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This is a great spot for a couple. Quiet & comfortable.

2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We thoroughly enjoyed our stay. The cottage was exactly as described. We live in a home built in 1912 so we like history and architecture. The cottage is quaint and had everything we needed. Three of us stayed and we had plenty of room. The single room is small but easily Plenty of towels and bath cloths in the bathroom. Great location!

and the location is great. The only drawback is that it needs a little refresh, other than that i would highly recommend this cute, quaint cottage."
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The location cannot be beat. We were able to walk to coffee shop and restaurants easily. I much prefer this area to downtown. Lisa was easy to communicate with and the cottage was just as it appears in pictures. The bed was very comfortable and lots of towels in the bathroom. We had dreary weather the whole weekend and the living area is dimly lit. My husband felt it was too dark. But I think if the sun had ever come out it would have been fine.

Kitchen was also thoughtfully stocked with dishes, coffee, etc. Linens were perfectly clean and soft. Bed was unbelievably comfy - like a great big hug. Highly recommend this host and site - though I'd love to keep it a secret so that we can access it every time we go to that city!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This cottage was perfect for our family trip to Athens with an infant and toddler. The location cannot be beat, and the accommodations were excellent!"

The location near Five Points is perfect for restaurants and is an easy walk to Sanford Stadium. The furnishings are stylish, and the space is perfect for one or two guests or a small family. Lisa is a great communicator and always available to answer any questions. Will definitely return."

2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very convenient and everything was easy!
2023-06-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Little cottage behind main house worked well for us. Location was great. Walkable to the University and lots of restaurants and shops in Five Points. Beautiful landscaping and room to sit outside. Peaceful, quiet and safe feeling. The wifi was slow and made some of our remote work difficult. When we reached out to Lisa she was extremely responsive and willing to help stating the problem was internet challenges in Athens. Just be prepared you might need a plan B to go to UGA or somewhere near by if you need to Zoom. There was no W/D which ended up being ok in the end. Place was clean - a few cobwebs here and there - but the beds were comfy and linens super clean. Small kitchen if you need to do much cooking but the restaurants and grocer nearby are excellent."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,We had an amazing week-long stay while my child attended a camp at UGA. The location was great for easy access to the campus and lots of great food options and a grocery store within walking distance. The cottage feels very private and is surrounded by beautiful greenery. The host was easy to communicate with and responsive to any extra requests I had. Wonderful stay and we will be back!
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,My favorite home away from home in Athens. Will be back!
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Had a great time at the property, easy access to a variety of food and shops a quarter mile away or so. Great neighborhood. Place was very nice, a couple of very minor issues that weren't even worth complaining about. The draw was Athens, Five Points, and the relaxation. It was a score on all of those points."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a wonderful stay. The cottage is private, cozy & nicely decorated. The beds were comfy and we slept really well. Being able to walk to restaurants and the market was wonderful. It was the perfect location for us!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Lisa’s guesthouse was just fabulous. It’s beautiful, very comfortable and very user friendly. It was decorated beautifully and had everything we could possibly need. It’s also located just down from Five Points and within a short walk to some great restaurants and coffee places. Check in was a breeze and parking was great. We will definitely try to book again when we head to Athens."

2023-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Lisa's place is great if you need a place to stay in Athens! If you know Athens, you know it's a great location - if you don't know Athens, trust me, it's a great location. The cottage is behind her house and you can't hear any road noise, which is nice. If you have kids, note two things: 1) you CAN fit a pack 'n play in the twin bed room, which I was very relieved to find out, and 2) this is listed, but a reminder that there is no tub and no laundry, which can be tough with kids. The cabin was thoughtfully decorated and clean, and the bed is very comfy!"

2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I spent five nights in this lovely cottage at the end of February (when, I'm told, it was unusually warm even for Georgia). It's a gem of a place, just as pictured in the listing. The location is ideal. The cottage is situated at a peaceful remove from the street and noise, and yet it's a five-minute walk to Five Points' grocery store, book store, bakery, coffee shop, art gallery, and multiple restaurants and pubs. Comfortable bed, lovely light, peaceful back patio, thoughtfully decorated by its interior designer host. I'll hope to make a return visit!"
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Wonderful place!
Great host"
2023-02-01,5,Stayed over a week,"I was able to walk almost everywhere! I felt super safe and comfortable. This is the nicest airbnb I have experienced in Athens by far. The back porch is super nice and sunny, and the landscaping is quite lovely. Would love to visit this place in Spring and see everything come to life. Side note for shower singers... the shower is an amazing echo chamber. You will feel like Mariah. There is a beautiful golden retriever who may come say hello and bless you with their presence. Can't recommend this place enough! 10/10"

2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This cottage is absolutely dreamy - like out of a Nicholas Sparks novel. The decor is exquisite. The location is walking distance to everything you would want/need in Athens/UGA. We were in town for a college visit and I was really hoping that my daughter would not LOVE it (bc it is too far away). Upon arrival, only minutes after getting our bags in the cottage, 6 deer (3 babies) were right outside the back patio. I mean, if the cottage alone wasn't impressive enough, the landscaping/atmosphere/environment/nature was sure to delight. This place was putting on a show!!! And we were loving it. Athens is sooooo charming. Five Points is a very unique area with tons to do and see. Downtown Athens had some of the cutest boutiques EVER. And talk about southern hospitality. This area exudes it. Everyone is so polite and friendly. I cannot, in any way, describe how nice this cottage and area are. If you are thinking about visiting Athens or UGA, do it. You will not regret it. We enjoyed every second of our visit. Lisa is perfection, as well as her cottage. Her design taste is impeccable. BOOK THIS COTTAGE!"

2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Lisa was very accomodating and responsive. The cottage is quite cozy with everything you need for a few nights away from home.

2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This cottage is in the heart of Five Points, but it is situated at the end of a charming drive and feels so private and pleasant.

Needless to say, it was extremely loud!"

2019-06-01,5,Stayed about a week,"The cottage is a convenient, stylish, and somewhat secluded getaway for trips to Athens and the University of Georgia. It’s situated in the upscale (and very safe) Five Points area of Athens, with many restaurants, shops, and grocery within a nice walking distance. (The Five Points area is such a happening place that parking can sometimes be tricky, so it was nice to be able to have a quick stroll to dinner and such). Although located just off of one of the main hubs in Athens, the cottage is located behind a gorgeous home/shop, surrounded with lush greenery, and feels very private. The inside feels spacious yet cozy for 1-3 people. We also found it easy to navigate around Athens using the cottage location as a starting point. We had an extended stay, and very much enjoyed our trip and stay in the Cottage."

Lisa had lost of coffee and shower amenities available for us. You should be aware that although there are two bedrooms, the entrance to the second bedroom is through the main bedroom which is only an issue if your child stays out later than you do, LOL!"
