2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a wonderful stay here after our wedding! Dave & Teree left cake, ice cream, cider, balloons, fresh fruit, & a sweet card etc. for us upon our arrival after our local wedding . It was so kind of them! It was a lovely spacious home, clean, 2 large bathrooms, laundry, and the deck was super nice. Floaties were in the pool for us to enjoy with our swim! The kitchen had all the essentials in it to help with cooking. They were very responsive & helpful, clear instructions were left for the home procedures."
2024-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Loved the house, but was disappointed that the pool was covered with a tarp, wasn't expected it to be covered in May, and not notified that it would be.The ad shows the pool and you look forward to relaxing by it."
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"I absolutely loved staying at the Bungalow. The place is beautiful and rustic and so peaceful and quiet. I loved watching the sunset over the trees and mountains range. The interior is nicely decorated and the bed very comfortable. The place definitely served as a home away from home and was a great get away. And I can say enough good things about Dave and Teree. They are such warm and friendly people. From the moment we connected, I felt like they were friends welcoming me to their home. They are extremely communicative and accommodating. I will definitely plan on staying with them again and recommend them highly."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a wonderful stay at the Bungalow! Beautiful location with a wonderful view. The home itself was cozy and clean. Great kitchen, well-stocked with everything you need to cook or craft a nice night in. But also close enough to the town's main shopping street that it's easy to go out to grab a bite, shop, and explore! The house is tucked away in a quiet neighborhood that lends itself to peace and relaxation. Communication with our hosts was easy and quick! We would very much look forward to staying at the Bungalow again! Thanks!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,Dave and Teree were fantastic in every way. My wife was staying for 2 months working at the local Theatre Company. Dave checked on her and made her feel safe. He even came over to make sure she had flash lights during a power outage. Fantastic Host
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We absolutely loved this place and would like to stay again next time we are in the area. The pool was fantastic, the French doors from the bedroom to the deck/pool is a very nice feature."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The Hilltop Bungalow, our 'Favourite Tree House'. Exceeds expectations from the opening of the entry door.
My husband and I agree that this home is now our go to for future visits to Sonora. Our good friend stayed with us here, to attend the wedding reception of a friend's son. He was very pleased with the 2nd bedroom and bathroom. The master suite is large, with a view from the window that is just Wonderful, and French Door out to the deck.
This home has modern updates that are very well done with granite countertops, double sinks in both bathrooms and a Beautiful Modern Kitchen that is well stocked with cookware, dishes for indoors and out.
Sitting on the spacious deck poolside was our morning place for coffee and our evening place for Cheers.
We could not have been happier staying anywhere else.
Thank you Dave & Teree, gracious hosts."

2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We've really enjoyed our stay here! The pool is amazing, it was even quite warm for the time of year. What stood out the most was the attention to detail, everything was super clean, notes with instructions were left to guide us, and a generous amount of supplies to use!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We enjoyed so much Dave and Teree's bungalow! The pool and the home were beautiful. If you are use to a flatter terrain the drive way is a steep one but the view makes it all worth while. I cannot say enough about how much we enjoyed the home, Sonora, and our visit family visit to California."

With all the creature comforts included. Lovely views, quiet, neighborhood, convenient, amenities, and brand new appliances. The place has clearly been recently and tastefully remodeled or is simply a newer home. Overall excellent experience, a perfect place to land, highly recommend it."

We really enjoyed cooling off in the pool. I can’t say enough great things about their house and can’t think of anything negative at all!"
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Lovely home for a summer getaway. The location is perfect for day trips to surrounding areas, and of course, Yosemite. We recommend taking YART to go to the park if you are just going for a day - that worked perfectly. There is plenty to do in the area and the pool was fun, although be aware, it is not heated. We ate dinner out on the deck most nights and enjoyed the lovely views. And our hosts were so lovely and helpful! They even found us an ice cream maker to borrow for July 4th!"

Its truly a gem!"

2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Teree is a wonderfully attentive and generous host - we so enjoyed our stay! We very much hope to be back. The house is full of thoughtful little touches and wonderful details. We cooked two full breakfasts and dinners and didn’t even use the bbq - next time! The kitchen is very well stocked and we found all we needed. The pictures are accurate but don’t do the place justice in terms of view and feel. Thank you again!!
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"Better than advertised! Cozy get away. The views & the pool together. Dinner on the deck with the fresh mountain air. Teree & Dave are incredible hosts, attentive & timely communication. We enjoyed a perfect memorial weekend celebrating our sons birthday. We can’t wait to come back."
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"This is a place that pictures draw you in but once you arrive it is beyond your expectations. Incredible views of the Sonora area, quiet & comfy. Teree & Dave are amazing hosts & truly care about your experience. I look forward to staying here again."
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"The pictures are nice but the reality of this place is incredible.
It is better than a home away from home. The views are relaxing, you’ll disappear into this quiet little neighborhood. Minutes from downtown Sonora & several great restaurants. We look forward to escaping to here again soon."
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Wonderful home! Clean and comfortable beds. Bathrooms are spacious. Great location. Hosts were accommodating and communications with hosts were excellent!

2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Such a lovely place. Just as described. Was perfect for a long weekend. Dave and Tee were so helpful and prepped a bunch of things (toys, crib, high chair) for our 1 year old. Highly recommend staying here for a fun weekend getaway."
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place was wonderful! In the hot and dry California summer, the pool was an INDISPENSABLE part of our stay! The house was clean and it had everything we needed for our stay."
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We four ladies really loved our time at Dave and Teree’s, hanging out in the pool and on the deck. We took a ride to Columbia Historic Park and rode a stage coach and shopped, and in the evenings we sipped wine and ate chips and salsa under lighted gazebos in the evenings. The street is quiet and it feels like you’re far away from town even though it was just a quick 6-10 minutes for food and shopping. I highly recommend Dave and Teree’s. I would love to go back again"
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Our stay was absolutely wonderful! The home has so much to offer- even more beautiful in person than in the pics!

We had a blast using the pool- so very relaxing!
Thank you for making us feel at home!"

2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We loved staying at Dave and Teree's Hilltop Bungalow! It was the perfect size for the four of us. The home was clean, well stocked and very comfortable. Dave and Teree were very communicative and helpful with check-in, and information regarding sites in the area. It is a perfect location to access and within walking distance to restaurants and shops in Sonora. We enjoyed relaxing by the pool after long days hiking in Yosemite! I highly recommend staying at the Hilltop Bungalow and would inquire again if we return to the area!"
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Nice town. Nice place to stay. Very quiet. Oh, there is a rooster that we thought was hysterical. But you dont hear it inside. Enjoy your stay"
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Had a great time at the Bungalow! The pool was so big and the canopy in back was a perfect touch. So chill, would definitely stay again!"
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This was our first Airbnb stay in over a year. We were a bit apprehensive because of COVID but everything was clean and spotless and we felt safe. We spent most of the weekend out on the deck and in the pool. We kept saying we wished we could stay longer. Dave and Teree respond right away for any concerns/questions and are just awesome hosts all around. The bungalow feels private secluded but if needed, Save Mart is just a few minutes away. Highly recommend this spot!"
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The driveway is steep but it is worth the climb. A beautiful bungalow surrounded by trees plus a great pool. We spent many hours relaxing by the pool watching the birds playing in the trees. Everything was well maintained and the bed was very comfortable.
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Gorgeous and private home that’s the perfect size for two couples or a small family. Set amongst the trees high above town but close enough to stroll down for an evening in town. Everything we needed was here and our hosts were so quick to respond and gave us helpful restaurant recommendations. They really thought of everything for their guests. The decor is a lovely mix of modern and vintage eclectic. I would very highly recommend.
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,very nice house with a great pool! super close to downtown Sonora and other fun things in the area
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful setting. Very tidy and cozy. Loved sitting out on the deck, gazing at treelined hills. So fun to get in pool on hot days. A great getaway. We even made the drive to Yosemite Valley one day. Glorious. Dave and Tee were friendly, great communicators. We hope to come again soon!"
2021-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,All around great people. 100% recommend Dave and Tee’s place to everyone.

2021-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Amazing cute space! Incredible view with greenery & everything you need! Out of all the airbnb’s i’ve stayed at i’ve never seen one with a kitchen as stocked as this one! Such generous hosts and the airbnb has the comfiest best! Super easy check in!
2021-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Had a blast! This is a very cozy place to stay with an amazing view! Definitely would visit again!
2021-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Dave and Tee's place was just what we were looking for. It was quiet, comfortable, spacious and private. Beautiful views from the deck, comfy beds, great water pressure, and a well-equipped kitchen. Dave and Tee were thoughtful hosts and checked in with us. Check-in and check-out were a breeze. Thoroughly recommend and would happily stay again!"
2021-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very responsive over messaging on Airbnb! Sweet little hilltop getaway with a wonderful deck. with the two bed two bath- it was spacious for a nice little out of town vacay!
2020-10-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Dave and Tee’s bungalow is so cozy and well-styled and the perfect size for our family vacation of 4. The house stayed cool the week we stayed at their place and my sister and I were able to tan on the deck and relax in the sun for a few days too! Walking to the old town of Sonora was pretty easy, though the house is on a hill and can be steep for folks who aren’t used to walking up inclines. Tee and Dave were great hosts and we even met Tee on our walk to town and Dave when he came by to check the chlorine in the pool. Tee gave great local tips for what to do in and around town and Dave shared tips for the surrounding parks area. We are all our meals and prepped park lunches comfortably in the open kitchen space and had coffee made in the Keurig every morning. Super lovely house and would love to come back again in the summer to fully enjoy the pool!! There’s a full-size washer and dryer in the house as well, which was useful when we came back dusty from hikes. FYI- Yosemite gate is an hour away and it’s 2 hours from the house to the Yosemite Valley Center or Tuolumne Meadows."
2020-10-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"This charming bungalow was comfortable, relaxing and private. Plus, close to several regional destinations for outings. I found all the labelling of light switches extremely helpful. Felt right at home after a few hours."
2020-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful setting. Close to everything. Went to celebrate birthday and the little touches like cake and balloons were just a few of the things that made staying here special!!
2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"We loved our stay at Dave and Tee’s bungalow in Sonora. The kitchen was well appointed with new appliances so we were able to cook and stay-in when we wanted. Yet there are many restaurants in close proximity. Decor in the bungalow was stylish and a mixture of antique and modern furniture. Beds were comfortable. Very quiet area, no disturbances with neighborhood noise other than a few cars going by periodically. The pool was a very added plus to our stay. We swam everyday that we were there. The bungalow was spotless and we felt safe staying there even during COVID19. Dave and Tee are excellent hosts and responded quickly to any questions or concerns we had. I highly recommend their place and we will definitely book again."
2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"What to say? Our stay in the hilltop pool bungalow was our best AirBnb experience to date.
Dave and Tee are just perfect hosts- kind, helpful, accommodating, and excellent communicators.
The house exudes relaxation and calm. As soon as we walked through the door we could feel ourselves easing into the beauty and serenity of the bungalow.
Every comfort has been thought of- well equipped kitchen, comfortable beds, fluffy towels, strong WiFi, local tips and recommendations, too many thoughtful details to list...
Just prepare to unwind, enjoy the peaceful sunsets on the deck, and of course splash in the sparkling pool.
We are already planning our return!"
2020-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Dave and Tee’s place is really wonderful. It’s really such a comfortable space. They are really conscientious hosts, providing good amenities and offer as much help as you’d like, but also give you your privacy. They really care about your stay and making you feel comfortable. The pool is really great. It was 100 degrees when we were in Sonora and with COVID not much else to do, but it was exactly the getaway we needed. They make sure the place is clean and stocked. Plenty of towels {including beach towels}, pillows, pool toys and cute touches like candy in tea cups. Definitely would recommend to anyone !"
2020-07-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"We really enjoyed our stay! Dave and Tee were both very helpful with recommendations and I felt very comfortable staying there during COVID, knowing that they were taking it seriously and following guidelines."
2020-07-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Dave and Teree's bungalow is a great home base for all kinds of daytime excursions. Hiking in Yosemite, boating and swimming at Pinecrest Lake or Melones Reservoir, and wine tasting in Murphys were all on the agenda for the just over a week we spent at the house. It was such a bonus to come back from a long day of activities and cool off in the pool.
The house is in a quiet residential neighborhood but still close to downtown Sonora, which makes it an easy walk (about a mile) to the Saturday farmer's market. The house is situated to stay cool on a hot day, but has great light, and you can get plenty of sun around the pool and deck. The layout is great - there were only two of us, but it can easily accommodate up to 4 with two bedrooms and two big bathrooms.
Everything in the house is super clean and well-organized. Teree and Dave live just down the street and were great about keeping in touch to make sure everything was ok or to ensure the pool stayed clean and properly chlorinated.
We had such a great time and hope we can visit again!"
2020-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"While I didn’t actually have a chance to stay at Dave and Tee’s property I must give them the highest possible recommendation. The reason I wasn’t able to attend was due to the nationwide Coronavirus emergency and inclement weather. Even though it was past the date for refunds, Dave and Tee were incredibly understanding, compassionate, and supportive of my efforts to obtain my refund.
I only hope I have a chance to book with them in the future and would recommend anyone looking to find lodging in the Sonora area to look no further than Dave and Tee."
2020-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Really cool spot!!
2019-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is a very beautiful home, bigger than you would expect from the pictures. The hosts are easy to get in touch with and responsive. A great home for a weekend away!"
2019-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We stayed at Dave and Tee's for four nights during a California road trip to have some down-time from hotel life. It was everything we expected and more - a lovely home and and really nice location. Unbeknownst to us there were power outages in the area due to high winds and wild-fires further north and the electricity was down for 36 hours. Dave and Tee were fantastic and kept us informed all the while, making sure we had everything we needed including torches and extra provisions! We would thoroughly recommend this to all!"
2019-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,It's everything it says it is. 4 of us stayed and 4 of us liked it!!!
2019-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"After spending a couple of weeks traveling, this place was our absolute favorite! A very intimate and cozy home with a beautiful view of the Sonora hills. Tee was a fantastic host! She offered tips on things to do. Really couldn’t ask for a better place to stay. We loved it!"
2019-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This bungalow was perfect in every way. Lovely secluded deck with pool. Very well equipped house with everything you need for a short and long stay. Many staples which you may use. Immaculate clean. Very cosy and nicely decorated house. Felt like home in an instant. Is even better then in the pictures ;-).
Dave and Teree are very nice and friendly people, and reacted quickly and gave good tips for things to do in the neighborhood/area. If you’re planning to go to Sonora and/or Yosemite (1 hour away) make sure you book this lovely place!"
2019-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This is a fabulous property in a great location. The property is perfect for a quiet get away and makes an excellent stop over for visiting lots of the local attractions (including Yosemite National Park). We loved our stay here and can’t recommend it enough!
2019-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Fabulous place. Great space for 2 couples. We did not think we would use the pool--but, we were in it constantly since it was such a nice size and so relaxing."
2019-07-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Nice place to stay
2019-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We fell in love with the bungalow on sight! We had complete privacy in the pool, and it was so refreshing in 104 degrees. We tried to book another visit after our first day, but they were booked up for the summer. Our host responded quickly and had suggestions ready to share. I was able to cook for my girlfriend’s birthday weekend with all the necessities available in the kitchen. This place does not disappoint! We will be back!!!"
2019-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"As per all the other reviews, this bungalow is an outstanding property. We loved everything from the spaciousness, the decor, the pool, the hillside views and the welcome gifts of wine, beer and chocolate. Tee gave us lots of tips on where to go locally. We ended up spending a day at Yosemite and also visited the museum in Sonora and Columbia State Historic Park. This stay was definitely a high-light of our trip and we wouldn't hesitate to recommend it."
2019-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Fantastic luxurious house with a great view. The house was very clean. Dave and Tee also had a lot groceries in the house which was very convienent. The boys felt like millionairs. We absolutely loved it.
2019-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was the most amazing spot... clean and very well appointed! Nice kitchen, great living spaces and amazing pool! A+++"
2019-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This house is exceptional. It is a modern house, very clean, well stocked with exactly what you need with a wonderful view and very private. The beds are very comfy and the living space open and warm. The pool is obviously the icing on the cake. It was so lovely to spend the mornings on the deck, relaxing and enjoying the view. We had a wonderful visit. Tee is very sweet and communication was easy and responses were quick. We will definitely stay here again when we are back in the area. My only concern is that it will already be rented! This house is quite the gem, and I highly recommend booking it."
2019-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,What a great place to stay at and with the pool was a bonus!
2019-06-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Gorgeous!!! Dave & Tee were so helpful! Would stay here again and again!
2019-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The hilltop bungalow was a wonderful space for me and my two best friends to relax and reconnect! We had one full day of sunny weather to enjoy the pool, which came with a large floatie and beach towels! The pool is unheated but offers lots of sun exposure, it was incredibly refreshing after laying in the sun. The inside was so cozy and comfortable, air conditioning and heat both worked very well and kept it cool during the warm weather and cozy when the weather turned rainy. I should also mention that our beds were insanely comfortable, I have never slept better in an Airbnb. The kitchen had everything we needed to cook our meals and a dishwasher for cleaning dish ware, and a variety of complimentary pantry items, drinks & food! Also a mini coffee bar with complimentary tea and Keurig coffee, little chocolates etc. We explored Murphy’s and Angels Camp and Sonora’s downtown, lots of spots for the outdoorsy and indoorsy types. And plenty of good wine! Overall it exceeded our expectations and I have already recommended this location to friends and family. If you are staying in Sonora don’t pass this place up!"
2019-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was such a perfect home away from home, so clean and welcoming with little fresh flowers even. We loved how close it was to downtown Sonora, as well as Union Hill Inn wedding venue. Really appreciated the tea and coffee available, and extras in the fridge. Dave and Tee provided great hiking recommendations and were very communicative. The pool and deck were lovely as well."
2019-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great hosts! Great location, private but accessible. Sparkling clean. Wonderfully updated and decorated. Lots of special extra touches. Very comfy. Great place to hang out all day (except there’s a lot to do around Sonora). i don’t know if it ever gets below freezing in Sonora but i wouldn’t want to be there when there’s ice or snow, because the driveway is super steep. But we were there in the rain and it wasn’t a problem."
2019-05-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Dave and Tee’s place was better than we had expected! The views were beautiful and their house was very comfortable and homey and also close to many amenities. These hosts are extremely nice people and were very helpful with tips about the local area. The pool was a wonderful place to relax and the end of the day. We would definitely stay here again if we are in the area!
2019-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Enjoyed staying at Dave and Tee’s place, highly recommended."
2019-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Best rental I’ve found on any site. Loved the location and very stylish and comfortable. Hosts were quick to respond and accommodating and even put a personal touch for my birthday.
2019-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Dave and Tee were so thoughtful and anticipated our every need. We arrived late on a dark and stormy night and Dave and Tee met us in town to direct us to the house tucked away from the street. The house was cozy and comfortable. The kitchen complete. We will stay again!
2017-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This rental was just fabulous. The home was lovely and in a good location for exploring the area. It is in a residential area but still very private. Everything we needed was made available and the home was spotless. Thank you Dave and Tee for all the special touches that made us feel so welcomed.
2017-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Incredible! Dave and Tee were amazing hosts - we had constant, responsive, and clear communication throughout our stay. Local recommendations were spot on. Space was very clean, quiet, and cozy. Perfect time to go visit!
We will definitely be back."
2017-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Most beautiful place we’ve ever stayed with the nicest and most cordial hosts we could’ve asked for. The place was clean, had a beautiful kitchen and the backyard with the pool was a lovely touch. The bed was a cloud sent from Heaven. The hosts were very accessible and helpful with restaurant recommendations."
2017-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,What a great location and fun getaway for the weekend. Hosts were very responsive and even put a special Birthday treat in the fridge for our celebration! I would love to stay again during the hot summer months and take advantage of the gorgeous pool!
2017-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"It was a beautiful stay in Dave and Tee's house!
As others said before, the house is much nicer than the photos show, I immediately felt comfortable. The pool is great, and even though the water was a bit cold, the gigantic blow up swan let me float and chill in the afternoon sun. Very relaxing!
If I come back to this area, I'll try to book again!"
2017-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is the perfect spot to enjoy Sonora and surrounding area.
A very peaceful location but close to downtown Sonora for eating out and shopping.
The pool was fun place to relax in the afternoon sunshine, very relaxing ,
Everything you need for a great stay !"
2017-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This bungalow hosted by Dave and Tee is ideally situated if you want to visit the beautiful north east area of California. The bungalow is well equipped with a nice sized pool ( unheated) and situated on a hill top with pleasant views. Bedrooms are of different sizes and clothing will need to be stored on one shelf in the walk in wardrobes. The town of Sonora offers many good dining venues and areas to shop for gifts and food very close by. A special mention about the hosts who took time to visit and explain where to go and what to do which was extremely useful for first time visitors to California and this area especially. I would definitely stay at this bungalow again and the cost was reasonable and good value for money in my opinion. Thanks again to Dave for all your trouble.
2017-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The house is beautiful picture don't do it justice.
2017-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Absolutely LOVE this place! We spent our honeymoon here and it was just excellent. Very quiet/private and extremely fun! The pool is big and cool which was nice during the summer heat. The rooms are cute and the bathrooms are very nice. Dave & Tee were excellent hosts. They were easily available and gave us great advice on visiting Yosemite and recommendations on some local restaurants. (The town of Sonora is about 2 hours from the Yosemite gate..a scenic nice drive imo) We had a perfect time here and definitely 100% recommend staying here.
2017-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We really enjoyed staying at Dave and Tee's place. The house was very clean and is just beautiful. They paud a lot of attention to detail - even having a little chocolate cake ready for our arrival. The pool was a perfect refreshment after a long day in Yosemite park which is only an hour away. Communication with the host was easy and all queries were answered super fast. We can only recommend staying here!
2017-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Gorgeous house in a beautiful setting with a great pool. Very comfortable beds, little toys for our toddler, caring hosts. Just perfect!"
2017-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I clearly understand that Dave and Tee have the mention of superhosts! Villa (modestly called bungalow) super nice and equipped. Real pool ideal for returning from walks. It takes 2 hours to go to the visitor center of Yosemite.
A really perfect stay with hosts full of attention and always at your service, all in Olympic calm and great comfort."
2017-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place is a gem. Everything made us feel so welcome, from the nice on line communication to the large plastic swan in the pool for our daughters. There were some snacks and drinks for us in the fridge, the beds were comfy, the towels thick and even the shampoo and soap was nice. When you use this place solely as a base for Yosemite, it might be a bit too long of a ride. But we enjoyed the surroundings and the pool on day one and drove to Yosemite the next day. We loved Jamestown and Pinecrest lake was nice as well (though a bit crowded on a Sunday). We strongly recommend this place!"
2017-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The house was amazing, the location was great. The outdoor pool was perfect after a day of hiking and visiting. Dave and Tee were very helpfull, gave us suggestions for our trip in Yosemite park. We arrived quite late from San Francisco and they even put on some extra light in the house so that we could find it easier and it felt comfy right away.
We had an amazing time and recommend this place for everyone :)
We were a group of 4 friends and had more than enough space."
2017-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is the best airbnb experience we had so far. Beds are very confortable, soap and linens are great quality, it is perfectly clean, communication was excellent and the pool is great ! location is about one hour to Yosemite Park. Calm neibourhood and"
2017-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"There is so much good to say I am not sure where to start. I had read that the pictures don't do the place justice and I would agree! We had pushed to get to Yosemite the day before our arrival to Dave and Tee's place and by the time we got to Sonora I was exhausted. Sorta rummy, needing to get my diabetic mother to dinner and soon, Dave met us and drove ahead for us to follow him. He even helped me find a parking place downtown Sonora. To make a wonderful gesture one better, after he was greeted by several towns people on the street, he introduced us to a family friend who was a server at the restaurant. That is above and beyond to the tenth power at least! One night we cooked a full meal for four utilizing the electric barbecue and everything turned out great. I could imagine in the future grabbing groceries, movies and just hanging out at the bungalow for a getaway from it all weekend!"
2017-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Best airbnb experience ever! Beautiful house and pool! Gorgeous view! Cozy and tidy room. And nice host, thank
You again for all, Dave and Tee ,Melissa"
2017-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Three day stay was excellent. Hosts are wonderful. Home is incredible, pool with deck area was my kids favorite. This is what a home away from home is supposed to be."
2017-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"What a great experience !!!!
Everything was perfect, from the reservation to the check out
No better choice in this area : house spacy, swimming pool appreciated after a day of climbing in Yosemite, quiet, ....
Definitively a place to go"
2017-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Vern nice house with a beautiful view. Pool and deck are great. Well worth a trip to relax, enjoy the view and pool."
2017-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"WOW! This place was FABULOUS! We stayed our first night in Sonora at a different place and wish we had stayed at the Hilltop Bungalow that night as well. The pool was clean and very inviting. Loved all of the floaters that were there as well. Check in couldn't have been any easier and owners were very prompt in responding to questions. The attention to detail was unmatched. The towels and shower curtain even matched. It was only our 2nd Air B&B that we've ever experienced and we will be using Air B&B for future trips. If we are ever in the ""neighborhood"" again, we would absolutely return. Can't recommend highly enough. Definitely give it a try!"
2017-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We stayed here for 2 nights while attending a friends wedding, the house was perfect for two couples it's very clean, nice and quiet with beautiful views with a large deck that gets plenty of sun which makes it easy for relaxing and sunbathing. We really enjoyed using the swimming pool as well! The house also has a BBQ on the deck which was a nice plus (really wishing we would have taken advantage of it!)
We would definitely stay at this place again if we ever make it back up to Sonora!
Thanks for allowing us to stay at your beautiful home!"
2017-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The house is amazing. 2 big bedrooms with private bathroom. The living room is very spacious and kitchen is well equipped. The outdoor area is nice too, and we enjoyed a lot the swimming pool.
WARNING: if your plan is to stay in Sonora to be close to Yosemite, you have the wrong idea!!! It is actually a 2hours drive minimum to get to the Yosemite Valley...
I would not give any comments about the host, because we had some issues due to mistrust from the owners toward us.
Anyway, we had 3 amazing days, and I would recommend this place."
2017-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Delightful bungalow with all the upgrades. Loved having a pool and a washer/dryer
2017-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My partner and I had a lovely time at Dave and Tee's place! Their home was decorated beautifully, clean and comfortable. The views from the home's deck were breathtaking and just what we needed! Dave and Tee were helpful and accommodating. We will definitely be back."
2017-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We really enjoyed our stay. The house was fantastic, clean, had a great view, and close to downtown. Wish we could have stayed longer! Dave and Tee were excellent hosts!"
2017-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We booked Dave and Tee's bungalow for my cousins wedding nearby. We came in late on a Friday night, and were instantly impressed with the space, quality and amenities of the rental! The stock photos do not do this place justice! Lovely getaway with amazing pool, 2 huge bedrooms, and an amazing central AC system! It was HOT out and the place stayed cool! Dave and Tee were in text contact if we needed anything (we didn't!), and everything went off without a hitch! There was even a beer in the fridge when we got there =) Loved it and would (will?) stay there again!"
2017-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This is a beautiful home with a great view. It was wonderfully decorated with quality in mind. We felt very much at home there.
2017-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Although we didn't meet our hosts in person, everything was perfectly arranged and communication was really quick and easy. The place itself is amazing, nicely furnitured and has an unbelievable view from the patio. We enjoyed the pool and relaxed in the sun. If you are somewhere in between Yosemite and Lake Tahoe, you should definitely consider to make a stop here. And Sonora itself is a very cute little town. We were sad that we could only spend one night. It's a wonderful calm place to stay! Thank you so much for everything!"
2017-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a fantastic stay in this luxurious hilltop bungalow. Every detail was thought of by the hosts, which made us feel welcomed and pampered."
2017-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,I had such a wonderful time! Can't wait to come back again.
2017-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This place is gorgeous! It was perfect for our weekend in Sonora. Can't wait to go back!
2017-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great stay at Dave and Tee's. The house is superb, more beautiful than in the pictures, and very well-equipped... We wish we had stayed longer...Dave and Tee are very friendly hosts and available for any information. Contact was very easy and very warm. The house is very well-located, close to shops and the city of Sonora which is very beautiful. We highly recommend this place!"
2017-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Similar to what others have written. The pictures don't do this home justice :) Everything is beautiful in this home, it's so nicely updated and well decorated. It's close to town, yet just far enough away for peace and quiet. The amenities were above and beyond. My communication with Tee was soo quick, I really appreciated all of the help :)"
2017-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We ate every meal at the house except we went to ""The Rock"" in Twin Harte for a burger and cake and loved it."
2017-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The home is lovely and memorable, the photos do not do it the justice it deserves. The energy and calm and comfort are apparent here and the hosts are exact to being hospitable and genuinely kind. It is one of the best experiences we have had with Airbnb. I can't think of a better location, it's not too secluded but not crowded or too downtown. It's nestled in trees and quiet just near town and shopping and boutiques and antiques and food. Everything you need to experience California and Yosemite. This is a high quality location and experience. I give it a sound 10/10 and sincere wishes of peace and happiness to the good family that hosted us. Thanks to Dave and Tee for caring. Nick"
2017-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Dave and Tee's place exceeded our expectations! The view, the house, and the hospitality were more incredible than I'd imagined. They left us a lovely bottle of wine and coffee and biscotti which was a really nice touch. I highly recommend staying there if you're planning a stay in Sonora."
2017-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Beautiful home outside of Yosemite! Dave and Tee were very responsiveness throughout our whole planning of the trip. I wish we could have stayed at this home longer.
2017-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Stay here while in Sonora!! Clean, clean, clean, updated, new bathrooms, floors, etc.. Stylish, so very nice, up on the hill. Beautiful views. Private location, close to town, yet residential. Pool, in season. Wonderful new fresh towels, sheets, comfortable bed, many amenities. Fresh flowers in every room!! Great communication. Steep driveway. Such a wonderful stay . Thank you !!"
2017-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I can not express our gratitude enough. Dave and Tee went above and beyond to make our little get a way perfect.
The bungalow was absolutely adorable. Everything you can think of was there. The space is perfect for a peaceful get away and we enjoyed every last minute. Minutes to everything from fun in the snow, ice skating, the historic downtown and other aspects of nature.
We will be back soon........"
2017-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The bungalow is beautiful, spacious and very relaxing. The hosts are helpful and pleasant to work with: from booking the bungalow to checking in/out, the hosts have been wonderful and responsive. I highly recommend this bungalow."
2017-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"You open the door to this little paradise, and your eyes will be greeted with colors, comfort, and style, your nose might be greeted with sweet fresh flowers tucked in here and there, your ears will be greeted by absolute silence save bird sound. You will find fluffy beds with splendid linens, spa like spotless bathrooms stocked with essentials+, an airy open main living space with a kitchen stocked with staples and snacks (my hungry girls found milk, and cheese goldfish and candy in wee bowls!!). The deck and pool gave this property a European country feel, with spicy breezes and city light views at night.
We only needed a place for the night, but our stay ended up feeling like a deep retreat. We were close to shopping and restaurants.
The house was spotless, extremely well appointed, and had everything we needed to feel at home and even spoiled. Thank you David and Teree. An incredible weekend. We will return certainly."
2017-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Dave and Tee were great hosts and communicated well. My family enjoyed their stay and we would love to stay with them again.
2017-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This place was amazing, very clean well equipped and felt like home"
2017-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful home to stay in. Great views. Amazing pool. Would stay again for sure.
2017-01-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"This is my 2nd time staying at this location, and it was even better this time. The location is scenic, close to everything, and Dave/Teree are awesome hosts, getting anything you need and frequently checking in to ensure your stay is enjoyable. Highly recommend staying here."
2017-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"From first contact to checkout our Hilltop Bungalow experience with Dave, Tee, and Melissa was EXCELLENT!!

The place is just as described and pictured. The house is well stocked and very clean, most likely the nicest place we have stayed in terms of overall experience. The neighborhood is quiet and the home has a great view! The owners are knowledgeable about the area which was very helpful as well. If you are heading to the Sonora area I cannot imagine another place that is as clean, comfortable, or comes with as many great amenities (coffee, snacks, body wash, shampoo and conditioner). They pay attention to the little things! Can't remember if we have ever stayed at a place that had plastic fork/knife/napkin sets to go just in case you decide you want to have a picnic at the nearby cider house and orchard. There was even plastic wrap and tin foil, and a few other items that you don't think of when you take a little trip or are at the store to stock up prior to or after arrival. There was even a bottle of wine for us!

Stay here! You will be comfy, cozy, have an awesome view and an excellent experience."
2016-12-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,This place is awesome. Loved staying here and has everything you could need. Dave and Teree are both extremely friendly and helpful. Always available if you need something. The house is beautiful and cozy and located in a very nice area. Will definitely be staying here again.
2016-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Not as private as preferred (neighbors house looks directly down toward front door and pool) yet still managed to exceed expectation. If secluded and away from typical tourist areas, and the nearest airport being two hours away isn't an issue, then this is the place for you. Surrounded by nature and a marvelous sun-setting view, this place was perfect. If only the hosts had control over the weather as much as they had over managing the property to the ""t,"" (no pun intended) that would be adding perfection to perfection. May I also add, although we didn't need them much, they continued to make themselves available to all efforts of communication from pre-reservation to post-reservation. If you're eyeing this place and its availability lines up with your schedule, book it asap, and that's a demand not a suggestion!"
2016-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I have no hesitations recommending a stay at Dave and Tee's home. It's EXTREMELY clean and well-appointed, and hosts were excellent communicators. It's not walking distance downtown, but convenient to downtown and everything in the area. We will definitely stay here again. THANK YOU!!"
2016-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Dave & Tee were the perfect hosts. They were in contact right away and made me feel confident traveling in from out of state on short notice. The house was impeccable; it was well appointed, spotless and warm. I really appreciated all the attention to detail they provided, like the welcome book, water in the fridge and coffee ready to go. We really wish we could have stayed longer and hope we get the chance to stay here again."
2016-10-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"The pictures are exactly as the place appears. For the price, this place was well worth the money compared to staying at a motel. The only thing to note is that the house is located up a steep hill and not really walking distance to town. But other than that, it was a very nice place and Tee was very helpful with recommendations as to where to eat (we wanted delivery) and she would answer quickly any questions we had."
2016-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The bungalow is exactly as described in the description. The place is beautiful and Is perfect for up to a group of four. The house is stocked with everything one could need. This a sure fire five out of five stars!
2016-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This house is absolutely beautiful. Almost so much that I want to keep it my little secret :) Ok... I will share. The house is immaculately clean, well stocked, and enjoyable to spend time in. Spa-like bathrooms, comfortable beds, tons of open storage space for travelers. We came in 50 degree raining weather so I'm not able to attest to the pool experience, but it is large and well maintained. Must be a real treat in the summer. The best part was that the lovely hosts left me a few surprises for my birthday, a beautiful cupcake and balloons, it made me feel so special. Such a nice touch. The hosts were very helpful and communicative, and really wanted to make sure we had a great trip and had everything we needed. This is a gem of an air bnb. Doesn't get any better than this!
As far as the city of Sonora, it was my first time visiting. We wanted to stay somewhat near Yosemite so I researched and found this little town. It is so adorable! An old gold-mining town with modern conveniences but an old-timey feel. Tons of thrifting and vintage/antique stores, I had such a good time outside of the house. Yosemite took us about 1.5-2 hours to drive to the inside of the park. We loved it so much we bought a year pass. I hope to stay in this house again on my next visits, wouldn't change a thing. Thank you Dave and Tee!!"
2016-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Dave and Tee were so accomodating! Worked with my changing schedule. House was PERFECT! Perfect for a business trip, family trip, romantic getaway. I'd definitely stay here again!!"
2016-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,The bungalow was amazing. Great place. Perfect for our stay. Beds we're very comfortable. Host was nice and answered all our questions. I have so many wonderful things to say about this place. I wish our stay was longer. Would definitely come back.
2016-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Great place! Very comfortable, amazing view, and perfectly decorated. We only wish we could have stayed longer."
2016-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a wonderful time at the bungalow, it is even more beautiful than the pictures show. Everything is spotlessly clean and very nicely appointed, many beautiful features, nice sized rooms, lots of windows, great views and lovely sunsets!. The pool on the deck is huge and very clean. Lots of deck to hang out on, lots of sunshine and shade. The master bedroom has a gorgeous blue spruce right out the window, squirrels jumping about. The hosts are completely available, responsive and so welcoming. The house is full of treats as well as good solid food, milk, butter, bottled water, very nice. We walked in to a beautifully set table and bottle of wine. The beds are great, the linens are comfy and plush. It is very close to everything in town, lots of fun shops and beautiful scenery. We will definitely return and highly recommend the place and the hosts. Sincerely, Elena Longsworth"
2016-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We were welcomed with flowers and local wine. Our hosts were warm, friendly and quick to respond. The house had everything we could need. Pool, large private deck, nestled in the trees with a view of the city lights-so peaceful!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,It was very nice. We especially liked the terrace.
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"might stay at the Sonora inn was great. it's a quiet and peaceful area. the room was very nice. the AC worked. the bathroom had great water pressure, it never ran out of hot water during my shower. I got wonderful rest on an comfortable bed and check out was easy and the Continental breakfast in the morning was delicious."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This place was beautiful! We arrived later in the day but they were super friendly and had everything ready for us. It was clean, cute and perfect for a single night stay. We were able to look at horses, enjoy tea and using their hot plate to make dinner. I would definitely recommend this as a place to stay, especially if you are visiting Yosemite and sequoia. It was a perfect middle spot."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Our stay here was amazing. We would definitely come back again. Leigh was a fantastic host, extremely responsive and very knowledgeable about the history of the property. She even let us meet the donkeys which was an added bonus!! We had a great time!!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place was great to stay while exploring the area and Yosemite. It was a great size for my husband and I who weren't spending a lot of time at the place but wanted a place to relax after hiking. We did see a couple bugs in the cabin which is to be expected with the location so we didn't mind.
Check in was very easy with clear instructions and the host was very responsive!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The stay was excellent . Your own private entry into the cottage, felt very relaxing and peaceful"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,My friend and I had a wonderful stay at Joe’s Airbnb. The location was peaceful and beautiful. Joe was easy to communicate with.
2024-06-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"Beautiful accommodation, a bit outdated, but has everything you need."
2024-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great stay!! So cozy and took us 1.5 hr to get to Yosemite :)
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Wonderful stay! Hosts were very friendly and very communicative. The farm was beautiful and we loved watching the horses, donkeys, and dogs from our window. The dogs gave us a spirited welcome! :) The cottage was adorable and very comfortable. It had everything we needed. Would totally stay again. The area was incredible! AMAZING hiking at Pinecrest Lake, and not far from Yosemite."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"On our way to Yosemite the cabin was the perfect place for us!
We loved the nearby village of Columbia and the town of Sonora is very pretty
The cabin is very cute and in a very quiet and nature setting."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Lovely little cabin! Had everything we needed after hiking through Yosemite - hot shower, water and a comfy bed."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Joe's place was super cute and in a great location. They were super helpful with instructions ahead of time on how to find their place and how to check in.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Our 2 night stay was great and accommodating for our plans! Highly recommend
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We had a wonderful time at Joe's place. It was closely located to many local attractions while still feeling very private. We would love to stay here again when we are in the area. Thank you!
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Adorable and peaceful! Loved the history of this cabin. So close to downtown Sonora! We will stay again!
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The cottage is perfect for us. It is quiet and peaceful. It is close to Sonora and Columbia. Leigh is very responsive. The cottage is clean and tidy. We will be back!
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Good private location, quiet, serene. Met expectations."
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"After multiple stays at The Cabin, I'll look for it next month when back in the Sonora area. The chances of it being available get slimmer by the month. This is the place to stay in the Columbia/Sonora area."
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Cute little cabin in Sonora, we used it as a home base to go to the snow. The location is great, 10 mins away from downtown for access to restaurants and shops. The host was very responsive, flexible and friendly.
The small kitchen has all the basic needs including coffee maker. We had a great stay and would love to come back."
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful little place for a perfect getaway if you’re from a larger city. Private, secluded, with beautiful views of the ranch from the windows. Everything you could ask for, comfortable bed, adequate lighting, amenities. Great stay for two."
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We were very happy with the cottage. It was just what we were looking for. It was clean and tidy and the location was very nice. The communication by the host was prompt and she was very accommodating. We will certainly stay there again!
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Joe and Leigh's was the perfect stay for a weekend getaway to Sonora, Columbia, and the Stanislaus National Forest. Leigh in particular was very helpful with getting checked and gave us a very flexible timeframe to work with that accommodated our schedule. As was forewarned, the building is very old, so, visiting in February it could be a little chilly, even with the heater running. For the price, this stay is pretty darn hard to beat! Would certainly stay again."
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,I absolutely loved the accommodations and hope to return sometime soon!
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Thank you Joe for clear communication before starting the trip. Quiet and peaceful.
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We spent 1 night in this very cute cottage near Sonora. It has everything you need for the space, including a hot plate for cooking small meals. Additionally, Joe and Leigh provided very clear instructions and were very communicative."
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Thanks so much for the memorable experience. The reading nook is just too good!
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Super grateful for airbnbs such as this that are not only comfortable and convenient but also affordable. This old little cottage had a sweet charm and all the basics one would need if you are not a high-maintenance guest. My niece and I took advantage of all the little nooks and cranny's and felt at ease the whole time. It is a little chilly even with the heater on (floors specifically) so bring some layers. They do have a nice wall heater in the bathroom that was a big plus. The location is quiet and beautiful - woke up to the view of their property and all of their animals.
Very close to downtown Sonora! Overall a great experience."

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"What an idyllic place! Highly recommended. It was a stopover between San Francisco and Yosemite for us, but you could definitely entertain yourself here for more than one night. The cottage is almost even more fun than what you see in the pictures and all the comforts."

2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Beautiful stay. I loved that there was no TV, that the host's horses were 25 feet from the back porch, being immersed in woods, dark at night. The place is small, comfortable, inspiring, clean. I had a chance to talk to the host and that was truly a bonus. Very close to Columbia and Sonora. If you're looking for a place to unplug and relax, this is it. Highly recommend!"

2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had an AMAZING time at this cabin in the beautiful Sonora area last week! The location was fantastic, and even with a power outages because of intense rainstorm, it didn't dampen our enjoyment of the place. Joe and Leigh, our hosts, were incredibly welcoming and made our first experience with Airbnb perfect .
The cabin itself had everything we needed for a cozy retreat with your loved ones, making it perfect for couples seeking a romantic getaway. It looks even better in person We used it as our base to explore the area and even managed to squeeze in a visit to Yosemite on the last day after check-out.
Also, thanks to Joe's recommendations, we visited all the spots he suggested, and we loved every one of them. His local insights added an extra layer of enjoyment to our trip.
Honestly, our ONLY regret is that we didn't stay longer – it's a magic place you won't want to leave! We would definitely rent it again in the future."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"My, well, multiple stay at Joe's cabin, lost track of the number of stays. When in the Sonora area, I look here first. It isn't always available, then I have to book #2 in the area."

I highly recommand to stay at this place!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The place is a dream, it is beautifully decorated. We felt immediately comfortable. My daughter was allowed to feed the horses with Leigh and walk the ranch. We still got tips for a good cafe in Sonora, the city is also highly recommended. 1000 thanks for the wonderful time."

2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Joe was super quick to respond to any and all messages and even offered to give us suggestions for food or things to see/ do. Overall our stay was so lovely and the cottage had everything we needed and more to accommodate us for the few days we stayed. Yosemite was gorgeous and this was a great option for us since everything in Yosemite was pretty booked/ expensive. So I highly recommend! Also the horses outside were a total plus, they are beautiful creatures that just added to the overall serenity of the cottage."

He wanted to offer nice restaurants right away, but we had already arranged food in the cottage. Nice rocking chairs outside and a very cute bay window in the house. Our overnight stay was better then expected!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Loved our stay at Joe’s place. The cottage was simple but had everything we needed. Definitely make sure you ask Joe for some recommendations on what to do and where to eat in the area, we went to the places he suggested and had an amazing time. Highlights were Mandy’s in Columbia and Kennedy Meadows Resort near Sonora Pass. Definitely worth the drive up into any of the national parks nearby.
Joe was super accommodating and very friendly. He also communicated clearly and promptly. Ask him for a tour of the ranch, we did and got to hang out with some of the horses and donkeys.
Overall we had an amazing albeit too short stay and we will definitely be looking to stay a little longer next time to take in the surroundings properly."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"For a small getaway, it was absolutely perfect. From the quiet & private cottage. To waking up & watching horses, donkeys and goats walk around. It was perfect. He even gave us a tour of the horses and let us pet the animals.
Was very responsive, helpful upon check in, & gave us some recommendations for food. Everything needed was inside that little cottage to just escape for a day."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Joe was one of the most accommodating hosts we’ve ever stayed with. The property is up on the hill from their farm and very cozy, quiet and a nice space to park right in front of it. The perfect tiny home. A great place to stop on the way home from Yosemite. Would absolutely love to stay again!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Very easy to communicate with Joe. Beautiful place to stay. Joe is present near the cabin and quick to respond. Horses and dogs are a plus, but only if you want to go to them; otherwise they will leave you alone. Very quiet and great stay overall"

2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Great little place to stay about 7min drive from Sonora which has a variety of restaurants and other amenities. From Yosemite Big Oak Flat entrance, about 1h 15 mins. The space itself is airy and peaceful, overlooking the garden. Joe was friendly and very responsive."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Wonderful place to stay! Joe was super friendly, helpful and communicative. The house was peaceful, homey, and comfortable (bed especially!)

2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Joe was great to communicate with. Cute place with a comfy bed.
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We loved getting to stay in this renovated mining cabin from the 1800’s. The location is so beautiful and peaceful! It was also fun to get to watch the horses below. The only suggestion I can even think of to make this an even better Air B&B than it is, is to cover the windows with some thicker curtains so as to ensure more privacy for guests. Other than that, we throughly enjoyed our time there!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We had a great time!!! Adorable cabin and we loved seeing the horses next door
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Joe's place was a beautiful getaway right near Yosemite! It truly felt like a little magical escape.

Also a very comfortable sleep! Would definitely recommend Joe's place and would come again in the future!"

Clean, quiet, comfortable, trees, horses, sometimes deer. Two thumbs up."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Very cute little place. Served us well for one night on the way from Yosemite to San Fran. The place is adorably decorated. The bathroom is pretty tiny so heads up if you're not smaller than average or don't like small spaces. Very cute spot!
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is my favorite place I’ve stayed on Air BnB yet! The cottage is adorable, private, and cozy, with beautiful nature and animals surrounding—the perfect getaway! Joe and Leigh were kind and very responsive. Leigh even encouraged me to pet the horses when I asked. :)
As a remote worker on zoom/teams meetings all day, I know I always look for wifi reviews in these. The wifi here is great! I was able to do all work phone/video/email communication needed with no issue or lag, and streamed movies at night.
If you’re looking for an affordable, stinking cute home to be in serene nature, while close to town (Sonora, Columbia, and Murphy’s are all near) and recreation (we checked out New Malones, Moaning Caverns, and Big Trees State Park!), this is your spot!"
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is what Aibnbs used to be like. Special spaces with a personal touch. Not just a bedroom in a condo. Cute Casita on a lovely property, right in gold country and not far from Yosemite.
Hosts are super responsive, happy to recommend hikes, etc.
great wifi, hot water, safe hood, would stay again."

2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We enjoyed staying at the cottage. Joe was very friendly and even took us around his property to visit horses, donkeys, and a goat. The location was private and cozy. Highly recommend for a little farm style getaway!"
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We loved our stay in this adorable little mountain cottage! It was so sweet and cozy!

Joe was an excellent host, and the city of Sonora was beautiful and had everything we needed."
2023-03-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"Nice quiet location, but also a quick drive to downtown. Space is good for two. Pillows are very soft, but comfortable firm bed. Shower may be a tight space if you're taller than 6ft. We had a good stay and Joe is very responsive host!"
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This would have been my 3rd or 4th stay in the cabin but my schedule changed & I was not able to stay. Communication with Joe is great & I have booked another stay in the Cabin. Great place.

2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"My 2nd stay at Joe's Cabin, which tells you all you need to know, it's worth another stay, must have been good the 1st time 'round, which it was. If this place is available the next time I'm in Sonora, I will book here."

2023-02-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"We loved our stay at the cabin! Waking up in the morning and having the ability to make our own breakfast was nice. It was also wonderful to watch the animals being fed as we ate breakfast! Overall a great stay 👍 only things to really note were that there were no blinds anywhere to get true privacy, and that included the bathroom which didn’t have any coverings at all…but we weren’t too stressed about it 😅"

Joe is an incredible host, he was very helpful, giving us great advice. He is also incredibly responsive to all of our messages.

2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This is the perfect getaway for couples! It's a small cottage that packs a big romantic punch. Cozy with twinkle lights outside. There's no stove so plan to eat out, but there's a mini fridge for snacks and a microwave for left overs. There were a couple games to play in the house and some local guide books with recommendations. The host Joe was very responsive and attentive to our needs. We'll definitely be returning!"
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We had a lovely time at Joe's place. His local recommendations were super helpful and he is an excellent communicator. We celebrated my daughter's 16th birthday in Yosemite and it was quite memorable ❤️
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Perfect couple retreat! The main house is far enough away that we just felt like a neighbor.
We stayed on Christmas and Joe had a beautiful Christmas tree in the window and bonus... my fiancé and I got engaged Christmas night in the cabin!!!

We will be back!!❤️"

Thank you Joe for your hospitality"

2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a lovely 2 night stay at the little cottage.
This is your perfect place if you want to enjoy nature, relax and maybe explore the nearby villages.
The cottage consists of a bedroom with a little table for two, a newly renovated kitchen and a bathroom. The furnishing is beautiful and functional - the pictures in the description are (currently) 100% accurate.
In front of the building, a small patio with rocking chairs invites for a breakfast coffee or afternoon beer. From the patio, you have a perfect overview of the property of Joe and Leigh and it is great fun to observe the various animals. We were even allowed to help feeding the horses, donkeys and the little goat.
Joe was the nicest host you could imagine, we highly recommend this lovely place!"

The hosts were even super accommodating when I had to make changes to my reservation! The only drawback, and I mean literally only drawback, is when the futon bed was pulled out, it was extremely close to the foot of the other bed. We kind of felt on top of each other but it was family so it was all good!"

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Katie and Len's place was perfect! Tucked away but walkable to all the spots downtown. Bed was sooo comfortable, and the place was super cute and clean.
You can tell how much thought and effort Katie and Len have put into making the place nice for their guests. We also briefly met Len, and he was super nice! Would definitely stay here again."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Nice little bungalow. Super close to downtown. Perfect spot for our needs.
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I really enjoyed stopping in the charming town Sonora on my road trip! The highlight was seeing an outstanding show at the Sierra Rep Theatre. I had read the shows were exceptional and was not disappointed. Columbia State Historic Park is another gem to be experienced along with Mandy's Breakfast House. The unit was just what I needed...easy to get into, parking right in front of unit, cozy and very comfortable bed. I loved the Ugg bedding so much I want to purchase it for home. The hosts also provided snacks and coffee which was appreciated."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The Carriage House was a peaceful and lovely stay. Immaculate clean! Perfect for a weekend in Sonora. We met the hosts and they mentioned the structure was originally a carriage house in the 1890’s. Of course now completely updated and fitted to be a comfortable modern suite. Very cool!
Minutes walk from Downtown Sonora, but tucked away up on the hill and quiet with great views. We’ll be staying again!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great place to stay and Len and Katie are very helpful, friendly hosts. There are limited self-catering facilities but who needs that when there are so many good bars, restaurants and bagel bars within a short walk! Even if you don't plan to stay there, Sonora is a great place to visit."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is a perfect spot for my work trips!! Cute little table and chairs, super comfortable bed, and spacious lovely bathroom! Will definitely be staying here again!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very nice home. Our stay great. Parking was off street and secure. The only thing I would to have known in advance was about the steep hill to get to the home. It's like San Francisco... lol.. but we made it!

2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We enjoyed staying here for our short stay. It is well located in a quite street but still near everything like shops and restaurants. It's about a 60mi drive from Yosemite NP. So if you leave on time you have plenty of time to enjoy the NP.
The place was nicely decorated, very cosy. The little patio area was really nice and we enjoyed sitting there. Maybe a bit small if you would staywith more than 3p.
The hosts live at the location. They're very friendly and welcoming but still give you all the privacy you need. They're also very helpful.
We would stay again"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay for a couple of nights. If you’re going to Yosemite it is quite a drive. 1 hour to enter the park but another hour drive to actually get to the valley. Overall we enjoyed our stay and would definitely recommend to people.
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This place was so nice. Had everything we needed! It is further than Yosemite than we anticipated but we could have done more research beforehand.

He recommended some awesome tourist points of destination. We had a wonderful time! A great way to celebrate and relax. The space was incredibly functional and the bed was very comfortable. We look forward to booking with them again in the future!

2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a quick visit to Sonora for a wedding and this was an amazing location! We appreciate the welcome sign, clean and comfortable lodging and ample local recommendations as soon as we entered the space, and it’s walkability to Sonora was an added perk. Small word of caution for anyone with accessibility considerations looking to stay here as it is a very steep uphill/downhill, but it wasn’t a problem for us. Overall, we’ll worth the value and highly recommended."
2023-04-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Katie and Len were great hosts. We stayed for a wedding and this was our first AirBnb experience and they made it very easy. Always quick to respond, clear and thorough instructions, all the necessary amenities and more. The cottage was very clean and access to the driveway was very much appreciated. My only complaint was the bed was not very comfortable. But other than that, quiet neighborhood and very short walking distance onto the main town street to check out all true local shops was very nice."

The carriage house was cozy and comfortable and we had no trouble settling in. The neighborhood is peaceful and quiet and within walking distance of the main streets. Sonora is a great little city and along with the cities surrounding it, there was plenty to see and do. We checked out Columbia State Historic Park and had a great time. We are definitely interested in returning to experience some of the local festivities like Christmas Town. Would recommend!"
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"What a Gem of a place they have here. Very welcoming and just felt like a home away from home. We had the opportunity to meet Katie and Len they are so friendly and helpful. Thank you again for an awesome stay!

2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My sister and I spend 6 days at this lovely Airbnb, and really enjoyed our time there. The unit was clean, attractive and comfortable, and the location was quiet. Katie and Len were wonderful hosts, and responded very quickly if we had a question.
The unit is just a couple of blocks away from the fascinating main street, which had eclectic and very interesting little shops. It’s just a 5-minute downhill walk to get there, but the walk back is steep. However, at 71 years old, I did the walk to and from the main street a few times, and enjoyed it.
Booklovers MUST visit ‘The Thirsty Prospector’, an intriguing second hand bookshop that also sells beer and ice cream. I had an ice cream and it was absolutely delicious!
All-in-all, our stay at this Airbnb was very enjoyable, and we’re hoping to stay there again. Thank you, Katie and Len for being such good hosts."

Very private carriage house with lovely views from all windows. Very respectful, responsive owners!"
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We stayed at Katie and Len's place during a weekend ski trip at Dodge Ridge. It was perfect for a couple friends who needed a comfortable place to crash after a long day of skiing. It was exactly as described and the location is excellent — it's a 4 minute walk from downtown Sonora, where we found a ton of restaurant options we could choose from. The studio is perfect — warm and cozy — and very well-appointed with all the amenities that we could hope for. I've stayed at a few other Airbnbs in the Twain Harte/Sonora/Jamestown areas, and this one was the best one by far. I'll definitely stay here again if we're there next season."

2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"If you are looking for perfection in your airbnb you will not experience anything less while staying at Katie and Len's carriage house. After a 7 hour drive (which began after a full day's work) we were exhausted and stressed when we pulled up to the Carriage house in the early morning hours. With the porch light on, an empty driveway feet away from the front door, and the home just as it appeared in the photos a sense of peacefulness immediately overcame us. The peaceful feeling only intensified as we walked through the front door and saw all the welcoming touches, spotless interior and beds with beautiful linens. We slept great and when we woke up and saw the beautiful surrounding landscape our positive experience continued. Katie and Len went above and beyond to accommodate unusual circumstances related to our trip, and they were so kind in their communications with us. Thank you Katie and Len! All the work you do to provide a perfect experience is sincerely appreciated. Can't wait to stay at the Carriage house again!"

Katie and Len are very friendly and responsive hosts, who made us feel very welcome.
The location is also excellent. It's only a 5-minute walk to Sonora's beautiful main street with good restaurants, and we enjoyed exploring nearby historic Columbia (8-minute drive). The kids also enjoyed our daytrip to Leland High Sierra Snowplay (35 miles up 108).
Eight thumbs up from us for a perfect getaway."
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Katie and Len’s place is cozy and very comfortable and had everything we needed for a stay with our 3 year old including kids’ books she was delighted to have us read her.

Downtown Sonora is just a short walk but is far enough away that the unit is quiet and peaceful, and there’s lots more to explore within driving distance.

2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The Carriage House is aesthetically designed for small-scale comfort inside and out. If you enjoy exploring historical old towns on foot, you’ve found an ideal location here, as well as for several other historical Gold Rush towns by car. We found our host attentive to our needs, respectful of our privacy, and eager to make our stay special. We highly recommend The Carriage House for aesthetic comfort, location, and value."

Thank you so much!! They are the perfect hosts 🙂"
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This was my first time staying at an Airbnb and we had the very best experience. It is such a charming place and Katie thought of everything that we would need. The location was perfect too. So close to Downtown. We will be staying here every time we visit Sonora!!!
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This is a lovely place to stay in Sonora. Its off the main road just enough to be blissfully quiet but close enough to walk to main street if you want. Accommodation is clean and you can see clearly its taken care of with much care and thought.
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Outstanding accommodations close to historic downtown Sonora. Will chk availability for next trip through the area.
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The location is close to downtown but away from the main street so it remains very quiet at night. The cottage is cosy, as well as tastefully and thoughtfully appointed. I have rented many homes before, and frankly, this is THE one that consistently checks every single box for hospitality, cleanliness, quaintness, comfort and value."
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Katie and Len’s place was fantastic! It is exactly what they advertise- a small but comfortable place right next to downtown Sonora. The place was clean and their communication was fantastic. It was the perfect place to come to after a long day at Yosemite.
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was a last minute booking for us. We just needed some time away for a couple of days. It was so perfect and so relaxing. Opening the windows in the carriage house and listening to the fountain with some meditation, is what I needed. The place had everything and is so close to town. Waking up and going to the farmers market on Saturday right down the street, was great! There are planting of restaurants near by and great places to sit and relax in town or at the carriage house. We will hopefully return again."
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I want to give 6 stars for location… literally a 2 minute walk from Saturday farmers market, another minute from all the shops and dining on Washington Street. If you want to stay “in” Sonora downtown, I don’t see how one could do better. The town has changed a ton since I was last here; very hip and alive with activity, yet the only thing we heard at the Carriage House was wind and birds. Owners have made the most of style and amenities in this cozy retreat. I could literally live there as-is and be quite happy. Tremendous vacation value."

2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This place is a gem, and honestly one of the nicest Airbnb’s we’ve ever stayed at. Katie and Len really went above and beyond to make our stay comfortable: from a personalized greeting on a chalkboard, to impeccably made beds, and delicious coffee. We felt very pampered.
The location of the coach house (a historical building and modernized throughout) also can’t be beat, and downtown is literally a two minute walk away. The house is very quiet, bed comfortable and clean as a whistle.
Thank you again, Katie and Len!"

The heat coming through from the bathroom ceiling exhaust fan while you shower was a surprising but nice touch!
The yummy snacks were also a great touch after traveling over an hour to get to Sonora. She pretty much provides all the necessary staples and then some and we appreciated it very much. If you do forget anything there are many grocery stores near by and restaurants as well.

2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Mr Richard's place was absolutely fantastic and amazing to stay at... lots of scenery beautifulpets different kinds of ranch animals he's easygoing down to earth polite makes you feel like you are right at home everything was outstandingly perfect to perfection I will most definitely be back and I highly recommend if you are passing through sonora to make reservations with Mr Richard
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Richard was a great host. We got in later in the evening and had missed the messages he had sent with access code so he came out to make sure we got the code. Feels so peaceful and calm out there. It is dark enough at night to see the stars from inside the studio. For just me and my wife this was a great getaway. I can’t emphasize enough how beautiful the drive and surroundings were. Would definitely stop by again if we ever came back to California.
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Everything was as listed. We arrived around midnight, and Richard still greeted us. We enjoyed our stay. It's in a quiet area. The beds were comfortable. It was a little difficult to determine which house it was because the area was very dark. Met our expectations."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a great stay at Richard’s studio apartment. It was very comfortable and everything was shiny and new looking.
The location was ideal for exploring the area making day trips really easy."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This studio is located away from a main road so it feels secluded, serene at night, quiet."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Richard's place was perfect for a weekend getaway. It was so peaceful and quiet - exactly what I needed. You're in the country but it's only a 8 minute drive into town. I'd definitely recommend staying here!
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We love staying here…it is a home away from home. This is not our first visit nor will it be our last for when we are in the Sonora area
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"Richard's place is a beautiful hidden hideaway. I stayed for 2 weeks and asked for extra time. It really felt like going home instead of a ""rental room"". Richard was a joy to talk to and was very understanding of my needs. I will definitely be back again!
Richard, Thanks so much for your hospitality! I consider you a friend!

Richard is an attentive host and comes out to greet you, great touch! I will stay here again if he isn’t booked up! One of the best Airbnb in the area!"
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Thank you, Richard. You were a great host and I wish we got had more time to get to know you. The place was cozy and couldn’t have been more pristine. Beautiful property which I wish we had had time to explore more. We’ll never stay in a motel in town again. This was perfect."
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Another wonderful stay at Richard's studio! As always, the place was clean and inviting. Fresh ground coffee was provided! We love staying at this beautiful, peaceful place nestled by the trees and stream! We will be back!"

2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Richard met us as we drove up and was hospitable and friendly the whole stay.  Thanks for allowing us to stay in your superb studio. He was kind enough to share freshly grounded coffee powder with us and coffee was superb! A very charismatic man with some amazing life stories to tell! Never once minded the conversation! He was kind enough to show us his guitar shop and an amazing gifted person, making really nice guitars. The studio was quite comfortable, clean and safe. It was a perfect place for us to rest our heads in the evening after skiing. We look forward to staying there again, sometime."
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The place is in a roomy attic over a garage. This allows you privacy. Everything was spotless, convenient and thoughtful. Granite counters. A big screen tv. A guitar and uke to play with.
There is a refrigerator and sink, but only a microwave to cook with"
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We have stayed here many times! Beautiful surroundings, studio is very clean and quite cozy. Will be back again. The host is friendly and has good recommendations if you don’t know the area."
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"As always, Richard's place was peaceful and relaxing. It feels so comfortable there! We have tried other places in the area and nothing compares. The studio is always immaculate and the bed is so comfortable! We just keep coming back!"
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was one of the best Airbnbs I’ve ever stayed at! Immaculately clean, great use of space, and so warm and cozy at night. Felt right at home. Richard was a great host, took the time to orient me to the studio when I arrived. It was obvious how much he cared about the comfort of his guests. Hope to stay there again in the future."
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Wonderful out-of-the way, peaceful setting. Very clean and comfortable. Richard is a very accommodating host."

2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Just a wonderful venue….cozy, clean, easy access and quiet. What more can you ask for? You will not be disappointed if you chose to stay at this gem!"
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Richard and Debbie's studio apartment is a wonderful place to spend few days or longer. The studio is in a separate building with separate entrance, plenty of parking.
The location is at the end of a cul-de-sac and truly is surrounded by nature, the day I was leaving we saw 2 baby fans crossing through the backyard.
The unit itself was spotless and was very well equipped. pretty much a full kitchen, just lacking a full oven, but it did have a toaster oven. Frig, microwave, cabinets full of dishes and cooking utensils are all here.
comfortable bed, full sofa, your own outdoor balcony, TV (Internet based), plus WiFi. A short drive to downtown Sonora and to Columbia State Park, plus only a bit over an hour to the Yosemite National Park
Richard & Debbie are very laid back and respect your privacy fully, but they are very good people and have very interesting lives.
I highly recommend their wonderful studio 😊"
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Richard was a perfect host! We truly enjoyed our stay.
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"My son and I spent two unforgettable nights at Richard and Debbie's house!
The studio on the 2nd floor is exactly what we needed. Very comfortable, perfectly clean and peaceful place to stay. Richard was a wonderful host, he told us about local places of interest and let us meet his dogs (my son loves dogs). The very best recommendations. We will definitely stay here again when we travel in the future."
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Our stay was wonderful. A peaceful quiet setting and beautiful, exceptionally clean, and comfotable space."
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great place, 2 hours from Yosemite. Next time I’d probably stay closer to the park but this was a good option for the money. The hosts are lovely and the nearby town of Columbia was worth a visit."
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Awesome suite well off the road which allowed for peace and quiet at the end of a long work day. I was in town alone on business and Richard’s place was perfect. He’s a wonderful host. Met me as I arrived and welcomed me.
If I could suggest anything, it would be to add a few hooks and hangers to hang dress clothes. And the stairs up are a little narrow and I had difficulty hefting my big, heavy suitcase up. But I didn’t ask for help. My guess is Richard would lend a hand.
I’ll stay again when I’m in town if it’s available!"
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I really like staying here when I’m in town on business. The location is quiet, but not too far out from Sonora. The property is great, all you need for a long stay. The host goes above and beyond as well, really a great experience."
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Super great spot in a relaxing part of town! Has lots of great appliances and accommodations that made our stay wonderful!
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,It was a much better place to stay than the photos on the wall. I liked the tidy accommodation and the peaceful neighborhood atmosphere.
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"A very comfortable studio furnished with great taste and very well-equipped,
You can cook with an electric stove that's in a closet,
Very quiet location in nature,
Richard is available and thoughtful and we loved being able to stay longer to chat with him
The studio is 1:10 from the entrance to Yosemite Park."
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Nice, clean, and comfortable. It was perfect for the three of us. Great location for adventuring. We would definitely recommend a stay."

2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Loved this spot! Super cute and very clean! Highly recommend!
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great location off a very quiet street. Owners live on site, which we found very handy. Being able to look for treasures was a huge plus! Didn’t find gold, it isn’t always the finding but the adventure of getting out and getting fresh air. Studio is upstairs and is all usable space. Had everything we needed. Close to Sonora and Columbia. Was able to explore both. Could have easily stayed longer. Keeping this in my favorites!"
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Super safe, quiet and private. I slept very well! Richard was super helpful. I would return."
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place. Area around it was quiet and peaceful. Woke to the sound of beautiful birds each morning. Studio was clean and well appointed for our stay. We would definitely stay here again.
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Richard went above and beyond to make sure we had everything in order and did not need anything. It is a beautiful property and the actual Airbnb is so cozy and comfortable! Would recommend to anyone!
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is a gem of a studio apt! Super clean and perfect for what I needed. The location is wonderful as I was hiking in Yosemite over the weekend and needed a “home base” for a few nights. Richard is a super nice guy! And made sure everything was alright for me. The studio is built over the garage, which is detached from the house. It’s really ideal as I felt like I really had my own place. At the same time, I knew Richard was just in the next house if anything came up. I highly recommend staying here! :)."
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Richard is amazing! Not only is he a great host but the place is beautiful. The view in the morning was amazing and the stars at night are breathtaking! Overall an amazing stay!!
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This studio is the best. We stayed here many times and keep coming back. The host has excellent communication. Very quiet beautiful setting. Definitely feels country but close to Columbia, Sonora and Jamestown. I highly recommend it."

Loved our stay."
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We had an amazing stay at this studio and will be back when we travel through this area!! Very cute and clean!
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Nice and cozy, super nice host, and in a quiet area"
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is such a lovely place to stay while in Sonora. The property is beautiful and the space is very well appointed, clean, and comfortable. Richard is a kind and attentive host as well!"
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Richard is a wonderful host, and his studio is the perfect spot for a weekend getaway. Highly recommend!"
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Purchased the stay as a gift for for my son and daughter-in-law. She is finishing up her advanced degree and they needed a break. They said they had a wonderful time. Lots of hiking in the area. Great stay!
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Great location, somehow magically just five minutes from Sonora, Columbia, AND Jamestown. Richard was very nice and welcoming, while being just the right amount available- never breathing down our necks or anything. The place felt very private and homey, and it was great having a place to cook some meals so we weren't eating it all the time. We'll definitely be back!

Fun bonus: there's a couple Emu and some pigs that you'll see along the way between the studio apartment and old town Sonora- we pulled over and watched them for a minute with our kid, which was a fun little treat.
We visited with our 3 year old and had a great time exploring the area- especially Columbia. We missed it, but if you happen to be in town on the second Saturday any month they have all kinds of fun stuff going on, plus Columbia has some incredible sounding activities throughout the year- Victorian Easter egg hunt, forth of July festivities, etc. We'll definitely look up some of that stuff more and plan our next trip around it. Of course, our kid was happy to just explore and climb on the rocks just there next to the main state park area, but it'd be nice to do something extra fancy some other time... and Richards place was a great home base for it!"
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was such a beautiful little studio will all the things stocked up. We had a great stay at Richard place . He was very helpful in suggesting places of interest nearby . He was very kind to give snow boots , snow suite fir my son since it snowed abs we wanted to go for sledding.
Will looking forward to staying at his place if we visit sonara or nearby place in future
I recommend his place for anyone who wants to enjoy the stay with beautiful nature surrounding the house"
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"I stayed for a month in this small unit above Richard’s guitar shop, close to their residence. He and his wife Debbie are really cool people, and made me feel welcome as an aging Bay Area type. Their place is secluded and rich with both nature—including a surprisingly long trail through the woods behind—and dogs. They mind the dogs well, but I enjoyed petting them from time to time. There is a small open porch for the unit. It was fun to see the lovely snow fall on the forest and yard from there.
The unit is cute and cozy. Take note that there is no stove: he has provided a microwave, a cooktop appliance, and a toaster oven, which are tucked away in a cabinet. There is no closet."
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This studio is cozy on a beautiful piece of land. It is furnished well and has all that one needs for a getaway. Will definitely stay there again. The host was very available during our stay.
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Absolutely loved the private and peaceful setting of this cute little get-away! Close to town, but you feel like you're in the country! Never heard any noises from the owners, traffic, neighbors, or anyone! Definitely a wonderful place to stay if you need a little R & R in Sonora! :-)"
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Fantastic space, very clean, quiet and very close to downtown Sonora. Richard is a wonderful and crafty person, great to talk to.
Make sure to visit Mercer Cavern, lots of steps up and down, but very worthy! Downtown Sonora has everything you’ll need including lots of live music on the weekend."
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,I loved this spotlessly clean studio (reassuring in this pandemic). I have food allergies so when I realized that there wasn't a stove top in the studio (I didn't notice that in the pictures/descriptions) I was a little dismayed. But after looking in the cupboards I discovered a lovely convection burner (& the cookware to go with it) & a countertop toaster oven. Hooray! I was in business and could cook my food for the 3 day stay. I plan on staying here anytime I need a place in Sonora. I highly recommend this place. There are stairs so next time I will lighten my suitcase!
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,Richard and Debbie are phenomenal hosts and we felt at home at Lavender Lane. It is five minutes from Columbia and Sonora and so private. We loved our time at this studio.
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The suite was exactly as shown in the pictures. It was bright, cozy, and clean. Freshly cut roses were a lovely and welcoming touch. The mattress was on the softer side. As it is a bright space, if you plan on sleeping in make sure to bring a sleeping mask with you. The internet speed was a bit slow. Richard sent a message letting us know early check in is available, which was much appreciated. He welcomed us personally with a smile, making sure we know he is available if we need anything. Overall we had a nice and pleasant stay."
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This retreat guest suite is simply the best. A private little deck to enjoy your morning coffee while you hear roosters crowing in the distance. The bed is amazing! The owner is happy to share fun places to go
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Nice place. Very clean. I would definitely stay there again!
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Wonderful place to stay in Gold Rush Country! Very clean and comfortable. The host responds very quickly to questions and requests. Convenient location to Columbia, Sonora, Jamestown, & Yosemite."
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Richard was very communicative and made our short stay great! The place was clean and comfortable and had everything we needed for an overnight stay before heading to yosemite. Richard made sure we had everything we needed. Would definitely stay again!
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Such a beautiful spot! A great place to call “home” while we were visiting the area. A very comfortable and cozy place to stay for a long weekend. It had everything we needed, including a fridge/freezer, microwave, and the most comfortable queen bed. Would definitely come back here again and recommend others to stay here as well."
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Very nice place, quiet and peaceful"
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Accurate description, comfortable place! No complaints."
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Richard was an exceptional host with a beautiful space that he rents out to his guests. Sonora is also a charming town with plenty of cafes and eateries. I'd absolutely go back again.
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Clean, efficient, spacious. Close to a lot of restaurants and lovely nature."
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great place, great price, exceptionally clean, quiet and comfortable. Richard is a great host. He goes above and beyond what is expected. Highly recommend this place."
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The Studio is meticulously clean. Check-in was a breeze and Richard is a super host. The biggest surprise for me was waking up in the middle of the night and looking up through the skylight to see bright stars in the sky. I did not want to go back to sleep. Haha.
I'm definitely staying with Richard the next time I'm in the area. It was a very pleasant experience."
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"A great Stay !
Post our Yosemite trips, it was very comforting to come back at the Studio, Lavender Lane; indeed felt like home with all facilities in kitchen. Location was an absolute delight - close to nature. With gas station , Walmart and other convenience stores close by , we didn't have to look far off for necessities.
Richard has been a warm and friendly host- quick to respond!"
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Warm and communicative host, comfy and roomy accommodations, beautiful surroundings. I'd definitely stay here again."
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Hard to imagine a better place to stay in the Sonora area. Extremely well-stocked kitchen with updated, newish utensils, pots, and pans, even spices. Very clean, pillow-top feeling mattress. Richard invited us to come to a bluegrass jam in the historical town of Columbia the evening we arrived. We were staying here for seeing Yosemite but Columbia is a worthwhile place to visit as well. Coverage with Sprint was not great in the area so remembering your key access code (last 4 of your phone #) is a good idea. Would love to stay again."
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful place, great host! We will be coming back!"
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place is a gem, quiet, cozy, sparkling clean, all you need for a nice retreat away or a comfy place to stay while touristing nearby. Super comfy bed (note the skylight above if you want to sleep in bring eye coverings), kitchenette has all you need, I didn't do electronics except to listen to music on my phone but wifi works great, TV and DVDs available, couch and chair to cozy up and read (or watch), but a real treat is the small private deck, enjoyed breakfast etc. out there. Some fresh roses from their yard, fresh ground coffee that was amazing, great chats with Richard about the art of making guitars etc. Nice short walk along a creekbed nearby. Easy to find, Richard is a great host and communication smooth. I love that it's near Sonora and easy drive to hiking spots etc nearby, but enough off the beaten path to be private poked in among some trees. Loved my stay!"
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay! Super comfy and clean!
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Literally the best airbnb I’ve ever stayed in and in a great location. Its only 5 mins from downtown Sonora and about the same distance to Dragoon Gulch. Meticulously clean, beautiful, and homey. Ask Richard about guitar making!"
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Richard’s studio is very cozy and very relaxing. Him and his wife are always there to answer any questions you might have or to just chitchat. My girlfriend and I really loved the place and we hope to return.
2021-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We didn’t stay for long but this place was wonderful. We visited Yosemite and it was a great place in a town about an hour from the park. Richard was so kind and the bed was crazy comfortable! I would definitely recommend this place in a cute little town
2021-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"A lovely airbnb on a nice piece of property with a great host. The airbnb itself is thoughtfully laid out, well appointed, super comfortable, and very clean. There are great views of nature out back and a nice deck to enjoy the weather. Richard is a gracious host and even provided some fresh ground coffee for us to use. My friend and I had a great time and we would definitely stay here again."
2021-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We would highly recommend Richards place to anyone, especially those interested in a quiet country setting, near many things to explore. Richard was able to welcome us, as we had hoped, and made our stay easy and fun! His studio seemed to have anything one might need and was very nice and clean. He was available for anything we needed."
2021-04-01,4.0,Stayed one night,Great place!!! Very quiet and peaceful location and Richard is super nice..
2021-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Richard's studio was cozy, comfortable and the perfect space and size for me and my two friends. We stayed for a weekend to visit Yosemite and Stanislaus National Forest and it was a great location between the two. The studio is separate from the main house so there is a lot of privacy and check in was a breeze. Richard was very responsive and welcoming. I will definitely plan to stay here again for more trips to Yosemite."
2021-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Where do I begin?? First of all, Richard is so down to earth and conscientious of his guests needs. You don't notice at first, but the little things like an electric kettle (my husband loved it so much, we just ordered it on Amazon), detailed explanations for TV use, access code entry (to keys to keep track of!), and every appliance I could need. We walked through his property and I felt like Snow White in the woods. The weather was perfect during our stay and we got to enjoy the deer, turkeys, llama and alpaca next door, but I really fell in love with Lila, Rosie, and Eva... Richards place was central to many of the activities we had planned and it was so nice to come back to rest every evening. Bonus... we go to hear him play guitar. Beautiful."
2021-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Located in a serene and remote environment. About couple of hours from Yosemite valley and pretty close to Columbia state park.
Richard was a great host and provided tips about the local attractions."
2021-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great hosts, very friendly and helpful. The place was very clean and charming. Was the perfect spot to unwind and relax at the end of a long day of hiking and skiing, woke up to views of fresh snow on the ground!"

2021-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Was such a pleasant little place. Perfect little studio for my kids and I. We enjoyed the time there and loved being around all that nature. Would definitely recommend this place.
2021-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place is great, warm and comfortable. We’re so glad that I could stay here during our vacation. The house is above the garage and the owner’s work place, is separated to main house so it’s really quiet all the time. There is compact AC so inside of the house is pretty warm and comfortable in winter. About the location, there is downtown of Sonora near there about 10 min driving so you can go get some food and small gifts easily. Also, there are some great shops there such as a bagel store, tea place, Thai restrain and more. You can even get some Japanese food! The owner, Richard is very easy to talk. He responded my questions immediately which was really helpful. Also, he said that we can play a guitar that hangs on the wall in this house. We’d like to come here in the future for sure!!"
2021-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This place is awesome!! Everything you need in a home away from home. The host was very accommodating and communicative, can't wait to come back!"

2019-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Now I can say that the reviews I read about Richard’s place prior to booking my stay, are spot on. This charming studio nestled up high, is a breath of fresh air. It has plenty of natural light, comfortable furnishings and it’s just the right amount of quiet. Also, as others mentioned, the bed is extremely comfortable. I don’t want to build it up too much because then I may have difficulty booking a future stay! To match the great place is an absolutely great host."
2019-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"A wonderful space! We stayed an evening after taking our son to the Jamestown Polar Express, and the studio suited our needs perfectly.

2019-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Staying at the loft was incredible. Richard was extremely responsive and accommodated our request for an early check-in. Shortly before our stay, PG&E notified the City of Sonora that they may be performing a public safety power shutoff. Richard immediately provided us with the update and offered us several options, including refunding our stay. We decided to keep our reservation and Richard was prepared with a generator, solar-powered lights and chests of ice. The power never went out, but we were very thankful that Richard was prepared. The loft itself was spacious, private and had everything we needed including fresh ground coffee and information on local landmarks and attractions. We will definitely be staying at the loft again."

I'll definitely be back one day!"

2019-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Beautiful! Really in middle of nature. Falling a sleep and waking up with sounds of nature. The studio was perfect. Kitchen had all amenities needed. Internet and tv worked pretty well. The freshly brewed coffee was really good. The owners were super kind. Lots of privacy. This option is a great stopover for those visiting Yosemite. Sonora is 5min drive with loads of restaurants.
2019-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"It's a very clean place.
There's a private entry with a secure key-less entry which is straight-forward.
The place is well equipped with essentials and the freshly ground coffee was a great touch!
Expect enough space for up to four people with a small balcony and a beautiful view for a great morning coffee. Clean bedding, a cozy room, and quick responses made for a great overnight stay for us."
2019-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Clean and comfortable, one of the best Airbnb's I've stayed at. Richard is a great host who went out of his way for my girlfriend and I during our stay.

2019-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Highly recommend! We stayed here after 4 days in Yosemite, on our way back to San Fransisco. Super clean space with a very comfortable king size bed!

2019-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Richard is an excellent host and very pleasant. His place is located in a great area if you are traveling to Yosemite or Calaveras Big Tree State Park. There are also some other places closer to Richard that are great to visit. He has plenty of area information available. The beds are very comfortable and the place is very cozy. I would definitely stay here again.
2019-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,I had a great time staying at Lavender Lane. The accommodations were clean and very comfortable. I would highly recommend it as a great place for a getaway!
2019-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Richard's place is a perfect spot to enjoy peaceful time in the nature. We were on a trip to Yosemite and this place worked out really well. Perfect place to enjoy stargazing on a clear night sky & I witnessed it fully for 2 nights. Place is full of all required amenities & privacy is its forte. Richard has clearly listed house details which were of great help. I appreciate his effort in answering our basic questions on guitar. House is near to a beautiful lake (tuttletown) which looks beautiful right at sunset.
2019-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Really cute space close to Jamestown and Sonora and Columbia really enjoyed our stay would definitely come back
2019-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Richard and Debby have a wonderful place.

The extra touches were everywhere and made us feel right at home. We highly recommend a stay here."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great location walkable to everything downtown. Very nice and flexible host
2024-06-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great location, cute place, responsive and flexible hosts. All good things. Just a heads up if you’re chemical sensitive to ask for alt cleaning situation, windows left open or something of that nature. There was a strong smell of cleaning products when we arrived. Very much appreciated it being spotless tho!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Lovely home and warm furnishings...I enjoyed my stay and felt very safe. Given the location, I really appreciate a dedicated parking spot attached to the property."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We felt fortunate to spend the week in this delightful cottage. It's the perfect size for two. Immaculately clean, roomy and airy. Set back from the road in a lovely garden. It was a surprise to find how quiet it was, just a block from the noisy main street, we could sit out on the lawn in perfect peace."
2024-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Excelente lugar para descansar. Cozy town. Less than 2 hours from Yosemite. I recommend it
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay here! The location was amazing and just a few minute walk to downtown, which is full of places to visit and eat. The home was really private and the surrounding neighborhood was quiet, which was nice since we had our baby with us. We were pleased with how clean the place was and how easy it was to check in. Overall such a nice place to stay, we will definitely be back!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The location is perfect for people visiting the area.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Lovely place right in the middle of town! My fiancé and I stayed for a night, as we visited Columbia (6-10min) away from the Airbnb. The home was clean, refreshing and peaceful. Absolutely one of the best places we’ve stayed at. Would def recommend. Thank you!"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Really great little airbnb. Clean, cute, and close to all things downtown. And quick response time from the host.
The only thing I would advise anyone looking to stay here: do not listen to your maps app - they both tell you the home is where the county building is. The street signs are small and difficult to read so don’t make the mistake I made by assuming the street is named “Linda Way” - as that is just a sign on a locals home. Once you find the place, you’ll love it."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We had a great time
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great spot

2024-01-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great place! Couple things I think they could change then it’d be 5 stars!
- Heater makes a lot of noise. Not sure if this could be fixed, but if possible future guests would appreciate it!
- Some of the dresser drawers in the bedroom were broken.
- Bed was a little too uncomfortable for me (others might think differently)
- Not sure if it’s a location thing, but if Wifi can be upgraded, I think future guests would appreciate it. Some days we had trouble watching the Roku because the shows/movies were stuck buffering as well as slow load times on our own devices. If this cannot be fixed then I understand that as well 👍🏽
Everything else was fantastic! The great stuff:
- They left multiple vouchers for places around the area for us
- heater works fast (we visited during the winter time)
- Shower heats up fast
- Beautiful cottage
- great location
- check in/out very simple
- Price was very reasonable for everything we got
Would very much stay here again 👍🏽"

2023-12-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,Very cute place. Host was very nice and gave lots of information on surrounding area and anything we needed to know about staying there. The bed was pretty uncomfortable and the bathroom was tight. Other than that we enjoyed our stay!
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Cute little cottage, nice and clean! Had everything I needed. Great location. An easy walk to downtown Sonora. Host was very helpful and quick to respond.
Only complaint I had is that the mattress is uncomfortable and the bed is squeaky. Other than that, everything was great, and I would stay there again."
2023-12-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"We enjoyed our stay at the cottage. My husband and I were visiting his baby sister but it turned into a romantic gateway too. The cottage is very homey. The only thing is that the bed isn’t that comfortable, but it’s like that most places."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,I work nights and when I came back it was so peaceful I could sleep without any issues.. The Host was helpful and answered the phone even if it was late at night .. I didn’t get to enjoy the outdoors that much due to rain
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Great place. We loved walking to downtown.
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place was great! Perfect location, adorable landscaping, quiet, clean, and the host was communicative and kind. Also, very good value for what you get. We will stay again! My only tiny complaint would be that the bed was squeaky and a bit uncomfortable."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a lovely and convenient stay in Sonora. The place was very clean, and spacious and had everything we needed. It was located in a great spot, close to cute shops and amazing restaurants. The host was very nice and easy to reach and provided us with all the information we needed for checking in and checking out. We found the local guide they provided to be very helpful in deciding what activities to do during our stay. Overall, it was a wonderful and refreshing experience."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Lovely, charming, alll the things. The ease of walking to downtown was a delight. I ditched my husband on a few occasions to grab a coffee and shop peacefully lol! Sonora as a whole is an absolute GEM. On multiple occasions I told my husband I felt like we were on set of hocus pocus!! Haha! Thank you for having us. We will ABSOLUTELY be back. You have something special here. Cheers!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Nice place!!
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We enjoyed our stay in Sonora on the way to Yosemite. The apartment had everything we needed, great location and the hosts were very thoughtful.
I’d recommend this home for anyone visiting Sonora!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,The place was adorable with nice antique furnishings and very clean! The only issue I had is that it is not visible from the street so I had to map it and walk there and go up steps to find the location but very worth the stay.
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"We had a wonderful, week-long stay at the cottage. The location is fantastic and walking distance to anything downtown. The kitchen is fully stocked with anything you need to prepare breakfast, lunch and/or dinner. (Save Mart is a few blocks away for your food). There is also a nice grill in the spacious yard which we enjoyed with family one evening. It is also a very quiet location even though you are just a block or two off of the main road. Both the heater and AC worked great (when needed). We will definitely stay here again on our next visit to Sonora!!!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Very comfortable place, very cute and clean. I especially love the views in the front yard. Very peaceful place, close 3 min walk to downtown."

2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I can’t say enough about this adorable home in Sonora. Great kitchen, spacious living room, and wonderful outdoor area. Perfect for 1 or 2 or the family. Really great place, clean and great location!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Cute cottage in a great location. Right next to many shops and restaurants downtown.
The house is old which means it has charm although is a little creaky. The air conditioning is very strong which is nice in a heat wave, although it’s far from the bedroom so you have to crank it to cool it down there.
Parking was easy - although our car didn’t fit in the garage there was plenty on the street.
There was a minor issue with supplies but the host was very responsive and jumped in quickly to help out.
Over all had a great stay and would do it again."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This cottage was exactly as featured! Spotlessly clean inside. Great location, very peaceful, walking distance to shops and restaurants. Responsive host. Very comfortable and would definitely stay again!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great place to stay in Sonora! Quiet area and the place was well stocked and comfortable. The bed is on the hard side and a bit old so if you are sensitive to that like I am, bring a foam topper if you can and you'll be fine. There are steep stone steps up to the place and then a few more steps just to be aware of. The yard is amazing and if you're staying a while you could put it to good use. The Wi-Fi wasn't great for my needs, so I visited the little coffee shop when I needed a really good connection. Downtown is very close and very walkable. Some really cute stores to check out for antiques and jewelry etc. Found a great place to get a yummy smoothie. Overall my experience was great and I would stay here again as well as recommended it to anyone that can handle the steps getting up to it."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This is such a cozy home. We absolutely loved staying here and would definitely stay again. It's a super short walk from the main street and the location is extremely quiet. There is a church next to the home and we didn't hear a sound on Sunday morning which was very impressive. Overall a great experience and we highly recommend this stay.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,excellent hosts!!
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I've stayed at this cottage many times and always appreciate the central location yet private and quiet setting. We had a small issue with linens, but the host responded immediately and rectified the issue. And... to top it off, a gift certificate to a local restaurant was dropped off on our doorstep the next morning to compensate for our trouble. Great response and service!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Very quiet neighborhood and walking distance to ""Old Town Sonora"". Loved the location and the cottage atmosphere of the accommodations. Would stay here again."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful stay and super close to everything in Sonora!

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We had a great stay here! House was clean and well equipped. Communication with the host was super clear and prompt. Definitely will stay again when we are back at Yosemite.
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"The house was clean, nicely furnished and very comfortable. Pramod was quick with his responses and was a great host! The only con was that Yosemite Park was about an hour and a half drive from the Airbnb. Other than that, would highly recommend staying at Pramod’s place"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Everything matches the description. I’ve been to several Airbnbs, and this is definitely one of the top on my list. Extremely clean, great communication, and the rugs and everything else seems to be brand new. My family and I really enjoyed the stay. Will definitely come back and visit if I have a chance."
2024-06-01,5.0,Group trip,"It is literally a cabin in the woods, 20 min drive from town in the mountains. We spotted wildlife as well. The hosts were extremely helpful; in fact, they arranged help to fix our car issue. They were also extremely proactive, friendly, and communicative. The hosts were accommodating and cooperative regarding check-out times. The house was super clean and organized. It had everything one could think of for a home-like stay and was labeled too, for easy access. The hosts put a lot of effort into making our stay more comfortable by keeping snacks, extra plush blankets, a hammock, and more. Lastly, DOME DOME DOME with a central fireplace!!! I think it was the best experience of all; was a cozy place to chill out on the patio with friends for stargazing and just enjoy peace. Overall, had an amazing experience. I would definitely recommend this Airbnb; it also lies between Sequoia, Yosemite, and Lake Tahoe, which is one of the reasons we chose this one. Would love to come back again!!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Great house, and the host was very responsive and proactive. We booked the cabin for a visit to Yosemite National Park but didn’t realize it was two hours away from the park—our mistake for not researching enough. There was a hot water issue mentioned by previous guests. We came back late and couldn’t get a timely response from the host."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"had a wonderful stay, home is beautiful and clean, just like the photos, everything was perfect and easy, host is very friendly and responsive! 10/10 would recommend!"

Peaceful ambiance, & was welcomed with a few treats! House had anything you could possibly need on your getaway trip. Highly recommend!"
2024-06-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Over all really amazing place to stay in Sonora! Super close to Washington street while also providing a secluded stay. A few things that were odd was that lack of dish ware on certain things (only 2 plates and not pans for the oven) and there were only two towels, would have liked to have some spares for our stay."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Very detailed communication from the host, with all relevant information for the stay. Simple and quick check in was so helpful!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Loved my stay at Stay Sonoma’s cottage. A perfect stay for 2 people. Everything was as described in the listing. We loved the convenience and closeness of the town, lots of stores and restaurants within walking distance. An extra bonus was a deer frequented to property our entire stay. It was a nice thing to see each morning as we had our morning coffee on the patio. Only thing I have to recommend is bring extra towels if you plan on using the hot tub as there are no extra linens, towels, or blankets."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great location! Clean and cozy!
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The cabin was a perfect, central spot from which to explore Columbia, the Sequoias, and the lakes and rivers in the area. The place was clean, bed was comfortable, and the hot tub was easy to operate. It’s only a few blocks to downtown, yet we enjoyed feeling perched in the trees, watching the birds and squirrels in the yard (similar to where we live, so we felt right at home!). We would definitely stay again."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay if you are visiting Yosemite!
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Was a fine place

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,A sweet spot for a night while on our way to Yosemite. Loved the hot tub!
2024-04-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place was perfect for being local to downtown. It is also a perfect little spot for 2 people. The only downsides i experienced was, the driveway up to the parking was difficult. The gravel is uneven and some potholes so my small car kept scraping on the bottom because of how uneven it was. Also the hot tub was super chlorinated gave us a headache. Other than that it was great thanks!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great location near downtown and good amenities

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Beautiful and cozy stay! Definitely recommend
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We had a great stay here! I really appreciated all the amenities they had available. It was easy to check-in on our own and the instructions were very clear. The only thing that felt surprising/unexpected was how high up the home was on a hill. It made the “2 blocks away from downtown” a lot less of an easy trip than we expected.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I’ve never stayed in such a clean airbnb! It was spotless as well as the hot tub. Truly is walking distance to DT, Highly recommend. Would stay here again."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This is a great little place to stay. Lovely living room area and deck. The hot tub is definitely a highlight but it would have been nice if more towels were provided and bathroom supplies. We really appreciated the walkable aspect of the location but be aware of the steep hill walking back up. Overall had a really nice stay :)
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a Fabulous time at your cute cottage style home with privacy and comfortable surroundings we look forward to a future stay at your home

2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Wonderful place to stay in Sonora. Walk to downtown Sonora, close to Columbia. No sound of traffic. My favorite part was waking up to deer at my front door. Place is nestled in the back, peaceful, and quiet. Close enough to surrounding little towns. Perfect place to stay if you are hitting the slopes, or visiting Yosemite. I recommend doing both. This is a hard yes. 100/10."
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Easy place to find and very clean and simple! It had all the essentials and the bed was comfy. Everything worked and had private parking too. Location is very quiet and safe.
2024-01-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"The ONLY small snafu was a ""tech"" thing related to internet going in/out with router/modem needing to be reset a few times during my stay and not being able to use streaming services on the TV. The host was EXTREMELY timely and responsive even though we couldn't find a solution to the TV streaming issue.
The surroundings are beautiful so you will probably be outside more than watching TV inside but it was rainy and cold during my stay.
I would highly recommend this place!"
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Very cool rustic wood cabin. I enjoyed the stay.
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a very quiet and peaceful stay and will likely book this cabin again in the fall sometime. Nice and quiet, back from the street and no cars coming by.

2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"amazing place, super helpful owner"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My partner and I were in town for a wedding. I expressed that I was concerned about getting ready and they called once the property was cleaned to let us know we could actually get in a bit early. Such amazing communication. The property was just as pictured and there were multiple cute deer roaming the yard. The balcony is a perfect place to read and it’s about a three minute walk to Main Street. When we come to Sonora again, looking here first!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"It’s a beautiful little cabin right in Sonora‘s center and an hour drive to Yosemite. We felt very welcomed and could relax on the inviting terrace in the evening. As we sat there, a couple of deers showed up and they let us watch them doing their thing. Very cool!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great little place. Beautiful views of downtown sonora. I enjoyed all the wood accents on the cabinets in the kitchen.

2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay in. I like the location of the house and it wasn’t on a main street. The owner even reached out to me to see if there was anything he could help me out with.
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Downtown Sonora is a real gem. Full of history and interesting restaurants, bars and shops. This wonderful and private place is goldilocks: close enough to easily get to things but just far enough away to be country-like peaceful.
The space is comfortable with a deck on one side and shaded patio on the other with gold rush era appropriate fittings throughout (but without being precious!).
We would stay here again in a heartbeat."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,enjoyed the great little house!

It was spacious, very clean. kitchen was fully stocked with anything you needed to cook, and as a bonus, Peggy even had individual cereals, oatmeal, and condiments, which was huge for my kids.

2023-10-01,5.0,Group trip,"Beautiful remodeled home, easy to access with parking and limited stairs, comfortable furniture, very responsive host. My spouse and I stayed here with my parents. One of us has a mobility disability and found it easy to be comfortable here since it’s a single level home: only a few steps to enter the front door and master shower has one low step. Backyard is shady and pleasant during a hot stay, inside is cool and air conditioner easy to use. The layout offers multiple options of dining/relaxing- the house felt like a nice size for us and more. Easy stay, clean, many towels and nice selection of options in the kitchen, had a wonderful stay."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I’ve stayed here twice and was very pleased with the cleanliness and comfort of the bnb.
My only request would be to add a normal drip coffee maker for those of us that do not like Keurigs."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"The house was beautiful and perfectly accommodated my family. Peggy was super responsive to any questions I had, and was very helpful.

The beds were on the firmer side for our taste, but still comfortable.
The location is very nice, on a quiet neighborhood yet still close to downtown."

2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Would be 6 ⭐️ if possible! Amazingly appointed home!! We came up for an adult getaway weekend (good food, good drinks, fun games) and this home was perfect for us! Every time we asked, “I wonder if they have…” we were blown away by the answer. When looking for a citrus juicer, we found a massive industrial-quality juicer. When looking for a larger pan for French toast, we found an electric skillet / griddle.
Comfy beds. Soft towels. Good A/C. Good enough internet speeds. Everything was amazing! Will definitely stay there again.
Only difference is that we would bring a few gallons of water next time as the tap water in Sonora doesn’t taste as good as what we’re used to in SF Bay Area. We ended up buying bottled water at the Save Mart down the road, which was easy — just wasted a lot of plastic."

2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The jealous side of me is hesitating to even post my rave review, for fear this gem won't be available the next time I want it! However, in the spirit of fair play, here goes. Basically, of all the places on this site where I've stayed, either in this country or abroad, nothing tops this one. From the minute you walk in the door, you feel like you're welcomed, and so comfortable. No detail has been overlooked. Just when you're missing some little thing and think, ""Well, surely they won't have that . . ."" you open a drawer or two and find that not only do they have that, but it's a top of the line item that you yourself don't even have in your own home. From the Delta and Kohler sinks and faucets to the Cuisinart cookware, every single thing in the house is top-end and so lovingly thought out, so well placed, the flow of the house and ease of living it affords so relaxing, that you want to move in and never leave. It was with great regret that we checked out and forced ourselves to return to ""reality""! I could go on and on, I don't even know where to stop. The HUGE manicured yard just outside the French doors, awash with roses; the charming outdoor dining area in which to relax in the evening; the BBQ (top of the line, naturally); the garage, stocked with anything anyone could need including washer and drier for extended stays; the TV's in every bedroom; the super comfy beds; the utter peace and quiet of the oak-canopied neighborhood; the proximity to town; the board-games cabinet, the magazine selection, the entire door full of every condiment imaginable in the LG stainless steel fridge -- but I'd better stop here. Nuff' said! :) Thank you, Peggy!"
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Peggy was a great host! Super friendly and communicative, she helped us with all our requests!"

2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"The house is beautiful and fully updated. Peggy has added touches to make the house a joy to stay including games and extra towels. The appliances are new and work well. House has a Kuerig, Nescafe, and electric tea kettle with plenty of coffee and sugar. The fridge was stocked with condiments and the kitchen has all the utensils, plates, pots, pans, and baking sheets you need to host a lovely meal. The backyard is perfect for gathering with a concrete patio, flowering plants and gazebo. Parking is easy with the garage and the house is walkable to downtown. The neighborhood is quiet and safe. The wifi worked great, a blessing since we had trouble with cell service around Sonora. We would love to stay here again."

Thank you for a lovely week, we will come back."

2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Peggy's home is beautiful, spacious, and cozy. My family and I enjoyed our getaway from the hustle ans bustle of the City. Peggy was a great communicator and provided the necessities and supplies for our convenience. Although the weather didn't allow us to do too much outdoors, we didn't mind staying indoors and really enjoying this beautiful home. Highly recommended!"
2021-12-01,5.0,Group trip,Home was so cozy and very beautiful. It was well supplied. Ms. Peggy was an outstanding host and very helpful during our stay. Hoping we can stay again in future.
2020-05-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"When staying at Peggys Place, you can expect great service, hospitality, a wonderful place to stay!!"
2020-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,This home was immaculate. Very centrally located within comfortable furnishings. Peggy couldn’t have made the check in process easier. We had to change our plans a few times and she was incredibly flexible and accommodating. If I come to Sonora again I will definitely stay here.
2020-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Clean, comfortable, well-decorated. Short walk downtown. A great option to stay when in the Sonora area."
2020-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,This is house is beautiful! It’s in a beautiful neighborhood and so close to downtown! Would stay here again in a heartbeat!
2020-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great place and great host. Clean, well maintained and stocked with all you need. Peggy keeps you updated prior to your arrival and is available if there are any issues (there were none)."
2020-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We really enjoyed our stay Peggy's Place. It is in a quiet and quaint neighborhood and provided the comfort of a place that feels like home. It is a great way to enjoy Sonora. Only a 15 – 20 minute walk to Downtown Sonora and close to many restaurants, bars and cafes in the area. Less than a hour to ski resorts or National Parks too.
Peggy’s Place is just what our small family needed to get away for winter break – a comfortable, clean, and calming place. The home was stylishly renovated and provided everything we needed - comfortable beds a well-prepared kitchen and well stocked bathrooms. We especially appreciated the milk, cereal, coffee and powerful hair dryer.
Peggy and her husband were very accommodating and helpful - letting us drop off our groceries and overnight bags early then giving us the option for a late checkout. Peggy was very responsive to all our questions. We would definitely stay again!"
2020-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,UNBELIEVABLE. This is by far the best Airbnb that I have ever stayed in for the price. Nothing else is even a close second. The attention to detail that was put into the full completely remodeled house was done tastefully and generously. Peggy was helpful with local restaurants to eat at and she keeps the house immaculate and stocked. I’m typically a complainer and find fault in everything so believe me when I say that this place is wonderful.
2020-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This place was amazing. I had my entire family there, 6 adults and 4 children and it was very comfortable. The house is beautiful inside and out and the hosts provided a lot of amenities other B&B’s don’t. Would definitely stay here again."
2020-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Had the opportunity to stay at peggys place during the week for about 4 months. I travel for work and was glad we stopped to work in Sonora because Peggy is a great host. She opened up her home and made us feel like it was ours as well as hers. I’m sad we’re headed to a different town because we may not find a gem like this there. And to be honest I’m going to miss that master bedroom! Great place to stay if you’ll be working during the week and an even better place to have for a holiday or weekend trip. I promise I’ll be back!
2020-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"clean, spacious, and modern. great home!"
2020-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,A very beautiful updated home! Look forward to staying again!

2020-01-01,5.0,Group trip,"Peggy's home is wonderful. Perfectly clean, well decorated with an awesome fully equipped kitchen. She also provides a selection of breakfast foods, which is really convenient. She has a Nespresso machine (the flat round pods kind) and a Keurig as well. Teas and infusions are also provided. No need to bring milk or cereal, but do bring eggs and bacon if you want those. If you plan to cook meals there, you won't even have to bring salt, pepper, oil, etc. as Peggy's cupboard is well stocked. Thanks, Peggy for a great stay!"
2020-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This home was perfect for us because had table space for family and full equipment in kitchen. I like to cook and it was easy in this home.
We skied at Dodge which was easy drive.
We want to return to visit Sonora museums and Columbia."
2019-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Absolutely perfect! The house was impeccably clean, completely upgraded, with all the amenities. Loved the fresh flowers and warm fireplace. Easily one of the best rentals we've had. You can't go wrong with this one!"
2019-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,A magnificent house! A+++++ Exceeded our expectations by far! Thank you Peggy for opening your beautiful house to us!
2019-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"What a wonderful home that Peggy has created. She has thought of everything. The special touches throughout the home ....I would say the nicest Airbnb we have stayed at.The Interior design and decor is just top shelf in all regards. Great country location just uphill from downtown Sonora.
I hope we have the opportunity to stay there again, thanks Peggy!"
2019-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Peggy’s house is a a fantastic choice when staying in Sonora. It is a short drive down the hill (I’d say walk, but the narrow streets and steep hills are challenging, especially with kids). There is space for everybody to feel comfortable and cozy, whether in the couches, at one of the tables, next to the fire, in a room. The place is meticulously clean and well decorated. Peggy even put up Christmas decorations (and a Christmas tree!) for our stay, and had beautiful fresh flowers. The refrigerator and cupboards were stocked with a variety of breakfast snacks, which is a life saver for young kids when traveling. The only “challenge” for me was the firmness of the mattress in the master bedroom. It was too firm for me to get comfortable, but this was easily solved by sleeping with a blanket underneath me- the little extra layer of the down comforter made it just right. We will stay here again without hesitation next time we’re in town!"
2019-11-01,5.0,Group trip,A perfect accompaniment to our Thanksgiving & wedding day celebrations. The home & the host were incredible.
2019-11-01,5.0,Group trip,Lovely place to stay.

2019-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This home is clean and well designed with great amenities. So much better than a resort or hotel because this home was inviting with lots of space, a backyard, and activities to entertain kids. They loved the chessboard and checkers. I liked the fresh flowers and the pumpkin out front. I highly recommend Peggy’s place."
2019-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Cannot recommend highly enough if you need to stay in Sonora. It's not really walking distance to downtown Main Street, but the space is so comfortable, stylish and spacious that you won't care as you won't want to leave. One of the best Airbnbs I've ever had the pleasure of staying at. Peggy was also a great host."

2019-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,The house is wonderful! Everything was great I loved my stay 100 percent! I couldn’t get the ESPN channel to work but I’m sure it was a network issue and nothing to do with the Airbnb. I’m working in town til January and I’m booking here every chance I can!
2019-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Exceptional! Beautiful home, well decorated and with a small exterior. Full of little touches of attention, and a good breakfast. The beds are super comf. In short, it feels good!!!"

2019-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"What a great value! This place was like a 5 star hotel! Bedrooms and bathrooms are outfitted with high end touches...plush towels, soothing shower heads, fancy soaps, and comfy bedding. The king mattress in the master bedroom was a little firm for our liking but again comfy pillows and bedding. Plus, we loved having our own bathroom, walk-in closet, and sitting area with tv. Our kids loved the other bedrooms too. There was also a large variety of cereal, oatmeal, Starbucks Keurig coffee, and espresso to choose from. Peggy was a great host to communicate with. Very friendly, but gave us privacy. Easy check-in and check-out. Our first Airbnb experience was more than we could have imagined!"

2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Bryce 's home was wonderful for our stay in Sonora. It was really clean and modern with 3 nice bedrooms,great remodled master bathrooms, and an updated kitchen. The place had everything we needed to cook and relax . There was also a basket with goodies as a welcome for us in the kitchen too. That was very nice of Bryce .We were a bit nervous that the busy street noises would keep us up at night, but it wasn't a problem at all. The hardwood floors are really beautiful and the house was very cozy. It was a lovely and clean home and we look forward to staying again soon."
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This Airbnb was a quiet, quaint and cute place to stay. There were even snacks and drinks provided by the host! The shower was great - nice and roomy! Just a few minor drawbacks. It took a while for the faucet water to get warm, the sofa and living room pillows smelled like they needed cleaning, and fridge was not clean. Overall I would stay at this Airbnb again. 😊"
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,This was a home away from home! I really appreciated how they think of their guests. They had everything that we needed new and organized. Im very thankful for the opportunity they gave me and my family to stay in their home. This is how an Airbnb house should be. I had a very bad experience at my last rental and didn’t want to use Airbnb anymore but this rental gave me back the confidence to continue using it! I also liked that the check in/out was at 2 and 12. Especially check out because it gave us time to eat breakfast and gather our belongings. The host responded and was available at all times. Thank you for hosting us and we will definitely use them again when we go visit Sonora!
2024-01-01,5.0,Group trip,"The house was great. It was spacious, clean, comfortable, and well stocked. Bryce was a very responsive host. Would definitely recommend."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"It is a very quick walk to downtown! Check in was very easy and the hosts were very quick to respond. The home is a lot older with its own quirks, but I do feel overall it’s a very quaint home.
We really loved the front yard and spent a lot of time there."

2024-03-01,5.0,Group trip,We were in town for a friends 25th Wedding Anniversary party and we loved that the location was within walking distance to town and that the home was spacious and easily accommodated our group. We felt very comfortable and at home and will definitely be staying again in the future.
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,This company was fantastic. I did not end up staying at the location because I booked in the wrong location. The owner was able to help me get a refund the same day so I could book in the rich place. Our vacation was a success thanks to this!

2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We enjoyed our stay here. We had booked another one of Stay Sonora's properties that was right up the road so we could be close to family. The beds were comfortable and there was plenty of room for five guests. It is an older building and has a lot of charm and cute decor. The hosts were also very nice and communicated well.
It has a great location for walking the main strip in old Sonora. Due be aware that the house is on a hill if you have any guests with mobility issues - it might be better to drive if your elderly family members will have a hard time with the hill. Driving is easy and there is a parking pad around the back of the building."
2024-02-01,3.0,Stayed with kids,"While the house was in a good location and walkable to the downtown, the house listing didn't properly represent itself. The house felt very dated, old, and run down. We encountered the following issues:
- towels are worn and thin; and not enough towels
-not enough warm bedding for one of the bedrooms
- watery soap
-no kitchen sponge or paper towels to clean with
- old oven that doesn't work well (temperature is 75 degrees off)
- refrigerator light is out and ice dispenser is partially broken
- many of the bedrooms and bathroom doors don't have locks
- only provide one key to get in/out of house
- some house doors don't properly work
- not enough toilet paper"
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We loved the location and views of the surrounding hills from the porches. Very comfortable and perfect for our 2 small families to hang out, cook and enjoy the home.
Really loved that the downtown with restaurants and shops were less than a 5 min walk away.
We were able to get up to pinecrest area for snow play each day and it took less than an hour to get up there.
We would stay again."
2024-02-01,5.0,Group trip,"Booked this home for a crew that was working out of town, they loved it, and it worked out great. A very clean home to come back to at the end of the day made them so happy!"

2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We loved our stay at this home! It was easy to walk to downtown, and great for 6 people plus a baby.

Excellent communicators, and so kindly checked on us through the app. Wholeheartedly recommend ❤️"

2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,This home was just what we wanted for our family weekend in Sonora.

Kitchen was wonderfully stocked with all the essentials we needed as well as towels and linens! We will definitely be back! Thanks for a great stay!

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This property fit our needs well, we very much enjoyed our stay here."
2023-09-01,5.0,Group trip,"Stayed for one night before heading out on a backpacking trip from the Yosemite area. This was a good tradeoff between distance and price for that purpose. The property itself is very well kept and includes everything you need for a longer stay. It's an older home, which I loved because it reminded me of my parents' home with the vintage latches on the cupboards and doors."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Super easy, very clean and very responsive host"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This was the perfect place to experience Sonora and the surrounding area and spacious for our family of 4 . Great location, a minute walk or so to the main downtown street. Easy parking in the rear of the street address / behind the home. Hosts wrote a guidebook full of helpful local recommendations and were quick to respond."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"A nice house in a great location, very close to the high street. We enjoyed our stay here and would definately return. There was a small issue with the fridge when we arrived, which was very quickly and proactively rectified."

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Mae is very responsive, provided very helpful local recommendations. The location is great, just a few minutes from downtown where u can find lots of great restaurants, yet private and very quiet. Thanks for hosting us!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place and wonderful host! Hope to be back!
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"If you're looking for a nicely appointed, comfortable, spacious and yet cozy place to stay in Sonora, CA, within easy walking distance of downtown (1/2 mile), look no further. This place is in one of the nicest, quietest neighborhoods in Sonora, and the way it is situated on the hill, with its excellent views and spacious patio surrounded by terraced gardens, it feels like a welcome sanctuary. To complete the picture, Mae is a consummate host, and is wonderfully accommodating and responsive to your needs and questions. Enjoy your stay!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Our second time at her guest house. Close to all that Sonora has to offer and most are within walking distance. EV charging was a real plus. Mae and her family were friendly, helpful and allowed us to also have plenty of private time.
We will return and hope that is an endorsement that motivates others to go to Mae's when visiting the Sonora area."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,I very much enjoyed my stay! The location was exactly as I expected and Mae is cery responsive and open to providing recommendations on the area.
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Had a great stay in Mae’s historic Sonora apartment. The place was exceptionally clean, comfortable and featured thoughtful touches throughout. It is centrally located in the town yet tucked away in a quiet neighborhood. You can tell that a lot of care and thought was put into the place and the guest’s experience. I appreciate Mae’s responsiveness. There wasn’t too much need to contact the host during the stay, but the times I communicated with Mae, I got a quick and helpful answer. My only gripe is that I wish the stay was longer to make some cocktails at the beautiful built in bar and check out some of the interesting books kept on the nearby shelves."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Mae’s place was very clean and cozy. The bed was extremely comfortable and the neighborhood was quiet so we slept soundly. The unit was well appointed and it was obvious that a lot of thought went into the furnishings, amenities, and overall design of the unit. We never got a chance to meet Mae, since we were only around in the early morning and evening, but judging from the books in her bookshelf and the attention to detail in the unit, I’m sure she is a bright and interesting individual. We would stay there again!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Mae's place was quiet and clean. I enjoyed my stay.
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Mae had a beautiful space ready for our stay! She gave us plenty of local recommendations and was very responsive. About an hour and a half drive from Yosemite.
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Mae offered us a warm welcome with several suggestions and her place was overall wonderful. We would stay here again.
We had stayed here as a base for traveling to Yosemite. It’s important to note that the park is about 2 hours away, but that wasn’t a big issue for us."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We had a fantastic time in Mae's place. She was always available and helpful.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Had such a great stay here, especially for it being so last minute!! The place was tucked away on a hill so it was nice and private with a good view, plenty of room for a solo traveler and I don't think it would get too crowded with more people, it was very spacious! Everything was clean and it felt so cozy! The host, Mae, was really responsive and gave recommendations on things to do which was so so thoughtful. Overall SO great!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The description was accurate. Her apartment suite was well appointed and so very comfortable. The bathroom was large and allowed us to use multiple counter surfaces for all the things. It was private but had a wonderful, panoramic view of the Sonora area. We sat on the patio to enjoy the quiet and it had a mister system that kept us cool despite the hot day temperatures. We walked to many of the places we hoped to see and Mae was helpful with recommendations and directions for restaurants including vegetarian/vegan fair. The area is pretty great but Mae, and her family, helped make it a weekend that we will remember."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We loved staying at Mae's; it's such a pretty area and the house is very walkable to all of downtown Sonora, with lots of great restaurants & bars and unique shopping. Mae gave TONS of great local recommendations that we made great use of! The space is cute and comfortable, the kitchenette had a great setup with all the basic necessities (coffee!!) and then some. The bathroom is HUGE -- everything was spacious! We didn't take advantage of the hot tub but I'm sure it's a great way to spend an evening. We stayed in Sonora as a home base for Yosemite and even though it's a bit of a longer drive, it was well worth it to stay here & in Sonora (which nails ""charming small town"" vibes without being TOO small...). Overall it was a wonderful weekend and I would absolutely stay here again!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Mae provided a great secluded place for us. The wet bar, bathroom, and patio were awesome! it's walking distance to all Sonora's restaurants and bars. We would definitely come again."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great is understatement for this place! It was the perfect fit for me and my partner for the week. Walking distance to downtown, clean environment with tons of privacy and Mae is an outstanding host! If you’re planning on coming to the area, I 100% recommend booking your stay here."

2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"It is rare that a place is better than the photos and description, but this place exceeded my expectations. It's a perfect place for a couple or single traveler who appreciates a stylish retro home in a garden setting close to downtown Sonora. The host was very helpful, space was clean and functional, and the deck area was perfect for the views and garden. I'm booking every time I go to Sonora!"
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Perfect getaway location. Close to downtown shopping and places to eat. Very peaceful getaway.
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Wonderful little bungalow. Perfect location close to downtown. Super clean and great host. We will be regulars from now on.
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Our stay at Mae's place was fabulous! Mae was great communicating with us from the beginning and through our stay. The rental is attached to her house but it has its' own entry and key pad so we didn't see our hostess at all during our stay. It was easy to find and in a nice quiet neighborhood just a couple blocks up the hill from town. The rental is spacious and well appointed with everything we needed. The bed was so comfortable and the bathroom is very large also. There is a nice sitting area out front for morning coffee and the entire unit is bright and airy! We would definitely stay there again when we come to Sonora!
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"What a great airbnb! It is a cute apartment with a comfortable bed, a great outdoor patio to enjoy the mornings and evenings and very well located and within walking distance of town. Mae is a fantastic host -- communicative and makes sure that her guests are taken care of. I will be staying here the next time I come to Sonora and recommend it to others!"
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"What a fabulous place! Just a quick walk through the historic neighborhood to reach Main Street with all its restaurant and shop offerings. The studio was spacious, light, clean and really comfortable. Stylishly curated with a mid-century vibe. We loved mixing up fancy cocktails at the wet bar, and then basking in the hot tub on the private patio. Place was very well provisioned and the organic local coffee provided was a nice touch. It was so lovely to enjoy morning coffee on the patio! Mae (the host) was super friendly and easy to communicate with. I wish I could have stayed longer, but I will definitely stay here again during my next visit to Sonora. Highly, highly recommend!"
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,It’s such a cute place to stay at! Mae was very amazing at communicating with me and she was super nice the place was super clean it was a nice title walk to downtown!
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Wonderful place to stay! Beautiful views from the patio. Very clean and tidy with everything you need! Mae was a terrific host and made sure we had everything we needed. Looking forward to visiting again.
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Mae's place was a great stay for us. 5 stars all around. She was available for any questions we had, which were not many. Mae has done a beautiful job in creating a cozy rental with quality furnishings. The bed was terrific, too! Located in a beautiful, quiet hillside neighborhood, it is an ideal location. A short 8 minute walk to town.
We give the highest recommendation for Mae's Airbnb. She is the best host we've had. Thank you, Mae, for making our stay so wonderful."
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Everything about your place was absolutely perfect.
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This unit is so sweet, so cozy, and awesome. The space is bright and airy. Fear not, there are blinds on the door and excellent blackout curtains over the windows. The murphy bed is COMFY and the linens/blankets are PERFECT. The bar is a cute add with microwave, coffee maker, kettle and sink. The giant bathroom with vanity really wowed my wife. The fireplace is adorable and VERY functional. The outdoor space is adorable and Mae is continually improving that space.
The location is a short walk to downtown. Which, after having a drink or two and a big great meal at any of the eateries, is perfect. A 10 minute stroll after eating is excellent. Also, since there is the carport for parking, you don't have fight with traffic or search for parking! Always always a plus.
Can't say enough good things. It is a super quiet location in a super cute town."
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Mae's place is situated in a quiet neighborhood within a short walk to Sonora's downtown. In the morning, there is great natural light that comes onto the patio and into the apartment. The space is handsomely decorated and well-provisioned, and has a very nice climate control system. The layout of the apartment is great and the space ample and comfortable. On our second night, we ordered take-out and spent a cozy evening by the fire reading some of the interesting books on local history and geology available in the book case. Mae was a thoughtful hostess and good communicator. She provided local coffee to brew and the flowering quince branch in a vase was a beautiful touch of spring. We recommend Mae's rental highly."
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"Very nice place! 22 brick steps from street to entrance and then, voila, a large patio, covered entrance leading into a spacious studio. Tons of natural light coming through the many windows looking out over cute yard full of morning glories, lavender and rosemary. Top notch bedding, large bar and kitchenette with swivel seating so the room can be enjoyed panorama style for T.V. viewing or socializing. Walking distance to downtown Sonora with its many shops and variety of dining options. Absolutely love this place. Friendly, responsive host."
,,,"The shower was clogged and had standing water. The bathroom sink was also clogged and was inoperable. The house was dusty. The bathroom fan was disgusting and extremely dirty. The backsplash tiles in the kitchen are falling off the walls. The bed was so uncomfortable, one of us got lucky and slept on the couch. We ended up leaving early and renting another local property."
