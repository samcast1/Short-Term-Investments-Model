2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Absolutely beautiful surroundings, comfy bed and room with pastoral views, lovely host and family, absolutely clean & quiet, yummy fresh eggs right from the chickens for breakfast with great coffee in the morning, and the goats are adorable! You can get there really quick from 83, but I came from the west on amazing backroads from Dresden to their place. It was magical. I’m allergic to dogs but I was fine—their 11 “puppy dogs” are hypoallergenic, super well-behaved, very quiet and clean, stayed out of my room, and were darling. Can’t wait to go back!"

There was even an elf in the shelf hidden in our closet and a lovely card and little gift bags with mugs and hot cocoa for our family of 4! The OSU decor was a bonus (I’m a Buckeye!) and Greg and his wife Erin answered all of our questions promptly. The town of Cambridge is adorable around Christmas and we made a wonderful memory.

The coziness of the home helped create a lifetime of memories for our family!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Group trip,Our host was extremely accommodating beyond expectations. The personal thought that was put into what a guest might need or want was there.

2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Greg thought of everything! My family and I had a wonderful time. I will definitely be recommending to family and friends.
2023-06-01,5.0,Group trip,"We had a great time at Black Bear. Cabin was clean and fully stocked kitchen made meals easy to cook. Beds were comfortable and there were plenty of sitting options when watching a movie in the lower level. Hot tub was pristine and very large.
We fished the fully stocked pond and was not disappointed. It should be noted that there is a significant slope from the cabin to the dock making it difficult for some older people. Would recommend steps for easier accessibility. We saw foxes, deer, and heard lots of bull frogs during our stay. Defiantly recommend this cabin and look forward to staying there in the future."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"Excellent location, very nice space, equipped very well!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,I enjoyed my stay at Sandy's place. It's a very quiet town with laid back people who are friendly. The apartment had all of the amenities that were mentioned and looked exactly like the pics.
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Peaceful place,was perfect for my needs!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The Airbnb was as described. Sandra answered my inquiries quickly.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"Sandra is a great host, easy to get in contact and very helpful. The place is nice and quiet. I would definitely stay again. Thank you Sandra for a great place."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"very nice and interesting house.
Also very comfortable"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Very large, plenty of space. Lovely area of town."
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Even better than the pictures! Amazing stay and we can't wait to return. The place is spacious, cozy, and thoughtfully appointed. Location is convenient, parking is easy, and we felt right at home. Thank so much you, Carol, for giving us a memorable time in a town that means a lot to us!"
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Beautiful old house, the rooms are decorated in nice period theme. Very comfortable, and the location is convenient to downtown."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,A lovely visit. We felt very at home. The home was absolutely beautiful and historic. Our only complaints were we were unable to light the fireplace in the bedroom..user error?...and we enjoyed ourselves too much and didn't want to leave!
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful house that will take you back in time.
2022-12-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great location relative to downtown Cambridge. Guests should know that ground floor bedroom is right on the street. If you're a light sleeper or might be woken up by street noise/ light this probably isn't the place for you. Blackout curtains would certainly help. Unit is large (significantly larger than a nearby hotel option) and has lots of character. We appreciated the seasonal decor but the snow covered steps/sidewalk and frozen shower pipes (shower would not drain during our entire stay) certainly detracted from the experience. The host informed us over the phone that with the with the warmer weather coming later that the pipes were likely to thaw and that a handyman would come by to check the pipes after we left. Great for the plumbing, not great if you've driven 300+miles and are hoping to take a shower during your stay. Would consider staying again, but perhaps in warmer weather."
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Beautiful place. In walking distance of the downtown. Highly recommend.
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,A beautiful place to stay. Definitely a repeat.
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Charming historic suite… we immediately felt like we were stepping back in time! Thank you for sharing the space and experience!
2022-08-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is a spacious gorgeous historical home with so many details in the decor and woodwork. The location is perfect for a short walk to downtown Cambridge. The home was immaculately clean with a fully stocked kitchen utensils and serving ware.
I would caution that the bathtub is a step in clawfoot that is curved throughout the bottom. There is no flat space to stand comfortably."
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We enjoyed our stay! Nice and clean!
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This was absolutely perfect! The space was large, clean and so incredibly inviting. I can't wait to return."
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I enjoyed staying in the Downton Abbey suite. The place is lovely and was comfortable. The charm of the city was a pleasant surprise. Fireplace in the bedroom, living room, dining room and the kitchen!"
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"the most charming home I've stayed at so far. location is perfect and right next to some convenient places, like a church, stores and food. will 100% be going back."
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great area ! House was beautiful and clean. I would definitely stay again
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The Downton Abbey Suite was a comfortable, unique, and peaceful property and I loved staying there. Carol had excellent communication and was helpful and immediately available when I initially had trouble getting into the unit when I first arrived. A+ stay with thoughtful touches such as complementary chocolates."
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The Downton Abby Suite is just perfect. We visited Cambridge during the holidays. The home is located right in downtown so we were able to walk and enjoy the town’s Christmas displays, light show and do some shopping. Highly recommend."
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great place to stay! Every attention to detail was made. You feel like you have stepped back in time with all the period decor. Would definitely stay again!
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Lovely accommodations in a great location within walking distance of everything Christmas in downtown Cambridge! Plenty of shopping and restaurants amidst all of the Dickens characters. We especially loved the beautifully lit Christmas tree that perfectly complemented the lovely and so warming gas fireplace in the master suite!
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Downton Abbey is a nicely appointed suite that will take you back in time. This is a great place in a nice neighborhood.
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This was the first time we have stayed in an Airbnb in the US and it was terrific. The apartment is very clean, spacious, and decorated in a unique way with a lot of attention to detail - like a movie set. It was stocked with coffee, tea, water, chocolate bars, and lovely bath gels. It is very close to Salt Fork Lake which is a great place to walk around. We would love to stay here again!"
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very neat historical home
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This place was even more spacious than what we thought it would be! Great historic home that was very clean! If we traveled to the area again, we would definitely stay again."
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,The house was super cute and Carols instructions were super easy to follow. If we are ever back in the area we would stay here again.
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This is a lovely and large apartment with a private entry and Victorian decor just steps from Cambridge's main street. The host has updated this older home with both modern (kitchen, tv) and period touches (wainscoting, tin ceiling, clawfoot tub). The towels were thick and new and there were bottles of water and coffee available. If ever in Cambridge, I would stay here again."
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"A beautiful and cozy suite. Great location in Cambridge, easy walk to restaurants and shops. I would definitely stay again."
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The pictures don’t even do this place justice. I am a big lover of history and old buildings, and this place has it all. Being the first house built in the town of Cambridge, this home has a ton of history! After my husband and I had a few challenging moments trying to get ourselves in with the keypad, it was all smooth sailing from there. (for this particular suite, enter the code and hit the LOCK button, since there is no “unlock” button) Our only regret is we wished we could have stayed longer. Spotless inside, great attention to detail, comfy bed, and wonderful to soak in the tub. My family was jealous that we scored this wonderful AirBNB."
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We stayed at Carol's place again on our return trip--worked out well. We had another lovely dinner in the antique-filled dining room, and then watched the Olympics on the TV in the living room. The best of both the 19th and 21st centuries!
Highly recommended, especially if you are looking for a safe way to travel during the pandemic. Near the highway, socially distant, you can make your own meals, and very comfortable and elegant!"
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This is a great place to stay, 5 minutes off the interstate. It was perfect during the pandemic—quiet and self-contained with a full kitchen. And so beautifully decorated with antiques, including a lovely dining room. A great choice if you are traveling through central Ohio!"
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Carol’s Downton Abbey Suite is incredibly beautiful and was perfect for my weekend getaway. The accommodations are so comfy and I felt as if I’d stepped back in time.
It was quiet, private and was very easy to park and the keypad check in was very convenient.
I highly recommend The Downton Abbey Suite to anyone looking for a relaxing weekend getaway.
I’m already planning a return trip!!"
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had seen the picture on AirBnB of this Downton Abbey Suite, but when we opened the door and walked in - we were still ""wow'd"". My husband and I were travelling for 2.5 weeks staying in 5 different areas - and this was our 3rd of 5 stays. We rotate between historic hotels and AirBnBs and it was awesome to find an AirBnB that was also historical. Carol has paid attention to the details that matter when you are in a home away from home. The linens and towels are top notch (and plenty of towels). She left us two delicious blueberry muffins from the local Kennedy's bakery, Great instructions for accessing the WiFi and cable TV. A large kitchen trash can. Coffee and individual creamers - just nice touches like that. The location was perfect with just a block or two to walk to several different dining options (although we had a kitchen, so we did cook for ourselves one night). This is a safe neighborhood. We had a small issue when entering the code to get into the apartment when we first arrived. I called her number and she responded immediately and we were in (we had to pull the door snug toward us as the lock was catching - no big deal). We also called her when we left to let her know and she was right there. There is so much to do and see in this area - and you can't go wrong with this place. Very special! We don't normally vacation in the same place twice, but if we are ever back in Cambridge - we'll be staying here."
2021-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Adorable place, like stepping back in time; Carol the host was wonderful, great communication; and great location to walk around town."
2021-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Wow! Imagine staying in a beautiful restored historic home (1815!), carefully and lovingly decorated, and this is it! Cambridge, OH, you say? No matter. This home is worth coming just to stay here. A truly special place unlike anything you will find for many miles in all directions. We look forward to finding reasons to come back for a longer stay."
2021-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"A beautiful, and well appointed place in an early historic federal home. It’s a quick walk to many shops and restaurants in Cambridge’s main thoroughfare and historic district. Parking is easy. Many thoughtful and generous touches to enjoy. Highly recommend!!"
2024-06-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,We enjoyed our stay. The cabin is a bit outdated but you can see that in the photos and the price reflects that. It was very clean. Driveway was a challenge but had no problem with a 4 wheel drive. You can hear the freeway from the porch but can't see any neighbors. Make sure to bring your own firewood. There was internet and a tv with streaming service. I'd recommend it!
2024-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I think the driveway was very challenging.
It could use some work. Otherwise it was perfect. Thank you very much. Cinda"
2024-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Gorgeous location. Peaceful and quiet. Wonderfully isolated without being a challenge to get to.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Loved the place. Very secluded & had everything we needed.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This cabin and location, close to Salt Fork State Park, was just what we were looking for. The cabin was clean, had all the items that one may want or need like spices, coffee filters, snacks, cookware and many utensils in the kitchen. The beds were comfortable. We enjoyed use of the fire pit under an almost full moon and stars, listening to the barred owls and spring peepers. Getting up the driveway provided an adrenaline rush but we made it. This cabin was a good bargain."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great place to get away for the weekend!
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Love this place great location
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Great stay. Kelly was fast to respond and a great host. Loved making a fire and enjoying the peace and quiet.
2024-04-01,5.0,Group trip,Everything good as described!! Would book again
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"So peaceful. It is in excellent condition, very well maintained. Kelly went over the top to make sure we felt right at home. Thank you!"
2024-03-01,3.0,Stayed one night,"If you’re gonna stay here, know that you will absolutely need four-wheel-drive for the driveway and surrounding areas."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Always a pleasure to stay at your rental!! Beautiful location. but the driveway unfortunately is become worse trying to drive up!! Definitely could use some grating to the entrance and first slope of the driveway!! Other than that. I highly recommend this place!!
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Overall our stay was good, we had a few issues with some cleanliness that I don’t feel We’re Kelly’s but-whoever she has clean. But-She was very accommodating to the issues and there was no problem. Personally the view and openness of her place was magnificent, there were even snacks left and I will admit our husbands were all about coming and getting surprise snacks 😂 I’d definitely stay there again."
2024-02-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"Great location.
Cabin comfortable and clean.
Great fire pit.
Close to town, far enough away to feel secluded.
Hiking was amazing at Salt Fork.
White Bridal Trail, section B
5 miles, 682 feet elevation.
Tlaquepaque Mexican Restaurant in town very good."
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great little cabin hidden in the woods!
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"There was a winter storm in Medina ohio and I asked if I could switch days, so we could travel a day ahead of the storm. Kelly was more than happy to grant this request. We will definitely be going back in the Spring.

2024-01-01,5.0,Group trip,Peaceful place to stay
2023-12-01,3.0,Stayed one night,"This place was great for five college students needing a cheap place to stay for one night. However, it wasn’t until the day of the check in that we were informed of the steep hill and the need for 4WD. Luckily we had one car able to get up the hill, but the other car had to be left at the bottom, and we had to walk the luggage up the hill. We feel that it definitely needs to be stressed in the description that you may not be able to stay here if you don’t have a car able to get up extremely steep, unpaved, and bumpy hills. Once inside, we found multiple bugs in each room, and when making dinner, the dishes had to be washed out before we used them due to visible debris. Other than that, the house fit the description and we had a great time, just slightly put off by the hill and bugs."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Nice home, clean, quiet and comfortable. Would definitely stay again"
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Very responsive host, great stay"
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,No complaints
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We just needed a place to stay for one night as we were driving through Cambridge Ohio. Was a great place not far from 70/77
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great views and cozy feel. The driveway can be intimidating without a 4wd vehicle so be prepared for that but was no issue in our suv. Front porch during fall is wonderful
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"A nice clean house that was affordable and just what we needed for a week of hunting. Kelly’s responsiveness to my questions was exceptional and just an all around nice host. The driveway is the only thing I caution people with, but my Subaru Crosstrek did fine on it."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"This was my first experience using Airbnb and it was perfect. My brother and I camp out every year. We decided to try something different this year. We enjoyed the peaceful setting. The porch was great. We spent our early mornings exercising and having coffee out on the porch. A snack basket was provided with chips and crackers. The kitchen was well equipped and there were a ton of fresh towels and washcloths. It was a great luxury to have a washer and dryer. Kelly has a binder with local businesses. We tried Theo’s restaurant and it was great. So great, we ended up returning 4 times. I enjoyed a hot bamboo massage at Zona’s spa. The owner was great and the price was so reasonable. The beds were super comfortable. It was really a great time. I don’t want to leave out the driveway that is mentioned in so many of the reviews. We did not find it difficult at all. My brother has 4WD and I do not. We both did fine. We both highly recommend this host."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We were in town for the fair, it was the perfect location. It was a perfect little place to stay with our sons for a fun weekend. We loved the all the board games and the cozy feel! Plus the view is great!! Looking forward to another stay!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,beautiful front porch. loved watching the sunrise and enjoyed an extremely relaxing weekend. Driveway was not for the faint of heart though. I was extremely nervous each time I had to leave and come back. But once your there it's a beautiful place.
2023-08-01,5.0,Group trip,"Kelly, thank you for letting us stay at your place. The cabin is clean, comfortable, and a lot of fun. All the amenities were there and as described. Perfect size and function for 7 grown men and all of our gear plus 2 full size pick up trucks. The driveway is an adventure all by itself! We will definitely be back in the future, and glad we found this place."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Kelly is not exaggerating when she says 4 wheel drive is recommended. Our front wheel drive mini van struggled mightily to get up the driveway.
Once we got to the top of the hill, the house was great. The bedding was comfortable, and towels were soft, and the house was clean.
We just stayed one night to break up a long drive. It was fairly easy to get to and not far off I-70. The view from the porch was fantastic.
If you have a 4WD vehicle and are looking for a simple, peaceful home, I’d definitely recommend staying here."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Was traveling home from vacation and wanted a place to relax before I got home. Amazing to wake up and see the outdoors.
2023-08-01,5.0,Group trip,"Place was great, really cozy., and with everything you need for a comfortable stay (short or long). The deck and the views from it were great. Would definitely come back again, just for a getaway!
P.S. watch out for a driveway, 4wd recommended."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great place! Definitely come with a truck and 4wheel drive. Awesome value for what you pay. I will for sure be back with my family when I have time to relax. Was bummed I was only there for one night for business.
2023-08-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"Spacious and clean, beautiful scenery! Love the fact that dogs are permissible."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,It's a beautiful cabin set back in the woods and up on the hill. It was a quick trip but we really enjoyed it.
2023-07-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,The driveway was nearly unpassable. A car wouldn't make it up because rains washed out the bottom and it was steep. Once you maybe got up to the cabin everything else was good. But seriously...the driveway...
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"It was exactly how it was described. It was quite, clean and had beautiful views. Was traveling for work so it was kinda a last minute thing but Kelly approved it quick and made the whole process super easy."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We enjoyed a lovely stay in this pleasant little house. We enjoyed the deck and the thrill of the steep driveway.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is a very comfortable, quiet, and relaxing place to stay. Everything as described and the views from the front porch were beautiful. Kelly had good communication and we appreciated her flexibility with the check in time."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great place! Fantastic host!!
2023-07-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Needs more kitchen utensils and stuff to cook with…everything else was okay…driveway is kept discreet till you book because it’s awful
2023-07-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Perfect accommodations for a family. Internet is a little spotty, but works decent for streaming on the TV. DVD player with DVDs available, board games in closet, fire pit (which we didn't use), beautiful view from wrap around porch. Spent a lot of time enjoying the quiet on the porch. Driveway, like described, is steep/washed out in some spots, but no issues for my Subaru. Had minor issues after check in that were resolved in a timely manner. I would stay here again!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Nice and remote place to stay ( if you can make it up the driveway) very much enjoyed the night I spent there.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,This is a great home I loved it so much so did my kids so much space for them to be free
2023-07-01,5.0,Group trip,We've stayed here several times now and will return again. Kelly is very responsive and the place very well kept. The view from the porch is my get away from the everything.
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Kelly’s place is as cozy and tidy as the pictures show and the setting is even more beautiful when you are standing on the deck! Local info was provided and it was a short drive into town. We got takeout and ate at the Cambridge city park and it was great!
The bedroom was comfortable, the bathroom was shining clean, the kitchen was well-equipped and there was coffee in the cupboard and a snack basket on the table. We would be happy to stay again!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Had a great stay! Close to Salt Fork State Park. Cozy cabin, with a great view from the deck. We plan to stay again sometime in the future. As others said the driveway is steep and curves, but was no problem for our SUV. I would not want to drive it for the first time at night in the dark. The lot is wooded and private and could hear lots of nature sounds at night from the deck."
2023-06-01,5.0,Group trip,Wonderful place!
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Great peaceful place to stay. Beautiful area
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Very peaceful and beautiful. Everything we needed. The driveway definitely needs 4 wheel drive but it totally worth it once you get up there!
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Lovely peaceful place! We will book again!
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,It’s worth the hard climb up! Glad they indicate need for 4 wheel drive.
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Nice Place !!
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The beautiful location and Kelly's quick responses to our questions made our stay near perfect. The description and photos underestimate the beauty and peace of this location. And, it is located minutes from Cambridge with great shopping like Riesbecks grocery and treats like Kennedy's bakery. We had no difficulty with the gravel driveway in our rental car. We hope to return in the future."
2023-05-01,5.0,Group trip,Kelly’s place was just what we could have asked for. Plenty of space and the wrap around porch is the best feature. We had tee times at Salt Fork Golf Course which is about 10 minutes away. Perfect location for us.
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,such a cool location! great location to hang out inside or outside!
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Awesome host and very responsive. Accidentally locked ourselves out of the house and she had it taken care of within the hour. Very responsive and flexible with things! Thank you for a great stay!
2023-05-01,4.0,Stayed one night,A very comfortable and roomy place. I would stay again!
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We had a nice peaceful stay in a beautiful clean place. A nice place outside to hang out by a fire. Would have been great if we had time. Nice bakery in town.
2023-04-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,This was very pleasant transaction . Will stay again
2023-04-01,5.0,Group trip,"Once again we had an beautiful stay. Kelly as always very helpful, we absolutely love the place and the view. We are already planning our next stay."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Awesome place would most certainly stay again thank you
2023-03-01,5.0,Group trip,It was nice place to stay.
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Great place! 5 stars!
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great spot! Wish we would have had more time to enjoy that gorgeous porch! Thanks for a great stay!
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We just wanted a quick getaway last minute to do some hiking at Salt Fork. Place was just what we needed. The driveway up is definitely as described in other reviews… steep and windy, but we managed just fine. I’d be nervous to do in the dark though.
Loved the fire pit. Views from bedroom outside was lovely during the morning snow.
Great price for a homey respite.
Thank you!"
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I always look forward to staying at Kelly's place. She knows how to make someone feel right at home! It's located in a beautiful private location, with nature all around! She is very responsive when needed!! We can't wait for our next stay!!!"
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is the perfect getaway! The house is stocked with all of the essentials. Peaceful and private. Kelly was quick to respond and great to work with. The driveway is definitely super scary to go up. When they recommend not being timid and taking the turn widely, they mean it. I drive a 300 and did fine getting up. I kept a steady pace and took the u-turn wide right and had no problems. I had to go past the drive way and come in from the other direction. It was absolutely worth the scary adventure! We plan to return the next time we can get away. Thank you, Kelly!"
2023-02-01,4.0,Stayed one night,We were very fortunate to get this great location at a great price on short notice. The cabin is on a quiet hillside near Salt Fork Lake state park and Cambridge. It felt quite homey and comfortable. We especially appreciated having labels on the light switches in the main room so we could tell right away which one we wanted. Kelly gave helpful instructions ahead of time and responded quickly to my question.
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay.
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,The cabin was perfect for our stay. The driveway could definitely be difficult. I don’t think I would attempt it with 1” of snow or more. We were lucky with our visit that the weather cooperated. It is quiet. I am sure the deck is awesome with warmer weather. I would recommend this to others.
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,All good.
2023-01-01,5.0,Group trip,Thank you so much Kelly for being such a great host! My friends and I especially enjoyed cooking together and spending lots of time on the porch with the beautiful views and around the fire. We would love to come back again if possible!
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Our family of six so enjoyed our time at Kelly's cabin. It was clean and actually even nicer than we expected from the pictures. It was very quiet even the road down at the bottom of the hill there is very little to no traffic. Salt Fork State Park was fairly close by and our family was able to go out for several different hikes. Cambridge town was very cute and we enjoyed going and seeing the different Christmas displays and Christmas lights at the courthouse. We have four kids ranging from 8 months to 9 years old and the place accommodated us well. There was no Wi-Fi and for us this was great! We enjoyed playing games, cooking, doing puzzles, exploring the property, watching a movie :-).
When Kelly tells you that you need four-wheel drive we would highly recommend that! We had issues getting up the driveway with our Honda Odyssey the first night with the snow and ice. The last day we made it all the way up to the cabin. We did get a little bit of damage under the front of the van."
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Kelly's place was a great place for the night. Very easy to find with a good price. The driveway as many said is very steep and was muddy for us.. made it up in 4x4 without tearing it up.. no cable or internet which bummed our 10 year old out.. found dvds and dvd player which made up for it.. the house was decorated for Christmaswhich is what we were using it for.. Big thanks for allowing my family to stay
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We enjoyed our stay.
2022-12-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,We had a very relaxing stay. It was very quiet and secluded.
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a great time! Upon arrival we found out real quick, the hill was a adventure in it self. I enjoyed being one with nature and all the peace and quiet, the guys missed out on the football game ( no wi fi ) other than that everything was wonderful
Thank You Kelly"
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a great stay! The drive is STEEP, but we enjoyed the large porch, fire pit, and it’s a great jumping off point for lots of things to do in the area. We’d definitely stay here again!!"
2022-10-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great little house in the woods, was very quiet and comfortable for our weekend stay."
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This cabin is fabulous. I would definitely stay again. The driveway is indeed very steep and host recommends a 4wd vehicle. I agree. That being said, I live in an area where steep driveways are normal. I made it up in my 2wd mini van with no problem. Just don’t try to go too slow and don’t stop. Thanks Kelly for a great stay!"
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Spacious and comfortable! Gorgeous views! Loved our stay here.
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Great digs, great view, and great host!"
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Excellent stay. Absolutely stunning. So peaceful and the beds were so comfy! Kelly was extremely accommodating. She allowed us to stop by a few hours before check in to drop off our luggage before our event. We will definitely be back!
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very nice and secluded place. The driveway is steep but we had no issues with our 4 wheel drive truck. They did work on the driveway while we were there and put in drainage to make it even better.
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Really enjoyed my stay, the wrap around porch is a perfect place to enjoy your morning coffee or relax in the evening! I will definitely book this stay again!"
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The driveway is a beast, the last turn make wider than you would normally or you’ll have more challenge than you want. Only stayed one night, would have liked two, super clean, super quiet, everything well thought out (snacks, signage, personals in the rooms). Kelly is super responsive and soooo nice! I wish I was in the area more because I would come here again in a heartbeat!!!"
2022-09-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,"It needs a few updates, I made some suggestions to Kelly. The stove needs replaced, and its a little humid and musty in the cabin. Nothing a dehumidifier couldn't fix. Other wise a beautiful, peaceful, calming, place to relax! I wish there was a firepit out front on the deck side.
The master bed was super comfortable, and the shower was fantastic! Great water pressure."
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"She's not kidding about the driveway being steep! But if you can deal with that, the cabin is a lovely, clean, affordable space to spend the night. Kelly was great to work with. Would recommend if you're in the area."
2022-08-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"A very peaceful lovely place to stay—great place for a quiet retreat but the drive was treacherous, and I am a country girl and not a whimp."
2022-08-01,3.0,Stayed with kids,Driveway is extremely scary and you need 4 wheel drive to get up it. Consider bringing a wifi Hotspot so you can watch the TV. It was quite and a nice time in the woods
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Beautiful location and scenery. The access drive way is extremely steep and rutted bur we did make it up in our minivan. Would definitely stay again.
2022-08-01,5.0,Group trip,Kelly is amazing and so is her home. She thought of every essential you'll need and then some. She seems very sweet and quick to address any issues. Her home is lovely and so is the land. Strongly suggest listening to her when she tells you a 4X4 is strongly recommended to get to the property. Overall wonderful experience and can't wait for a return trip.
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The place was very quiet and very peaceful. Everything was clean. Every amenity you want was there. You better have a four-wheel-drive vehicle to get up that hill. Our Ram 1500 had no problem getting up the hill!
2022-08-01,4.0,Stayed one night,Convenient and as described.
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Quite and Tucked away in the woods
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Nice place. had quiet relaxing weekend here.
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,.
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Great views! Convenient to the highway without feeling like you're on the highway.
2022-07-01,5.0,Group trip,Beautiful place to stay. Yes drive can be scary but it’s worth it!
2022-07-01,5.0,Group trip,Great little cabin that feels like you’re in the middle of nowhere but within minutes of town. Great views. :)
2022-07-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"My husband and I are from the flatland of North west Ohio. We like going to mountainous areas on vacation. It is true the driveway is a challenge. Our first trio up it was not graceful. We did make it. We have a Ford Explorer. It has all wheel drive. We have not had it very long. We are not used to all wheel drive. We also are inexperienced with that type of terrain. It got easier the more times we went up the driveway. The trick is to not stop while going up the driveway. Another trick is not turn sharp at the turn midway. Go almost into the grass and then turn. The gem is what awaits you after you conquer the driveway. The cabin is in a quiet and peaceful area. It is clean and has many extras. Salt Fork State Park is not that far away. It well kept. We went hiking there two different days. The town of Cambridge is really nice as well.
All in all, if given the chance we would go back."
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,The family and I had another awesome stay. Kelly made sure everything is perfect and all questions are answered in a timely manner. Sometimes 4 wheel drive is needed but my daughter made it up in her Ford focus.
2022-07-01,5.0,Group trip,"Our stay at the cabin from 6/25 to 7/2 was marvelous. The cabin was spotless and well stocked. Baths were clean, bedrooms prepared with fresh linen and plenty of clean towels. Beds were comfortable and kitchen had all you needed with plates, cups, pans, pots, coffee maker, etc. The porch is great and very relaxing. Grill had plenty of charcoal and lighter fluid. Fire pit well stocked with wood. No bug issues at all. Plenty of hot water for all showers (5 people). Lovely relaxing location . 4wd or Awd very recommended to navigate driveway. No problems experienced the entire time we were there. We all discussed and agree we will be coming back for another stay. This southern Ohio region is beautiful and the scenery is exceptional. Kelly made sure all was good with us. Outstanding!"
2022-06-01,3.0,Stayed with kids,"The host was very prompt with communication. There were some cleanliness issues, but she was very eager to fix them. Also, the driveway is extremely steep! So be aware if you have a minivan or regular car. Other than that the view was great and it was a nice secluded spot."
2022-06-01,5.0,Group trip,This is a really relaxing place to get away from everything. It is very private and very comfortable. I highly recommend you use a car that has four wheel drive or it'll be a hassle getting up and down it.
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Beautiful setting and relaxing porch! We definitely needed to use our 4 wheel drive to get up the driveway!
2022-05-01,5.0,Group trip,The view was awesome and the cabin was very nice. We really only had to use the 4 wheel drive on rainy days. It was the family and I needed. Kelly made sure the stay was nice and answered any questions.
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Kelly was great and responsive. When we showed up, the house had sustained storm damage that prevented our stay. Kelly took care of canceling our stay and getting us refunded. We were disappointed things didn’t work out to stay, as the location was beautiful and the house was obviously well cared for and prepped for our arrival."
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Had a great evening at the cabin. The description was very accurate on how the house was. Definitely want 4x4 to get up the driveway. Very quiet and relaxing place to stay.
2022-04-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,Quiet location. Great communication. No wifi but we didn't mind. It was a nice place to stay to break up our 2 day trip.
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Super host and proved it. Very roomy cabin on the side of a small mountain full of amenities and seclusion. 4x4 is definitely needed and that proves the seclusion .Its a short drive to stores .. Thank you Kelly for your trust in us it means a lot to us.And thanks for stocking it so well we needed for nothing. .Jeff&Carol Coffman

2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Arrived around 10:30 pm, March 17. The spring peepers were making a wonderful noise across the road. Wish we would have had more time to spend lounging around there; beautiful setting. 4 wheel drive is recommended. It rained Friday and we struggled a bit to get up the driveway, but we made it in our full size Chevy van."
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great, cozy place!! A lot of fun and a beautiful state park near by!!"
2022-03-01,5.0,Group trip,"Picture this, March 5, 2022… The most perfect cabin stay in rural Ohio that one could hope for.
Kelly’s place is exactly what she says it is. The beautiful view, clean cabin, wonderful amenities, wrap around deck, excellent communication, and super clean linens.
We would definitely stay here again!
Thank you Kelly😃😃😃😄"

2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"What a beautiful cabin in a beautiful location! It was peaceful, beautifully prepared, including Christmas decorations. Check in and check out were easy. And what a great value. The driveway is a doozy, but it also allowed for a secluded location."
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Only thing missing is cable/WiFi. You can hook up to the television and Stream through your own devices though. Other than that the place was great. Great snacks and treats on arrival that were unexpected. Clean and roomy. Loved all the Christmas decorations as well.
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Just watch the weather and make sure you understand that the road in is a dirt road with a very steep incline and has sharp turns. Also, it is best to come in in daylight."

2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was my 3rd time staying at Alissa's Valley View Cabin. Each time it has been just what the doctor ordered.

We’ve already booked for next year and can’t wait. If you like peace and quiet stay here !!!
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,We had a great time returning to valley view cabin. This time we are able to share the experience with our toddler daughter who absolutely loved the place.

We booked another trip this summer before this trip ended. Don’t hesitate.

No wi-fi, which didn’t matter to us, but might to someone else. With our provider (T-Mobile) cell/wireless service was somewhat limited at the cabin itself. We were very happy, and would definitely stay again."

Everything we needed was there: dishes, cookware, personal items, dvd player, satellite tv, etc. Comfortable queen size bed and couch. The listing says no wi-fi but I was able to get cell service with Verizon. We hope to come back when the weather is a little warmer."

2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This little cabin provides the perfect getaway! It was super clean and Alissa gave great directions. From walking onto the screened in porch, to the perfectly accommodated furnishings and kitchen, it was exactly the getaway place we needed.
Prior to booking, we had messaged Alissa. She answered quickly and gave honest answers. We went to celebrate our 5 year anniversary and arrived to fresh cookies and a Happy Anniversary message from Alissa. And to top it off, she left a treat for Beau, our dog!
If you are looking for a quiet, but accesible to amenities, this cabin is the perfect spot! Thank you Alissa for being such a great host!

2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great cabin in the woods! Immaculately clean and close to the boat dock. We were even provided free firewood. Great place to stay that is close to everything Salt Fork has to offer. Will definitely refer to friends and family and will definitely return.
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We had a wonderful time staying at Alissa's cabin!! The property is breathtakingly beautiful!! It was so peaceful and the perfect haven from the hustle and bustle of everyday life. The cabin is close to everything Salt Fork is known for--horseback riding, camping, swimming, exploring, hiking, etc.--it's the perfect location! We definitely hope to return next year, and maybe next time it won't rain so much, haha! However, not even the rain could dampen the mood of our vacation! The kids moaned the entire way home that they wanted to go back to the cabin!! None of us wanted to leave!!! Thank you, again, Alissa! We were in need of nothing because you thought of it all, and had us well stocked with the essentials in the cabin. We will highly recommend you to anyone we know who is looking for the perfect vacation getaway!!"
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This cabin is awesome and has everything you need for a peaceful, relaxing stay that is so very close to Salt Fork Lake Park for the hiking or fishing we did. My husband and I had the opportunity to stay with our golden retriever for a couple days and enjoyed the beauty of the nature around the cabin. The host, Alissa, makes the check-in easy and the cleanliness is excellent. We always try to stay at rentals if we travel and this is one of the best!!! Hope to return some time again, Marty and Linda"

2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,I literally had a perfect stay in Alissa’s Valley View Cabin! It was conveniently located near the marina where we dock our boat at Salt Fork State Park. We were able to completely unwind and relax while enjoying the beautiful scenery all around us. I highly recommend!
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Perfect location! Everything we stayed to do (hiking, fishing, Nature Center) was just a short drive, but we felt like we were far away from everything."

2021-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Such a cute house!!! Away from all the chaos of every day life. I needed a place for my family to completely unplug for the weekend and this cabin was perfect!!! We aren’t from the area so we didn’t know about activities in the area. There is a wall of flyers and brochures that gave us so many options. Very close to Salt Fork park! Everything we needed was available.
2021-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This was our first time staying at any Airbnb. My family of four is quickly outgrowing hotel rooms so we looked into this cabin and decided to give it a try. So happy we did! Room for the kids to run outside and a great setup inside. Everything was very clean and well stocked. It was also nice to have an assortment of movies and games. Cell signal was weak, and no WiFi, but we honestly appreciated the chance to “unplug”. Very pleased with our stay!"
2021-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Alissa’s little cabin is so well done and comfortable, you can’t help but unwind and relax. Wish our home was as spotless as the cabin. Despite the weather we were able to bundle up and enjoy the front porch for morning coffee, and in the evening, campfires under a full moon with a glass or two of wine. Slept like babies each night.
With Salt Fork State Park minutes away, hiking was a must.
Truly enjoyed our stay in the absolute peace and quiet of Alissa’s cabin."
2021-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The Valley View Cabin is a very peaceful place to stay. It's easy to get to Salt Fork State Park from the cabin. Just hanging around the cabin is nice enough. Great location. Very clean. I highly recommend this place.

2020-11-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"The cabin is definitely clean. It was obvious that the decor was mostly created by hand. It was beautiful and comforting. The location was very quiet, yet close to all of the state park. I certainly recommend this cabin for anyone that is looking for some peace and tranquility."
2020-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"The Valley View Cabin has everything you need if your looking for a quiet, peaceful getaway from your everyday life. It's cozy and warm and features creative cabin decor. And the screened in porch was a great place to share a meal outside. We planned to use the outdoor fire pit our last night there, but unfortunately it rained, so instead we played games inside. Alissa provides a huge selection to pick from and she also has a great selection of brochures to area attractions and a map of Salt Fork is framed on the wall that proved to be helpful during our stay."

This was the cleanest AirBnB I’ve been in, and the pictures don’t do the place justice! The cabin was so warm and cozy and had the perfect personality with the cabin decor touches! Alissa was a great hostess and was such a quick responder for communication!
Some other awesome perks of the cabin: tons of fun board games to play, brochures for ideas for area activities, and cozy fire pit outside.
My boyfriend and I would surely return for another getaway!"

Perfect space for a couples get away or for a family trip! The screened in porch was perfect for having your meals outside and the fires at night were perfect. Can’t beat the price!!

This space is great with all the kitchen amenities you would need and a great loft for sleeping and relaxing. We also enjoyed the selection of board games and appreciated all the local information provided. We would definitely recommended this relaxing cabin just a short drive from Salt Fork.
2019-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We had a wonderful weekend at Alissa's cabin. It was secluded and peaceful and also close enough to the lake for fishing! The screened in porch was perfect to enjoy a rainy afternoon. The cabin was clean and had everything that we needed.

2019-09-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Very clean and cozy very quiet nice get away
2019-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My sister and I spent last weekend in this cabin. It is far enough ""away from it all"" and close enough to the local attractions. We will stay again!"
2019-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,One of the best places to stay around the Salt Fork Area.
2019-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Quiet, seclusion, nature's beauty. We LOVED not having internet or cell service. We had a lovely valley view where we watched an incredible lightning show in the evening and watched butterflies and birds during the day. The sounds of crickets, birds and frogs filled the air. The cabin was spotless and comfortable. The screened porch allowed us to enjoy the nature without getting mosquito bites. I hated to leave this place and would highly recommend it."
2019-07-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"We had a very relaxing week. Thank you Alissa for your hospitality. The cabin was very quiet and clean. Nice view sitting on the porch where we spent most of our time. Short drive to Salt Fork state park where I went three times and paid for a day pass to swim
Only negative is no WiFi. Phone service was a little spotty at times also.
But if you want to just get away and relax. I highly recommend it."
2019-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,I based my choice to stay here by the raving reviews posted and I couldn't have been more pleased 😁
2019-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Everything was wonderful. Very close to Salt Fork Park. Very clean. Bed & pillows very comfortable. We will be back!!
2019-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Alissa’s cabin was so clean and peaceful! She was so kind and left a treat for our doggo! We’ll definitely be back!
2019-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The cabin is wonderful. Pictures don't do it justice. The place was super clean. So quiet and peaceful. There was no wifi and our phones had no signal so plan on being out of touch. But with that setting it was totally worth it
She has books and movies and board (& video) games for use. Outside charcoal grill and full kitchen. Wonderful.
The place has well water so if you don't like the taste, plan to bring water.
We will definitely visit again."
2019-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,It was a very nice cabin and very clean felt like home
2019-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Alissa was so sweet and accommodating! Cute cabin really close a beautiful lake!

2019-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Everything about this cabin was wonderful. The location was fantastic and the cabin was unbelievably clean. Alissa provides you with all the necessities. We had a great weekend getaway cannot wait to begin booking our return trip. Do not hesitate !
2019-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This is an amazing beautiful getaway. We loved our stay here. Alissa allowed us to check in a bit early which was very nice of her—I was tired from the drive. She provided firewood (I ended up forgetting a lighter the first night the second night I was too tired from hiking so we didn’t actually build a fire) but there is a wonderful space to do so. Everything was clean and thoughtfully designed.
2019-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"It looks exactly as pictured. Very quiet and private. It is on a dirt road that can get slippery when wet.
There’s also no WiFi so you must go closer to park for reception."
2019-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great weekend get away from the hustle and bustle. Super clean cabin with no neighbors in sight. I'll be back soon! Great Arbnb find.
2019-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great stay! Cabin was better than the pictures. Very relaxing. Didn’t see a single person on the road outside the cabin all weekend!
2019-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Great place! Better than the photos. Would stay again.
2018-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I stayed at Alissa’s cabin while I was in town to run a race. Alissa was easy to communicate with, was responsive to messages and requests, and has a quaint and quiet space for guests. The cabin is small but cozy, and the accents were a nice touch. It was apparent Alissa cared about the space."
2018-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place to get away. Close to hiking and all things outdoors. Perfect place to recharge your batteries.
2018-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Nice quiet location. Easy to find. Great value.
2018-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Easy to find, very clean, comfortable bed , and close to Salt Fork state park."
2018-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This review is not for Alissa, she already knows we loved staying in the cabin. This is for anyone thinking of staying here. This place is great. The cabin has the necessities and is super-clean. But the setting!! That's what is so amazing. Most of the 4 days we were there, it rained, but sitting on the screened-in porch with a cup of coffee, & a good book, it didn't even matter. We watched the birds at the feeder, listened to the sounds of the natural world, and just relaxed. One night, we had a bonfire, and as night fell, we looked around and realized that the *only* light we could see was from our cabin, and our fire. No other houses. No headlights. Heavenly. Then we heard coyotes in the distance, and saw glow worms in the grass, twinkling like lightning bugs!!
I think fewer than 10 cars drove by on any given day we were there. This is the perfect place to unplug, re-set, and enjoy the land. Thanks for everything, Alissa!!"
2018-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"A relaxing get away, saw a bald eagle, canary, rabbits, horses...."
2018-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,If ya are looking for a quiet and peaceful place.. This is the place to be!!
2018-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,alissa has a beautiful home. she is an excellent host and is very accommodating. excellent area to relax and pit your feet up. definitely recommend
2018-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Alissa's cabin is very peaceful and was perfect for a weekend retreat. The cabin was very clean and location is great.
2018-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We loved staying here. The place was spotless when we arrived. The location was excellent. A great get away and we have already talked about when we want to come back.
2018-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"When I made the reservation for the Valley View cabin, I (mistakenly) assumed I'd be able to use my mobile phone's data plan during my stay. ""Even your sister who lives in the Tetons has service at her cabin"", I said. This turned out to be a very erroneous assumption on my part--that's how remote the location of Alissa's cabin is. If I had a dollar for every time I mistakenly assumed something...anyway, as a result I was ""forced"" (albeit surprisingly and blissfully so) to unplug and enjoy the books I'd brought, as well as my surroundings. This cabin is beautifully and thoughtfully decorated and has everything you need for some time ""off the grid."" The VERY nearby state park has tons of hiking trails that are easy to find and well blazed. Even someone like me who is usually terrible at reading maps (though not so much anymore, as a result of this weekend!) can find their way. At the cabin, the biodiversity of the surrounding wildlife is impressive. As I sat on the screened in front porch and watched the sunset on Saturday, I also watched a red and green hummingbird make a serendipitous appearance. In sum, I was able to leave Alissa's cabin with a deep sense of gratitude and peace--which is exactly what I'd wanted."
2018-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very clean cabin at a great rate! Quiet location. Beautiful surroundings!
2018-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Alissa was easy to communicate with and even let us know the road conditions the day of our trip because of the cold temps and snow. Also the Cabin was a great space that allowed dogs!
2017-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Fantastic place. Very clean and neat. Right near tons of outdoor things to do. Friendly service and communication. Everything you would want in a getaway cabin.
2017-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very nice cabin. Well cared for and would will definitely return. I'd recommend to everyone if your looking for a little r&r
2017-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great weekend getaway cabin for two! Very clean, comfortable, and away from it all!"
2017-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,A quaint and wonderful place for a quiet getaway.
2017-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"First off, let me say Alissa's cabin is beautiful. Perfectly secluded and tastefully decorated. Comfortable and homey. We had a great time during our stay.
Secondly, I must give praise where praise is due. Due to a complete misunderstanding on my part, the cabin needed an a/c window unit installed when we arrived about 7pm on Friday. The weather was more humid and hotter than expected. It was late Friday evening when I called Alissa about the issue. In less than 10 mins she was at the door and 15 mins more she was done with installing a very nice a/c window unit. This goes to show the amount of pride Alissa has in her cabin and the level to which Alissa is a completely selfless airbnb owner.
We had a terrific time in the cabin and, if in the area, we will definitely be back!"
2017-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,A lot of hiking trails nearby to take the dog to. The screened in porch and fire pit were a plus.
2017-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This is a wonderful cabin in the most quiet rural area. Near Salt Fork State Park. It is the perfect size and it has abundant wildlife. We enjoyed our stay immensely! The had crated furniture is a bonus!
2017-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Clean, quaint, and comfortable! We were looking for a cozy place to enjoy nature and slow down life for a few days, and this trip to Valley View Cabin did the tick! Alissa's directions were easy to follow and we had more than enough choices of things to do."
2017-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Cleanest cabin we have ever stayed in. It was emaculant ! If you are looking for a get away that is private, quiet and away from the hussel and bussel this is It!"
2017-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Amazing cabin! Everything was perfect. Alissa does a wonderful job communicating and is extremely friendly. This is a place I will be coming back to again and again.
2017-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My husband and I really enjoyed our stay at the cabin! We were able to boat all day with friends and family at Salt Fork and then retire to peace and quiet near by. I had no problem at all with my chemical sensitivity, thank you so much for the extra things you did to avoid my problem! It was a beautiful little place to stay!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Group trip,House is super clean. Plenty of parking if you are taking a boat like we were. Great location. Ping pong table was a great feature.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Easy access to highways to get in and to where you need to go. It was nice to have ping pong table, pool table, and basketball for when you just want to hang around the house."
2024-04-01,5.0,Group trip,Everything good. Highly recommended
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Thanks Cindy - we had a great stay and your house is very spacious and warm! Kitchen was great and comfy beds. we would stay again
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,Cindy was a wonderful host! She was very responsive to any of my questions I had and went above and beyond to make my stay excellent. The house was very clean and comfortable. I will definitely stay here again when I come back to town!
2024-01-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"This house worked for us! It's spacious and seemed true to the listing. It was very clean and the beds were very comfortable with cotton sheets. The house is older and a little quirky (like a full bidet in the bathroom.!) but worked well for our family, with 5 adults and 2 kids. The internet & TV worked well, we made several meals in the kitchen, did laundry, and there is a nice little sunporch on the back that our kids claimed as their own for playing in."
2023-12-01,5.0,Group trip,Large spacious home! It was very clean and the linens and towels smelled freshly washed! House sits on a very large lot with lots of outside space! We only used two of the three bedrooms but plenty of room for more guests! Cindy was very responsive via AirBnB messaging. Would rent again!
2023-12-01,2.0,Group trip,"My friends and I recently stayed at an Airbnb that left us with mixed feelings. The house itself was impressively roomy, providing ample space for our group. However, our overall experience was tinged with an unsettling vibe, as the place bore an uncanny resemblance to a funeral home.
The spaciousness of the house was undoubtedly a plus, offering us comfort and freedom to move around. Unfortunately, the décor and ambiance were reminiscent of a place with a more solemn purposed. Medicine cabinets, large mirror, wide basement stairs and antique furniture added to the eerie atmosphere. One peculiar feature that stood out was a mini surgical sink tucked away in one of the bedrooms. While it may appeal to some as a unique touch, for us, it contributed to the unsettling undertones of the house. It felt out of place and left us questioning the design choices.
Despite the creepy vibes, the Airbnb was clean, and the host was accommodating."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We enjoyed our stay in Cambridge!
2023-10-01,5.0,Group trip,"This was the third time we spent at Cindy's, and we've loved it all three times. We will definitely be back again."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Overall great!
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This property was perfect for our stay in the area. The house is comfortable and well maintained. The house has a lot of character and charm. The property surrounding the house is well maintained and is located in a beautiful country setting. I highly recommend staying here!
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Definitely an older home but it was a great stay for us! Cindy was very responsive and kind.
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Cindy's home was exactly what was advertised on the website. She was responded to any questions I had in a very timely manner and very professionally. The home was very clean, in a nice peaceful neighborhood and with plenty of room for our four generations to enjoy. I would certainly rent from her again."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"The home and yard felt safe for both human and dogs (something hotels often fail). Truly large enough home to comfortably hold the 6 people it can sleep, including availability of extra bathroom facilities. Two large flat-screen smart TVs, good Wi-Fi. Car port facilitates loading/unloading car in bad weather. Large mowed lawn area to enjoy, wish we had more time to enjoy outdoor fire pit.
Labeled as out of order: dish washer and wood burning stove.
Outdated electrical: difficult to find accessible grounded AC outlets (several outlets had ""cheater plug"" adapters, no GFI plug in bathrooms. Bedroom ceiling fans turn off when light turned off for the night (and only one chain on ceiling fan, to turn off the fan when light stays on). Would have been nice to use ceiling fan in dark room over night.
However, we made do with the outdated electrical, and everything else was fine. We hope to stay there again."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The house is interesting and quirky. Enjoyed the ping pong table. We especially loved that is has 2 full bathrooms. We had a small issue out of the host's control on the last evening. She was very quick to respond to try to resolve it. She was very friendly and we were happy with her resolution. We will be back. The location is very convenient to both town and nature.
2023-08-01,5.0,Group trip,"The host was very communicative and let me know when the house was ready and gave clear instructions. She was really nice and responded to my questions in a timely manner. The house was very clean, and all the linens smelled amazing! There was plenty of room for our group to hang out for the evening comfortably. We really enjoyed our stay!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,It’s the perfect place for us.
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We loved the stay. The house was perfect for us. The doors to the bedrooms seem to be loud to close and open. However, the house was a perfect location for us. Close to the lake and perfect for what we what we were. Looking for. Very spacious too!!! Loved all the room in the house."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was our 2nd time staying here. House is very close and convenient to the event we’re visiting.
House is clean and yard is well groomed. Enjoyed sitting on the porch drinking our morning coffee.
Thanks for the coffee pot, big plus for us guys and definitely will stay here again next year if available.."
2023-07-01,5.0,Group trip,We had a great stay and she was very helpful. Definitely recommend.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We were in town to visit The Wilds and this house checked the boxes for us. We were a party of 4, had plenty of space inside. Kitchen and dining areas were clean and fully functional. Wifi worked well. Kids enjoyed ping-pong when they weren't on their phones. Our host, Cindy, was very responsive and was proactive in sending the check-in code. AirBNB needs to make it easier to pull up the house manual via their app. I was able to get the manual after typing in the link manually."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"My sister, niece, and grandnieces enjoyed a wonderful Girls Trip at this peaceful home in a quiet neighborhood with beautiful views. Cindy sent helpful instructions for check in and check out as well as suggestions for things to do in the area. This home is clean and all of the furniture and the beds were so comfortable. We enjoyed coffee and breakfast together on the front patio. And we had so much fun in the backyard with the foam gliders that were available to use. The kitchen is so large and well stocked. We had had a great time making pizzas together. There are great places to visit nearby. We went to a local burger place, a vintage shop, and a local market that were recommendations from our check in information. Great trip with some great family time for us!"
2023-06-01,3.0,Stayed with a pet,"No kindling or newspaper for a campfire, or hotdog forks, but it smelled like sewer so bad we couldn't sit outside anyway. Good location. Easy to find. Easy checkout. Clean linens. Doors stuck and were noisy. Good provisions. Good activities. Lots of doors to keep track of. Nice place in spite of the sewer smell."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,It was a great home to stay in. Everything was easy access. Right off the highway.
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,We prefer a country setting when we travel and this location was perfect! Quiet and peaceful with neighbors just close enough to feel secure without feeling cramped. Close to everything we needed. Lovely spacious home with touches of art deco and modern furnishings- perfect for our taste. Lots to do in the area if that is important. Highly recommend and hope to visit again.
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Lots of space inside and outside. Close to Salt Fork and restaurants.
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"In total I stayed at Cindy’s place for around a month and a half for work. It was clean quiet and well equipped. Startlingly large and spacious, close to main roads but extremely private. Parking nook was good for when it snowed and plenty of games to occupy time. Excellent stay."

2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Great place.
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Cindy’s place was exactly as advertised. I stayed for roughly a month. The space is extremely large and well kept. There is lots to do in the house, movies games etc. Would definitely recommend. Kitchen was well equipped, check in was quick and easy with the keypad. Place is quiet and private, but close to salt fork state park as well as Cambridge city center. Well equipped for long stays, pots pans cleaning supplies and cooking supplies etc. great host very flexible with travel arrangements and prompt concise communication, 10/10 would recommend."

2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"This a great place to stay -- plenty of room, well stocked kitchen, comfortable bed, located on a quiet residential street. The yard is large, abundant parking space. Convenient to two Interstate highways, including I-70. Cindy was very attentive and gracious. Highly recommend."
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This house was the cleanest, most charming, best stocked and thought-out house or condo we have ever stayed in, and the most comfortable beds! Great area and the neighbors were quiet and very friendly. We looked forward to coming back home at the end of every day. Our host, Cindy, was very responsive and helpful to all our inquiries. The kitchen is in superb condition with new appliances and the stainless counter-top is the quality of a commercial kitchen. The house is bright and airy with many large windows and large rooms, hardwood floors and updated bathrooms. The heat and air conditioning worked flawlessly. The driveway and property made us feel safe and secure. The many covered porches are great for those warm summer evenings. We would definitely stay here again."
2022-09-01,5.0,Group trip,"We were in town for my daughter’s wedding, and wanted something comfortable and homey for the celebration, this was perfect. The house was 20 minutes from the venue and close to the local town. The house was very clean and met our every need.
Thank you for the wonderful stay!!"
2022-09-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,"This house was so convenient to get to from the highway, and it was also easy to get into town for a bite to eat. The house is cute and quirky and has plenty of room for a family although there were only two of us. The beds were very comfortable! Cindy was a great communicator and made the process and experience pleasurable. I would recommend this Air BNB if you are passing through Cambridge!"
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Perfect spot
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Convenient, spacious and cozy! Great yard for your dogs! Love how they have taken great care of the home…......really appreciate how they've preserved the homes original character! Would definitely stay here again!"

2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We had a nice time, it was close to Cambridge and Cindy was communicative and helpful."
2022-07-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"Spacious, older house with plenty of room for 6. They lay out is odd but that is part of the charm. Cindy is a good host and responds quickly."
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Book this stay!!!
The home, the yard, the neighborhood, the area, the host-all of it made our experience so much fun.
The house- There is so much space. You can spread out so much or all gather in the living space.
Stocked with everything you need in the kitchen if you want to cook.
Coffee area all set up to go!
There are also guidebooks left for you so you can plan any/everything during your stay.
The yard and neighborhood- The yard is gorgeous. So much room for the kids to run around and we took full advantage of the whole yard, basketball hoop, front porch area, and picnic table. The neighborhood is adorable and quite a few neighbors waved bye to us as we were leaving.
The area- You are tucked away on a quiet street but you can get to the historic Cambridge downtown area in minutes.
We loved McKenna’s Market, Kennedy’s Bakery, and Ladders Coffee. City Park and Parkside Tasty Treat ice cream shop are a must if you have kids.
The host- Cindy is the best. Quick to respond, helpful, and so sweet.
If you want a small town, quiet, laid back visit but still have plenty of things to do a short drive away, then this is your home base.
If you just want to be lazy and enjoy coffee on the front porch all week, then this is also your stay.
We will make it a point to look for this home if we do another cross country tour."

I walked around in white socks the entire time we were there and my socks were never once dirty or dingy. I’ve not found many Airbnb’s that clean. The rooms were very spacious and the playroom/toy nook in the upstairs was perfect for our four kids along with the foosball table and the basketball arcade game in the basement. If you’re debating on whether to stay or not, just book it! You will not be disappointed. We plan to stay again sometime next summer so we can utilize the in-ground pool. Brian was very responsive and a great host. We’re looking forward to our next stay!"

Our whole group was comfortable - slept great and even got to take advantage of afternoon naps. Super relaxing stay even with small children. The pool was perfect for some very hot, sunny days and we could all gather and eat our meals in the huge, beautiful and well stocked kitchen.
They had so much more than any other vacation home we’ve ever stayed - we didn’t have to want for anything!

We absolutely loved every detail that was placed into this adorable house! The hospitality we felt was truly appreciated as it was our first time renting an Airbnb! And the pictures on the website do not do this place justice. Thank you for the beautiful place that supplied a lifetime of memories!"

2023-09-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"The price was good for what was there, lots of space with lots of charm. The room darkening curtains in every room were great, and the neighborhood was quiet. It’s not a great place if you’re over 5’5”, the shower is extremely small, as well as the toilet. The bed frame was annoying and hard to move out of the way from, constantly stubbing toes. The rugs under the beds are nice, however I stepped on a small screw which obviously hurt. It really is a charming place, just dated. Even smells like grandma’s house."

It was a great getaway and I plan to do it again!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Place is just as described. Not a modern updated place but I think it lent to its charm. Felt a little like my grandmothers sweet home. Very easy to be around. Close enough to Cambridge but in a very quiet neighborhood. Host was very helpful.

The fire pit was amazing, and the swing set was very enjoyable for our grandchildren.

The furniture was super comfortable, the bed was super comfortable, and it was overall such a homey vibe and we loved it. l have to say - this stay was 10000% better because of the dog….she was literally the friendliest dog ever and we frequently went back out to get our pets in when she was outside. We loved her so much!!! The outside in general was so incredibly relaxing. Beautiful trail and land overall and we absolutely loved hanging out in the hot tub and making a fire in the little fire pit. Super cute market across the street was so close it was walkable and we just loved our experience. We can’t wait to come back here ❤️"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,It was very nice they were very respectful of our privacy and had a beautiful dog
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Extremely relaxing place. All that it looks like and more . The dog, Willow, was such a lovely addition that it was hard to say good bye. She is a total sweetheart and got along wonderfully with our fur baby. She should be a featured attraction! The location was perfect for us because it was half the distance to Columbus and right between where we live. Excellent local restaurants and the hot tub was relaxing, as was the nature walk right behind the house. The recommendations by Carolyn for food are spot on for whichever type of food you prefer. Highly recommended! 5 ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️
Still miss Willow and would like to give her one more belly rub"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Carolyn's place is just what we needed after a long travel day. Extremely quiet and peaceful, and beautiful to walk around, her property is really inviting. The space was perfectly clean and neat, and the bed comfortable. (The couch is limited as a sleeping space, but ok for a child) The hot tub is a nice added bonus, and was hot and ready for us on arrival. Her dog is an absolute gem, lovely and well mannered.
I would definitely recommend this spot for any travelers coming through the area."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The Bunker house was a perfect getaway! The place was spotless and has everything we needed. Carolyn is a great/friendly host. The hot tub was also really clean!! Overall, this was exactly what we wanted and we highly recommend this place :)"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was the most wonderful solo trip I’ve taken in a long time! Getting a couple nights away to relax at Carolyn’s Airbnb was an absolute gift! The bunker house was spotless and so incredibly welcoming and well decorated. I felt right at home! I loved that I could bring my dog along and she loved running the property with Willow, the official bunker mascot and greeting crew! The location is wonderful, especially if you want to get out and walk the property, make sure you bring your hiking boots! Both Carolyn and Jason were very responsive with any questions or issues that came up. The city of Cambridge has some really cool shops downtown, I thoroughly enjoyed Black Cat Vintage, walking around downtown and checking out random stores, as well as dinner to go from 360 Burger - it was delicious! Absolutely wonderful getaway! Before I was checking out, I was already checking my calendar for dates when I can return again! Thank you, Carolyn and Jason!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"I can not say enough about the ""BunkHouse"", and Carolyn!
This was a ladt minute escape, from the campground i was staying at. We had Severe storms and multiple tornado warnings expected.
I was very frightened, and when i found the ""BunkHouse"" , i was instantly relieved.
Carolyn worked above and beyond to accommodate my last minute request.
Her home was so welcoming, and unique.
I highly recommend !!!
Thank you do much, Carolyn"
2024-03-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,Had a good weekend but very little privacy outside and no one to watch the dog he was friendly and nice just don’t like the jumping on me part when I took the trash out ruined one of my hoodies.

2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was the perfect house for our relaxing girls weekend getaway! They have a beautiful property to walk around and the sweetest, most well behaved dog to greet you. The Bunker is just as cute and cozy as the pictures.

2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Our Stay at The Bunker House was exactly as pictured. When we arrived the house smelled so good.

2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Loved the space. It worked really well for our ministry retreat. It was clean and comfortable and had everything we needed for preparing meals. They even added a new gas grill outside which we used a few times. I would recommend bringing slippers if it’s cold outside. The cement floor was kind of cold.
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"More than accommodating, and friendly. The property is clean and well cared for. We would go again !"
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Our stay at the Bunker House was so peaceful and relaxing, the property and our experience was an easy 5 stars. ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️
Our favorite feature was definitely the hot tub. The string lights overhead were so pretty too! We also appreciated having the fridge and oven. It was something we didn’t think we’d use but it was so convenient that we made a quick Walmart run and did a little bit of cooking during our stay. We were so grateful that cooking tools were provided.
The property was incredible, very spacious for a studio, and immaculately clean. We would not hesitate to stay again and recommend to others. If you have the opportunity, definitely stay here! 💗
An honorable mention has to be the hosts’ dog, Willow. She is so adorable, incredibly well-trained, and sweet! I miss her already lol!"
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This place is amazing, quiet, and has the cutest hot tub! My girlfriend and I had a relaxing time and will definitely stay here again!"
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The place was very clean and just a great overall experience. We mainly stayed in but we did love the hot tub and also hit up the Yellow Butterfly Winery. The dog was also a great addition. She was a great walking buddy down to the ponds. Had a great weekend. Thanks you.
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Excellent Bunker House!!!!! This was my first stay at any Air BnB. It was very easy to book. Carolyn was awesome. I felt very welcome upon walking into the space. The hot tub was so relaxing after a long day of work. The stay was awesome all the way around. If you are in the area you gotta book a night at this one!
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Very comfortable and clean. Everything you need, plenty of blankets, very nice hot tub & and adorable dog too 😊! Would definitely recommend!"
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Wonderful stay. Love any host that takes a picture of the kitchen drawer so you know the cooking supplies available. Great quality on the details: extra toiletries in case you forgot something, quality toilet paper, towels for the hot tub and the shower etc."
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This place was south a diamond in disguise. The pictures don’t do the amazing little but very spacious unique and personalized place. The hosts were so humble and gracious. They even personalized my stay with a nice touch with a welcome on the butchers paper dispensary. The host have extraordinary and great amenities and the hot tub with the outside lighting was just the relaxing atmosphere I needed. And another huge surprise was in the morning the views were extremely pleasant and just a great start to the day. Your dog is such a ham and so well behaved. And can’t wait to visit again hopefully longer soon. This place is the perfectly priced little getaway.
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We loved our time at the Bunker House. It was warm and cozy and the hot tub was private and so relaxing. All the little thoughtful touches really impressed me. Carolyn was very responsive and kind
We would love to come back!"
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place was great! Everything was clean, well maintained, and cozy. The fireplace was lovely and the hot tub was amazing. It’s very private, but it is right next to the main house. The place is very open, and you can hear everything, which was perfect for us, but may not be ideal for everyone. Carolyn was a wonderful host and was very quick to respond to all questions."
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is a wonderful place. It is quiet and peaceful while being close to town, and was wonderful to stay at for a few days. The Bunker House had absolutely everything we needed to feel at home."
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"I loved everything about this cute little bunker. The location was great for me and the place was exactly as described on the listing.
Bed was super comfortable. The couch does turn into a futon bed, however I don’t think it would be suitable for an adult. A child would fit nicely on the couch bed.
Even thought the floors are concrete, the bunker stayed nice and warm and cozy!
My only suggestion would be maybe add a full length mirror.
Also, we never could get connected to the Wi-Fi router. The host did offer to help get it connected, but I was just too tired to mess with it so I just used my phone data while there.
Other than that, it was perfect and I will definitely be staying again when I visit my family!
I would recommend this bunker to any single travelers or a couples!
Thanks Carolyn!"
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Very convenient location. Easy check-in. The property is beautiful - we loved our leisurely stroll around the property and getting to play with Willow (their adorable pup). The hot tub was also great after a long day of driving. We hope to return again soon!

2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Peaceful place to spend a few days before the holidays with my family. Kitchen was well stocked to cook your own food. Great places for food & coffee in Cambridge. Cozy and inviting.
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We were in town visiting Cambridge to see the Christmas decorations and Carolyn’s place was perfect. If I had found it sooner I would have stayed two nights!!!

Felt right at home."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I immediately felt comfortable and settled in the Bunker. It feels very warm and cozy. The surroundings are also very quiet and peaceful, so I slept very well. Having a super comfortable mattress certainly helped. Highly recommend this place!!"
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We enjoyed staying here while visiting family in Cambridge. Very cozy, clean and has plenty of light. I enjoyed the ""coffee table"" books that were placed here and there. There is a beautiful pond and walking area on the property, but we didn't get to enjoy it on this visit. (Hopefully next time) My husband said the hot-tub was great. The jets were all in perfect working order. Thank you for having such a lovely spot!"
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Perfect place to stop on our road trip, very charming bunker and host was very responsive and welcoming."

2023-11-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,We were not able to walk the property because of hunting season and her family using the property for hunting. It was the ability to walk the property that made this unit perfect for us and we didn’t know until 2 days before arrival. So we started off disappointed. The unit was cozy and well maintained

They have a beautiful piece of land that you can relax on after hiking all day, and a cozy hot tub to ease your achy muscles after a long hike. Definitely going to save this one for future trips to the park!"
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"My wife and I were using the stay as a pass through town to start our anniversary trip. After one night we wish we stayed longer. comfortable bed, great place, and an amazing hot tub that felt really secluded. She was also super responsive and a pleasure to speak with.

My senior dog had fun exploring the lawn. It was nice to have everything on one level at the house as stairs can be a challenge for him. We had a great stay.
After I checked out, Carolyn was even so kind as to let me know I had forgotten something at the house. I was able to go back and pick it up."

2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Very clean, well equipped kitchen, beautiful surroundings, just what I look for, convenient to activities I planned, we had a great week."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,We enjoyed our stay at the Bunker House and so did our Aussie. Looking forward to returning very soon. The hot tub was very relaxing😊
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The Bunker House is immaculate and charming. Appreciated the attention to detail and overall coziness of the home. The instructions left were clear and amazingly helpful. The host left small touches of perfection everywhere you look. As a new grandparent to a child nearby, would eagerly visit again."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"My boyfriend, myself and our dogs had an incredible and relaxing stay at The Bunker House, and we are definitely thinking about returning sometime in the future.

2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Carolyn’s place was my favorite airbnb so far! it was super clean and the hot tub was wonderful, there was a lot of nature to enjoy and it was a very lovely experience, she also has a dog next door that’s very cute and wholesome!! i definitely recommend this airbnb!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Such a beautiful place, wish we had more time to explore!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"This place was awesome!! The bunker itself is very cozy, welcoming and a very well designed use of the space. It included several amenities I didn't expect but appreciated having. The property around it is something you have to explore! I almost didn't and I am so happy I did. There is a long atv trail that branches off into different directions, I strongly encourage exploring each way. It is not a short walk to the fire pit though so make sure you plan ahead if you want to make use of the provided smores supplies. Carolyn was very kind and accommodating of my check-in needs. I plan to come back next time I visit Salt Fork Park."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay for a few days

2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Five stars across the board. Beautiful, peaceful, relaxing.
Remarkably, the hot tub worked! I’ve been to so many Airbnb’s that list a hot tub among the amenities, but when you arrive the hot tub is broken. It is a consistent issue with Airbnb properties. So, it was a very pleasant surprise to stay at an Airbnb with a hot tub that works. It was pure bliss to soak in the hot tub after a day of driving. Many thanks!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I really enjoyed my four-night stay in the Bunker House. It's a very cozy, comfortable space. Carolyn was very fast responding to any messages I sent but otherwise left me to enjoy my solitude, just as I wanted! I had no problems the entire time I was there, and I thought it was well worth it for the money. I would happily return there given another opportunity."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Had a great time here. Loved the hot tub and everything lived up to expectations. Great place for couples. Property was beautiful with the two ponds in the back.

2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,beautiful house! super recommend
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Wow! What a gorgeous place to stay! Although brief, I was so floored by the details of amenities and thoughtful touches of the home. I arrived after dark so was unaware of the absolutely stunning surroundings until the morning and wish I had more time to walk amongst the trail and enjoy the little lake behind the home. I slept impeccably on such a comfortable bed and was glad that I was able to cook and do some laundry as well! Having been on the road for 4 days, it was much needed! I can’t express how great of a stay this was, would highly recommend! Thank you to the hosts for being so incredibly kind and thoughtful ! x"
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The Bunker house was perfect. The new hot tub was an added bonus! So many unique touches.

2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,I was looking for a quiet place for me & my dog. Very cozy and exactly like the pictures. Unfortunately I got sick from something I ate and couldn't take my dog on walks around the beautiful farm. Maybe next time!

2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"If you are debating about booking this place do it! The bunker house was perfect for my husband and I. It was cozy, nicely decorated and well equipped. The bathroom area was actually larger than the pictures. It would be nice to have a door on the bathroom. 360 Burger was a half mile away. We were able to walk down for a great burger, onion ring and boozy milkshake. The grounds of the Airbnb look gorgeous with the ponds and walking areas. I bet it’s beautiful in the summer!"

2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"This was a great spot to stop with my dog when I was driving across the country. It’s cute, cozy, and quiet but close enough to the highway that it was easy. Carolyn was responsive and helpful."
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We just needed a quiet place to stay overnight as we were moving. The place was beautiful, easy to find and peaceful. We appreciated the hospitality so much! Would definitely stay here again."
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Carolyn’s Airbnb was absolutely amazing. I arrived on Christmas Eve from out of town (not used to cold weather anymore) and the place was welcoming, warm, cozy and so pretty. I love all the thought put into decorating and the many nice things she had out like Keurig and kcups, which warmed me right up, and a hot shower in the nice, clean bathroom! I also slept great in the cozy bed too! I really enjoyed staying here and will absolutely be checking to see if it’s available so I can stay again next time I’m visiting from out of town!"
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great place! Great hosts! We will keep coming back!
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,The place was cute and well designed. It was convenient and hospitable. The place did get a little chilly at night but we figured out the fireplace heater which helped. It was cozy and private. A wonderful stay!

2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The Bunker House is an absolutely amazing place to stay! You can really tell the attention to detail Carolyn has gone through to make every single one of her guests feel super welcome. Even down to all the lights being left on for my arrival (I got there late when it was dark) and all the very detailed and informative instructions on how the whole place works and what remote goes to what - was super helpful and appreciated! She also made a very nice personal welcome sign that made me feel right at home.
Overall the entire place is very unique and super cozy. The coffee station was also awesome to have and I absolutely loved my stay. Super great value for the price as well. Thanks again!"
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"To start our evening, I took a wrong turn and when we called to share our predicament, Jason came to our rescue. So sweet! Above and beyond. Not even Grumpy!
Once we really arrived the place is absolutely delightful! Full of the details that show a host who really cares. The kind that make you feel like a friend is having you over and wants you to be perfectly comfortable."
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Everything was as pictured / described. Easy check in process with the key code door. We slept well in the bed. There were plenty of extra towels, washcloths, and blankets. There is a keurig and a nespresso machine with pods available. The mini xmas tree and small holiday decor gave the place an additional warm touch.
It's basically a studio layout with no real doors (just curtains) separating the bedroom from the living room / kitchen area and the bathroom from the bedroom, which was totally fine for my boyfriend and I, but if you're bunking with anyone you'd feel shy pooping around, that variable may be a problem hahaha.
The shower is tight quarters so if you're a very large person, you may feel cramped, but it's fine for an averaged sized person.
Overall a great stay and definitely plan on booking again when returning to visit family in the future!"

2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Carolyn’s space was better than expected! So quaint and cozy. Everything was SPOTLESS and all the little extra touches were so wonderful. Anytime I am coming through the area again, I will definitely be staying here!"
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"This little bunker was exactly what I needed. My dog and I stayed for a weekend to get out of Cleveland for little break after a rough few weeks. The bunker couldn’t have been cuter, cleaner, or more prepped (filled with hygiene items, toiletries, kitchen supplies, spices, coffee, and snacks!).
The land was amazing which was so great for my dog who just has a small yard back home. Absolutely gorgeous. I reached out about having a time where their beautiful dog was inside so that I could go out with my girl (who tries to start trouble with other dogs) and Carolyn replied almost immediately and was super kind and accommodating by putting her dog inside so we could use the land without stress. I so appreciated it!
Shops, delis, and nature areas around the area were fun to explore and ended with lots of good food! I’m so grateful I decided to do this last minute trip. Thanks for having me, Carolyn and family!"

The hosts left bottled water in the fridge, extra toiletries in case we’d forgotten anything, and sweet snacks! The house sits on a beautiful property of fields, woods, and small ponds. An easy 10 minute drive to either Salt Fork park or Cambridge. We would definitely stay again."

Attention to details, cleanliness, thoughtful and comfortable decor, no difficulties while there… all make for a great experience. This place has everything you need. They’re not stingy on things like towels, they have nice pans/spices, etc. They even have complimentary goodies, water, things for s’mores. Great stay, A+ hosts! My only wish was that it was maybe a little cheaper; it seemed just a tad pricey."

2024-06-01,5.0,Group trip,We had a wonderful stay!!
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Such a nice little place. We were able to walk downtown. There were 8 of us (7 girls/women) so it was a little tricky with one bathroom but it worked great. Plenty of mirrors for getting ready. The place was amazingly clean!
2024-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"It was a great place about 5 miles from the exit we took. Definitely utilize the parking behind the house as street parking was taken by neighbors. Extremely clean home, kind hosts, and the choice of toys from a basket helped out 4 kids be entertained along with the Roku tv. Lived the privacy of a master bed on the 1st floor, and the kids room being upstairs."

2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,We loved it! Really comfortable and clean. Great for families (there are toys to play with and a big backyard and quiet neighborhood). The only “con” is that it’s 6 miles off the highway.
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Friends and I were meeting for a quiet weekend of catching up, reading, snacks, games and this place was centrally located for us. And it was perfect for what we had in mind :). Miriam was responsive to our reservation and questions for local recommendations immediately. Check-in process and instructions were clear. And the house was exactly as described and cozy for a friends low-key weekend. And the homemade cookies that greeted us on the kitchen counter were AMAZING!"

2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Miriam was fantastic and I’ll probably book again sometime this year. The internet here was fast and reliable, which was very important because I work remotely. We booked during the winter and it was quite warm and cozy. The host was very reliable and responsive to any questions we had. The kitchen was nice and had all the pots/pans/utensils we needed. There is a Dairy Queen within walking distance as well that made it easy for fast food.
I highly recommend Miriam!"
2023-12-01,5.0,Group trip,"We traveled for a two day sporting event, the home was the perfect quick 5 min get away to bounce back and forth. After being stuck in a gym for several hrs it was just like returning home. The home was decorated beautifully and was very clean. Plenty of space for all 6 of us to re-charge after a long day.

2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"This house is beautiful and extremely comfortable. It isnt overly crowded and is beautifully decorated. It reallt just feels peaceful there. The porch swing and back porch patio are great places to hang out. There were amazing blueberry muffins waiting for us when we arrived and our fur babies really enjoyed the back yard! Aside from the home just being beautiful, its on a very quiet street and is easily accessible. Miriam was extremely responsive with me and was extremely kind. The biggest plus for me in this home is that the beds were EXTREMELY comfortable!!!! I am always shocked when i stay places because the beds are always hit or miss. My husband and I have back issues and this bed did not irritate our problems at all. I am so thankful for that! Any time I go back to Barnesville, I will be staying here. Thank you, Miriam!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We spent a nostalgic weekend in Barnesville. Our mother and grandmother grew up in this town and we spent many holidays and summers there. The cottage was perfect for our needs. The host left us fresh cookies, tomatoes and a green pepper. We were thrilled to find out we could buy Hall’s Herb Ham Salad at Riesbeck’s Market Deli. This was a childhood favorite of ours. The beds were very comfortable. The kitchen was stocked with everything you could need, including water bottles in the fridge. The cottage was nicely decorated. The neighborhood was quite and quaint. We will definitely stay here again on our return trips to Barnesville."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"From the moment we booked through to the end of the stay everything was wonderful. Miriam and Jake are great hosts and made us feel so very welcome.

,,,"The cabin was quiet and isolated as described. Kelly was very communicative and did reach out to ask how everything was.
However, the cabin itself was not what we expected. There were many bugs (between me and my wife we killed at least 15 and found several more dead moths on window sills etc). Millipedes, spiders, stink bugs, etc.
The cabin also had a very strong order that smelled almost like trying to cover up a smell. We had to wash everything we brought with us to remove the smell.
Before we booked we had chatted with the host and she said the cabin sustained damage from a storm but repairs would be completed a month before our stay. When we stayed the ceiling was half painted, there were cracks in the drywall and molding was missing in a couple rooms. I'm not sure if this was related to storm damage or not.
Additionally, we briefly tried to turn on the TV/DVD player and found the TV didn't work. The picture color was distorted and the TV did not have working sound.
We had to leave our stay early for personal reasons, and Kelly did offer us a refund, however we did not cancel our last day and I don't think it's fair to deny the host our rental when we left unexpectedly early.
Kelly did ask during our stay if everything was ok with the cabin, however we didn't explain the issues. There was nothing anyone could reasonably do to fix a dirty, smelly bug filled cabin in a day. I did tell her the TV wasn't working, but she had no comment on that."
,,,"We were running ahead of schedule and asked if our Air Bnb would be ready a half hour early. Kelly said she was in Texas and her daughter was cleaning and would let me know when it was ready. Check-in time is listed as 3:00 but she did not let me know it was ready until 3:32. All other properties we have stayed in gave us the lockbox code for the key 24 hours ahead of time, but it wasn't until I asked for it that morning that it was provided to us (I like to know ahead of check-in in case I don't have signal, etc.).
Prior to booking, I read reviews and many stated 4-wheel drive is necessary to get up the driveway. We do not have a vehicle with that ability so we I messaged Kelly to ask if that really was needed and she said it was not. Then when she responded to my question about the lockbox code, she said she recommends 4 wheel drive. Getting up the driveway was a pretty scary experience, and I should have listened to the reviews. It's very steep, has a couple sharp turns, and has several ruts. I wasn't sure if we were going to make it up. Coming downhill was easier, but we scraped the bottom of our car. From that point on we just parked at the bottom of the driveway and walked up and down.
Underneath the porch there were old mattresses, several bags of trash, and other junk. The walkway to the door was blocked by a pile of firewood that had fallen over. The home has a wrap-around porch which was the only thing we actually enjoyed about the property. Although the porch table was filthy and we had to clean it off. There was a cooler on the porch full of rain water and a wheelbarrow by the fire pit was also full of rain water.
Inside, there were bugs everywhere we looked. The floor, walls, ceiling, curtains, furniture, etc. Mostly millipedes but also ants, stink bugs, and other insects. I live in the country so I'm used to some bugs getting in, but this was disgusting. We wore shoes the entire time because we were stepping on a bug every time we turned around. The walls had paint peeling off, cobwebs on ceiling fans, there were food particles in the sink, the master bedroom closet door was falling apart, there was hair in the bathroom sink, shower, and floor, black spots on the inside of the shower curtain (likely mold), a moth and other bugs in the dryer, and the place was all-over dirty and not kept up with well.
Upon opening the fridge we found a case of beer with an empty bottle, and a lunch bag of tuna pouches and a container of leftover hamburgers. There was also a pasta strainer in the freezer(?).
I have sensitivities to fragrances so I requested room sprays and air freshener plug-ins not to be used, as well as our sheets and towels washed in free & clear detergent. As far as I could tell, our sheets and some of the towels were (some still had fragrance), but there were four air-wick plug-ins throughout the house, which was irritating.
At this point, we were looking for other Air Bnb's or VRBO's to stay in. Unfortunately for us there were none available in the area that short of notice, and we would have left to stay in a hotel, had it not been for the cooler of food we brought that needed to be kept refrigerated.
The burners on the stove are very uneven, which made cooking frustrating, but doable. Some of the cooking utensils definitely should be replaced, for instance there was a plastic spoon that had pieces of plastic coming off, and a pot with the coating scratched up. There were enough utensils/cooking equipment for what I needed, but none of it was great quality and it was a pretty random assortment. The coffee maker was also dirty and had old grounds in it, and the kitchen trash can still had trash in it.
The bed was decently comfortable, but when I stripped the bed before we left, I found a ton of little hairs at the foot of the fitted sheet.
Maybe this was just a one-off because of the other good reviews, but we didn't feel like we could relax at all because of the unkemptness of the home and property. We tried to spend as little time as possible at the home and have never been so relieved to check-out. I do not take leaving negative reviews lightly as I truly try to see things in a positive light and help hosts out by leaving good reviews, but we did not enjoy our stay and can't believe we paid money to stay here. I would not recommend this Air Bnb to anyone."
