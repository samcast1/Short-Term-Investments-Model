2023-10-01,5,Group trip,LA little difficult to find. The driveway would benefit from reflecting poles at the end. I turned into the ditch backing out. There were a team of people from 20-70 who couldn‚Äôt figure that how to watch a football game on the living room tv. The remote is too worn for one thing. We couldn‚Äôt get fox sports on Sat or nbc on Sunday. No lack of weird sports channels including ai

2023-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We loved Vicki's Place Fishing Cabin 3! As someone with mobility issues, the incline down to the riverbank is steep and quite the walk back up! (Which is obviously no control of the property owner) But if you can make the walk, I HIGHLY RECOMMEND YOU DO. It's gorgeous and worth it. We fished all afternoon along the riverbank while my child found some cool fossils!
The chairs near the firepit are comfortable, and you could sit there all night in peace and quiet. But crawl into that bed for even MORE comfort.
We'll definitely be booking another stay at Vicki's Place!
Also! If you're looking for places to fish but the weather is uncooperative, check out the heated docks in the area, so you can fish all day without weather worries!"

2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Overall this place was great. I was wanting a middle of nowhere escape to be able to just be in nature and fish and just enjoy the outdoors. This did all of it. Beautiful views as well. The fire pit at night was also a plus. Would recommend if you‚Äôre needing a nice escape to the quiet outdoors.
2023-07-01,4,Stayed with kids,"Very quaint place to get away. Internet signal was very strong, but only needed for email. We had zero time to watch TV! which is exactly what I hoped for. Played on the river and explored the local parks. Miami not to far away to grab a quick dinner. Cabin was fully stocked, and loved the fact we didn't have to go buy wood for the fire pit. Had a deer visit us each morning from our porch."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The cabin was very nice, clean, beautiful setting in the woods. Peaceful sitting on the porch and enjoying nature. Vicki was very easy to get in touch with and very attentive and friendly. Enjoyed our stay and would come back."

2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I have never had such a well stocked kitchen. We were pleased since we had some holiday pies to prepare for a family gathering. There was a train nearby but it never disturbed us in the least. The beds were very comfy. Everyone slept well. The towels were luxurious like you find in a 5 star hotel. The washer and dryer are brand new and cleaned/dried quicker than most appliances. There was a large Keurig coffeemaker and all the fixings! The house was large and very roomy.

Very clean and comfortable for our entire family. We will definitely look to stay here again when we are passing through on one of our road trips."
2022-12-01,5,Group trip,"This place is newly fixed up, and they took the time to thoughtfully decorate and make it feel like home. We were just crashing for the night on our way to Dallas from Madison, WI. So it was fantastic that we found this place on short notice, and they had it all ready for us. There were waters in the fridge, coffee on the counter, and even pop tarts and granola bars. Thanks for having us!!!"

Very well appointed cabin with premium snacks ( cereal, popcorn, etc), full kitchen with all necessary dishes and cooking utensils.
Karen goes above and beyond not only in furnishing the cabin but also in the small touches that make the Treehouse very cozy and inviting. We loved our time there and will definitely be back again. 5+ Stars!!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"The Tree House was a perfect getaway. It was just as described and more. It was peaceful, beautiful, and spotlessly clean. We had dinner on the deck and then sat in the rockers enjoying the view. The bed was comfortable. The way the house is built, there's a window above the bed so that at night, I could look up at the sky and see the stars. There are stairs, but the risers are shorter than regular stairs. My husband, who has had a stroke was able to go up and down easily using the hand rails. Overall, we had a lovely stay. I didn't want to leave!"

2024-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We enjoyed our stay at the cabin along with River! It was a perfect little hide-way and peaceful at night. The deck was awesome and loved the cedar wood detailing inside! Eric and Coren both came over as we were on the porch, and it was great to chat with them and showed us around their area. We were able to have our fur babies so grateful for that, took them on a walk along the river front area. Highly recommended this cabin if you are doing any fishing on the river as the boat ramp is only 5 miles away. Super close! They gave us dinner recommendations in the nearby town close by. We will be back in the future for sure! Thanks Again for Everything! Go Huskers!

Hot water was at the ready, but it gets scorching hot so be careful of the temp. On our last night, the ac stopped working so we had trouble sleeping. The neighborhood was very nice and quiet.

The highway that goes by is quite busy but slows way down in the evening/night so the noise didn‚Äôt bother me. I don‚Äôt know about the rest of the beds but mine was super comfortable. (My husband and I were in the back bedroom by the laundry). The location is great to get to Afton, Grove or Monkey Island. We personally love the proximity to Miller Pecan‚Äôs a definite stop every time we are in the Afton area. Thank you Nina for another great stay!!!"

This would be a great place for anyone going to Grand Lake. The sisters are so so kind and always responsive! I always give the stay 5 stars. This time the house was not quite as clean as we would have liked it to have been, but they made it right! There was a mishap between them and the cleaning crew, they owned the mistake and apologized. I only mention this, because it shows the honesty of the hosts. Not many people in today‚Äôs world own their mistakes without making excuses and these ladies did. We were completely impressed and pleased with their response and quick action.
We will be back. The place is homey and the pies they left for us were amazing."

The floors are tiled throughout the house which makes cleaning up after a dog extremely easy. All of the appliances are new and the dishwasher and washer/dryer are quiet.

As before, the house is exactly what you need: clean, many beds, and a nice kitchen to prepare meals. However, what puts Nanny's over the top is the kindness you receive from the hosts. We arrived to cookies and were offered pies as well. Nina already had already made us two pies but when she learned coconut cream was my favorite, she made one special. Nothing like 3 fresh (and still warm) pies to celebrate my 36th birthday.
There were lots of flies this trip and they thoughtfully brought over some spray for the doors. We couldn't find a wine opener and they quickly ran a personal one over; it's those small details and the kindness that will keep us coming back.
Thanks again."

2024-05-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We loved this place so much we stayed another day! It was such a relaxing and restorative stay for us :) The cabin was more spacious than I imagined, and incredibly comfortable and clean. We felt so safe in this spot too. Very private and quiet, with the reassurance of knowing our hosts were close by if we needed to reach out. Would absolutely stay again if we‚Äôre ever in the area!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We had a wonderful time ! I would recommend this place to anyone looking for a relaxing beautiful setting to unwind in!
The dogs loved it we loved it!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,John was fantastic at responding to my questions before I booked. we're driving 18 hours on a trip to Texas and his place was on our route for a one day stop. thank you!!!
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,2nd time here. was so great that I had to return. great location and host. highly recommend.
2024-04-01,4,Stayed one night,Easy check I
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This was our third time staying at the cabin and we just love it more and more every time. John and Ginny clearly put continuous effort into making this a great place to stay. Traveling with two large dogs isn‚Äôt always easy, but having the cabin to count on for our trips down to Joplin really takes the stress off knowing they are comfortable and have a quiet place to relax. This is by far our favorite Airbnb and we are so thankful to John and Ginny for providing this wonderful little spot to stay."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,Great place to stay off the beaten path. GPS gets you right to the road. Just watch close cause it is easy to miss.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,very peaceful cabin area. we really enjoyed our stay. John was very quick to respond to a few questions I had before booking and was extremely helpful. we will definitely stay again if in the area.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This was a real find. We are traveling with our dog, and this cute little cabin was a peaceful oasis for our one night stay. The dog could run freely, it was quiet and private and well appointed. We highly recommended this place."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"This was a perfect spot to get away for a little bit! The cabin was very cute and cozy and had everything I needed, and the property is perfect for walking around in just nature with none of the noises of city or traffic. I would just say use Google maps when you‚Äôre trying to find it, Apple Maps puts it a little further down the road. But John gives great instructions for finding the place, and it‚Äôs marked well out at the road! I‚Äôll be back."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"John‚Äôs place is a really amazing one room cabin with everything that anyone could need. Very relaxing and cozy, once you get the temp right in the room, a very comfortable bed. I like my mattress just a little bit more firm than most. Hard to find in an Airbnb. We enjoyed the property and took nice walks around during the day with our pup. If we ever have an opportunity to stay there longer, we will. It‚Äôs a little hard to find only because our phone map suggests it‚Äôs .6 miles from the turn in Peoria, when it‚Äôs actually more like a mile. Very well marked at the road and an easy drive up the driveway even in the dark."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,used for 2 nights on my way through and back. My dad and I were delightfully surprised by the place. ended up being one of my most enjoyable Airbnb experiences.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Wonderful cabin with every amenity we could ask for. Plenty of space to walk the dogs.Quiet and remote location.

2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,Such a lovely cabin experience. Peaceful and very clean. Everything was well thought out. The washer and dryer was a huge plus considering we were traveling cross country. Thanks again!
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This is our second time staying at John's place and we have loved it both times. It's very cozy and comfortable, it has everything we would want in a place to stay, and we love the peaceful location. :-)"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Only suggestion would be to add a photo of the the turnoff. GPS was all over the place. Otherwise, couldn't ask for a better place to get in some R&R."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"During our recent stay at John's cabin, my family and I were delighted by the cleanliness and privacy of the accommodation.

2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"GPS will give you the wrong address, so make sure you read clear directions John gives! It was peaceful and no one around to bother you! It was clean and there was even washer and dryer! I did this solo as female woman and I can tell you I didn‚Äôt have any problems. Thanks for a great stay!"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Great place for a single or couple. ABSOLUTELY Loved the place!! Just be aware the maps do not have the correct location so at night it can be a little hard to find. John gladly helped me through it! I‚Äôd stay there anytime! Be awesome to see what all else he adds to the property next I visit!
2024-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Great host, the cabin exceeded our expectations! Will definitely book again soon!"

2024-01-01,5,Stayed one night,We were amazed by this little gem. John was incredibly responsive and helpful and it made our experience. We stayed on a particularly cold night and the cabin stayed cozy. We had a beautiful sunset and a great view of the stars at night. Access was simple and the property was incredibly private. We spent the evening in and had a great time but we would have been happy to use this location as a jumping off point for nearby activities if we would have stayed longer.
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We had a lovely stay at John's cabin. The property was beautiful to walk around with our dogs. We were looking for a quiet, cozy spot and this checked all the boxes for us. Had everything we could need and we felt right at home.

2023-11-01,5,Stayed one night,Always love staying with John
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Great cozy cabin. Bed is a fold out. Go slow upon arriving address a little tricky to find. Very clean & had all the toiletries we needed. John is very responsive.
2023-11-01,4,Stayed with a pet,"Quiet place back in the woods, great for pets. Bed was a little uncomfy but place was clean and laundry was great."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"Beautiful and peaceful area. Took a nice walk. The cabin was very clean, and comfortable. I would stay there again if I was in the area. John gave me great directions after I booked but of course my GPS didn‚Äôt follow them but John was easy to get ahold of to tell me what to do!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with a pet,An adorable and peaceful cabin encapsulated by beautiful scenery. The kind of place you never want to leave.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Great Place to stay for a couple of days at a time, but not ideal if you have a long drive the next day as there is only a Futon, which isn't exactly comfortable, wasn't easy to get to sleep.
Loved the Location, Cabin itself, and price point was awesome."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,It was so great getting to return to John‚Äôs place! My husband and I really enjoyed our stay. Definitely will return in the future!

2023-10-01,4,Stayed one night,awesome place!!
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,Extremely clean. Much larger than appears in pictures. Felt safe and remote at same time. John responded quickly to my questions. I dream of finding such a perfect little cabin on this Airbnb app. Found it! Would visit again!
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,John let my husband and I book his place very last minute due to a flooding on our dorm floors at school and needing to stay off campus until the issue was resolved. He allowed us a later check out time. Very nice and peaceful place to stay when wanting to get away from the business of the world. We will definitely be returning in the near future!
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"John & Ginny‚Äôs Peoria Hills Cabin is beautiful inside and out, pristine with welcoming decor, and amenities are easily accessible. The washer and dryer are appropriate for the environment and, really, who knows what the weather will bring?
Check-in was a breeze. The size and open layout was perfect for me as it also would be for a small family. The cabin is located back in the countryside so paved and unpaved roads have lumps and bumps; drive cautiously and you‚Äôll have no trouble plus why would you want to speed through the serenity?
John‚Äôs communication and kindness began immediately after the reservation was confirmed with the welcome and when to expect additional instructions, as well as the reminder that he‚Äôs available if needed. In fact, John and Ginny live just far enough away to drive there quickly, yet, the cabin is still on a private, isolated space. I already look forward to another rare day‚Ä¶or more‚Ä¶of personal space. Thank you, both!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with a pet,The cabin was awesome!! john always responded quickly & was always very nice. I have a dog and he loved the space as well. I will absolutely love to stay again next time I'm in the area.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"What a weekend! John and Ginny are truly wonderful people and we had an incredible time. Late Friday night, we locked ourselves out and they came to our rescue within minutes. Saturday, we had car problems and they offered us food and tools. Besides their remarkable hospitality, the cabin was beautiful, extremely clean, and in a great location. Also offered were free water bottles, coffee, and toiletries. It‚Äôs a lovely place to disconnect from your busy life and enjoy the sights and sounds of NE Oklahoma. We would love to come back someday!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"Peoria Hills was a cozy and welcoming space that had my husband and I feeling right at home! John was a very responsive host and quickly answered any questions we had throughout our stay. Would recommend it to anyone looking for a secluded, weekend getaway!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with a pet,The hosts were absolutely amazing! The peace and quiet was absolutely priceless. The whole time i spent there was worth every penny. The hosts were very kind and checked in with me to ask if i needed anything. 110% worth the it! Very beautiful property.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"Perfect, cozy cabin for a private and peaceful evening. I loved how the cabin is surrounded by trees. Exactly what I needed! Thank you üòä"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,Great place to stay
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This stay was so wonderful, beautiful, peaceful and sweet! the cabin is adorable and very clean , the hospitality was the best we have ever had! thank you all so much. this was just the little get away we needed! if we are ever in the area again , this is definitely were we'll stay. They are great Host!!!!!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with a pet,This was just what we needed. Extremely peaceful and secluded which enabled us to totally relax during our stay. When we first drove up we were greeted by a couple of deer. I just can‚Äôt express how relaxing and peaceful the place was. Just a one room cabin but our two midsize dogs and my husband and I had plenty of room and we had absolutely everything we needed. We will absolutely be going back.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"I‚Äôve been on the road since August 11 traveling from Lawton Oklahoma and doing the four corners of Missouri, now we are getting ready to move out east. And I love the cabin and quiet environment. This place is great! I wish I stayed more than one night."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"Very relaxing, peaceful and very clean cabin to stay in eastern Oklahoma. Well worth the price and more. Love the fire pit and the nature setting. John is a gracious host."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,It was great. The only issue we had was that the ac leaked a bit on my suitcase but there was a washer and dryer there so it wasnt really a big deal. Oh and if you go for a walk in the woods. Make sure to use bug repellent.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,We had a nice stay!
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Wow this place has got to be one of my favorite Airbnbs! I arrived during a very severe storm and the log cabin was so solid and well built I felt totally safe! Lots of walking paths, pet friendly and so many amenities in the cabin. Most of all extremely private and peaceful. Even after all the rain and storms it was easy to walk anywhere around the property. Will definitely stay here again. The hosts, John and his wife were on top of everything- very responsive!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Super cute cabin, nicely located in a secluded area.
John was easy to communicate with and responded quickly to my messages."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,Great little cabin in the countryside.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,This is really awesome place to stay.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"John was a great host, excellent communication. Any questions were answered promptly and the accommodations were great! I felt right at home. The listing does show a gravel access road, so just be aware of that, but had no issue getting up the short incline and any vehicle with a bit of clearance shouldn't have any issues driving the 1/4 mile drive back into the woods. Full kitchen, TV, A/C and even USB wall jacks all over. I didn't use the fire pit outside as summer temps are currently over 100, but it looks like it would be a nice fireside area next to the cabin in cooler months. Highly recommended as a little rural getaway."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"I've got to say, I adored this little cabin out in the woods. It's definitely rural- you cannot see or hear anyone or anything other than insects and wildlife- and could possibly leave some people almost feeing eerie, but I greatly enjoyed the peace, quiet, and privacy. These folks thought of all of the important things, including the comforts you'd want from being at your own home, plus extra (snacks, different types of sweeteners for coffee/tea, mini bottles of water in the fridge, etc). I watched Netflix with flawless reception, cooked my supper without missing anything I needed to do so, and was able to easily stay in contact with loved ones because of the wifi AND a good cell signal. My only suggestion to make this little slice of Heaven even better is to add curtains that aren't semi-sheer over all of the windows and doors; you don't want to feel like anyone could be peeping in at night out in the boonies. Ha! I highly recommend this space and I hope to return in the future."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,The cabin was very peaceful and clean. I enjoyed my stay here and would stay again.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,Very nice and peaceful place!!! Will definitely go back if need be!

2023-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"John went out of his way to be helpful, even rescuing us when we inadvertently locked ourselves out! Very private and quiet--the loudest thing we heard at night were the night birds. everything was clean and worked well."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,This cabin and the surrounding area is beautiful and peaceful. If you like nature this is a good place to stream your legs!
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This little secluded cabin, was a great stay for our little family. We enjoyed playing board games, watching the deers, birds and butterflies. We cooked all of our meals and stayed glamping at this beautiful location. What a great start to our summer. Thank you both for hosting us and being such nice people, hope to come back in the near future."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"I loved how remote and private this cabin was, but regret it was only 1 night. Coffee and a walk around the pond is a great way to start the day here...
A more than fair rate, I hope to return again for a longer stay sometime!
P.S. - Hosts are super-sweet!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Our second time staying here and loved it just as much as the first! John and Ginny are so friendly and helpful and very quick to respond. Love having such a peaceful place to relax at while visiting family in the area.

2023-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,We loved staying at John's place! The interior of the cabin was a 'perfect' size and so comfortable to hang out in every morning and evening. The included washer and dryer was definitely a bonus! Each evening we sat in the rocking chairs on the porch and enjoyed our wine while listening to all of the bird song surrounding us. So peaceful here!! I've stayed at dozens of airbnb's and John's place is now one of my favorites! :-)
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"The cabin was beautiful and peaceful. John was responsive, friendly, and kind. When I locked myself out, I was able to speak with John and Ginny came over immediately to get me back in.
I would definitely stay here again!"

2023-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"The place is very cozy. Everything was very clean and well taken care of. The land is very peaceful and was very quiet. Just what I needed after a long day of driving.

2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We loved our stay! The cabin was relaxing and cozy with the perfect location. Some trails to walk, a nice pond to enjoy, and civilization not far.

2022-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Have never had such a great stay anywhere else! We absolutely LOVED it here. It was so clean and smelled so nice.

2024-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Upon arrival we were greeted with a sweet welcome card, snacks in the kitchen and sunroom, full coffee n tea options, and wine :) There were books and games, a thorough and helpful house manual, and guest book. All the lights and appliances were in working order and the thick padded carpet was appreciated for our active little ones. Seating and beds were comfy, and had 2 convenient and stocked baths with fluffy towels and individual sized shampoo, soap, conditioner, and makeup remover. The home was tastefully decorated in a country/ cowboy theme throughout, which made it fun! Extra blankets and pillows were in the hall closet, with cleaning supplies for any mishaps, for checkout (minimal tasks), and laundry supplies were also provided. There were 2 tvs with a dvd collection, grill, and a fire pit with firestarting supplies and lawn chairs. We enjoyed the large yard, surrounding peaceful pasture and meeting our gracious hosts."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Our stay at the bunkhouse was very comfortable. Very nice views of farmland and various animals. Quiet and peaceful location. The home itself is very well stocked with everything you need. We are so glad to have found something so close to family and will be returning. Thanks Sandra
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Sandra was such a great host and her personality comes through with all the details she has through out the house. There were cute accents everywhere, the decor was peaceful and that matched the scenery. The backyard was perfect to sit out at night and the scenery was extremely relaxing. Inside we instantly felt comfortable. If the beds were able to be purchased‚Ä¶we would! We loved everything about our stay! We even were able to visit Sandra‚Äôs horses and donkeys (which were adorable!). I would stay here 100 times over and highly recommend it!!"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed with a pet,We had the best time at the bunkhouse! It was VERY clean.

We felt right at home. We came here to see the train museum and will definitely be back!
2023-12-01,5,Group trip,"The host is fantastic and very accessible. We had one small issue and they were available to fix quickly. It's very clean and has a wonderful backyard. Very quiet. I didn't like the plug in air fresheners as they bother my breathing but that is a personal preference. I also thought there was supposed to be another bed, but that might have been my mistake. Overall this is a very nice place with great service. Thank you very much."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,Me and my family felt right at home at this place. We enjoyed the stay and will definitely stay again.
2023-12-01,5,Stayed about a week,"We stayed here to hunt and it was the perfect home away from home. Sandra and Derek were hospitable and made sure we had everything we needed for our stay. We had multiple hunters and the beds and couch were all very comfortable. The house was well-stocked with everything we needed (towels, linens, coffee, cookware, etc.) We will stay here again."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed one night,Beautiful stay!
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The bunkhouse was by far the best place we have ever stayed. It felt like home from the moment we opened the door. It‚Äôs close to town but still the perfect country setting. Derek and Sandra were some of the nicest people I‚Äôve ever met and went above and beyond to make us happy. Can‚Äôt wait to get back and stay again.
2023-11-01,5,Stayed about a week,"We had an amazing stay at the Bunkhouse! We have been coning to this area of KS for 10 plus years always staying with friends or at the local motel. It was nice to finally have a place like this to stay at so we were NOT at the local motel (which is not a very good place to stay... lol...) and not having to interrupt the normal routine of friends especially since they have young children now. Sandra and Derek were very friendly, responsive to any questions we had while making sure everything was perfect for us!! Absolutely loved everything about the Bunkhouse. We have made some new friends with Sandra and Derek. We plan on staying at the Bunkhouse for many years to come!!!

2024-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"John‚Äôs little cabin is awesome. I did not have to worry about greeting people or making small talk after driving for 11 hours. It was really nice to be able to walk around and stretch my legs too. The location is very peaceful. Apple Maps might take you the wrong way, so make sure to drive a little further down the road to the driveway John describes :)"
