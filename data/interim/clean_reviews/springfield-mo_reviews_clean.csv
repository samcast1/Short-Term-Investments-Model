2024-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This was our second stay. The house is exactly as pictured/described. It is perfect for us as an overnight with 2 dogs during travel, but would be equally good for someone staying longer in Springfield. Thank you Libby for making the house so welcoming after a long day in the car."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,Great place to stay! Definitely recommend!
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,The Dryer house was the absolute perfect place! Cannot say enough about the house and Libby was a pleasure to deal with! Highly recommend!
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Libby's place was just as beautiful as the photos! Our group was only in Springfield for one night, however, I wish we had more time there specifically to enjoy the great backyard space. Beautifully lit with string lights, plenty of seating, and a fireplace. Would definitely recommend this place for your stay in Springfield!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,One of the best places we have stayed! Peaceful and very modern and many thoughtful updates. Our family of four was able to visit on quaint front porch and beautiful backyard and loved the interior too. We didn’t bring our dogs this visit but would be perfect place for them to enjoy on our next visit. Thanks Libby!
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,Libby’s place is one of our new favorites. It’s a delightful and cozy retreat in a walkable and beautiful neighborhood. It’s spotlessly clean and supplied with everything you could possibly need for a comfortable and memorable stay. 5 stars seems somehow inadequate. We’ll for sure be back.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,We had a relaxing stay and felt right at home the moment we arrived! Hope to visit again when we traveling in the area.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Great place! Very clean and pet friendly. Enjoyed our stay and will book again on next visit to Springfield.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Can’t tell you how much we loved Libby’s place! The house was beautiful inside & out. So welcoming & our dog loved it. Libby was very responsive & such a sweet lady. We will definitely be back!
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Stayed for a quick overnight trip. House is very nicely done and feels very open and clean. Nice amenities and the host even had little puppy toys for the new puppy we had with us. The location seemed to be relatively close to things to do and was easy to get to. Would stay again!
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My third time staying at this property and I absolutely love it.
The host definitely puts in a lot of effort to provide anything you may need. Extensive coffee selection, and well equipped kitchen. The house is lovely and very comfortable.
Close to restaurants and shopping is definitely a bonus."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Libby is an exceptional host. Her place was immaculate and felt so welcoming with lights on and fire going when we arrived after dark. She had even left out treats and a cat toy and basket for our traveling companion! The place was spotless and so well-equipped with additional amenities too. Our daughter was particularly excited to learn that there was a unicorn chair in the closet just for her. Libby was accommodating with our check out time and communicated well prior to and during our stay. It was nice to sit out in the sunny garden on departure morning. We wouldn’t hesitate to recommend and wished we could have stayed an extra night - it was the most comfortable bed on our week long road trip relocating across the country!
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This is a great house for a relaxing time. We went down to visit our son at school. The backyard was so accommodating and we spent a great day visiting with him and his friends and their families. Great open concept made it easy to visit inside too. Beautifully decorated and lots of attention to detail.
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,This house is fantastic!! Always my 1st choice when I’m in the Springfield area!
2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"A beautiful home where humans and dogs felt at home. We were greeted with the TV on, calm music, and treats/toys for the dogs and humans. The place was extremely well designed and clean. Wish we could have stayed longer and enjoyed more it. Would highly recommend this to anybody in the area or just passing through. Check out was super easy/painless. Hope we can stay here again"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We felt right at home the minute we walked inside. Libby goes the extra mile to make everyone feel appreciated and welcomed. Beautiful space and decor, comfortable beds and plenty of spots to stretch out and relax. The Dryer House has everything you need to set you up for a great stay. She made sure our pup would be comfy too, beyond anything I’ve ever experienced in an Airbnb. Highly recommend - you won’t be disappointed."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This was our second stay at Libby’s and we will return any time we spend time in Springfield! Her place is gorgeous with LOTS of extras and she was very accommodating allowing us an hour later check out since we couldn’t get to our next location until after 12. Thank you for everything Libby!
2024-02-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Very nice and dog friendly home! Had a perfect stay :)
2024-02-01,5,Stayed one night,Comfortable and clean home that was beautifully decorated. We spent a lot of time geeking out about wall coverings and artwork when we first arrived! The outdoor spaces were so charming and comfortable for our family too. We really enjoyed our stay!

2024-02-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We were completely blown away by Libby’s airbnb. Hands down the most thoughtfully decorated inside and out… both the front and back porches were perfect for hanging out. She included a nice welcome package for us upon arrival and even had a small one for our pup, Daisy. Truly could not recommend a place more! Thanks again Libby, can’t wait to stay again!"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was the perfect Valentine’s Day getaway for me, my husband, and my service dog. It was so special to feel like my dog was welcomed with open arms and treated like family. The beds were comfortable, the place was clean and smelled lovely. It had everything we needed and more. We will definitely stay again."
2024-01-01,5,Stayed about a week,"When we arrived the fireplace was burning, lights were on, the TV playing on mute, Alexa music playing. It was so inviting. Bathrooms and kitchen so clean and nice amenities. Fully stocked kitchen. Coffee on hand so it’s there the first morning g while you figure out groceries you might need. ☺️Bedrooms comfortable. The couch great for TV watching. The front and back porches are divine. The weather didn’t cooperate for porch sitting. I might have to come back just for that ☺️."
2024-01-01,5,Stayed with a pet,This has quickly become a “Springfield Fave”! Central and easy location when we are visiting our daughter at Drury. Beautifully decorated and incredibly comfortable. Thank you for sharing your home with us Libby!
2024-01-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Such a cozy and homey place! My husband and I stayed during the coldest weekend and it was so nice having the electric fireplace in the living room and a good heating system in the house. It stayed toasty warm inside and there were plenty of blankets - we felt right at home.
The location is great! We were never more than 15 minutes from all the restaurants and shops we wanted to go to. Loved that downtown and C Street were 5 minutes away.
Libby is an excellent hostess with attention to detail and lovely decor/style throughout the home. We had everything we needed for our weekend getaway. A few spots were a little dusty (under bed & coffee maker) and could use a wipe down, but overall the home was clean.
Loved the thoughtful touches for our dog! She loved the pet bed and toys. She also loved the big fenced in backyard.
We enjoyed our stay and would absolutely book again!"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Was an awesome stay on a road trip from Indy to Texas. We felt at home and so did our puppy! Everything was so clean and inviting and our stay made the road trip a great experience. Will for sure be staying again anytime we pass through. Thanks Libby for such an awesome experience!
2024-01-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Libby’s house is absolutely beautiful. Everything was set up beautifully when we walked in…fireplace on, dog toys and bed set up, goodie basket, the heat was set to “warm and toasty”. Beds are very comfy and each bedroom is cozy. Kitchen and laundry room are great. The fenced backyard with fire pit and cozy seating is lovely. This home is absolute heaven."
2024-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"We went for a much-needed getaway, and Libby‘s place was perfect. We felt like we were home, She had thought of everything we might need. Her house is amazing and beautiful and very clean. We loved it so much. Hope to visit again in nice weather so we can enjoy the beautiful backyard patio and fire pit. We did get to enjoy the small table top fire pit on the back porch. It was a wonderful stay in every way!"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We loved Libby's beautiful home! We would have extended our trip if we could have. There is so much attention to detail, and we were super comfortable. I always appreciate dog-friendly environs, but this was above and beyond! Highly recommend."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"If we could give Libby more stars, we would!
It's like if your best friend (who's a fabulous decorator) said you could use their home. There were so many details - from many appliances, coffees, snacks, candies, adorable little emery boards to just name a few - that made it so special.
And it was so comfortable, easy to use, and livable, Libby's home makes you want to stay longer.
Thanks! it was delightful!"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"The Dryer House ranked as one of the most beautiful and thoughtfully designed AirBnBs we have stayed at! We wished we could have stayed a few more days to fully enjoy the lovely amenities. Libby thought of everything - it was a first class experience. The fact that we could bring our dog and still get such a nice place was awesome. Every room (including the laundry room), the fenced-in backyard, and front porch were remarkable. Don't second guess booking this place!"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Beautiful clean home with beautiful seasonal decor and extreme attention to detail. Ultra convenient location for restaurants and shopping. Helpful, friendly host. Absolutely wonderful experience. Thank you so much for going the extra mile for your guests. Highly recommend."

Beautiful, clean and very well stocked. We came with our pups and it was more than perfect for them. Little details made our trip easy. Will definitely stay here again!"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Our stay at Libby’s place was just what we needed.
We stayed at her home on our road trip from Texas to Illinois. The home was cozy and full of everything you would ever need.
Our favorite parts were the private back yard for our dogs to run around in and the cozy atmosphere.
We would highly recommend this place to anyone looking to stay in and around Springfield,MO."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"The amenities were great, everything from lip balm , dog toys and a basket of snacks. Beautifully decorated. The back yard was fenced for our dogs with a beautiful fire pit and seating area. One of the best we have stayed at!"

2023-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"One of the best airbnbs I’ve stayed in! It is updated, clean, extremely comfortable (we walked in to the fireplace on, Christmas tree lit up, and music playing. It was so cozy in every room. A great updated home. There were lights throughout the front and back porches. I wish we were there longer to enjoy the fire pit and grill. My dog appreciated the toys and treats. What a great host! Highly recommended."

2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I have stayed at SO many Airbnb’s Libby’s by far is the nicest!! Clean, cozy and SO comfortable. It is like a paradise! We preferred to stay in more than going out because it was like a vacation home. She had anything and everything you can think of for the house! The cherry on top is it is very dog friendly which is so hard to find! Libby also had great recommendations on places to eat loved the extra touches of gifts for the pups and welcoming music when we walked in along with making sure the lights were on for us. It is truly nicest gestures! Libby also had snacks and tons of coffee/tea options. This is 100% worth the stay and we plan to stay every year we can!! Thanks Libby for sharing your little slice of paradise with us and the pups!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Libby simply outdoes herself every time we stay!!! Our favorite place to stay when we are visiting our MSU Bear!!!
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Wow, wow, wow! The amount of detail was astounding. First we were able to do an early checkin, then when we arrived she had music playing and all the lights on. She also not only had a great welcome basket for us but also a basket for my pups! Yard was stunning, bed linens were comfy and very homey. It is a gorgeous home so much so that we changed our plans to dine in just to relax and enjoy our one night there. Great price as well and I would come back to Springfield just to stay here. 🥰"

2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"This was a wonderful stay. The transformation that the house underwent is incredible and I love that they had pictures of what it was like before! Libby was absolutely the most pleasant type of host. There if you need her, but give you space! We celebrated our small wedding at the house and the kitchen, indoor/outdoor seating, and landscaping made it such a smooth and comfortable experience. We only wish we had more time to enjoy the place instead of having to go back to work!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Libby’s was beautiful and the beds were so comfortable, loved the backyard to sit under her lights at night . We will definitely be back and would recommend!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"Loved Libby’s house for our one night stay en route from Michigan to Texas. While we were only there for 12 hours, it was the perfect homey environment for two adults and two dogs. The house is exactly as depicted with a beautiful front and back yard. The home is set up with every amenity imagined. Need a snack? Has you covered? Thirsty? Covered. Want to unwind outside? Covered. I could go on. I’d consider this location for a longer stay and we look forward to visiting again on our next road trip"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This was the most comfortable home I’ve rented. Libby has such a nicely renovated home. We were prepping for our daughter’s wedding and she even loaned us her carpenter to help!!! The kitchen had everything we needed as well. I will be coming back!!
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Libby’s place was amazing! Such a charming cottage with all the amenities and more. I can’t say enough about the amazing front porch and backyard. Beautifully done with plenty of comfortable seating. The flowers everywhere were just gorgeous and made it feel so homey. Libby went above and beyond making our fur babies feel at home. I have stayed at lots of AirBnBs and this one definitely makes the top 5!
Libby was extremely responsive and was flexible with our check-in time which we soooo appreciated since we needed to get our dogs situated before we had to attend a wedding.
Great location, near plenty of restaurants. I would definitely recommend and I am saving the listing to my favorites in case we’re back in the area."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"If anyone is looking for a quick get away and bringing the pups along, this is the place! Great back yard that is fenced in. Peaceful surroundings and the work they have done to the house is amazing. We were thrilled with our stay."

2023-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Libby was a great host! This was our first time in Springfield and we loved our stay at the Dryer House! I told Libby this house is my house goals. The back porch was my favorite part it was so relaxing to sit and read my book. We walked our dog down the street to get some great pizza and tacos and checked out a dog friendly brewery we liked called Tie and Timber. Libby made some great suggestions of places for us to take our pup! Thanks for the great stay!
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We stayed here during my daughter's college move-in weekend. 5 out of 5 stars isn't even accurate. It is a million stars out of 5. Libby is the best and made us feel 100 percent welcome, including our dog, Murphy, who loved the treats and toys that she left for him. The house is gorgeous, has great energy, the beds and linens are amazing, the back yard and front porch/yard are perfect, all modern appliances and electronics, the house had everything that you need.

2023-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Libby's place was one of the nicest Airbnb places we stayed it. Lights, fans and music were on when we arrived which was very welcoming. The pup was greeted with a nice bed and treats. Beautifully remodeled home with quality furnishings. The porch and backyard were private and great for relaxing. We only had 12 hours in the house as we drove across the country and we loved every minute of it. I would highly recommend this stay! Great host with style!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We had a wonderful stay at the Dryer House. The house has a great welcome basket with snacks, ample cleaning supplies, and very pet friendly - with snacks, toys and a pool for the dogs. Also, the fire pit was great for S’mores.
The neighborhood is very walkable and has a neat historic feel. The house is very close to shopping and dining. We would definitely come back for another stay.
Also, when in Springfield check out the Wonders of Wildlife Aquarium and Museum. It is pretty amazing!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"My husband and I have stayed at quite a few Airbnb properties around the country, but we both agreed The Dryer House is our favorite ever!

2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,The thoughtfulness and attention to detail that Libby puts into her home blew us away. She has thought of everything you could possibly want and made sure you have it.

2023-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This lovely well-appointed home with every imaginable amenity including a nicely landscaped backyard with patio and grill, is located in a beautiful historic front porch neighborhood where we enjoyed walking our two standard poodles. Libby is next door readily available to answer questions and make recommendations but never intrusive. All the above made our 7-day stay at the Dryer House the best Airbnb experiment my husband and I have ever had. Libby even had the kiddie pool in the backyard filled with cool water for our poodles on arrival!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"I cannot say enough about this beautiful location.
You are greeted by a stunning porch with beautiful ferns and sitting spots where design and comfort come together spectacularly. It feels as though the house is giving a hug as you walk in the front door. Every single detail was well thought out and considered.
The beds are amazing! The bathrooms gorgeous. The photos really don’t do it justice. The location is perfect in a neighborhood of old houses and front porches. Tons to do right near by and easy off the highway. The owner is delightful and so accommodating. It is what Airbnb was intended to be. We added an unexpected extra night when our plans changed last minute and it was so easy. If you are in the area do yourself a favor and book at least two nights here because when you wake up from the first night you won’t want to leave!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Such a beautiful home! Libby was wonderful, making sure we felt right at home. The accommodations for our fur babies was wonderful! Beautiful fenced in backyard so they could run and play. I give this place a 10/10!"

2023-05-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Libby provides a beautiful home that feels cozy, and comfortable to guests and their dogs. The home has a great set up with beautiful furniture and decor. My dogs felt right at home with the dog bed and toys for them to play with. They also loved running around the stunning backyard. I couldn’t get enough of the the backyard and how cozy it was. We asked for recommendations on dinner and Libby was friendly enough to assist. She also had some magazines on the table with local dining and activity options. If we find ourselves back in the area again we’ll definitely be looking up this place! Thanks for giving us a lovely little getaway."

2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Very Cute and peaceful! Libby was very helpful and kind, even letting me send a package to the house before we checked in. House was very clean, and well decorated. There was even a basket of snacks waiting for us when we walked in. Would definitely stay here again for our next trip to Springfield."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"I can honestly say that Libby’s home was the first Airbnb that we didn’t want to leave. Her whole place, inside and out, was far superior to anything we’ve ever stayed in. She was so thoughtful that she had beds and treats for our four legged family. Staying at her home felt like our own little sanctuary, a special experience that we’ll remember. There is no doubt that we will be back again. Thank you Libby for a wonderful stay and experience."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"This was hands down one of the BEST stays I’ve had at an Airbnb. I’m sad we couldn’t have stayed longer. Dryer House was absolutely stunning. I felt like it was a home straight out of HGTV. So much was put into this beautiful home. This is an Airbnb done right. I can’t say enough great things, but I loved this home. Thank you for sharing it with us! Truly 5 stars."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Libby was an amazing host.

2023-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This was the second day of a grueling cross country trip. When we arrived at Libby's home, we were greeted by a welcoming space.
Our labradoodle was welcomed with a dog bed, treats and toys...he was so happy. The fenced in yard was terrific.
The whole place gives off a vibe of welcome and relaxation.
Beautiful and thoughtful renovation of this home makes it a place wonderful to stay."

2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The Dryer House is absolutely amazing!! The pictures truly don’t give this house justice! It’s more beautiful in person! The moment we opened the door, we were not disappointed! Libby goes to great lengths to make sure you are welcome. The house is beautifully decorated and so comfortable! It’s true, the beds are very comfortable! The house was very clean! The deck and backyard are amazing as well! Unfortunately, the weather didn’t cooperate with us during our stay for us to enjoy it! My family absolutely loved this place! We would definitely return to the Dryer House!"

Libby is very kind and helpful. The house is VERY well stocked with everything you’d need plus a lot of unexpected nice to have features. I can’t recommend this place enough, it blew me away!"

2023-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Just WOW!!! So hoped the house matched the pictures, but it was so much nicer!!! Libby has done amazing things at her place, and could not have felt more at home! Make sure you sneak over next door to play with her Frenchies!!! What a great place! Our kid is a student at MSU and this is our new place to stay when we come to Springfield!"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We have stayed in a lot of Airbnbs this one really stands out. Libby has beautifully and lovingly remodeled this house and then filled it with quality furnishings and thoughtful details that create a special experience. Next time we pass through Springfield, we know where we'll be staying!"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Can’t say enough about how much we enjoyed our stay! So many wonderful touches…beautifully decorated, yummy snacks (for people and pups!), incredible outdoor space, lots of cool local restaurants and shops within walking distance, and (most importantly) the most comfortable bed we’ve ever slept in! Libby was just wonderful and very communicative. We’d love to stay here again if she’ll have us!"

2023-02-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Libby was an awesome host and a pleasure to work with.
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The Dryer House was the nicest Airbnb we have visited. Libby was extremely thoughtful about amenities, decor, snacks, beverages and so much more. The design was beautiful. The rehab was very well done. Libby was extremely attentive when needed but also respected our privacy. The house rules and check in/check out process was clearly defined and easy to follow. When we arrived, the property was very well lit, and warmly invited us into the space. We spent about a half an hour just walking around, looking at the beautiful finishings she even thought to consider pets. Libby’s process showed attention to detail from listing through check out. We highly recommend staying here. We will be back!"
2023-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"Amazing!! Libby’s house is gorgeous, and she is so friendly! Really enjoyed our time out back on the beautiful porch. We would stay here again!"

2023-01-01,5,Stayed with a pet,We loved staying at this airbnb. It was so nice and cozy. The host was responsive and helpful. There were so many thoughtful touches throughout the airbnb. The pictures honestly do not do this house justice. It's a beautiful place to stay. We would LOVE to stay again
2023-01-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Our stay at Libby’s place was just what we needed on our cross country trek, it was a wonderful break from hotel stays. From the moment we walked in the front door, we were immediately impressed by the thoughtful offerings from the host. Dog treats and a toy just for Charlie were placed on the comfy dog bed. An overflowing basket of human treats on the counter and relaxing music playing on the speaker all created such a nice first impression. The house has been tastefully remodeled from the ground up, inside and out. If you’re looking for a place to stay in Springfield, look no further."
2023-01-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Outstanding experience. Over the top...really. We will most certainly book her home again. I only wish more owners were half as considerate and attentive as Libby and her home was absolutely perfect.

2023-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"I was blown away with the accommodations and service! Libby was not only a gracious host, but thought about every detail in this gorgeous Airbnb! I have booked many Airbnb’s and I am a host myself and this really knocked my socks off! My favorite part of this stay was just looking at all off the details of the home remodel that she did. The transformation is quite impressive! I love that she has before pictures displayed so you can see the detail that went into this remodel! From the driveway to the back yard, you will find that this home is tastefully designed with YOU in mind! This gem is not only an exquisite find, but clean, furnished and staged unlike any other Airbnb that I have found in my stays! The guest basket and banana bread were over the top and very inviting! Libby is an amazing host too! She really put a lot of time and love into this property! I look forward to my next stay!"
2023-01-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Libby’s place is amazing, and she went out of her way to make us feel welcomed! She even had dog toys and a bed for our dog! The house was fully stocked with amenities (fresh baked banna bread) and looked exactly like the photos! We only stayed one night and didn’t get a chance to make use of the patio, but we will be back for sure!!"

Everything you need is at your fingertips… we will always stay at the Dryer house when In Springfield, MO. Absolutely an amazing home…"
2022-12-01,2,Stayed a few nights,"We absolutely loved this house, it was perfect for a weekend getaway. Although the host was quite disrespectful. As we booked this house for a weekend, she was aware of a get together that we had one night with a few people, she then showed up at the door unannounced and raised her voice because she was upset. After trying to resolve the issue she failed to communicate with us. Due to these circumstances we will not be booking with her again nor do we recommend."
2022-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"If we could give a 5+ we would! Libby was responsive and accommodating. The house is beautiful and incredibly well equipped. Couldn’t have asked for anything more. Next time, we’ll stay longer so we can fully enjoy the porch and yard."
2022-12-01,5,Stayed over a week,"The home looks exactly like the pictures and the description. Loved that it is close to Rountree which has restaurants and a brewery. Finally, the home has a great layout and is so warm, inviting and comfortable. Definitely recommend this listing."

2022-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Libby’s home is absolutely perfect… the pictures are beautiful but even they don’t do this home justice.. you will not regret staying in the Dryer house.. Beds A+…. Living room A+… amenities A+… We cannot say enough about how lovely the home and stay were and Libby herself was amazing…. Definitely will make this a constant in my travels…. Should be called the A+ house

They let us know several hours early that the house Was ready, and very accommodating to us And our requests. The house is truly a three bedroom two full bath, a fenced in backyard, nice grill on the patio. This is in a family residential neighborhood and was quiet. We took a walk around on all the many sidewalks after our long drive and felt safe. The house was fully stocked and beautifully decorated. There was a closet full of toys for children. A baby bed. Really they thought of everything. The location was nice and easy to get to most everything in Springfield. We took the kids to Rutledge Farm,(literally right around the corner from the house) which is run by the public park system. Amazing what Missouri does for its citizens. The park was over the top. I recommend going to casey’s convenience store down the street for breakfast pizza. Yum Great place!"

The toys and big backyard were definitely a hit! Tons of extra towels for bathrooms plus the kitchen/living room was amazing with more than enough supplies for cooking.

We had to leave early to drive to St. Louis to catch a flight and when we looked to see what our requirements before leaving was, we read WE DO THE CLEANING. My daughter in law said, ""You will have to write them a 5 star review. We had a wonderful stay and everything was great."

The kitchen had sooo many amenities! The floors and bathrooms were spotless too.

Place was clean and we enjoyed our stay. Back road was was a bit busy behind house and at times seemed a bit noisy and you can hear plans taking off from nearby airport, but most noise was early morning or later, so did not disrupt sleep times. Only thing I would ask more for is a bit more cooking utensils. But would definitely stay here again."
2022-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This was definitely one of the best homes we have stayed at when considering the amount of thought that went into every detail that the hosts took care of to make sure that they provided everything one could ever possibly need while being away from home!
Their home was also one of the cleanest and most kid friendly that we have stayed at, the beds were very comfortable, and the communication from the hosts was fast and friendly.
We can’t say enough good things about this home - and the hosts! We had an incredibly comfortable stay, and we would definitely return if we were ever in the area again. Thanks so much, Michael and Lu!!"
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay!
2022-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Place was clean, staff was very friendly, and close to everything in Springfield area"
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This house is spotless! Check in with keyless entry was a breeze. It was a bonus to be able to park in the garage. House was filled with details, like a Keurig and cups, plenty of dinnerware and silverware, and extra linens. This was a multi-generation girls trip and we had plenty of room with my mom, sister, niece, and me.
The house is located in a neighborhood with a feeling of being rural, yet having access to stores and restaurants within 5 minutes.
Noise level at night inside the house was low. The house backs up to a main road and is at the entrance of the subdivision. We could hear a train horn in the distance throughout the evening, and some airplanes overhead, with the airport about 10 miles away. We did not sit outside or use the yard.
The master bedroom was extremely bright early in the morning. There are blinds, but not curtains. If you like to sleep in past daybreak, you will need a sleep mask.
Communication with the hosts was very prompt and courteous. I would recommend this place!"
2022-05-01,5,Group trip,"Above and beyond the call of hospitality. It felt like home. If you forget something, they have you covered. No complaints here from me or all the house guests. Made sure we were well taken care of! I’ll be back for sure :)"

2022-04-01,3,Stayed a few nights,"The house was fine and comfortable for our stay. The last day we discovered that someone had stolen our coolers from the garage. The door was always down, so not sure if the code was comprised or not. At the end of the day we were out approximately $600. I'm just glad they didn't come in the house. I contacted the owners and they reported it to the police."
2022-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Several things we look for when choosing a location is cleanliness, kid friendly, and fits within our budget. Michael & Lu have a wonderful place in a quiet neighborhood that met all of our needs. The place was well organized and had everything we needed for our family for the weekend. If you are looking for a free activity with the kids you are a minute from the Wilson Farm Park. We had a minor issue with the hot water and Michael & Lu went above and beyond to correct the issue. They are wonderful to communicate and work with. Book their place, you will not be disappointed."
2022-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,Nice house and area! You should visit the nearby farm and Wonders of Wildlife Aquarium at the Bass Pro Shop. The backyard is great for kids and for grilling and games.

2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We stayed in this beautiful home for a week in October. We were so impressed with all of the amenities that were provided! Just about everything you could think of. Michael even provided a bedroom alarm clock before we arrived when I asked if there was one in the house. This home was immaculately clean, well-stocked, in a safe quiet neighborhood, and at a very reasonable cost. They provided eggs, bottled water, coffee, and snacks. The home is very “kid-friendly” as so many items were available for small children. We felt as if the owners lived there and just left for the week and let us stay. It was a perfect location for our trips between Bolivar and Branson. Next time we visit Springfield – this will definitely be our “go-to” place. Thanks so much to Michael and Lu!!"

2024-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Wonderful place that's better than the photos!
The main common area was the big draw for us and it was wonderful. We visited family, had 4 generations from 96 yo to 18 months and everyone thoroughly enjoyed themselves.
With the fireplace in the center of the common area, you have a large open space but just enough of a divider that activities can be in the kitchen and living room areas. It's spacious, well-stocked and the fireplace isn't just for looks - it really heated the place! And it like the rest of Anastasiya's home, it's beautiful.
Wish we'd had more time, we could have had a movie night or even two... esp w massively large TV in main bedroom! Everyone loved the ""Best Seat in the House"" and the ample closet space was a plus. We were in love w the screened-in porch even though it was a bit cool to be out there.
It's a comfortable, beautiful, spacious home. If you want to have time together, this is the place!
Host Anastasiya was helpful and proactive - Thank you!"

Lots of towels were provided. There’s a HEATED toilet seat! The kitchen was stocked with great supplies. There’s no blinds in the home at all. That was the only thing that I disliked.

2022-09-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful, clean and modern home. At first the beds seemed like they would be too soft for our liking, but they were incredibly comfortable and we slept very well.
Don't be startled by the automatic-cleaning toilet in the master bathroom. It will automatically raise the lid when you get near, and runs a cleaning cycle in the middle of the night.
The windows are huge and amazing, making for a light and bright home during the day. But know that there are no window coverings so people can see in at night. Just something to be aware of. :)"
2022-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,🦋Absolutely stunning new home. Had everything from expresso coffee to tooth brushes if you forgot them at home. The sunroom while drinking coffee in the morning provided relaxation and quiet time before our full day. Would recommend this place to anyone

The pictures don’t do this home justice it is truly amazing in person. We loved the option of being able to use the kitchen and laundry room, it was especially helpful with all the kids clothing we had to clean. A beautiful and very thought out floor plan with many items at your disposal. We loved the shampoo, condition, and body soap in the restrooms. One of the best seats in the house was the master bathroom toilet. I definitely want to purchase one of those for our home. The heated seats were magnificent! The best amenity in the home was hands down the espresso machine. I have a similar model at home so I was able to use it with no problem at all. We enjoyed all the extras to make our fancy coffee drinks as well. The caramel drizzle was fantastic! The neighborhood was quiet and friendly. Overall, the stay was nothing short of fantastic. We appreciate greatly the last minute reservation and the clear communication throughout the whole process. We will gladly be returning if we ever come back to Springfield.

There was shampoo, body wash, conditioner, makeup remover cloths, Qtips, lots of extra wash cloths and towels, a bidet, an espresso machine, coffee syrups, and a well quipped kitchen!! It’s in a very safe and quiet neighborhood but it’s close to everything. Also, check in is at 3pm, earlier than most airbnbs, and the check out was at 3pm, way later than any Airbnb I’ve ever seen!! The hosts obviously thought everything through very well to make it as accommodating and comfortable as possible! My fav Airbnb so far!! Can’t recommend it enough!!"

The only issue I had was with the stools inside, by the bar, not being the most comfortable, but there is plenty of seating and a table you can eat at outside. Overall, a fantastic experience."

The beer garden up the road was a special treat as well. I highly recommend staying here. I hope to stay again soon!"

2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Kathleen was an absolutely lovely host! Staying with her was like dropping by an Aunt's house for the weekend whilst in town for other things. She made me feel so welcome, and she was readily available for any conversation or questions. But she also made me feel very free to come and go as needed, at any hour of the day, with no need to ""check-in"" or let them know my schedule throughout the day. I had my own code for the front door which worked perfectly, my own bathroom to use, and the bedroom/bathroom were at the front of the house so I didn't need to worry about walking through the rest of the property and disturbing anyone (nor did anyone disturb the area where I was staying.)
Our son just finished his Freshman year at Missouri State in Springfield, and we'll be making a lot of visits to the city. I hope that we will be able to stay with Kathleen and Bob for many of those visits to come!"

It was the perfect place for me to crash one night on my road-trip, but they were such amazing hosts I wish i coulda stayed multiple days! Thanks again so much for the memorable stay, I hope to be back soon :)!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I thoroughly enjoyed my stay at Kathleen’s place. It was perfect for my needs and they were warm and welcoming hosts. Would love to stay again.

2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The Elephant Room at Kathleen and Bob's was just like the photo, full of memorabilia from travel and living abroad, and very cozy.

Clearly many people choose to stay there time and time again. I probably will, too, on return trips to Springfield."

When I returned that evening, Kathleen asked about my day. It was like coming home to mom or Grandma and one of them asking how my day went. It is obvious how much they care about their customers. They really make you feel right at home. I hope to stay there again on one of my future trips to the area. Thank you for your gracious hospitality!"

We were welcome to come and go as we pleased, and the amenities were just what we needed. We were in town for two nights and just needed a place to crash somewhat close to downtown. If you like to stretch in the morning (as we do), you’ll need to go outside as the room is a tad small for that. Fortunately, they have a lovely patio outside with plenty of chairs and shade cover.

The room was perfectly comfortable, equipped with all we needed and easy to access as was the private bathroom. We didn’t even see our hosts the first day though they were quick to respond once notified we had arrived. I met them in person the next afternoon and they gave me a quick tour of the other space on the property, which was detached and larger. I got to hear and share stories with them and hearing about their travels and why they did it said so much about who they are and makes me want to help support them any way possible! They are so kind and giving! They had towels set out, toiletries, very clean accommodations and I cannot wait until our next visit. Above and beyond gracious hosts!"

Beautiful loft - we loved it!"
2023-05-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Nice place to stay. Big loft with enough room for a few couples. More than enough space for the four people we had. Loft was unique and a fun place to stay. In a nice downtown area with great food. Only caution is the lack of privacy between the bedrooms as the ceiling is open so you can hear everything between the downstairs bedrooms. Plenty of parking behind the loft. We had a truck and trailer and fit just fine. Melinda was responsive and helpful.
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The loft was absolutely perfect for my bridal suite. We got married at the savoy right across the street. The location was perfect and when I checked in I said I wanted to live there! It’s totally my vibe!
2023-05-01,5,Group trip,Great space in a great location! Melinda made the experience as easy as can be! would recommend and stay again

2023-03-01,5,Group trip,It was very comfortable and felt at home!
2023-03-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"My only complaint is having to take out the trash at checkout and walk it around the block, behind the buildings, and back down the alley to the trash cans behind the building. For the cleaning fee I feel that should have been included."
2023-02-01,5,Group trip,"Spacious, accessible and super clean."
2023-02-01,4,Stayed one night,Thank you so much!
2023-02-01,5,Group trip,The loft was well decorated and a very unique space. There is a train track the runs next to building - but we did not hear the noise at all. Would highly recommend this space!

Also- the decor was TOP NOTCH! Absolutely breathtaking!"
2022-12-01,5,Group trip,"This was a great place for a large family—my wife and I and our three daughter and their husbands. Lots of separation and privacy. Also, amazing beds and mattresses! We all had wonderful nights of sleep!"
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,It was great!!! So beautiful & spacious
2022-12-01,5,Group trip,"We had a great stay! Never stayed on that side of Springfield, so such a pleasant surprise to find a “hidden jem” we didn’t know about. The place is so charming and full of character.
Thank you Melinda!"
2022-12-01,5,Group trip,We had 9 girls in this beautiful loft for a girls weekend and it lived up to everything!!! We almost stayed In just tired enjoy the place but thankfully there was so much to do around the place!! It was walkable to several stores and restaurants!! We loved our stay and would definitely stay again!!!

2022-11-01,5,Group trip,"Great place, lots of space and very cool atmosphere. Would recommend if traveling in a large group, and need a place to stay with dinner and breakfast spots within walking distance."
2022-11-01,4,Group trip,"Cute place for our girls’ weekend. Spacious for our group of 7. Beds were very comfortable! Street parking was a bit of a challenge arriving at midday on Saturday - we had to park a block away, but were able to move our cars closer later in the day when shops had closed and things were less busy. The place is super cute, but the wood floors are old and very creaky! We all heard each other getting up to go to the bathroom throughout the night. Also train track right behind the building - I like some white noise so it didn’t bother me much but between that and creaky floors, light sleepers might want to bring ear plugs !"
2022-11-01,5,Group trip,"We loved staying here! Big enough for our group, never felt crowded, and super cozy and cute! Will definitely use again!"
2022-11-01,5,Group trip,"Charming, unique, one-of-kind spot in the coolest part of Springfield. Definitely make sure to eat at Cafe Cusco across the street!
Would love to stay again!"
2022-11-01,4,Group trip,"This venue is very cool! It was great for our bridal party to stay before the wedding!
They found something wrong before we checked in and made sure to have it fixed as soon as possible!
If you have any elderly people in your group or people who struggle with stairs this location may be difficult for them as there are multiple sets of stairs—however this was not the case for us and it helped us reach our step goals for the day 🤪"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful air bnb
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great spot, with cool vibes, and easy access to all 417 has to offer."

2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This was the perfect loft for me and my bridesmaids to get ready in! So spacious and such cool decor. Be mindful that the train-tracks are directly behind the loft and trains run by frequently. I would definitely recommend this place and would stay again!
2022-09-01,5,Group trip,absolutely beautiful place to stay! stayed here the night before my wedding with all my bridesmaids and could not have picked a better place!
2022-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This was a wonderful place for my family to stay during Sister-in-law's wedding! I have 4 children and they loved the Swings! This is right next to the railroad so the cars sometimes sound like thunder but it's less noticeable in the Queen bunk area off the kitchen or the smaller bedroom on the main floor. We also had my Grandparents with us and while there were many stairs (24 stairs to reach the floor of the entrance that leads to the guest & master bedrooms plus another 10, a landing and then 12 to reach the queen bunks, kitchen & living room) it was manageable for them with the sturdy rails! It's a great location and I think your family will love it too!!"
2022-09-01,5,Group trip,"I was so excited to get this space for my bridesmaids to get ready. It was as beautiful as the pictures show and spacious enough for a somewhat larger group to share. Melinda was so helpful and responsive to questions and concerns. We also booked the other loft managed by this company in the same building, which was so convenient having all of us close together. Would highly recommend."
2022-09-01,5,Group trip,We had a great stay at the loft! It was so beautiful and unique. Melinda was a great host to respond quickly and communicate check-in & exit instructions. I’d recommend this location!

2022-08-01,4,Stayed with kids,"Our family loved the unique loft experience on C Street! The history, the large windows, the fun decor, the unique seating options were all very cool. There are a lot of stairs, but it wasn’t unmanageable. Thanks for a great stay!"
2022-08-01,5,Group trip,Great location. Loved the place. Nice modern mix with the rustic feel of the natural brick. Loved the swings at the counter. Will definitely stay again.
2022-07-01,5,Group trip,"This loft was an incredible spot for a low-key boys weekend.
We loved the swings at the kitchen bar, the rustic/vintage vibe, and the master bathroom.
Absolutely perfect find, and I will hopefully be back soon!"
2022-07-01,5,Group trip,Such a cute spot!
2022-07-01,2,Stayed a few nights,There was a problem with the Airbnb that resulted in us not staying for the last night. The host refunded us for two nights but we were not entirely satisfied with the compromise. The Airbnb itself was thoughtfully designed but not well maintained. We would never stay again.
2022-07-01,5,Group trip,Super cute spot!
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great loft in a perfect location to the venue we were going to. Instructions were great for check-in and out.

2022-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,This place is great! Very unique! Open floor plan. You can spend time downstairs where the master bedroom (and another bedroom) is or upstairs where kitchen and bar are located. Big Momma’s coffee shop is right outside the entrance door and is great! We parked out front a couple of nights and in back one night. Was never an issue. Cool little farmers market down the street also. We would definitely stay here again!
2022-06-01,5,Group trip,Great place to stay in Springfield!
2022-06-01,4,Group trip,"A beautiful, artsy, sunny space.
Many stairs, so might not be great for some. Also, the beautiful huge windows allow quite a bit of light in from street lights outside so sleep might be effected for those who need to sleep in the dark."
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,It was a really neat spot with great food around. Would definitely plan another stay when I’m in town.
2022-05-01,5,Group trip,Great location and place
2022-05-01,5,Group trip,"This place blew me away. Melinda was so kind and helpful throughout the process, offering timely responses, answering all questions, and providing detailed instructions for checking in, staying, and checking out. Though the pictures are fabulous, you are not able to fully grasp the beauty that this place has to over until you’re in person. The two story space encompasses a boho, industrial, and luxurious energy. The attention to detail in decor and furnishing is unmatched. I HIGHLY recommend this space."
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great location on Commercial street and very spacious unit.
2022-05-01,3,Group trip,"Place was very unclean which was explained when the host basically requested that we clean the place for her even though we paid the mandatory cleaning fee through air bnb. Washing machine was broken which wasn’t communicated until the day before we arrived. Dishes were very dirty, so much that we washed before using for safety. Good location for an event on commercial street but not as nice as others in the area."
2022-04-01,5,Group trip,"This property is simply stunning! It is so unique, and was perfect for our girls’ weekend. Plenty of space to just hang out and have meals, and super comfortable accommodations for everyone. So much character and great styling. Can’t recommend enough!!"

2022-03-01,5,Group trip,"This was the perfect space for us on this trip! The swings at the kitchen bar are super fun, and the bunk beds upstairs gave our girls their own space. The wood floors are SUPER creaky and loud, but they kind of added character to the place. Would definitely stay here again!"
2022-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,My family and I had a wonderful stay at this historic loft! It’s beautifully decorated and clean! Very relaxing and would definitely recommend and stay again!!

2022-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was my favorite Airbnb I’ve ever been in. The location is questionable but only bc this is unfortunately not a very good area of Springfield. But we felt totally safe when we were inside of the Airbnb! This place has incredible natural light for photography sessions, which is what we used this for this weekend. I loved using this space. It was so different and beautifully decorated. We cannot wait to be back!"
2022-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,Melinda was an excellent host. The loft was stunning and just with the art and the history behind all the pieces that were used throughout the space to make it one of a kind definitely made it stand out above most Airbnb I’ve stayed it. My family and I thoroughly enjoyed our stay!

2021-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We had a flight out of Springfield super early in the morning so we stayed here for the convenience. Let me say it was AWESOME! It was one of the most unique places we have ever stayed at. Lots of classic charm and very comfortable.
I will say if you are not a heavy sleeper the down stairs bedroom by the windows is not the place for you to sleep. The train does run through all night.
Other then thatthe place is wonderful for families."
2021-11-01,5,Group trip,"Melinda , thank you so much for your help and your time and helping me out with all my questions. I really appreciate the amazing customer service."

2021-07-01,5,Group trip,Great stay!
2021-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,The loft we stayed in had a very cool vibe going on. All of the eclectic decor and local artwork were very nice touches. The layout was unique and the host was very responsive. The location can’t really be beat. I love older places so it was really cool to stay there with all the real wood floors and brick walls. The staircase is a sight to behold for sure.
2021-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,Great property in an area of town with great restaurants and is walkable. Trains are loud but that’s part of the charm. Plenty of space to spread out and responsive host.
2021-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Very chic unique stay! We thoroughly enjoyed, very pretty aesthetic , safe neighborhoods around and overall felt very safe for being on a Main Street. Cool vibe all around very trendy. Kids enjoyed bunk beds. Good workout with the stairs but like the description says it’s a loft . 5 stars from us."

I got married across the street, so it was a perfect place for my bridesmaids and I to hang out and get ready. My now-husband and I spent our wedding night here as well and wished we could have stayed longer. As an interior designer myself, the boho and eclectic vibes completely matched my own tastes.
Highly recommend, 10/10."

2021-06-01,3,Stayed with kids,"Very spacey , photos look just like the place, AC works great. I’d say they just need to work on the cleanliness and somethings need to be taken care of."
2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very good location easy to access nearby attractions' friendly neighborhood and very safe and clean and spacious place.
2021-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This was my very first stay at an Air BnB. From the first moment walking in, my family and I were in awe. The loft was very chic boho. It made me want to take pictures so I can copy the designs at home. My favorites were the swings in the bedroom and at the kitchen bar. I would definitely recommend this place, or any place by Melinda. She is very communicative, making sure we were having a good time and that we were well taken care of."

2021-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"A perfect place to ring in the New Year, now two years in a row! We were able to have a change of scenery and spread out throughout the spacious loft.

2020-12-01,5,Group trip,"This was our second stay with this Airbnb and we love it! It’s such a perfect location. We love the little shops all around, having a warm drink and breakfast down the stairs at Big Momma’s and the best pizza at Pizza House! I’ve used it to be close by my daughter’s place at MSU and for family gatherings during holiday and graduation. Plenty of space having living area both downstairs and upstairs. Cute decor with counter swings and a wonderful kitchen area to dine in. I sleep with noise canceling ear pods so I don’t hear the train at night, but both husband and son-in-law comment on train for sleep so maybe pack earplugs. I love it though!!! Melinda is an amazing host with prompt wonderful communication you can count on at any time! You’ll not be disappointed!"
2020-11-01,2,Stayed with kids,Overpriced. We were greeted by roaches and missing lights in the master bathroom. The bathrooms were filthy and filled with the owners personal items. You will have to navigate three flights of stairs and a common door that is impossible to lock. Not a good value for the money.

2020-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What a fun and comfortable space for a respite/get away during these crazy COVID times. The home had everything we needed for a safe ""shelter in place"" getaway."
2020-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I had a great stay at the loft. Pictures do no do this place justice. It is large and has all the amenities you will need. I would recommend to anyone needing a big space.
2020-07-01,5,Group trip,This was our second time staying in the loft. It is beautifully decorated. We had teenagers and adults on this trip. The layout is perfect for all to hang out together and for adults and teens to have their own space. The value is amazing! We will be back!
2020-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,Beautiful place! Such a unique stay and we enjoyed every second. Don’t pass it up!
2020-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Super stylish space! It was right above a cafe that made grabbing breakfast easy. Lots of comfortable beds and the communication/check in process was great. Would definitely stay again when we return to the area.
2020-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very stylish space! The host was very quick with responses and very accommodating! I would stay again!
2020-06-01,5,Group trip,"Such a beautiful loft, with a boho vibe. All of the decor was so cohesive. This was the best place for my bridal party to get ready in the morning of our wedding! The owner is extremely friendly, and was easy to communicate with !!!"
2020-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,Very unique and stylish space. It was clean and well equipped. Very happy with our stay.
2020-06-01,5,Group trip,This place is so cool and unique! We had a girls weekend here and it was so fun. Had a couple questions during our stay and management was always a phone call alway and so kind. The location is great and this place gives the WOW factor for the kiddos and adults. Highly recommend and would love to stay again in the future!
2020-05-01,4,Stayed with kids,Very fun and unique place to stay! We enjoyed our stay and loved the details of the decor.

2020-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This loft is unbelievable... it is the perfect get-away. Lots of space for everyone in your party, fantastic common area for everyone to hang out. The art and design touches make the stay feel really special. C street is our main destination when coming to Springfield, so the location is absolutely perfect. Could not recommend more highly!"
2019-12-01,5,Group trip,"This place is just great. Plenty of space, creatively decorated, lots of character, great location, comfortable, clean... My husband and I, our son, our daughter and her husband stayed here over Christmas week. I was concerned about the proximity to the railroad tracks as I can be a bit sensitive to sound at night, but surprisingly the walls and windows blocked out the sound very well. This place was great for our family. It would also be great for a girls or guys trip. Not sure how well it would be with small kiddos, but I know I would have been able to make it work. I hope we get the opportunity to stay here again!"
2019-12-01,5,Group trip,My bridal party stayed here the weekend of my wedding. It is a great place for the girls to get ready in and take a lot of fun photos. It is very spacious and comfortable. The location is great and offers lots of local spots in walking distance.
2019-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Fun place to stay in a historic building. Everything has been redone and is one of the most unique place I've stayed in an Airbnb. Was not an issue for me but the master is quite bright in the morning but luckily the couple in there always bring eye masks when traveling so it wasn't a big deal - plus the room is lovely. We were a bit worried because the train track was so close but this wasn't an issue at all. Rooms are a bit lacking in privacy, but again it's an older building so that's part of its uniqueness. Fun bars within walking distance and we had a late breakfast and coffee at Big Momma's next door a couple of times - really good and fantastic service. Other restaurants are down the street but we didn't have time to try them out. If you enjoy eclectic places then you need to stay here when visiting Springfield."
2019-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,"My family and I loved this apartment! It was in a great location, it was super clean and we were able to easily access the amenities of the city. Parking was no problem. If you are looking for an upscale retreat that is far better than any hotel in the area, this is it! A few of our local family members were so impressed with the place that they took pictures while dropping off groceries. Overall, we loved this place!"
2019-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My bridesmaids, mother, mother-in-law and I all stayed here the night before my wedding and it was absolutely perfect. The space was beautiful and allowed us so much room to get ready for my big day."
2019-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We grew up in Springfield, and return to visit family every year. Commercial Street is a new and fun way for us to experience our home town. This loft is the perfect place to host groups! Its very spacious, very comfortable, appointed nicely and also allows some private spaces within it. Not to mention the beds and pillows are really really comfy! Great place to have friends and family congregate. You and your family will enjoy the swings as much as we did! The location can't be beat. C street is the happening place to be in Springfield as there are wonderful restaurants and fun shops right out the front door! It is a short drive to a multitude of things to do, as well as a quick drive from the Airport. Another unexpected bonus, the trains directly out back. Very interesting to watch this activity as well and they also lulled us to sleep every night. We will stay here again!"
2019-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,It was a great loft. Going up the stairs was a little challenging
2019-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We loved using this as our base on vacation.
Plenty of restaurants within walking distance...with many more within 2 miles.
Not far from Bransons shows.
The apartment was very spacious and very clean.
Loved it. Will be back"
2019-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place is beautiful and perfect for a wedding party to get ready at, especially if you’re getting married at the Savoy. There is so much space; men can get ready on one floor and women on the other. I recommend it!!"
2019-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Directions were easy to follow, but be prepared to climb some stairs! The property is amazing and so comfortable! Loved everything about this place! Would recommend for any girls trip any day!"

2024-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Just as described! Very unique little place with lots of charm close to some great restaurants.
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great little find on our road trip.
The house has real character.
It is small but as advertised but for one night and for a driving Pit Stop it was perfect.
The bed was comfy and sheets and towels soft, although we only had one set of towels.
Plenty of coffee, creamer etc as well as bathroom products.
Parking was directly outside the house and very safe.
The Neighbourhood was very quiet and we slept well.
its about a 10-15 mins to some great restaurants and bars.
We ate in Black Sheep and was fabulous if you like burgers and shakes!
(Hands down best I've ever had)
While it's unlikely we'll return as were from England and this road trip is a one off, if I was in the area I'd stay here again and recommend staying here also."

2024-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Very cool idea, turning a historic gas station into a tiny house. If you’re looking for a place to stay overnight without having to encounter other people and pets, this is a great option!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"very cute and pleasant accommodation. The city center can be reached in a maximum of 10 minutes on foot. The accommodation has everything for cooking as well as coffee (very nice in the morning). The vehicle can be parked just outside the front door. In short, we loved it!"

2024-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Overall, my stay was a last minute decision as I was traveling from the Arizona to Tennessee for school. He quickly responded to my reservation and any messages that I had sent. Upon arriving, super flexible check-in and allowed me privacy. The place was tiny, creatively decorated and still held some historical architecture on the inside. I loved the place and found it to be very cozy. I had my dog with me and the yard was tiny so it would be a little more crowded with a big puppy. I would still recommend for anyone visiting as a couple or just 2 occupants, any more would be very crowded. Great access to other areas of Springfield and worth the money I spent."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Nick has a lovely space and incredible location. Workable and nice driveway!
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,This is little converted gas station is so adorable! It’s a quaint spot with everything my dog and I needed for a restful pit stop from Chicago to Austin!

2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"A wonderful place to stay!! It's a time capsule that is well modernized and I truly appreciated it and enjoyed this opportunity!! I've paid much more for a hotel overnight in Springfield that gave me much less. This was private, easy load and unload, plenty of space, proper accommodations and all for less than a cheap hotel. Wonderful neighborhood and felt safe and comfortable. there was even a picnic area and relaxing space, both in the shade and in the Sun. Great place and I highly recommend it.
I'll definitely be back on my many trips to see grandkids and family and friends."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,Nick was so helpful and kind! Great space!

2023-09-01,4,Stayed one night,"It’s very small, which I expected, and didn’t mind. However, I believe the previous renter must have smoked because it smelled smoky and the floor wasn’t as clean as it could’ve been. It’s a cute building and a unique experience for sure."

2023-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"I’m always looking to stay in places that are unique and this place fits that bill for sure! It was a perfect place for us to stay the night as Hammons Stadium was less than 2 miles away and that’s why we were staying in Springfield! Nick was a wonderful host! He was always quick to respond and he was also very interesting and a talented guy… it was an added perk to meet him! Great place for an overnight with your furry friend at a reasonable price! The water pressure in the shower was great!
If you are contemplating, just go for it!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is a great and unique place. I always go out of my way to look for unique places that are clean and have some kind of history. Can’t do too much better than a 1920s gas station. The decorations were an added plus. It was a great location, especially if you want to be close to downtown and restaurants. If you are a light sleeper may not be best for you as the traffic is a bit loud BUT it’s a 1920s gas station within walking distance of downtown so for us worth the extra noise. Overall we had a great time and enjoyed our stay."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,This was a great location for a short drive to the stadium. Nice area to walk the dogs in too. I love the uniqueness of this place!
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"My second time staying at the gas station and no complaints! Met Nick in person, very nice guy! I'll most likely stay there again on my next work trip because of the privacy, location, and it's pet friendly. vh c"

2023-06-01,3,Stayed one night,"My daughter & I were in town from 2pm Sunday to 9 am Monday. I chose this mainly to say that I slept in an old gas station off Rt 66 & the price for 1 night was cheaper than any hotel! It's quaint, unique, and all you would need for a quick stay.

2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We have stayed in this adorable refurbished gas station before, and we will no doubt be staying again. It is super central to downtown Springfield, and relatively close to wherever you’d like to go in other places in or just outside of the city. Nick was available anytime we needed him and we had a seamless check in. With this place being pet friendly, if you have a fur baby, look no further. So much character in a small structure 🤍"

2024-03-01,4,Stayed one night,"Kelley’s Place has a lot going for it. First of all, the neighborhood is just beautiful. I took a long walk down two of the country roads and you wouldn’t think you’re near a city. This home and the other homes in the area are unique, upscale and located on lovely lots. Neighborhood is peaceful and very quiet. I didn’t use the deck but it would be a nice place to sit and read a book or enjoy a cup of coffee.
The private entry/access was nice, the bed was comfy and the shower was great with plenty of hot water. The wall-mounted HVAC unit was ultra quiet (silent really) and provided a nice, even heat. It’s really a perfect apartment for one or two people.
This is a pet friendly unit and I should have paid more attention to that when I booked. As such, I noticed a mild, doggie aroma as well as dog hairs on my socks when I walked around without shoes."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Great little cottage. Everything you need for a quick weekend stay
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Kelly was so sweet! beautiful home!! Madd sure we had everything we needed, made us feel welcome!"

2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Perfect fit a two person weekend in Springfield, MO. It is a perfect mix of feeling like you're home away from home. Cozy, comfortable, and once you walk outside there's a big yard and fireplace for you to unwind. Wouldn't hesitate to book the cottage again!"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"Very clean and tidy. Very comfy bed. Quiet location with wooded lot in the back. Covered entryway via the carport. Super easy to find and a quick hop from 65 and 44. Away from crowded city area of Springfield, but easy access to restaurants and shops. Only complaint is that there are two street lights right outside the windows of the cottage which made it too bright at night. Bring a sleep mask if you like it dark at night. Otherwise the place was perfect!"

2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Stayed here on business and would stay again in a heartbeat. BEAUTIFUL quiet area, and the guest house was really great. Kelley was awesome, as I rolled in at around 2am, they made sure all the lights were left on inside and out. If you’re looking for a quiet, clean, nice place, that’s close to a lot but is tucked away and peaceful this is it."

This studio is in a beautiful area of large, well-made homes with lots of older trees. The best part was that there was a full bathtub with shower that had great pressure. I would definitely like to stay here the next time I visit Springfield."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,We had a great stay at Kelly’s. She was very welcoming of us and our dog. The place is very peaceful and it’s in a nice neighborhood not far from dining and attractions in the local area. I’d stay here again if I ever need an overnight in Springfield.

2023-03-01,4,Stayed with a pet,"Enjoyed the serenity and the lovely neighborhood. The bathroom is on the small side, but the strong water pressure makes up for it! I hate weak showers. If we had more time and better weather we would’ve taken advantage of the deck, grill and fire pit. Kelley was great."
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The place was very peaceful, in a nice neighborhood with large lots, and very easy to find. We had everything we needed in the place. It was clean, with good amenities, and within 10-15 minutes of everything we needed during our stay. Kelley's instructions were very good and her communication was responsive.

2022-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"The extras (s’mores supplies) were a nice touch. Tile floor was great, but a few extra rugs on the floor would be good in the winter. Overall, beautiful location."
2022-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This is a clean and stylish studio in an upscale neighborhood. Kelley's communication was excellent and she allowed us to check in early. My husband and I, along with our little dog, were in town to take our daughter to a college visit. This location is an easy drive to colleges, restaurants, etc. The weather was very windy with some rain and the temperatures ranged from the 30's to the 50's. The only minor negatives we found is there is no dishwasher in this unit, and turning around in the parking area with our big truck was a little tight, but those were not big issues for us. This would be a safe place to stay for a single person traveling alone. It is also suitable for a couple or a someone with a small pet. I highly recommend Kelley's Airbnb."

Nice to have the tile floor so I wasn’t worried about me or my dog tracking anything in onto a carpet in the wet weather. (But especially if you do bring your pup, I suggest bringing a couple towels or something to step onto when you come inside for drying paws/leaving shoes as there are no floor mats at all inside.)
It was extremely cold for my stay, but I’m sure In warmer months the back deck would be a lovely spot to sit out. As it were, it was great to be by the wooded area to take my dog out to stretch etc. Thanks for the lovely place, Kelley!"

2021-12-01,4,Stayed with a pet,"Ideal spot for a solo guest wanting a quiet place to sleep while visiting.
