Even the pull out deal in the office was top notch. The fridge was clean, no 3 year old jam. The space is well thought out. Stay here if you are in the Eastern UP...and it's available."

2024-02-01,5,Group trip,"I spent this past weekend at a hockey showcase and the apartment I stayed in was amazing! It was so neat, clean, and spacious - I felt right at home. Plus, the location was perfect - everything I needed was within a 2-mile radius. Admittedly, we had a bit of trouble getting in at first, but it was mostly our own fault. The only minor issue was that our unit was on the bottom floor and the upstairs unit was also occupied, so we could hear some noise from upstairs. Despite that, I would still give my overall experience a perfect 10 out of 10!"

This popped up at a great rate for our stay (we checked in on Christmas Eve). We had one minor snafu where we were locked out, but Edmund was immediately responsive and fixed the issue in less than 5 minutes. If this location is available, we will definitely be back for future visits."

We didn’t do any cooking, but the kitchen was well equipped, including a dishwasher. This place would work great for two couples, or a family, since there are two bedrooms plus a separate office/futon room. The neighborhood is quiet and only a short drive to downtown, the locks or LSSU. We will definitely plan to stay there again."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Edmund's place was very centrally located for us in The Soo. The place was also neat and clean and cozy.

The next time I am up in The Soo, I will definitely consider staying here again."

The neighborhood felt very safe and there was reserved parking behind the house. The house was very comfortable and the kitchen was stocked well. I slept like a rock every night we were there, the bed was so comfortable. It got a bit warm at times but there were box fans that cooled things down pretty quickly. We will definitely choose this house next time we're in the area."

2023-11-01,5,Group trip,This rental was one of the best I have stayed in. Very spacious and updated. The amenities in the bathroom were a great added touch.
2023-10-01,5,Group trip,Our stay was great. House was extremely clean and host supplies more than enough for guests! If I were to say anything negative it would be that the bedrooms could have blackout curtains and larger beds and that there was another bathroom on the 2nd level.
2023-10-01,5,Group trip,We had a wonderful stay at Avery-Rose’s home. Our family loved the open spaces for gathering and eating. All the bedrooms are upstairs with only one bathroom (ensuite) on that floor. If any guests that aren’t in the master bedroom have mobility issues climbing up and down the stairs at night can be an issue. We loved our stay! We’ll definitely be back!!
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Avery’s place was wonderful , the perfect place to stay for the weekend. Lots of space, was fully stocked with anything you could need. We especially appreciated the hotel like amenities left in the bathrooms, a great touch. Would recommend the place to everyone!"

2023-09-01,5,Group trip,"This house was perfect for our family to stay while visiting our daughter at LSSU. We loved seeing the deer in the back yard and the giant tv was great for watching football games. Very comfortable space with everything we needed, including a nice gas grill to cook some steaks for dinner."
2023-09-01,4,Group trip,"The place was as stated, we had a great time there. It was nice and clean, a little noisy at night and early morning since it was near a school and in town but that was expected and stated."
2023-09-01,5,Group trip,"The home is beautifully updated and tastefully furnished. It had everything we needed to feel right at home. The host got back to me right away with any questions I had. I would stay there again and recommend it to anyone staying in the Soo area. It was close to area attractions and big enough to fit a family of four comfortably. The host also had many unexpected details and such a nice, personal touch!"

2023-08-01,5,Group trip,Beautiful space with everything you could need!
2023-08-01,5,Group trip,"Absolutely gorgeous house! Everything was beautiful and felt like being at home. The house backs up to a wooded area with a peaceful and relaxing setting. Beds were comfortable and the entire place was immaculately clean. Just a couple of minor items to note. There are no window coverings on the master bedroom or the bathrooms, but both face the backyard, so it was less about privacy and more about light waking you when the sun rises. Also, there were no deck chairs. It’s a beautiful setting, but could only sit on the deck steps or stand. As mentioned, these are minor issues compared to the overall high quality of the home. Would definitely stay here again."
2023-08-01,5,Group trip,"Beautiful, clean and spacious house"

Communication with host was excellent. Super friendly and responds quickly. We requested an ironing board/iron and was quick to supply. Worked with us for special requests.
Thank you Avery-Rose for a fantastic stay, you’ve done a lovely job with the home."
2023-06-01,5,Group trip,My group had a lovely stay here. Host was very accommodating to let me make the reservation and to keep my family comfortable from the heat wave by purchasing fans and having them delivered. A generous and kind host. I recommend staying here 100%.

2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place was amazing, im so happy we were able to stay here during our trip.

2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The space was as advertised and very comfortable. Enjoyed the unique location, both situated at the back of an old church building, as well as being smack in the middle of downtown/ church district.

The space was clean and had everything we need for our stay, including waste bags for our dog which we didn’t expect and was a really nice touch. The location was very close to downtown SSM (about a 5-10 minute drive depending on traffic) as well as to the closest Meijer to pick up groceries (about 8 minutes).

2023-08-01,4,Stayed with kids,"Could use some more furniture in the living area, but was clean and comfortable. Suited our needs."
2023-08-01,3,Stayed a few nights,"The little house was very clean with plenty of linens, most plumbing worked well, However the electrical lacks a bit to be desired, in that it had very limited capacity. The house itself has three levels of floors between the rooms, and the drywall was not well finished, and not as it looked in the pictures. Owners were very responsive and Georgia assured me they had an appointment with an electrician in the near future. In retrospect we would probably not visit again, and would probably stay in one of the hotels closer to town."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This home fit our needs perfectly. Very cozy and conveniently located to be able to adventure in the UP. No bells and whistles, but that's not what you're here for.

Very quiet neighborhood and easy to get to both Sherman Park and the main strip of restaurants."

A cozy, clean, thoughtfully set up space in a well-kept, quiet little neighborhood not too far from all you might need or want to do. For future guest, grab a few logs of wood from a local store as you get into town so you can enjoy the fire pit - out back is a nice space too!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Enjoyed our stay!

2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Family of 3 recently visited our son in Sault Ste Marie for a few days, and this cottage was conveniently located to him and the downtown area. Very clean and modern updates inside. Bed was comfortable and extra bedding was provided for the sleeper sofa. One of our party slept there and found it more comfortable when it was a sofa vs when opened up. Appreciated the large fans as well as the window a/c in the bedroom. High temps while we were up north and the house does heat up if fans aren't running. Great communication with the hosts and the neighborhood was quiet and safe feeling."

2023-02-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Overall, cozy is a great description for Connie's place! In addition to the coziness, the kitchen is extremely well-stocked with cooking implements, coffee maker, etc. One of the reasons we choose Airbnb's is for their kitchens and the ability to cook meals. Connie's place has everything we needed to use - the oven, the stove top, big refrigerator.
The bathroom sink area is snug but the shower stall is a nice size - and the place has lots and lots of really hot water with excellent water pressure! There is a step up into the bathroom so if you're like us you'll trip once. Plenty of room for two people to spread out and take advantage of the provided wifi and Roku television setup.
Only drawbacks we noted were due to winter more so than the property. Parking access gets crowded by the snow banks; the metal roof has a tendency to release built-up snow right onto the walkway to the unit."
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Connie was a great host! When we had questions, she got back to us quickly and she was very friendly. The house was nice and warm even when we first showed up. Which is a huge plus when the temperature never got out of the teens the whole time we were there. Everything was clean and tidy. It was a perfect place for our weekend getaway. I would definitely stay there again."
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Connie is an awesome host and the penthouse is perfect for a weekend in the Soo! Within walking distance of the downtown area, cozy space with anything you would need to cook in or right next door of a place to eat out.

We especially liked the binder of menus of local places to eat. Very walkable to many places, grocery stores just a drive down the road or one you can walk to just down the street. The parking spot is a tight fit, definitely nothing larger than a equinox would fit. Connie is a great host, very quick responder. I think we would stay here again!"

2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Perfect!
2022-08-01,3,Stayed a few nights,"Not much natural light available inside. Pigeons roost on roof and right outside bathroom window, you can see and hear them 12 inches from window. Entryway is up the stairs and flooring made of sheet expanded metal (little wobbly for those with difficulty walking) also entryway is not covered and roof ends right over so if raining you will get wet."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Wonderful location, easy to get to. The penthouse has everything you need for a weekend or a week. So much better than a hotel!"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great little penthouse for sure! Connie has thought of all the comforts to make her air bnb an excellent place for relaxation and comfort!

2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Wonderful space in walking distance to all things Sault Ste Marie. Small but not claustrophobic; this is to apartments what a well-designed tiny home is to residential spaces.

2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Connie was an excellent host! She was aware that we were arriving late and made sure there was a light on where we needed to park, and the air conditioning was running. The apartment is exactly as it appears in the photos, and very well appointed. I had a question the first morning and received an instant response, and she checked later that day to make sure everything was OK. We could not have asked for a nicer stay. The apartment is also located very near Portage Street which is where the locks are, as well as many gift shops. If you’re hungry and looking for a great place to eat the Wicked Sister restaurant is right next door, and had excellent food and service! We would also highly recommend the West Pier but be sure to bring your appetite! We will definitely be staying there again!"
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Such an amazing place. Host is great and communicates perfectly.
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Connie’s place was beyond my expectations. It is a very cozy, adorable space with a comfortable bed and little to no noise disturbance! It’s walking distance to down town. All of the amenities are clean and perfect for a short or longer stay. I think my favorite find was the mini iron and ironing board! It is clear Connie makes sure her place has everything to offer to ensure your trip to the Soo is perfect! I highly recommend her place!"
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My sister and I stayed here for two nights as part of a road trip around the UP and could not have asked for a better experience! Connie was great at communicating, making the check-in/out process easy. The place was clean, the kitchen was fully stocked with whatever you needed, there were food menus from local restaurants in a binder you could look at, a Roku to keep up with your favorite shows, and a nice hot shower was waiting for you after a long day of hiking."
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Exactly as advertised, more than what we expected. Hope it’s available next time we visit Sault Ste Marie"

2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"You will love, love, love!"
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Connie’s apartment is very well done and well equipped. We didn’t do any cooking, but it would be easy since there is a good variety of dishes, glassware, pans etc. There is a grocery store a couple blocks away and she has provided information on local restaurants. Everything was spotless, the bed was comfortable and the linens were nice. The location is central to everything you would want to do in the Soo. We were there for homecoming/alumni events at LSSU so we were only about two minutes away. There are stairs to reach the unit, so if that is an issue for you, it won’t be a good fit. We will certainly plan to stay there again!"
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Connie's place is very nice and exactly as described, only better! It's easy to find, with off-street parking and a good location. Keyless entry! Easy on and off the freeway. It's a nice walk down to the waterfront, past many interesting storefronts. You can walk to your choice of many restaurants. You're close to the area attractions.
The apartment itself was extremely comfortable and well-appointed; it has a fabulous kitchen with every implement you might need. I did not cook during my stay, but it would be really nice for a family because eating out every day and night can get expensive. The bed was very comfortable and the sheets and towels were of high quality. The bathroom has a nice showerhead and lots of hot water. Watch that small step up into the bathroom, though!
After exploring the area all day it was nice to come home to such a cozy retreat. Relax. Watch a movie. There were many small, thoughtful touches that made this stay a real winner.
I would definitely recommend staying here."
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Cute little penthouse in a nice location. It was perfect for my husband and I for a weekend in the area.

2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Connie has a wonderful place that isn’t too far from shops to walk to. We walked down to the locks and then ate at Zorbas, exploded all the little shops, and tried a local brewery. The Cozy penthouse is only about an hour drive to mackinaw city where the ferry for Mackinac Island is located. We spent a whole day on the island so if you’re planning a trip to the island allow a whole day and be sure to ask the souvenir shop directly in front of the sheplers drop off about the bar crawl tshirt! We appreciate Connie’s place very much! Very clean and super cute :) thank you, Connie!"

2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had an amazing time at Connie’s Airbnb. She was available, very quick to respond and so very kind. The facility was perfect and even better than advertised."
2021-08-01,4,Stayed a few nights,A very nice Airbnb. The unit was very clean and well equipped. Connie was very nice to do business well. She responded quickly to any concerns or questions. Just be aware that it is an outside entrance with steps and an open grate walkway to the apt. We were surprised but got used to it. A very nice place to stay while visiting the Soo area.
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Connies place is very cozy and wonderful to stay at! She is very responsive, and offers great suggestions for restaurants in the area. Keep in mind if traveling to mackinaw or mackinac city it is about an hour drive!"

2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a great stay At Connie's! She has done a lot with a small space to make it comfortable, modern and clean. All the supplies and things you need for a stay away from home. Great decor down to the minor details. Located on the main street leading down to the locks and gift shops. A great restuarant right next door as well. Communication was great too, we will definitely book again the next time we are in the Sault!"

2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The airbnb was very clean and well thought out to provide a comfortable and relaxing stay. The location is excellent with many good restaurants and bars a short walk away. The host is also very responsive and friendly. Overall, I would highly recommend."

2021-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The style of the penthouse was awesome and everything was very user friendly. Supplied with the proper kitchen equipment and bathroom utilities. The AC unit worked great and having a tv of that size was nice as well. All in all, we really enjoyed our stay!"

2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great location, right off the highway, easy access to everything. Secluded, quiet and just big enough for us. The GPS Directions took us to a dead end road near the Canadian Border so not sure what was up with that. Also, bunk beds are not the best for a multi use unit. Otherwise everything worked and was a good stay. It wouldn't hurt to add some travel bottles of shampoo and soap for the shower and toilet paper that doesn't feel like sandpaper. All in all a great stay and value and we will likely return the next time we visit the area."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a wonderful stay. The location is close to the sights Sault Ste. Marie has to offer, with a private setting. It was a great stay for a young family with two toddlers. We will stay again. 🙂"

2023-11-01,4,Stayed one night,Nice place! Lovely hosts. Could use some tweeks. Discussed with Tammy
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The vibe was: “modern, perfectly stocked, clean, organized, tiny-home, newly-built FOR the sole purpose of being an up-north glamping, rental place”
The windows in the living room were EVERYTHING. Everything seems very custom and newly built like the shower floor which has Michigan rocks cemented into it.
Kitchen and bathroom all appliances were great.
Grill + bonfire + easy access to a town 10 mins away. Hosts are responsive and friendly folk, I can tell they put a love of TLC into their home + other listings- which are all close by.
My 1 month old infant accompanied me and my partner on this birthday getaway of mine, and they were nice enough to bring out a pack n play which had a bassinet and changing table built in (huge thank you for being infant/toddler friendly)"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is the second time we been hosted by Tammy and David, but a different property. They are wonderful hosts, their homes are always as described and they are super responsive. The grill ran out of gas right as we were getting ready to grill and David brought a new tank right over. We will stay with them again and again!"

2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Tammy & David we’re so friendly and easy to communicate with. The property had exactly what we needed and for a great price.

Full kitchen with tons of supplies to cook. Word to the wise - there aren’t any curtains or blinds so if you’re not an early riser, be sure to pack a sleep mask."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"It was nice to come to a clean and peaceful stop after a day of driving. Tammy & Dave’s place was clean, comfortable, had yard games and board games and a large space for the kids to run around! Great stay!"

2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Nice place. Close to Sault Ste Marie, but it felt private."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Always a great place
2023-03-01,5,Group trip,"Tammy and David's place was updated, clean and open. The beds and furniture were extremely comfortable. However, due to the open-floor plan and walls that didn't go all the way to the ceiling, there was little sound or light barrier throughout the entire space (e.g. if one person snores or turns on the light, it affects everyone). Also, there was no door to the bunkbed area, and the doors to the master bedroom and bathroom both had frosted glass, which did not afford the amount of privacy needed for a space designed for 7 people."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Stayed here while visiting our son at LSSU. The place was beautiful! Close to campus. It was a short drive to Tahquamenon Falls and a few lighthouses. East arrival and departure. Everything was exactly as pictured.

2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Probably the cutest and def cleanest Airbnb I’ve stayed at since using Airbnb over the past 6 years. Some of the decor was stuff I had so I really felt at home. Just the cozy and perfect size. Our boys loved the bunk beds. So clean that I felt like we were the first people ever to stay there. Had everything we needed. Impressive. I loved it. Very peaceful place.

Everything we needed was provided, as well as many thoughtful touches including family games! The beds were comfortable, as were the couches, and communication was clear and prompt.
Highest recommendation for this beautiful house! It was a highlight of my family vacation."
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We really enjoyed our time staying at Tammy and David's cute little house! We loved the tranquility it provided and were looking for.

She took the time to walk us through how everything worked, and introduced the kids to her pets (my daughter, especially, is an animal person). She even let us know that we left a charger and offered to ship it to us.
The apartment itself was immaculate. Very clean, comfortable, and well appointed. It was on a through road but in a quiet area, so a good mix of ease of access and a low traffic area.
All in all, would highly recommend staying with Kellan."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,Very beautiful home Kellan was really nice and helpful and very convenient location everywhere I needed to go it was within minutes from. I really appreciate her and allowing us to stay at her home.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Couldn’t have asked for a better FIRST Airbnb experience for our family of 6 (kids aged 1-13). We explored the UP & needed a place to stay for a night. Kellan was responsive, welcoming, and friendly. Our kids loved how it felt like home & that they all had their own beds. I don’t remember seeing it in the listing (I might’ve just missed it) so I was surprised to see a pack n play + highchair (didn’t use them, brought our own pnp.)
We loved waking up 10 minutes from the Soo Locks. We were able to walk around before it got busy.
Would recommend the apartment as well as Kellan!"

St. Ignace was about a 45 min drive and there were some amazing beaches with dunes off of US-2 that our family enjoyed. So many fun things to do in the area. Kellan provided us with many recommendations in the area. She is such a kind and friendly host. I just can’t say enough good things about our stay! We will definitely be back. ❤️

2022-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We were some of Kellan’s first guests and we had a wonderful stay. The space is very new, modern, and clean. It is a newly renovated basement apartment in Kellan’s home and a completely private space. A large TV in the main living area and one smaller one in each bedroom. The sauna was so nice after a long cold day. A fully stocked and working kitchen. The beds were very comfortable. I have stayed in AirBnbs all over the world and think this one will be a huge hit! It is close to M28 and downtown Sault St. Marie. Kellan is very quick to respond, you can contact her for anything. Highly recommend."
2022-01-01,5,Stayed one night,Kellan’s place in very clean and comfortable. The host communication was wonderful. Location is close to town while giving you a quiet setting. I highly recommend a stay.
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,Enjoyed our stay very much. Great spot to watch the freighters pass.
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The view of the Soo Locks was fantastic. We were able to use the QR code in the apartment to see when ships would come through. The place was very clean and well appointed . We walked to dinner each night and had wonderful meals in the local restaurants.
2024-06-01,3,Stayed a few nights,"Wonderful location. The windows overlooking the locks were very dirty or foggy, which impaired the view. The batteries in the smoke alarm failed, causing a disruptive, loud beeping all night. The TVs are difficult to operate. The parking instructions were confusing; they said to park in a space on which ""No Parking"" was clearly written."
2024-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a lovely stay at your home! It was easy to find, great instructions, clean, just as beautiful as the pictures. It was very spacious! Amazing views of the Saulte Ste Marie locks! It was the perfect location to walk to local restaurants too. Thank you for hosting a wonderful weekend. We are looking forward to our next stay :)"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed about a week,Location was great and was able to walk everywhere in town. The view was spectacular and I had enjoyed watching the freighters move through the locks. I will come back!

2024-03-01,5,Group trip,"Very responsive, clear instructions on how to get into the apartment. Apartment was very clean and had a beautiful view of the soo locks. Hosts were very responsive throughout our stay and answered all our questions in a very timely manor. Would definitely recommend this location if you are wanting to be right downtown Sault Ste. Marie. You do have to go up two flights of stairs so keep that in mind if you have trouble climbing stairs."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This is a fantastic location in Sault Ste. Marie and has such an amazing view of the locks. We watched more than a dozen ships go through in three days that we were there. Would love to come back!
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We came to Sault Ste Marie to watch boats, and the location could not have been better. Great view and everything in walking distance"

2024-03-01,5,Group trip,We LOVE this air bnb. It’s in the perfect location for all our needs while visiting the soo. Alexandra is a wonderful host and is super kind! We have stayed here a few times now and this will always be a favorite for us!
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Wow, what an amazing gem in beautiful historic downtown Sault Ste. Marie !!! The almost secret and harmoniously poetic “speakeasy” style entry nailed the vibe from the moment you arrive and walk through the Palace restaurant below’s main entry door. From there it feels even more adventurous as you open the adjacent beautiful solid wood bi-fold closet-style door with a small sign noting the ABNB access point. You will then climb a set of traditionally historic wooden stairs, which are tolerable, yet allows you enough exercise that it creates a prelude heat beat in preparation for the amazing view you find immediately upon arriving at your destination. Atop this flight you will find your entry ——— a large solid wood door with a polished brass key code style lock ——- from there, prepare yourself, as you swing this door open you are met by an amazing view over the world famous Soo locks with the backdrop of the country of Canada. An all glass wall leaves nothing to hide. I will be back !!!"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,Awesome place and exactly as described! We had two toddlers so the stairs were a challenge but we’re not a deal breaker! The only thing that would have made it a bit better would have been if the hosts could have controlled the weather 😂 It was a fantastic place!
2024-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,Great place right downtown with a great view
2024-02-01,5,Group trip,Such a great place! Have stayed multiple times and love everything about it! Excellent hosts!

2024-01-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Warm and fluffy bed, nice view"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,A great place to stay with amazing views of the locks.
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Amazing location and view!! Only thing that would make it better is more than one white noise machine since it is a bit loud in the morning and at night.
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great location. Space was clean, beautiful view. Close to everything we needed. Wonderful stay!"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What an incredible place to stay! We were mesmerized, night and day, by the passing freighters. There is no better view in the city! So close to many shops and restaurants. Will stay again!"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We have stayed at several Airbnb’s in Sault Michigan and this is the only one we would return to. Very comfortable at home feeling. It is on the high end of our budget but we really enjoy it.
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Alexandra is a great host - very responsive, flexible with check in/out and helpful with instructions.
The place is just as described, even bigger and nicer. Soo Locks is right in front with a wide view. Going up the stairs is not a big deal and the place is very quiet despite of being above a restaurant. Thank you."
2023-12-01,5,Group trip,"This was a wonderful apartment, clean and spacious. Everything was as explained as far as noise and stairs. We had a wonderful weekend visiting and celebrating Christmas with our adult children. We loved watching the ships go in and out of the locks with the awesome view from the apartment. We spent time walking, shopping and at various restaurants and bars. Even took our family photo by the Christmas tree at city hall. Highly recommend this apartment!"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Thank you
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"10/10 recommend! Such a cozy beautiful place! We LOVED our time spent here. It was nice and clean and had just about everything we could need in it! The host was extremely kind and was great about communicating about things during our stay! We will be back again!
We also recommend the palace! It’s delicious and has a wonderful atmosphere!"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I needed a pace to stay for work at the last minute. Alexandra communicated quickly and was very accommodating and helpful. Great place with a front row seat to see the locks. Located right above a vibrant restaurant and within a block of the local brewery and a great local bookstore. Very spacious with high ceilings and a fully stocked kitchen. Would stay again no doubt.
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Lovely space, great location, host responsive... and the views...."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We loved our time here. So much room and large windows that were great for watching the ships. So many shops and restaurants right outside the door along with the Soo Locks. Alexandra was a great host. Clear instructions, which made check in and check out easy. We hope to stay here again in the future."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This was a beautiful place to stay. I could walk a short distance to many places to grab food or coffee as well as cute little shops. The apartment was very clean and tidy with a lot of helpful amenities. I would stay here again on my next visit. The view was incredible!
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Two thumbs up! And from the lower Peninsula, a bag of Better Made Potato Chips!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Great AirBnB, lots of room inside the apartment. The window viewing the locks was a big hit, cool ship watching. Would definitely stay again."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful space, very clean, open and great views"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"You'll probably say something like ""Nice!"" when you walk in the door and see the big window you'll be looking from during your stay. Found the place as described, and yes, the bars across the street produce noticeable noise that can be heard from the bedrooms until at least 1 AM on the weekend. But play some white noise - the uniqueness and convenience of the place are worth it. Alexandra and Tammy were responsive and provided good instructions. Check in and out were easy."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful Airbnb!! This will be our go to place when we visit Sault Ste Marie.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We loved being so close to everything including the lock. We had a pretty good view of ships moving through.

2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Phenomenal place! Very clean and well stocked! Loved the big windows in front to watch the freighters go by! Already thinking of a second trip!

2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great place. Wonderful location, great view of the locks. Located right in the heart of the Soo. Beds could be bigger, but we made it work. Hosts were super quick to respond to our questions."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place. Awesome location.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,This ranks at the very top of my list for favorite Airbnbs - and I’ve stayed in a LOT! This place is so unique and special. The location is perfect. The loft and view and windows are gorgeous. There is SO much space. We loved it and didn’t want to leave.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"If you want t be in the heart of the Soo, but have a relaxing place to stay, this is it! Clean, more spacious than I expected, and beautiful views. I doubt there are many places where you could get so much, and pay less."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We loved being up in this spacious apartment. Being able to watch the freighters come and go through the locks while sitting on the wide window seat was amazing, and then going downstairs and being right in town was so fun. The location really is awesome. We did just relax and watch tv in the evenings, and the sofa area is really comfortable, and then the bedrooms were lovely and private. The apartment really is up two long flights of stairs, ( in case you are doubting ) but as long as your knees are able, so worth it for the view of the sunrise, sunset, view of the locks, and location."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Great location, clean, beautiful view of the locks/sunrise/sunset. Highly recommend staying here!"
2023-09-01,5,Group trip,Alex’s place was great and accommodated our family. Liked being right downtown and walking distant to all the little shops. Enjoyed watching the big ships come in thru the big windows.
2023-08-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Convenient location. Onsite parking OK for mid-size car. Bigger vehicles may be a problem onsite. The two flights of stairs (no elevator) will give you a workout. Short walk to everything. The window is very nice for viewing boat traffic, but not the locks because of trees in the adjacent park. Very nice park. Spacious interior. Neighborhood noise is what I expected in advance. The property is in a commercial, downtown tourist area next to a working maritime installation under construction. Occasional loud vehicles on the main drag at night. Could hear downstair tenant’s TV at night. Loud riding lawn mower on adjacent lot before 7:30 am. All 3 bedrooms had double beds. 2 of the 3 bedrooms could easily accommodate bigger beds. Bathroom clean and basic. Notified owner of 2 bath issues. A sharp protrusion on the bath’s hot water knob resulted in a minor cut. The bath’s grab bar was not secure. The owner was apologetic and quick to respond. Would stay again after bath issues repaired."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,My friends and I loved staying here! It’s a beautiful apartment in a historic building which lots of space to spread out.
2023-08-01,5,Group trip,Beautiful place and a great location with wonderful hosts!!
2023-08-01,4,Stayed with kids,Alexandra's place was perfect for our family get-away to Sault Ste. Marie. It was close to the locks and everything downtown. Highly recommend!
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,Great place within walking distance to a lot surrounding the soo locks.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"My family had a lovely trip at Alexandra’s! The view, location and size of apartment were all ideal. Not to mention - Alexandra was incredibly helpful and fast with all responses.
If I find myself in the Soo again - this is my go-to spot."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Open, airy, and so nice to walk everywhere. Would visit again!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place!
2023-07-01,4,Stayed with kids,"Beautiful view of the locks, spacious and clean apartment. Walk up above restaurant as advertised. It closes at ten so you will have a quiet night. We really enjoyed this space, plenty of room for sister, her kids and our father to enjoy. Working pump organ was a fun extra. Extended family and some friends came to tour the place when we told them about it and were impressed as well.
Good food at the palace saloon and easy take out. Just down the block is Birdseye outfitters, they offer great paddle tours and healthy food and smoothies, good coffee.
Note that the parking spot only works with a compact car. Close free parking nearby in a lot or paid parking at the hospital ramp. Some issues with a beeping smoke alarm which disrupted our sleep, the host eventually addressed and did make this right. Just be sure you are communicating with the main host asap if any urgent issues come up, especially in the evening.
Would stay here again when we are in the area."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,Very clean and nicely decorated. Beautiful view of the Locks. Our kids enjoyed watching the boats from the living room.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Spacious, clean and quiet. Great views. A short walk to the Famous Lock tour office, well worth the time. We would recommend this place to anyone coming to Sault Sainte Marie."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,It was what we look for when traveling. Quiet. Clean. Nice safe area.
2023-07-01,5,Group trip,This place has a great view of the locks and the downtown area is within walking distance! Great place to stay for a weekend
2023-07-01,3,Stayed with kids,Alexandra was very responsive and communicative. It was a good location. She was quick to help when we reached out.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We stayed here for a local golf tournament and we were not disappointed! It was a very spacious, very clean condo, right downtown. It’s where you’d want to stay when visiting the Soo, you can literally walk to all the great restaurants, bars and shops. Lastly, you’d be hard pressed to find a better view than the one this condo offers! We are already booking this spot, next year!
Great host and a great place!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is a fabulous place right in downtown Sault Ste. Marie. You are close to shops and restaurants, and the view of the locks and the big ships is amazing. A great place to base yourself for some eastern UP adventure, or a stay in town."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful place right downtown!
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Our family had a great time in Sault Ste. Marie. We loved being able to watch for boats coming and going from the Locks from the HUGE picture window. The condo was very clean, spacious, and just as pictured. As a family with 3 little kids we loved being able to walk everywhere in town as well. We would definitely rent again if back in the area!"
2023-06-01,5,Group trip,"My family and myself enjoyed our stay! The description of this place was very accurate. The view out the window overlooking the locks and park was fantastic! The host communicated clearly, and quickly!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Such a fun place so close to EVERYTHING! My kids loved watching the boats come in! Everything was spotlessly clean, and we felt right at home. Super fun location! We can’t wait to come back again!"
2023-06-01,5,Group trip,We really enjoyed our stay. The place was clean and had a good shower. Nice open floor plan. Great location. We went for a walk around town in the mornings and was able to walk to the 1668 Winery. They have great wine and beer there. Also very good food. We especially loved the artichoke dip and the pizza and burgers - excellent!
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,Alex was a great host. When we had two cars she made sure we got a parking for our second car too.
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I truly enjoyed my visit and the accommodations.
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Lovely view and stay. Walkable to shops, dining and health food store."
2023-02-01,5,Group trip,Absolutely beautiful place! Awesome location and a wonderful host!
2023-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,The place was as described.
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Alexandra was a wonderful host!
2022-10-01,5,Group trip,"Our family enjoyed this place so much. It’s spacious, not cluttered, very clean, well stocked, great view, and a truly unique place to stay. It wasn’t weird at all staying at this location either, above a restaurant. Once inside you couldn’t even tell. I’d stay here again and again!"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,What a wonderful place to stay! We will definitely be back!
2022-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Awesome place! It is so close to everything and easy to walk to shops, restaurants, locks and museums. The kids (my wife and I too) loved watching the freighters out the windows."
2022-10-01,5,Group trip,"Perfect location to check out all things Soo! Very clean, spacious and nicely decorated."
2022-10-01,3,Stayed a few nights,"It was okay, but caution if you feel you need to report an issue to Alexandra!! She/he took umbrage and was resistant to fixing it. In this case the toilet was inoperable for the first day... because clearly the place wasn't being maintained properly. But yes, with my insistence the only toilet did get repaired. On the positive side the location is good."
2022-10-01,5,Group trip,Great stay! Very spacious common area. Easily accessible and host was great with communication. Cute downtown area with good shops and bars. Had everything we needed for the weekend!
2022-09-01,3,Stayed a few nights,"Great views and location, but steep stairs."
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"A (very well) hidden gem in downtown Sault Ste Marie!
The apartment is accessed via a closet-like folding door in the vestibule of the Palace Mexican restaurant. Up a couple of flights of stairs is a BEAUTIFUL loft-type space that is much bigger than it looks in the listing pictures. It has a cozy living room, fully stocked kitchen, spacious dining area, three bedrooms, and a large bathroom with full-size washer and dryer. Don’t forget the wall-to-wall window with a view of the river!
The location couldn’t be better. We were basically smack in the middle of downtown Sault Ste Marie, with great restaurants and museums in walking distance either direction out our front door. A short (less than a block) walk got us to the park at the locks to watch the freighters go between Lake Huron and Lake Superior.
Our only issue was with parking. Thanks to some messaging with our hosts, we found out that you do, in fact, park next to the “No Parking” sign, on top of the “No Parking” painted on the ground.
Overall, it was a great space in a perfect location that will be our first choice for our next trip to Sault Ste Marie!"
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is a great place! We loved the windows, the unit got great light and the living room was comfortable. We enjoyed relaxing mornings watching the freighters go by. It was central to everything in town. The unit had everything we needed and the host was quick to respond to any questions. I would definitely recommend it."
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Awesome place, best way to experience Sault st Marie!"
2022-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,Great place! We will be back! Location is amazing and the view is incredible!
2022-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This is a great location right in the heart of SSM and walkable to many restaurants and attractions. Ship traffic is visible and makes for fun entertainment. It is as the owner claims, a long climb up two sets of stairs, but the stairs are wide and check in and check out are easy. If we’re ever back in the area, this will be our first choice."
2022-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Amazing place in the heart of Sault St. Marie! We were able to walk to all the main down town must do things: Soo Locks, Tower of History, Valley Camp Museum, Wicked Sisters Restaurant, numerous other shops and restaurants and of course the world famous Palace Mexican Restaurant and Saloon that is downstairs! Our 6 year old sons favorite part of the place was the giant picture windows from our third floor overlooking the locks allowing us to watching the ships sail by. You can track all the ships on Marine tracker online and know ahead of time what ships are in route through the locks. My family would absolutely stay here again for our next visit to down town Sault St. Maire!"
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Nice clean and spacious unit within walking distance to restaurants, shops and Soo Locks Park. We enjoyed watching freighters from the living room window. From Sault Saint Marie, in addition to local attractions, it was easy to get to a couple Light Houses, Brimley State Park to swim, Whitefish Point, Tahquamenon Falls and De Tour (Lake Huron). Very clean. Comfortable beds. Great communication with host."
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great location to everything. Very clean and spacious. The host was very responsive and we had everything we needed.
2022-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"what a great location! Alexandra was responsive and helpful, made our trip so easy and fun!"
2022-08-01,5,Group trip,Good place to stay!
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great View & Location!
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,Such a great place to stay. It’s way bigger then I realized and the view was awesome.
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The space is the third floor of a 100-year old building, above a Mexican restaurant. You do have to be able to haul yourself, your luggage, and your children up two flights of stairs, but the space and view are so worth it. The space is thoughtfully remodeled, keeping the older charm. Lots of room to spread out and unwind. Everything was immaculately clean. Washer & dryer were great and the kitchen well-stocked and table big enough for a feast! Of course we enjoyed watching the huge boats enter and leave the docks from the window that stretches along the entire wall facing the water. Summertime's leafy trees blocked the view a bit, but still able to watch them come and go. This is also on the mainstrip, walkable to cafes, restaurants, gift shops, and the park with museum & deck to watch the locks. Highly recommend!"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We had a wonderful stay! Perfect location. Beautiful apartment. Alexandra was always very responsive. Everything was very clean and comfortable. We would definitely stay here again!
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,Great space with a perfect location. Unit is very large and has everything you need. It was so nice to be able to walk to everything in downtown Soo Sault Marie. Communication with the host was fantastic. Highly recommend this Air B n B if your looking to stay in the Soo.
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,She was so helpful with all my questions and the Airbnb exceeded our expectations!!
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We loved this apartment in so many ways - the downtown location was awesome and even though it was over a restaurant, on the 3rd floor we didn't hear or smell a thing. The living/dining/kitchen area was a great open space, all it needs is a touch of coziness and the space will be perfect. Everything was very new and clean and we appreciated the explicit instructions for getting in. One word of caution: those two flights of stairs getting up to the 3rd floor apartment are a bit steep and not for people with mobility issues. We really enjoyed our stay and because we visit my in-laws in the Soo regularly, we will definitely be coming back."
2022-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This is a very clean spacious apartment. The bedrooms were nice and big. The kitchen was well equipped. It has a full size washer and dryer which came in handy. It easily accommadates a large group without tripping over one another.
The ability to watch the sun come up over the locks is a view that will never get old!! The location is perfect. You are across the street from the locks. Within walking distance of several restaurants, shops and coffee houses. When visting a small town who would want to be able to walk down the street and see the sights.
We are so happy we were able to stay here."
2022-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Can’t beat the location! Very spacious, amazing views. Alexandra was great to communicate with too!"
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Amazing location right downtown… very large space with awesome views of the locks. Highly recommended!
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We'll be happy to come back at any time, a place to feel good."
2024-06-01,4,Stayed one night,Really enjoyed our stay! Convenient location and cleaning rooms! Would definitely stay again 😌
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"The rooms are clean, comfortable and cute. The parking lot and outdoor area are rundown but the welcome binder explains improvements are coming. I'll be back to see the results. Don't let the outside first impression worry you!"
2024-04-01,4,Stayed with a pet,"This place is exactly as advertised. Very clean and new looking. Enjoyed staying here with my little dachshund, Bernadette."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"I love the vibe of this place! I love the upgrades and would highly recommend this place to anyone! Clean, quaint and it’s obvious there was love in the remodel. Thank you for the wonderful stay."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Lit as expected. Thanks again
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We loved this place! It's compact, but bigger and better equipped than a hotel room. It was really nice to have a hot plate (induction burner, fancy) to do basic cooking and we loved watching movies on the smart TV from the comfy day bed. Big windows let light in, and they were operable (unlike at a hotel) so you can have fresh air too. Grocery store right next door. The shower was a bit lukewarm but not terrible. I'd definitely stay here again and would 100% recommend to anyone visiting SSM!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Glad to see folks restoring older places instead of tearing them down. Lots of character and charm.
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,I loved it here!! My dogs and I had a wonderful stay. Clean & cozy.
2024-02-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Clean place, nice decorated, and looked like the pictures. We enjoyed our stay. Would recommend."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"I had a great stay, check in was easy and my stay was quiet and simple. Had TV as well which was something I forgot to check for. Would recommend!"
2024-02-01,4,Stayed a few nights,It was a great place to stay and very reasonably priced. The check in process was very easy.
2024-01-01,4,Stayed one night,"Alekz was wonderful to communicate with and the accommodations were fine too. The bed was very comfortable. The provided Coffee was much appreciated.
We were there for an overnight during an arctic cold snap while awaiting a morning flight. Internet was a bit slow and the shower only able to reach lukewarm. We parked it in the room, ordered a pizza and comfortably waited for the flight. Only 4 stars due to the shower heat and slower internet. Thank you!"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Perfect little getaway place. Town was quiet due to the time of year and no snow. Would definitely come back. Room was very clean and comfortable.
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Very friendly owner, and were very flexible with us. Would stay again."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"A lovely, quaint location. Centrally located. Served my purpose well!"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Alekz’s place was great! Clean and quiet. We’ll definitely be back when we visit Sault Ste. Marie.
2023-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"A beautiful hidden gem. Absolutely love what they have done to this old school motel. This particular room was everything as described. If I had to make one suggestion, it would be to add additional mirrors. The bathroom mirror is high and for someone short it made it very difficult for me to get ready. A mirror on the back of the bedroom door would be great to see your outfit, as would small mirror on the wall in the main area so two people are not fighting for the lone mirror in the bathroom. Aside from this, everything was perfect and we will be staying with them again."
2023-10-01,4,Stayed with a pet,Beautiful place. Perfect size! Super cute and cozy. Loved how hot the water got. Will stay again if in the area. Thanks.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Loved staying here with my dog for a quick trip to the Soo. A true gem, will stay again!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Alekz’s place is unique, neat, creative, and comfortable. Appreciated all the work going into the renovation of an older motel. The bed was very comfortable which is key. The suite had everything we needed. . Can’t wait to revisit and see the progress!!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Adorable little refurbished motel and pet friendly. My dog Lola and I stayed the night there on our road trip and it was simplex homey and convenient
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,Very nice and clean! Close to everything - highly recommend!
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,Everything we needed for our stay!
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,Great sitting area and kitchenette. Nice job of remodeling - very comfortable. Only downside to the property is that the road is busy - this coming from someone who lives in the country down a quiet dirt road!
2023-09-01,4,Stayed one night,Great place . Clean. Came for a wedding just overnight. Very convenient.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,A very peaceful place. We would stay there again!
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"We had a great stay at the Ash! Easy check in and the host was very helpful, responsive, and accommodating. The room was super clean with a stylish interior and thoughtful touches. (Nice job on the renovation! I love that they left the original midcentury touches, rather than gutting everything, as some might have unfortunately done). The room is well equipped with everything you need, and the location was central but still quiet and private. Highly recommend this cute spot."
2023-08-01,4,Stayed one night,Nice place to stay with very convenient parking. Well worth the price! Thanks Alekz!
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I loved staying here. The main reason it stuck out at me was because my name is Ashley and I get called Ash all the time. We were in town for the Michigan Paracon, last minute needed a place and boom, like a little present The Ash fell into place ☺️ very cute and quaint. Definitely recommend for a short stay up in Sault St. Marie."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"The Ash is a beautiful place to stay! The suite had everything we needed, and was very inviting. The space was clean and comfortable, and we really enjoyed some of the more retro amenities from the motel's past life. Alekz was friendly and proactive and also gave clear instructions."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Absolutely adorable. We loved everything about this place!
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Alekz’s place was great! Very nice and a great location for dropping my husband off for the Trans Superior race.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"A beautifully renovated space with friendly, responsive hosts. I was greatly impressed by the thick binder of recommendations that our hosts had prepared - listing pages of things to do in the area, recommended restaurants, as well as house rules and instructions. You could tell that they had put a lot of thought and effort into it. Location is great - just a 2 to 5 minute drive from restaurants and main attractions. The one thing we noticed is that the walls between the units were thin, so we could hear our neighbor occasionally but it wasn’t a bother. I would say that the place is better suited for guests who will respect quiet hours!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,Loved staying here! This was the most beautifully renovated motel I have ever seen! I’m so excited to see the changes that are made in the next year with finishing the outside pool and patio area!
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,I love this use of an historic motor inn! Freshly remodeled and very comfortable…perfect for a good nights sleep on our travels!!
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,The place was great
2023-07-01,4,Stayed one night,Nice clean room.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Had a great stay! Alekz was very quick at responding, the place was super cute and the bed was very comfortable. I would definitely stay again."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,Adorable place & very clean
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"I so enjoyed my stay at this wonderful vacation rental! I loved the charm, comfort and style of this unique and very cool place!! I plan to stay here again the next time I visit the Soo! Alekz was so easy and helpful to communicate with and I so appreciated that! 😃♥️"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"Alekz was very helpful when I couldn’t find the info I needed to enter the room. The place is so tastefully renovated and they are going to be offering more amenities such as a pool, etc. We especially enjoyed the book of “before & after” photos, which also had recommendations of any outside services we may need, complete w address & phone numbers!
The only thing I can think of to add, is that another towel hook in the bathroom would be great!
All in all, a good experience!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We really enjoyed our stay! I certainly love that it's an old building that's been given new life! Everything was just as pictured.
I found the bed to be incredibly comfortable! There were extra blankets that were very soft.
It was very clean.
It was very nice to have coffee provided!
We have family in the Soo, and we will likely stay here again the next time we visit!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We were looking for a pet friendly place in the Soo area, visiting relatives in Brimley. Accommodations were extremely tight due to the construction work going on at the Soo Locks. We found this neat old motel on Air BnB and it was pet friendly and reasonably priced. The rooms looked good and it had what we needed, so we reserved it. When we arrived, I followed the instructions and was able to get in with no problems. There are just two small steps up to the door and they are shallow enough that I had no trouble with them. The rooms are small but big enough to fit us comfortably. The bed was so comfortable we slept very well. The decor fits nicely with the retro look. There was nothing wrong anywhere in the place and we wish we could have spent more time there. Next time we come to the Soo, we'll stay there again."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Beautiful motel suite with everything you’d need. Comfortable environment. Bed was super comfortable and warm and cozy, clean and well thought out. Retro decorations were fun. Had a great stay snd would definitely return! Recommendations were awesome including coffee and breakfast at oh crepe!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great place for our overnight stay to our next destination. Clean, easy to find, quiet. Hope to be back."
2023-06-01,4,Stayed with a pet,"Alekz was great with communication- responded quickly, provided helpful information about the place and things to do, and even allowed us to check in early. The suite was beautifully renovated. The location was close to town and SOO Locks, but it was on a very busy street and seemed a bit run down. I’d still recommend The Ash- sounds like they have even more plans for the future to make it an even cooler place to stay!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Charming little place. We loved our stay. Very clean and comfortable. Our dogs tell us to give you 5 stars as they loved their quiet stay as well.
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"I'd highly recommend Alekz's place to a solo traveler or couple looking for a place to stay in Sault Ste. Marie. The place was the perfect space/layout for my wife and I (and doggo). Very cute decor and loved the revitalized and updated motel vibes. Meat/grocer next door was fun, Alpine Choclate house down the road had some killer ice cream and treats, and Bird's Eye Outfitters downtown was a great little breakfast/coffee stop with a dog-friendly patio. Thanks for a great stay!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Alekz’s place is very beautiful, comfortable, and clean. It’s easy to get to and close to downtown Sault St Marie. Alekz was also very responsive and a great host. I’d highly recommend this place, great value!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,Just as described. We enjoyed our stay.
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Super clean and very close to downtown Sault St. Marie. Would book again!
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,The ASH Motel was such a great idea and was excellently executed. The space was nice and quiet and was an easy drive to downtown! We really enjoyed our time there and would definitely stay with Alekz again.
2023-04-01,4,Stayed with a pet,"Our stay was pleasant and comfortable. The boutique motel was situated a short drive to downtown and to other establishments, which was helpful for our visit. We appreciated that we were allowed to bring our dog along, and that the surrounding neighborhood provided space for peaceful walks."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,Easy Check In and great place to stay
2023-03-01,5,Stayed one night,Great location and super easy check-in!

2022-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Alekz has turned an old motel into one of the best places to stay in the Soo. Communication was great. The space was very efficient and clean. We will be back!
2022-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,A very tastefully refurbished motel!
2022-11-01,4,Stayed with a pet,"Overall pleasant stay. Cutely furnished, with plenty of space. Bathroom storage/shelf space was fairly limited but worked ok. There is a bit of a damp smell when you first go in, but we pretty quickly acclimated to it. Good location, with quick access to anywhere in town you may be going."
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Such a cute and cozy place for a little getaway. The host was very quick with communication. Will definitely be staying here again in the future.
2022-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Great stay! Perfect for a couple. Bedroom was a little tight for our baby’s pack and play, but ended up moving it into the living room. Room was spotless and very clean."
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,It is close to stores and to town.
2022-10-01,5,Stayed with a pet,A nice step above a typical motel room for a good value. Very cute eclectic decor- two TVs and a comfortable queen bed. Close to downtown Soo. Easy self check in and we were able to access the room a couple hours earlier. Would highly recommend.
2022-10-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Good location for a quick trip. Pretty simple but had everything we needed.
2022-09-01,4,Stayed one night,"Clean place, with a vintage feel. Really nice to have just a bit more space than your average hotel room. We enjoyed having the living area separate from the bed room. Host was very responsive to messages, and was able to let us check in a little early which we really appreciated. The bed wasn’t very comfortable for us, but that could be personal preference. Overall a lovely stay. Nothing fancy, just clean, comfortable, and convenient."
2022-09-01,5,Stayed with a pet,We had a great stay! The place was as described and the location was perfect. Alekz is a wonderful host! She provided great information to enhance our trip and was easy to communicate with.
2022-09-01,4,Stayed one night,"The rooms were super cute and very clean. The outside of the motel/airbnb was a bit off-putting, but overall a very nice place to stay! The sheets were not the softest, but definitely the cleanest I've ever encountered in an airbnb or hotel. I also appreciated that they let you have full control over the thermostat in the room. I wished the couch was a bit more comfortable, but it was perfect for a one-night stay. I would definitely come back to stay again!"
2022-09-01,4,Stayed with a pet,"Artistically decorated rooms, convenient parking directly in front of unit, clean and comfortable. Unique conversion from an old motel, interested to follow their continued updates!"
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I recommend for the stay for sure
2022-09-01,5,Stayed one night,Very cute place to stay! We had a great experience.
2022-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"Alekz was so kind and did a great job of communicating. Their rehab of what was once an older, outdated motel is amazing! It has an adorable, modern bohemian vibe! The room included a small kitchenette, very comfortable bed and very nice furnishings! Check in was all contactless and went very smoothly. They made sure we had everything we needed. Very comfortable and reasonable. We would definitely stay again!"
2022-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"Such a sweet spot! Very clean, chic, and comfortable."
2022-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"Adorable decor, very clean and accurate listing. Very close to things to do in the area!"
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The motel turned into vacation rental is the cutest place I've been. They had a binder of before and after pictures. The work they put into the motel is amazing. I felt safe in the location and comfortable staying in their rental. It was super clean, organized, and everything was easily understandable with directions they provide. I was close to downtown, it's walkable or drivable. They provided a list of places you can go to and restaurants. 10/10 would rebook. I highly recommend booking with them."
2022-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"This was such a convenient place to stop on our road trip. We had a late night and early morning, and Alekz's place was perfect."
2022-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"We came up to see the Soo Locks on our way to the UP, and had a lovely evening and morning in the former motel. Great design, lovely personal touches, and very comfortable. We had one of the smaller rooms/suites and it was very useable for two, even though we both had to do some work late into the evening. Really perfectly located and just as advertised."
2022-08-01,5,Stayed one night,Super cute and clean! Right by downtown with plenty to do. The price is amazing as well!
2022-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This place is so cute, and was exactly what I was looking for on my beach trip with my dog to the UP. Check in was smooth and the location is close to downtown Sault Ste Marie. Would definitely stay here again!"
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Thank you Alekz for a great stay! We will definitely be back again.
2022-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"Really nice space, everything was really nice and cozy."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,SOO glad we found this place! I LOVE how they turned an old motel into a vacation rental. It looked just as the pictures on the listings. Super cute! Super clean! A true GEM!! I can’t wait to see the full potential of this place! We will definitely be back!
2024-06-01,5,Group trip,"Cabin was very cozy and clean, pictures were accurate-no surprises-Scott was very helpful throughout the process-highly recommend"
2024-06-01,5,Group trip,"I brought a group of my college students up for a documentary project and Scott's place was PERFECT. We were running around the EUP every day, but this peaceful cabin was the perfect place to stop in for lunch and for quick naps before we went on with our day.
At night, it was the perfect place for us to relax and hang out. My students loved the fire pit and the cozy accomodations, especially when the Northern lights were out during our first night! (Thanks for the heads up Scott!)
As for Scott, he was extremely communicative and helpful and has set up one of the most well-prepared vacation homes I've ever been to. The cabin had all of the basics, but had some great quality of life things stocked up (firewood, camp chairs, etc.) that made our trip easy and fun."
2024-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"There is not much more we can say. Hadn't been back in the area, since 1967, when we lived in Sault Ste Marie, with Tom's being in the U.S. Air Force, at Kincheloe A.F.B.. Got orders to go, overseas, in 1967. We celebrated our 58th wedding anniversary, on this visit. Can't wait to go back. --- Tom and Judy"
2024-03-01,5,Group trip,I love staying here thank you very much ☺️
2024-03-01,5,Group trip,I will stay with you again I loved my stay very quiet and nice place thank you for being aware
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Lovely cabin, beautiful property and great communication from the owner. We had everything we could want and would happily return in the future!"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a great time and look forward to staying at this location again. The host was very responsive to any communication and very accommodating. Thank you, Scott. We look forward to our next stay."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We absolutely loved our stay in Dafter, and can't wait to return. Scott is quite possibly the best host we've worked with (this was our first Airbnb stay, but we've used VRBO extensively). He was kind and very helpful (all via text), but totally gave us our space to enjoy the cabin. The bunkroom was a HUGE hit with our 6-year old, and the woodstove (which is an option, there's also baseboard heat if preferred) made everything extra cozy. We look forward to our next stay!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Had an amazing time, the cabin and surrounding woods were beautiful and peaceful, the rental was fully stocked, and the couches and beds were very comfortable."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very clean and beautiful place.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Super clean, super cozy, super private! Cottage with log cabin interior and massive wood burning stove sits on 200 walkable acres. We slept in, made a fire, drank coffee, sat on the deck, walked the trails and generally relaxed. Twenty minutes to the Soo Locks. House is very well stocked, communication was a breeze. Will definitely be back!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Great place to stay, clean and quite. Located in the middle of all the good boat ramps in the area. Great Host that works with you in any way he can.
We will stay there again!!!
Thank you
Scott"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,Exceeded our expectations! Welcoming and cozy. We had everything we could have needed. We stayed at two cabins when we we’re vacationing to the UP and this one was by far better than the other.
2023-09-01,5,Group trip,"This cabin is very cozy. So nice and quiet, clean and Scott was great about responding to questions. I would love to go back some day."
2023-09-01,5,Group trip,"Overall, it was a really great stay. Our whole group had a very nice time. the cabin was well stocked and clean. It would be nice if there was a way to keep the cabin cooler during the day, and there were a lot of flies. However, these were very minor in comparison to all the great amenities in the cabin. All in all, I would definitely recommend this cabin for anyone looking to stay in this area."
2023-08-01,5,Group trip,Scott’s place is everything he promises in the description & more. We had an amazing family trip. We went to nearby Sault St Marie & enjoyed a boat trip through the locks. We hiked the trails on the property. We had a bonfire & played corn hole (provided by host). The place was very clean & inviting with firewood & chairs provided. We also played board games that were provided. My adult children drove to whitefish point at night to rock hunt & found some yooper lights. On the way home we checked out the state park in Brimley which was very nice also. I like the close proximity of everything to this air bnb. The kitchen was very well stocked. We didn’t lack any tools to make our meals. Would recommend this 10/10 & would love to return one day. It is truly a place of nature & solitude & you leave feeling mentally rested & relaxed.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,our stay was amazing it was peaceful and tranquil I would highly recommend staying here.Scott was amazing as well
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"A wonderful place to stay! Our kids thought the bunk beds were a delight and the space was lovely. We had a fire and the host had all the supplies (chairs, marshmallow pockers, and even had the supplies for s’mores ready). I would definitely stay there again."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Scott's cabin was immaculate. The photos and description don't do it justice - perfect for our family getaway. It is obviously well maintained, clean, well supplied with games and movies, kitchen utensils, shampoo/soaps etc.
Only 20 minutes from the Soo and 45 from Mackinac ferries, the location for us was ideal.
We had a small issue with a slow draining sink and Scott was responsive within 20 minutes offering to have a plumber come out or reimburse us for some draino. Exactly the response you'd want from a host.
Our kids did great in the bunk room. One note if you travel with an infant- there is no room in the bedroom for a pack-n-play. You could fit a narrow bassinet between the bed and the wall, or put a pack-n-play in the bunk room (or large linen closet next to the bedroom..who are we to judge 😉).
We had to cut our trip a day short, but we will be back to visit again in the future. Scott's cabin will be our new home base on the east side of the UP."
2023-07-01,5,Group trip,We rent multiple airbnbs each year and this was one of the best ones we’ve rented. The kitchen well stocked and his house had everything our group of 6 needed. Would definitely stay again!
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,Scott was great! Loved the place!
2023-07-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Scott is the perfect host, great with communication and very hospitable. His place was lovely, private, comfortable, clean and homey. We enjoyed being together as a family after a very busy several months-we played games, watched movies, laughed and ate. We were really hoping to see some wildlife while we were here and much to our surprise and delight, we got to see a great horned owl enjoy a meal right in the backyard for several hours one day! We had a perfect experience at Scott’s cabin-do yourself a favor and book a stay! We hope to return in the future!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"we came up to scatter my Grandmother's ashes in the lake. Everything was beautiful. I couldn't have asked for a more helpful host. Even when my niece locked us out. Scott had us back in literally 10-15 mins.
Heads up to other guest. Bring something for the mosquitos but that can't be helped in the woods. still a 5⭐ spot."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,Scott was the best host I've ever encountered using the App. He was extremely responsive to my questions. He knew my family and I were going to do outside activities on Friday and he sent me a screenshot of a storm coming in. We waited until after the storm to go out and I'm glad we did. The house looks way better in person than in the photos. They had literally thought of everything right down to bug spray and sunblock! I plan on visiting again in the fall.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Well-stocked and clean, convenient location, excellent and responsive host. Depending on when you plan your visit, keep the mosquitos in mind!"
2023-06-01,5,Group trip,"Beautiful place! Very quiet and peaceful area, but not too far away from the city. We had a great time!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,Perfect place to stay felt like home!
2023-06-01,4,Group trip,"The Cabin was very spacious with lots of beds for family to sleep. The property was beautiful and very peaceful. The only issues we had were the mosquitoes. The mosquitoes were thick and made it tough to spend time outside fireside or just walking to and from car to house. The second draw back was the grill is in need of replacing. Otherwise, i couldn't have asked for a better rental."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed about a week,"If you’d like to get the true feeling and experience of what the UP of Michigan is, then Scott’s cabin is your place! Quiet, surrounded by woods, secluded and yet close for a variety of great day trips! Scott’s cabin is exactly as pictured and has all comforts for your stay! Thanks for having us & hope to return one day!
Ann & Bill"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful cabin nestled in the woods. Very comfortable and clean. Really enjoyed our stay and can’t wait to come back.
2023-04-01,5,Group trip,"The cabin was absolutely perfect for my weekend hunting trip with my friends and family. The house was neat, clean, and honestly the best Airbnb I’ve stayed in. Scott made sure we arrived alright and made it clear that he was there if we needed anything. I highly recommend Scott and this place to everyone."
2023-04-01,5,Group trip,This place is amazing! It's close enough that you can easily get supplies from town but far enough away to feel secluded from the business of life!
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,Our family had a great time relaxing in the UP. This place is beautiful and peaceful. The host was very helpful and responsive. I am definitely marking this place as a favorite
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had to go to the UP for a funeral and Scott’s cabin was everything our family needed it to be. The cabin is beautifully decorated along with being very practical—it is equipped with all of the amenities needed for coziness and comfort. The kitchen is the most well equipped of any Airbnb we have ever stayed in. The wood burning stove was a definite plus (with very clear instructions provided on how to use it.)
Every room with a window has a beautiful view. The atmosphere is one of peaceful tranquility—just perfect for us during this time.
Scott is a wonderful host. He went above and beyond our expectations in so many ways and we can’t thank him enough for all of his kindness. We definitely hope to come back."
2023-03-01,5,Group trip,Stayed at scotts for our snowmobile trip. And couldn't have been happier honestly the nicest airbnb i have ever stayed at. Will definitely be booking again
2023-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,"My family loved staying here while I was in town for work. Very secluded and beautiful. Kids loved the winter wonderland! The wood burning fireplace with stocked woodshed was above and beyond. Overall a great, slow-paced week. Scott was very helpful and responsive. He made sure our stay was exactly what we’d hoped for."
2023-02-01,5,Group trip,Had a great time. Beautiful cabin in a beautiful setting and close to attractions
2023-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Everything was perfect! The cabin was clean, well organized, and had everything we needed. Scott was a great communicator and made sure we had a comfortable stay. The location was beautiful and private. I highly recommend!"
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful cabin set back in the woods. If you love pine trees you will fall in love with the surroundings. The cabin is so much better in person. Everything you need is readily available. The host is very responsive. We took our sleds up for snowmobiling, and there was plenty of parking for the trailer. While we weren't able to ride from cabin to trails (not enough snow), there are numerous trails close by to trailer them to! This cabin does not disappoint."
2023-01-01,5,Group trip,Supernice place. Scott was awesome with all the helpfulness. Will definitely be staying again.
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was our first Airbnb experience and we could not have been more pleased. The pictures were accurate with one pleasant exception. When we got there we were excited and surprised to find a Christmas tree in the living room. The house was stocked and perfect for our quiet getaway from the world. Scott's communication was great. We asked permission and enjoyed snowshoeing around the trails on the property. We would definitely go back for another stay and have highly recommended it for others.
One thing to point out: There is one bathroom and it has a glass shower door. Keep that in mind if you generally like a little more privacy and use the bathroom area while someone is showering."
2022-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,This place is even cozier and cuter than in the pictures! Spent Christmas here with family from down south and it was the best Christmas we’ve had since I was kid. I could go on about how wonderful our stay was but I’m not going to. I highly recommend this AirBnb any time of year there’s something to do.
2022-12-01,5,Group trip,"Great communication, the cabin was very cozy and looked like the pictures. We had plenty of all the necessities. I would definitely come here again!"
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Very Quiet, very clean, very comfortable. Highly recommended - great place to stay!"
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Another fantastic stay. Looking forward to next year!
2022-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Scott’s place is the perfect getaway, it is close enough to do fun day trips like white fish point but private enough for a break to unwind and enjoy nature. We were able to see the Milky Way and tons of stars. The house has everything we needed to enjoy our stay and make unforgettable memories with our kids. Scott was easy to work with and available if we needed anything. We hope to visit again soon! If you’re heading up to the UP this is a MUST STAY! Thank you Scott for allowing us to enjoy your house."
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Scott's place is perfect for us.
Can't wait to get back again.
Scott is great to deal with too"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,The cabin is even better than the pictures show. Beautiful setting. Great trails. Every detail thought of and more. Look forward to staying again sometime!
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The cabin was super comfortable and had everything we needed. The woodburning stove was awesome for the cold and wet October nights. Cozy Corners was a great recommendation with great food and ambiance (very cool when the freighter went by on the river). Great jumping off point for day trips to Tahquamenon Falls and into Sault Ste Marie. Truly a terrific cabin.
2022-10-01,5,Group trip,"Place was very tidy and clean, had a great stay!"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Awesome cabin with great amenities, great layout, very cozy! Will definitely keep this place in mind when returning to the UP!"
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Wonderful property. Due to unreliable cellular service, it was a bit of a challenge to locate, but Scott was more than helpful and assisted in getting us there safely. Anything and everything you could think of, Scott has already taken care of. The cabin is clean, comfortable, peaceful and quiet…just what we needed, and a quick drive outside of Sault Ste. Marie makes the location convenient. There is a nice little water front park at the end of the road that is great for star gazing and catching the Northern Lights on a clear night."
2022-09-01,5,Group trip,A beautiful cabin on a great piece of property. Excellent location for hunting or exploring. Scott was a fantastic host.
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My wife & I loved staying at Scott’s cabin in Dafter, MI recently for a mini vacation. We were looking for a place that was secluded, but also in close proximity to Sault Ste Marie and other points of interest in the U.P. This was the perfect spot. The cabin was on 200 acres of land and was absolutely beautiful and quiet. It was everything we wanted and needed for an incredible vacation. We are already looking to book another vacation at Scott’s cabin for later this fall. Can’t wait to stay at this wonderful cabin again soon!"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,The cabin was perfect. My grandchildren loved the bunks . We are already planning a return trip.
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Perfect secluded location for exploring the U.P. Fishing close by at Dunbar Park. 20 minutes to get into Sault St. Marie. Well provisioned kitchen, lots of towels, sheets, books, dvd movies & and everything else we needed."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The cabin is a peaceful, secluded property right near the Dunbar park and boat launch and just minutes from the Kozy. The campfire pit and well-stocked woodshed had us out around the fire quite a few times and really bumps up the place from good to Great. This was our second time in the cabin and it's high on our list to stay at again. Comfy bunk beds, and just enough space for everyone to feel like they're camping, but with some great amenities :)"
2022-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Really great cabin. Spotlessly clean, and very well appointed."
2022-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,It was wonderful!!!
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I would reccomend this cabin to anyone who wants a prime spot to camp and hang out or run around and play tourist and come back to a beautiful log cabin with everything including wifi, netflix, laundry you name it, Scott has it there."
2022-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This was the by far one the best places I’ve ever stayed. A great place for families to make memories, and close to any tourist locations you’d want to visit up there. Absolutely perfect. Thank you so much!"
2022-05-01,5,Group trip,200% recommend such a nice and cozy place to relax
2022-04-01,5,Stayed about a week,Fantastic host. Quick to respond to all of my questions prior to booking. The first night there we couldn't get the TV to work and he was very quick to call me and walk me through it. The cabin was very clean and equipped with so much morw than you would ever find at any other rental. My husband and I loved the seclusion and being able to relax and unwind in the evenings. I really can't think of anything we weren't happy with. I would love to see this property closer to Paradise and Whitefish Point as that is the area we really love the most. I knew that before booking though so nothing against the rental. we thought we would stay in Dafter and that would allow us to explore the other direction and head toward Drummond Island and surrounding areas. All in all a good central location to venture in different directions everyday. I would without a doubt highly recommend this rental to anyone.
2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great location for a getaway! The cabin was well supplied with everything we needed. It was clean and well maintained. Planning to go back.
2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful cabin just far enough out of town for some relaxation and peace and quiet but also close enough to town for local amenities. Had a great time and will likely book again in the future.
2022-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,Great getaway place! will definitely come back.
2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This is clean and cozy. Wood burner and wrap porch made it extra cozy. We loved the Outpost and will be checking availability for future adventures
2022-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was our second stay here and it won’t be our last! We cannot say enough wonderful things about this cabin or Scott! The location is perfect, close enough to grab things you need yet secluded so you can fully appreciate the beauty that is the UP. The cabin has everything you could think of so packing was very light. Cannot wait to book our next trip here!"
2022-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Perfect stay in the upper peninsula! Cabin well organized, just as described, and is an excellent place to get back to nature. Close enough to Sault St Marie, isolated enough to allow you to experience Pure Michigan."
2022-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"No regrets in spontaneously booking this cozy cabin for a snowmobiling trip. Great hosts! The wood stove was awesome! Privately located with beautiful views. We were able to go see Mackinac Island, Tahquamenon Falls (Upper Falls is a must see! and I recommend checking out the Brewery and Pub there), Sault Ste. Marie.. Neebish Island is a few miles away with a restaurant/bar called Cozy Corners. House is stocked with dishes, towels, all the basics for cooking meals, blankets, wood. You won’t want to leave!!!!!"
2022-02-01,5,Group trip,"Book it! This was a return trip for us. Super cozy cabin in the woods. Amazingly clean, well stocked with anything you would ever need and the host is great! You won’t be disappointed."
2022-01-01,5,Stayed about a week,It was very nice
2022-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Clean and Cozy!! Very well stocked, everything we needed and more. Beautiful property. Close to shopping and freeways yet secluded."

2021-12-01,5,Group trip,The cabin was fantastic. great communication. wonderful location. will book again
2021-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This cabin is breathtaking. It exceeded our expectations and was worth every penny! Scott is a wonderful host and was quick to respond to messages and answered questions about the area.
Staying in this cabin gives you the true experience of the beauty that is the UP. To sit next to a crackling fireplace while watching the snow fall after having our Thanksgiving dinner was a memory our family will cherish forever. We cannot wait to book Scott’s cabin again!"
2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is the fourth time that we have been lucky enough to stay here, and it is a tremendous value, well-appointed, a short trip to the Sault and so peaceful."
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"If you want a clean, Secluded but close to everything cabin this place is perfect. I would like to rent this again in the near future. Absolutely AMAZING!"
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We were in Michigan to look at a school for my daughter. This place is awesome!!! Clean, beautiful area, not too far from town. If my daughter is there next year for school I’m planning to try and stay here again when we visit her. 😁"
2021-10-01,5,Group trip,"Awesome place to stay for a getaway in the up, have rented this place twice now and highly recommend this place for anyone's getaway"
2021-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The cabin is secluded in a beautiful and remote forest. Scott did not forget any amenity, everything you could need and then some is available. Stayed there with my wife and 4 boys ages 5,3,2 and 5 months old. Plenty of beds. We did all the tourist things within an hours or so drive and relaxed and enjoyed the great trails on the property. Short drive to Sault Saint Marie too, very nice place to decompress."
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Our stay at Scott's place was great. The cabin was impeccably clean and well-stocked. Everything was very comfortable and Scott responded quickly to all of my messages.
2021-09-01,5,Stayed about a week,Scott is a great host and this cabin will exceed your expectations for a remote cabin experience
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,super calming atmosphere! enjoyed driving around and finding new places to stop off and see the waters. take advantage of the ferry and island hopping!
2021-09-01,5,Group trip,The cabin and property were amazing. The pictures online do not do it justice. It was very peaceful and relaxing.
2021-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"My family enjoyed our stay in this beautiful cabin. This place had everything that we needed.
We wish we stayed a little longer. We will definitely come back. Thank you Scott"
2021-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Scott is a fantastic host! This cabin has everythingyou will ever need! extra blankets, flashlights, all the cooking necessities plus spices and basics provided, very clean, beautifuldeck with 2 diff seating areas, plus the propane grill, fire pit area is perfect. the property is wonderfully secluded yet a city with pretty much everything you need 15 min away! so glad we found this paradise in the woods and hope to come back through all the seasons and continueto use it as a basecamp for adventures! Would be perfect to never even leave the property"
2021-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,Amazing host!! I would recommend this Airbnb to all! The house and location were the perfect UP get away. Loved our experience!!
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We enjoyed our stay, using the cabin as a base camp. We left each day to discover the UP. Scott was in contact via texts prior to our departure and assured us he would be available during our stay if needed, which we did not have any issues. The cabin is exactly as described and as the pictures show."
2021-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Beautiful cabin. Secluded, but not too secluded. :) Clean, quiet and the owner was great with communication!"
2021-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We spent 4 nights in this amazing cabin in the woods! The cabin and grounds were well kept. Attention to detail was very obvious in every aspect of the cabin...from extra fans, blankets, flour and bug spray, etc! My family had an awesome time exploring the woods and local attractions. Scott was very attentive to communicating check-in and seeing if we needed anything. A+ experience, thank you Scott!!"
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"A beautiful secluded cabin in the UP woods. The beautiful pine paneling is warm and homey. There are many up to date conveniences such as laundry, Wi-Fi (important with the limited cell phone coverage in the area), charging stations. A cute coffee bar area, helps to reduce congregation in the kitchen. There is a outdoor grill and patio area. We were lucky to be there when the weather was perfect and the mosquitos were nonexistent, so outdoor time was very enjoyable. There are games, movies and other nice extras. We were only there a long weekend, and mostly to sleep so we did not use many of the options we could have."
2021-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Great home base for exploring the eastern half of the UP. The fire pit and space for the kids to run around outside. Games, books and movies for rainy days (not that we had any.). It was the perfect place to rest between exploring different parts of the upper peninsula."
2021-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,Loved the cabin. Peaceful. We are hoping to stay again.
2021-06-01,5,Group trip,Nice cabin
2021-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,Beautiful cabin!! We will definitely return!!
2021-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This place was amazing! Scott was a gracious host and was attentive and checked in to make sure we were enjoying our time and had everything we needed. This cabin has everything to make you feel at home. Close enough to popular area attractions (Munising, Taquamenon Falls, Sault Ste. Marie, Whitefish Point) but yet completely secluded. The property is beautiful and quiet, and you are surrounded by the sounds of nature. This place is truly a gem and we were not disappointed. We will definitely be back. Do yourself a favor and check it out!"
2021-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Great secluded getaway. Very quiet. Cabin has all furnishings a family could need, cookware, linens, games/movies."
2021-06-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Great rural setting with lots of wildlife including the resident black bear walking down the driveway one morning, the cabin is very clean and organized and the check in process is great."
2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Our stay at this cabin was great! Cabin and property were even better than the pictures. We couldn’t have asked for a better host than Scott. He went above and beyond to make our trip great. Cabin was very clean and very well stocked with paper towel, Saran Wrap, coffee filters, etc. very comfortable and private property perfect for a UP getaway."
2021-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,Looked good online-better in person!!
2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay with all the amenities of home.
2021-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,What a wonderful cabin! The property itself was absolutely gorgeous with so much to explore. The inside of the cabin exceeded any expectations we had and was much more homely and comforting then the pictures lead on. Scott answered within minutes whenever we had a question and was super helpful. Overall we had an amazing stay!
2021-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Very clean and welcoming. You’re minutes from the city life of Sault Ste Marie but yet in the middle of nothing if you choose to be. It was better than expected based on the pictures.
We don’t want to say too much good because it will become a MUST stay for the world instead of the lucky few who find this gem!"
2021-03-01,5,Group trip,Would highly recommend a stay at this cabin! Very cozy on beautiful land.
2021-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,This was a wonderful place with amazing amenities. A great northern getaway!!
2021-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,This cabin is amazing!! Much nicer than we had expected!! Absolutely loved the way the bunk room is designed with personal light for each bunk with a shelf! Everything was beautiful from the handmade curtains/bedspreads to the wood burning stove that we looked forward to each evening after snowmobiling! Scott was super accommodating & with super quick responses when needed! Woukd stay here in a heartbeat again❤️
2021-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,Scott was extremely responsive. The house was great. Our kids really enjoyed the bunk bed room!! Great place to enjoy the winter weather. Can't wait to try it during a different season!!
2021-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Just an all around great place to stay. Very clean and cozy home!
2021-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Scott texted us on our check-in date to let us know the cleaning crew had done their thing, the house was ready for us and made sure we had the passcode to the door and contact info in case we had any issues with it.
We arrived later than we expected because we left later than expected so it was dark when we arrived. Our Garmin GPS was off on the address by about 500 feet, Apple and Google Maps are spot on by the way. Everything began to get better as soon as we pulled in to the driveway.
There are motion activated outdoor lights so if you arrive in the dark like we did you'll have plenty of lighting to navigate the unfamiliar terrain. The keypad to unlock the door was easy enough to use so we didn't have any issue with that.
You walk into a breezeway or mudroom with plenty of hooks to hand up everyone's jackets, shelves for your hats and gloves and mats for your boots. There is also a washer and dryer in this room and a washtub to wash off your boots when you get mud on them. We didn't use the washtub but it's nice to know it was there.
There is an insulated door that separates the mudroom from the rest of the house which takes you to the kitchen. The kitchen table has enough chairs to seat 8 people. Everything in the kitchen was very clean. The refrigerator was empty but cool, ready for food. The electric stove was nice. There were labels on kitchen shelves which helps to remember were things go back if you use them all up, say drinking glasses for instance.
The living room has two couches and two recliner chairs along with a TV with DirecTV and a DVD player. There was a nice selection of DVD's and books. And what our kids thought was the best part, the wood stove. Thankfully wood for the stove is provided and is easily accessible from an insulated door in the living room. This is a vestibule that contains just the wood for the stove and has another door leading to the outside.
There is one bedroom with 8 bunkbeds which are much larger than I imagined. All of our kinds are late teens, early 20's except for one so they are pretty big. They all thought they were comfortable.
The master bedroom has a comfy queen sized bed with a cozy comforter. All of the beds had sheets and blankets and were ready for someone to just hop in.
The bathroom... well, what can I say? It has a sink a toilet and a shower. :)
Oh, and almost forgot to mention the whole place is wood, the floors and and the walls. Absolutely spectacular.
The view out all the windows is nothing but woods with occasional wildlife so if you get tired of admiring the beauty of this house then just look out the window.
This house is more than just a place to hang your hat in the evening, it adds to the vacation and will be pretty high in the things we talk about."
2021-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Scott was timely in his communication, the cabin had everything we needed, and the setting was beautiful and could be enjoyed in any season. Our children enjoyed the cozy bunk bed spaces. We were extremely happy with our stay and would recommend it for others."
2020-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Scott's cabin in the woods is a great option for anyone looking for a comfy getaway in the Upper Peninsula. We were there with a few inches of snow on the ground and had a blast exploring the outdoors with our two little kids, making snow forts, sledding, etc."
2020-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The cabin was cozy, gorgeous, and super clean. Beautiful and quiet area."
2020-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"A must if traveling in Michigan’s eastern upper peninsula. Clean, cozy, quiet, super well stocked and organized. We spent a long November weekend at this serene spot. Enjoyed the large property and the easy access to all the UP has to offer. Scott was one of the best and most responsive hosts I’ve dealt with. If you are looking for a quiet spot to relax or a base camp for excursions around the eastern UP you can’t go wrong."
2020-10-01,5,Group trip,"Quiet, clean, and comfortable. If you need a space to get away for a while and enjoy everything the nature of Michigan’s Upper Peninsula has to offer, this is the place!"
2020-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Scott's cabin is absolutely beautiful, always quick to respond thoughtfully on local activities, amenities, and anything you need. The property is perfect, and we want to come back again and again. Excellent place to stay, extremely clean."
2020-10-01,5,Group trip,"Awesome place to stay, can't beat the price and the expectations of the seclusion of the cabin"
2020-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The cabin was awesome in a beautiful secluded location! It was fully stocked with every thing we ever needed and beautifully organized and decorated!
Looking forward to staying there again!"
2020-09-01,5,Stayed about a week,"This place is truly awesome. Came up for a week long fishing trip on the St. Mary’s river and it easily accommodated five of us including our 4 bass boats. We were only 1 mile from a nice boat launch. The house is spotless and we were able to utilize a huge pole barn for rigging and maintenance of our boats. Scott is a super host, a super good guy, was incredibly responsive and was even willing to come up and show us around the gorgeous and expansive St. Mary’s River. Cannot say enough good things about the house, the setting and the location and will definitely be coming back."
2020-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The perfect getaway. The house was spotless and fully equipped with everything we could possibly need. Scott was responsive and checked in with us multiple times throughout our stay. Can’t wait to stay again!
2020-09-01,5,Group trip,Great place
2020-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,This was my first time using Airbnb. It was amazing. Scott is a great host and made things easy for us. The house was spacious and absolutely perfect. I couldn't have chose a better place to stay.
2020-08-01,5,Group trip,"This cabin is the perfect place to be based when you want to explore the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. Tucked in the wilderness, it was close enough to the Big Mac bridge towns and Sault Ste. Marie. Be sure to take the Lakeshore Drive along Lake Superior. Scott is a great host. He runs a very clean space. Highly recommend it."
2020-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,Great little cabin that my family loved spending our vacation at. Quick responses to any questions we had.
2020-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place was a great value and one of the best Airbnb’s that I’ve ever stayed at. It was only about an hour from Mackinaw, 20 minutes from the Soo, and about two hours from Pictured Rocks. We loved cooking dinner on the grill and sitting on the patio in the evening after our excursions. The inside was clean and there were so many thoughtful amenities."
2020-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This is the perfect cabin for some time away. All the amenities you could possibly need and great options for outdoor activities in the area. 10/10
2020-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This was our second time, and we loved every minute of it."
2020-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,This place is quiet and a lovely place to stay!
2020-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"If you are looking for a quiet and secluded place to relax and enjoy nature, then this is the perfect place for you and your family. Scott is an amazing host. He is very friendly, helpful and will respond to any question you may have right away. His place provides everything you may need and more. We enjoyed every single moment we stayed there. It’s a beautiful place, very nice and clean too. We highly recommend it."
2020-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"You can expect the most clean and cute cabin in the woods! Very well stocked from paper towels, corn hole, camp chairs and marshmellow roasting sticks."
2020-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful cabin and area. We loved our stay. Scott was quick with responses.
2020-03-01,5,Group trip,"Scott was a great host and was quick to respond to any and all questions. The cabin was great, check in was easy, and the place was stocked with anything we needed. The bunk room was perfect, and there is a nice wood stove in the living room with a drying rack above it to hang your gear on. The wood room was also well stocked and we had use of a nice sized garage. However, the driveways were too tight to turn a small trailer and the closest groomed snowmobile trail was about a 15 min ride down the roads, which wasn’t ideal for 8 snowmobilers. Thanks again to Scott for a great stay and being a great host."
2020-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Scott’s cabin was great! Extremely clean, easy to access, has lots of area information, and was really cool in general. He was very responsive with every question and truly cared about our experience. We had a great time!"
2020-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,What a great host and a great property.
2020-02-01,5,Group trip,The pictures don’t do this cabin justice. Such a pretty setting and a such a cozy place. We had a family weekend of snowmobiling and this was our home base. No detail was overlooked. The bunk bed room was nice and roomy (and made me feel like a kid again!). All we brought was our food and everything else was provided. The wood stove was super toasty after we got back from some frigid rides. Will be back again for sure!
2020-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,A beautiful cabin in Michigan’s Upper Penninsula. Very clean and awesome cabin. Highly recommend
2020-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"House has a bright, open and comfortable layout. Well-stocked/amenities. A super private setting. Scott is quick to reply when you have questions. We would stay here again."
2020-01-01,5,Group trip,Great place to stay! Scott was a great host. Responds quickly to any questions or concerns. Cabin is stocked with everything you need. Had a great time!
2019-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,"If you like what you see in the photos and the listing description, multiply it by 10 and that's how it is in real life. This so far surpassed our expectations. It was a beautiful, quiet cabin covered in snow. It was a magical Christmas experience like our family (who lives in the South) has never experienced. I couldn't recommend this any more to people."
2019-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,Fantastic cabin the U.P. woods with everything you need for a relaxing getaway with the family!
2019-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,What a fantastic place to stay! Place was beautiful and it had everything you needed. Scott was so easy to communicate with. We’ll be staying there in the future.
2019-10-01,5,Group trip,Scott had this place looking great and FULLY stocked with tons of great amenities. Perfect location and great atmosphere.
2019-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Absolutely amazing!
2019-09-01,5,Group trip,"If you're looking for a place to relax and explore, book this cabin! It's 180 acres of your own to enjoy, but ""Cozy Corners"" is less than 5 minutes away for dinner and drinks. There are grocery options in different directions, around a 15-20 minute drive.
The cabin was SPOTLESS. It was fully stocked with clean towels, sheets, blankets, bathroom amenities, kitchen essentials, a coffee bar, games/movies. The bunk beds were great and VERY comfortable. Three adults used the bunk room and were surprised how private each bed felt. We didn't expect the mattresses to be comfortable, but we were all very pleased and woke up refreshed.
It has so many extras, too- you really feel at home. The only thing I wish I'd brought was a travel mug of my own, since we decided to take some daily excursions. Honestly, we didn't need/want anything extra- just our own clothes and groceries.
The owners are great at communicating before and during the stay, and the smart lock is very easy to use.
Make an outdoor fire, some s'mores, and take in the stars at the cabin. If you enjoy hiking, enjoy their trails.
While staying, consider taking some drives. Canada was only 30 minutes away. PLEASE visit the Breakfast Pig for brunch and the Queen's Tarts for a treat to take home. Thompson's Strawberry Farm is adorable and a MUST for wine tasters. The SOO Locks were interesting to see for the water and history lovers.
About an hour and a half East- Oswald's Bear Ranch is home to 39 very happy bears. Bonus, you can feed them apples and take a picture with a cub! We combined this with an additional 30 minute drive North to Tahquamenon Falls. The Upper Falls were so impressive and humbling. The falls are handicapped accessible, but also allow for many hiking trails. We stopped for views of Lake Superior on the drive back to the cabin.
Macinac City and Island are a fun experience- about 45 minutes south of the cabin.
On our way back to the land of the Trolls (ha!), we stopped by Bronner's for all things Christmas and the Bavarian Inn for a Chicken Dinner in Frankenmuth.
A giant thank you to the owners of the cabin. This vacation was very special for my family, and we will never forget our memories and how you played a role."
2019-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This cabin is a perfect little haven to stay at. Down a quiet dirt road with a pretty setting, it was just what we needed to get away to for a few days."
2019-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,We had a wonderful stay at this place. The House was amazingly clean and well equipped. We would love to come back!
2019-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Just a great cottage! A true UP experience. Amazing touches, better than we could have expected!"
2019-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My husband said he thinks he died and went to U.P. heaven!!! Scott’s cabin is amazing!!! Everything was as described and even better. Check-in and check-out was super easy and convenient.
The location is perfect for day trips around the eastern and middle part of the U.P. Also, very peaceful and quiet.
Scott made sure we had everything we needed to make our mini vacation a success. The amenities are amazing!
We highly recommend Scott’s place... book quickly, the availability calendar will fill up!"
2019-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Very nice secluded cabin that was well stocked with everything you need. Myself, wife, 3 daughters (ages 7, 5, & 3), and 7 month old son enjoyed the piece and relaxation of the north woods. We were a short drive to the Soo, Mackinac, and St. Ignace after morning fishing on the rivers and bays. You can spend a day at Tahquamenon Falls or Pictured Rocks. If you just want to relax then sit outside around a campfire making s’mores while enjoying some corn hole or ladder golf, or take in the sounds of nature and the fresh smell of the northern air. The girls loved having us all stay in the bunk room, and were very happy there was a private bedroom so grandma and grandpa could join us for the last couple of days. All linens were provided and having a washer and dryer were a huge bonus.
The communication was very prompt and the host provided exceptional local information. We are looking forward to another trip and hope this cabin is available when booking."
2019-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"Wonderful people to work with, quick responses and the house was everything and more from the description. Definitely would love to come back in the future."
2019-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"There is so much to recommend this location. You are close to St Ignace and Sault Ste. Marie, but truthfully my family would have been happy just staying in the cabin if the weather had not been so perfect. There were games and DVDs books etc. It was just awesome, and we hope to go back again sometime soon."
2019-08-01,5,Group trip,"Scott has this place STOCKED. He had giant bottles of shampoo, plenty of towels, ten+ lawn chairs, marshmallow skewers, plenty of toiletries, dishes, and pretty much everything and anything you could think of. The cabin stays cool at night and each room is equipped with either a ceiling fan or standup fans. The cabin was immaculate and although there was only one bathroom, it was spacious, clean, and fully stocked. The fire pit is a great addition and there’s a nice patio for grilling (brand new beautiful grill btw) and outdoor seating. There is ample parking and both an entryway/exit driveway. The sleeping arrangements were comfortable—everyone in the bunks were impressed with the individual lighting, hooks, and shelves in the each bunk. There were these charging stations that could charge five phones at once that saved our lives. The cabin was stocked with firewood for campfires and the indoor stove. Thank you Scott for your hospitality, your cabin is now part of our favorite summer memories!"
2019-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"Book now, you will not be disappointed!! This place is amazing. Wonderful location after my family spent the day in the UP finishing with the soo locks before arriving to the cabin. It is stocked with every possible thing that you may need for your stay and so much more! There is love in this space with little added touches everywhere you look! My children loved the bunk bed room so much, they were in heaven. The host is amazing and has everything down pat. Our arrival and stay was perfect with NO problems. In this cabin you can enjoy nature and your loved ones and this beautiful space for memories that will last!!!"
2019-07-01,5,Stayed about a week,"We stayed here for a fishing tournament on the St. Mary’s River. Cabin was clean, spacious and Scott was a great host. Highly recommend"
2019-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,The Upper Peninsula at its best! Warm and gracious host that has thought of everything you would need. Location is perfect and peaceful.
2019-07-01,5,Group trip,"If you are looking for a hunting cabin, or just a quiet place to relax, this is the place. You can comfortably sleep 12 people. Its very roomy, very peaceful. There is a very cute park just down the road you can go fishing on the St. Marys River. Plenty of blankets, pillows and towels. 5 stars all the way. I can not say enough good things about this place!"
2019-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Scott’s cabin is wonderful! Located in a private, peaceful corner of the UP, it was a perfect place for some R&R and a base for exploring the region.
The amenities are so thoughtful and practical, and Scott is super easy to communicate with if anything is needed.
We followed his recommendation for the Cosy Corners Bar and Grill nearby and found it to be an excellent spot for a meal and some drinks.
Something that was notably better than any other Air BnB we have stayed at is the wifi. My brother in law was holidaying with us from Australia and works remotely. In other accommodation he hasn’t had enough service to reliably connect but this was no issue at all at Scott’s cabin. WiFi here is more than the token connection so it can be listed as an amenity. But then that’s true for the whole experience.
We will be back for sure!!"
2019-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This is a fantastic cabin property in the heart of Barbeau, right between Dunbar park/boat launch and the Cozy Cabin restaurant (and also the little country store). It's also just a quick 15 minute drive to get up into the Soo, and maybe 30 minute to buzz over to Brimley. Couldn't ask for a better location, with fantastic amenities included, that holds this number of people comfortably. We stayed here with 6 people - including a 2 and 6 year old, and had plenty of room to relax and comfortably sleep. The bunk room is awesome and the great room is super well furnished. We don't typically do a lot of camping, (and staying here really isn't hardcore camping), but it was a great mix of comfort and cabin-life for us. Scott had very attentive and well prepared communication with us and we're already planning our next trip to come back here!"
2019-07-01,5,Group trip,"Scott's place was immaculate! He goes above and beyond to make your stay nice with all the extras such as shampoo, conditioner, soap, lotion, detergent, paper towels, toilet paper, cooking spices, charging stations for our cell phones, etc. It was nice not to have to worry about packing things such as towels, sheets, and a hair dryer. There was even bug spray available if needed, but we had brought our own. Having a washer/dryer included was also a plus! Scott has everything you need to cook indoors and outdoors. There is also a nice firepit outside. The location was not bad at all. We spent a day at the Soo and it was only a 10-15 minute drive there. Nice place to eat about 3 miles away right on the water and Neebish Island. I would recommend this cabin to everyone. Although it only had one bathroom, we made it work and we enjoyed ourselves! Thanks again!"
2019-07-01,5,Group trip,"Such a great cabin! A Cozy, north woods atmosphere with modern amenities! We loved our time in the UP, and this cabin made our family time very special. Super clean and wonderfully stocked."
2019-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Great and quick communication with the host. Excellent amenities, loved the bunk bed setup. Unable to use the outdoors because of the mosquitoes so be prepared for that."
2019-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The cabin is amazing! Hunting/fishing lodge decor, many comfortable beds, and well-stocked with any item you may have forgotten to pack. 😁 The acreage is lush and peaceful. It must be stunning in the fall, and picturesque in the snow.
The hosts are so nice. They worked to accommodate us when we missed a flight and were delayed over 24 hours.
If we didn't live so far away, we would come back every year!"
2019-06-01,5,Group trip,"Me and a bunch of friends came to stay at Scott’s place for the weekend. The house looked much nicer and different in person. It’s got that rustic feeling, but with a very modern touch. Everyone was really amazed and it clearly exceeded our expectations. The house literally had to offer everything you’d need and much more. You really don’t have to bring anything extra with yourself other than your basic necessities. I would like to make one suggestion though and this is completely my own opinion and maybe for most it wouldn’t even matter, but the only thing that I felt was absent was a dishwasher. Again, that’s just me and it’s probably because I use it so much at my own house and even that it was available at all the other Airbnb’s I rented so far. Overall, it’s an excellent place to stay which offers completely privacy also. I would definitely recommend!"
2019-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Great spot and so easy to check in and get comfortable right away. Had everything we needed, including a cozy fire in June! Would come back in a heartbeat. Wish we'd stayed longer."
2019-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We stayed at Scott’s place and it was awesome. Real close to a lot of rivers and bodies of water to fish. The cabin is modern and has everything you need for a get away. My group of 4 had plenty of space to sleep and plenty to keep us busy exploring the property. Only suggestion is make sure you have bug spray you are up north.
2019-06-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Very centrally located for traveling around the states side of the Sault St. Marie water system. Close to the city, with a gas station around the corner and boat launch just up the road. Very quiet place at night! Awesome place!"
2019-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"Scott thought of everything! From the fully stocked kitchen to the chairs to sit by the campfire.
The cabin was clean, fully stocked with anything you might need, and beautiful and quiet. I can’t wait to stay here again!!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I repeatedly stay at this location while traveling to the Soo for work or pleasure and as usual everything was as expected! Great location, responsive host , comfortable beds!"
2024-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What a wonder place to stay. We love the Soo and wished we had know. About this place sooner! Its location is close to two of our favorite places, Barish’s and Wicked sister! It was an awesome graduation weekend!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Danna’s loft was everything a person could ask for! The location was perfect, check-in and check-out was simple and easy, and the amenities were simply incredible. Not to mention, the loft was SPOTLESS! The place looks even better and more spacious than the pictures show. Anytime we find ourselves in the Soo, we will definitely check to make sure this place is available. Thanks again, Danna!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Danna is an excellent host and was quick to respond to messages. The loft was clean, the bedrooms were big, and there was plenty of amenities available. The location was great and had several restaurants nearby. We would definitely stay again if available. Thank you."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I stay at Danna’s place every time I visit the Soo. Convenient to most everything.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very clean. Comfortable beds. Spacious

It was really nice to have the washer and dryer to do laundry during our stay as well. Danna was helpful in offering some ideas of things to see in and around the Soo.

2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very clean and beautiful!
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is probably one of the most beautiful Airbnb's in which I have stayed, and I have stayed at many. It is comfortable, large and furnished so tastefully. The weather wasn't really cooperating while we were there so we did spend a fair amount of our time staying inside, which was no problem because it is such a cozy space. It is also within walking distance of all the great shops and restaurants that Sault Ste. Marie has to offer. I would highly recommend this airbnb to anyone who wants luxurious accommodations in this really neat little town."

2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was a very nice place to stay. Two couples agree, comfortable beds, clean apartment, heart of downtown so able to walk everywhere. Owners description of metal stairs to access apartment was spot on. Grateful we were told in advance or it could be a negative. Though for 4 seniors it was safe and not an issue.
Decor was very attractive, not surprising when we discovered the owner runs a lovely gift shop a short walk from the Loft.
Would definitely choose this place again."

We were there during a blizzard, the location was perfect. We were in town and felt safe in spite of the winter weather. The Loft was decorated for Christmas which made our Christmas just perfect.

2022-11-01,5,Group trip,"The circumstances that led us to rent the airbnb was sad due to a loss, the host, Danna was quick to respond to our needs. From the initial contacts with Danna which was primarily done via Airbnb to following house instructions she responded, in a timely manner.
The location was on the second floor. The loft filled all of our needs. It was a space where my family felt like it was their space, away from home. The loft offered my immediate family a time to reflect on memories and we continued as a family to build more memories.
Thank you."

Communication was excellent. Responses were clear, concise, professional, easy to follow with lots of kindness. Best customer service ever.
The beds were warm and comfortable. Having the kitchen starter kit was perfect for us. The Roku TV was just like at home and we started watching Virgin River.

2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The rental was very open and spacious – plenty of space – even more than the pictures showed. Kitchen was well stocked if you wanted to do some cooking. One of the cleanest rentals I've stayed at – was recently remodeled I think. Host was very responsive. Location was a quick walk to downtown. Hit Wicked Sister restaurant next door and Austin Cigar Lounge a few blocks away. Only cons are the stairs to get in are outside and are metal stairs/grates (necessary for snow I'm sure). Took some getting used to. There was a little traffic noise in the front bedroom – not at night, more in the morning during the week. Not a big deal for us, we were up early."

Located on a main thoroughfare, but road was quiet by bedtime. Convenient parking. Take extra caution on the metal stairwell up to the apartment. Host Danna was a great communicator. We weren’t used to the late sunset and early sunrise at this time of year, so the only thing we wished for was room darkening blinds in the bedrooms. Don’t hesitate to book, it’s worth it!"

2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This is a wonderful place to stay. Everything you need to feel right at home. The location is great. Only a short walk away from the Soo Locks and an even shorter walk from a grocery store. We will definitely be back.
2021-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Location was amazing. The place was super clean and decorated really well. Tons of supplies such as tp, pt, Kleenex, shampoo, conditioner, body wash, etc. There are plenty of spices and condiments that have been left to use. Meijer and Walmart close by for groceries. Beds and linens very comfortable. Loved having air conditioning and the ability to do laundry!! Two things to be aware of: you have to be careful of noise level during business hours because the apartment is over a store. And the steps to the second floor apartment are on the outside and they are metal with a large grate. We brought our two dogs that really struggled going up and down the stairs. Their feet would get caught in the holes and we had to carry them most of the time and they are not small and don’t love being picked up. Other than that we loved the place and would definitely go back or recommend to anyone!"
2021-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Excellent place to stay! Has everything you need. It is upstairs, so expect steps, but overall it's perfect."
2021-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,This place is really nice! Lots of room. Beautifully decorated. Would definitely stay again!
2021-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,Awesome place! Highly recommended.
2021-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We will for sure be back. This place was perfect for our family. It was very spacious, extremely clean, and included everything we could possibly need for our stay. It was an absolutely amazing experience."
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Danna's rental was beautiful, comfortable, clean and the perfect getaway. She was easy to contact, and provided great directions and easy access to the rental. I'd recommend any of her locations to anyone looking to stay in the Sault Ste. Marie area!"
2021-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Wonderful location and great space! Danna and Terry are wonderful hosts, and very responsive. This is by far the cleanest and most well appointed Airbnb we have ever stayed in. Well equipped, beautifully decorated and felt like home. We couldn't recommend more highly."
2021-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This apartment is a must. We stayed in the Soo for a couple nights in order to just poke around town, see the locks, etc. The apartment was a quiet oasis for us to get recharged in. Beds are comfortable, location is excellent, and it is very clean! The owners have thought of everything!"
2021-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We were absolutely floored by this AirBNB. We have travelled all over the world and stayed in many, but this was quite honestly one of the best. The decor was amazing (thinking of borrowing a few ideas for my house!) - hint...much of the decor can be found at a store called the Foundary downtown, in case you see something you like! The apartment itself feels spacious, it's super clean, and the kitchen is extremely well-stocked. And the location.... can't beat it! We literally walked everywhere. Dedicated parking is great as well! We had a phenomenal stay, and this cozy apartment had a lot to do with it. Only caution is the staircase to the apartment, it is a perforated metal staircase that seems a bit flimsy. Highly recommend this place to anyone!"
2021-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We enjoyed this spacious loft! Space was exceptionally clean, kitchen had everything needed to cook meals, and the decor was fabulous. Danna was responsive when we needed to communicate. Overall a great stay!"
2021-07-01,5,Group trip,The decor is modern and comfortable. We had everything we needed and Danna was in touch before we checked in and answered all questions immediately. Also appreciated the designated parking place in the alley.
2021-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Awesome location, beautiful interior, very fun!!"
2021-06-01,5,Group trip,"Danna’s place is super nice and clean, the decor is urban rustic in a newly renovated condo, lots of cooking ware, towels, and cleaning supplies
The condo is equipped with everything you need pretty much. Would highly recommend!"
2021-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Our family of four loved our stay at the loft. Perfectly clean, beautifully decorated and centrally located. Loved having a laundry room available and Danna was very easy to communicate with. Would stay here again no question."
2021-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,The Loft on Main is a beautiful and clean property. It is very close to downtown Sault Ste Marie; I would say within walking distance for able-bodied adults! The decor in The Loft was unique and fun. Danna was a wonderful host who was quick to respond to any questions we may have had. We would absolutely stay there again!
2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We had such a great time and absolutely loved the place. The place was super clean and the recent renovations were incredible — we were super impressed by the decor. Danna was super easy to reach throughout the trip and was extremely accommodating. The wifi was also blistering fast (~230mbps down) so work calls were smooth. I would highly recommend staying here with Danna.
2021-06-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Two couples — enjoyed our stay at The Loft. Beautiful floors and woodwork. Close to everything we wanted to do. Danna very easy to communicate with and accommodating to requests.
2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Very clean and modern home. Open layout, nice furniture and comfy beds."
2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is a perfect place to stay to explore the Soo. It’s an 8 minute walk to the Locks and most of the restaurants and shops. My husband and I took a day trip to Taquamenon Falls which was about an hour drive. The apartment is decorated so nicely and outfitted with anything you might need including extra blankets and pillows and all the pots, pans, dishes, etc to cook a full meal.
Danna was a great communicator and kindly offered to turn on the lights when I told her we’d be arriving after dark. I would definitely stay here again!"
2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Wonderful place to stay. Less than 5 minutes from the Soo Locks & less than 2 hours from Pictured Rock National Forest & Tahquamenon Falls. Great centralized location for U.P adventures :)
2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What a wonderful find in the SOO! Every detail was thought of, from the decor, the coffee, the toiletries, everything was top notch here! We can’t recommend Danna & Terry’s place enough! Great communication all the way!"
2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This place is a gem! Very modern and clean. Great location downtown. 10/10 stay
2021-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,A beautiful home! The location is perfect with shops nearby and the locks within walking distance. The hospitality is incredible and response time is very quick when you want to know local tips. We will definitely go back!
2021-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great place to relax and unwind! Perfect location for an Upper Michigan visit. Enjoyed having the full kitchen to cook meals, and the washer and dryer to keep up with vacation laundry. Will stay again!"
2021-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Wow! What an amazing space! This is a total package. All the small touches like the luxurious towels to the toilet paper. Comfy beds. It really felt like home. Highly recommend.
2021-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Second stay here. As good as it gets for being out of town. When i come back to the Soo, I'll be staying here, if available"
2021-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Amazing space! Very clean and I love the decor!

2021-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"A clean, open, quiet loft. Great place to stay. Close to downtown and the Wicked Sister bar is next door with excellent food and craft beer."
2021-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,Highly recommend. Great communication. Great space and decorated so nicely. We'll try and book this space again on our next trip to the Soo.
2020-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The pictures do not do this place justice! We spent the week of Christmas here so we could maintain as much space as possible while still visiting select family members. Danna thought of everything and had wonderful decorations including a tree for us to enjoy for the week!
The space was wonderful, spacious, and thoughtfully curated. Beds were comfortable, decorations were tasteful and everything you need had been thought of even down to the cookware and Tupperware to store temporary leftovers. It was tidy and clean and cleaning supplies were easily accessible and stocked. Onsite washer and dryer were an added bonus as it allowed us to travel light for the week.
We will definitely stay again!"
2020-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Perfect place to stay, great location in downtown Sault, close to restaurant, shopping, grocery stores. The place was very stylish and clean!"
2020-11-01,5,Stayed about a week,Great 2br apartment space centrally located with all possible amenities Danna was quick to respond to questions with easy check in
2020-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"If you're going to the Soo stop looking for places to stay and book this loft! The hosts are fantastic, the space is beautiful and SPOTLESS. You stay right above a great restaurant/bar which can fill your bellies with food and spirits, the entire town is walkable and awesome to see the history of the area. Small shops and restaurants are unique and well done, the scenery is beautiful and there's a lot to do if you have kids with you. Hockey families this is your perfect tournament home base, less than ten minutes from all the rinks in the Soo and very comfortable for a between game nap, laundry to keep those sweaters fresh for the next game. My wife loved the decor and hand touches the hosts added to the unit you feel as you are staying at a family members house we loved everything about it!"
2020-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Enjoyed a great stay at Dannas. Very clean, large, comfortable, nice kitchen."
2020-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"What a lovely place to stay in the Soo! Our family has stayed in many different places over the years in this area, but this was a step above all the others. It was clean and very beautifully decorated. One thing that I appreciated very much was the attention to the small details. The hosts do not skimp on the nice toilet paper, laundry detergent, towels or soaps. I felt cared for and valued by these things! The kitchen is stocked with all the important things so this place is nice for a longer stay. There is a Roku and Apple TV which was convenient as well.
This place is conveniently located beside The Wicked Sister restaurant, which we took advantage of a few times! We also really enjoyed the location in town. We walked to the locks several times.
Danna and Terry were very kind and we were happy to meet them! We highly recommend staying here!"
2020-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,.
2020-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Danna is a wonderful host. We highly recommend booking her units.

Julia was super sweet and amazing with communication. When we needed to check out a bit late she coordinated with the housekeeper it was no problem at all. We would definitely stay again and highly recommend to anyone looking too stay in the Soo!"
2024-02-01,5,Group trip,Awesome
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Host was very responsive! Home was just as described and we were able to even use the board games available for us! Check out was a breeze also as a reminder list was left and it was easy to follow! Will look at this place next time again! Also chairs and couch was very comfortable!
2023-09-01,5,Stayed over a week,"We had the please of staying in Julia’s property for five weeks this summer. We have stayed in many AirBnBs but never one as thoughtfully prepared and comfortable than her property. Every time we thought of something we needed- it was there.
Julia was a delight, beds comfy, spotless, and peaceful in a great location!"

2023-01-01,5,Group trip,"Julia's place was great! we came up for a 4 day sled trip, and the location of the house was phenomenal. literally 1 house away from trail 8. The drive way can be tricky with longer trailers, but it works! it felt like home after a long day of riding. would definitely stay here again."
2023-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,Julia was very responsive (quickly) and the place was awesome! We picked it out very last minute-even made same day reservations. Better deal than any hotel in the area and really close to amazing winter trails! Would definitely rent out again👍
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We appreciated how clean the home was and felt right at home. It was well stocked, and Julia was very responsive to questions we had. Even though the house is next to the snowmobile trail, we couldn't hear any snowmobile traffic from inside whatsoever. We would stay here again!"
2022-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,We had a very nice stay. Great price for the value even with dogs! Would love to come back again.
2022-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,will definitely be back

2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Wonderful place
Spacious, clean and homey! Very much enjoyed our stay and Julia is amazing. Had a couple questions and she was on it immediately!"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,House worked well for my week in town. Everything was as advertised. Easy in and out.
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very nice place and it's comfortable. Great location. Had a great time.
2022-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,This was our first trip to Sault Ste. Marie and we had a great time. The house was super clean and Julia provided everything needed for our trip. Thank you for hosting us.
2022-10-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Very clean, organized, and comfortable. It is just a few minutes from downtown but is in a quiet and relaxing area. The stairs are a little steep, so be careful for someone who has medical issues. There is a bedroom with a set of full sized bunk beds on the main floor, however. We would definitely stay here again!"
2022-09-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Julia is an amazing host! The house had everything you can think of! Just like home👍
2022-09-01,5,Group trip,"There is absolutely nothing negative about this home! It's clean, beautifully decorated, spacious enough for a group stay and located in a great place for sightseeing. Will be back again!"
2022-09-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Absolutely loved the house, location was good too. The set up of the house with bathrooms and bedrooms worked well for our family of 9, (all adults). The kitchen was very large, which is always our general gathering spot. It was very clean, and decorated beautifully. The house is bigger than pictures show. Side door to the house had a very nice deck with privacy. Will definitely stay there again."
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This was a really nice and private stay. The host was very nice and communicative and the place was clean.
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Met expectations set by the pictures. Was very close to a cute downtown area with restaurants, shops, bakeries, chocolate shops, ice cream and mini golf. Home was easy to check into, was very clean and up to date, and had comfortable furniture. Everyone was able to have their own space without a large floor plan. Location was a little desolate, but we didn’t spend that much time stuck in the house anyway. Great overall value!"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,We loved staying in Sault Ste Marie to have a central location to explore the UP. The house was wonderful - clean and as described. A nice bonus to see they’ve added a larger sectional in the living room. Only complaints were it got very hot upstairs and the downstairs bed was not very comfortable. But us buying another fan and mattress pad helped those issues! Julia was very responsive to the few questions we had during our stay. I definitely recommend this host and home!
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Had a great time.
2022-06-01,4,Stayed with kids,"It isn’t clear from the description, but this is an entire house. There is a downstairs bedroom with bunk beds, an upstairs bedroom with two queens, and a small foldable bed that can be moved where you want it. There is a small living room, two bathrooms, a fully equipped kitchen, and laundry in the basement.
It’s not the best neighborhood and the house is a bit worn, but it is very much nicer than having to squeeze into a double room with three kids. Pet-friendly also, so we didn’t have to kennel the dog.
Having a full sized fridge was nice. We could refreeze our cooler packs and store breakfast items so we didn’t have to eat out the whole time. Our first Airbnb experience was positive!"
2022-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,Julia's place was clean and comfortable. We were a bit surprised that the upstairs bedroom didn't have a door (it's just a loft/attic space) - just something to be aware of - but it still worked great for our family. Julia was responsive to our questions as well. We enjoyed going to Sherman Park down the street - the kids loved the beach and the playground. If we are ever back in the area we will stay again!
2022-05-01,5,Group trip,Perfect location for celebrating together as a family. We had fun being able to stay all in once place. Clean and comfortable.
2022-04-01,5,Group trip,"The place was fantastic for us! It was our 25th anniversary of our sorority’s founding and the space was big enough for pictures of all of us, there was enough counter space for lots of food, and parking was our biggest worry, but there was plenty with the long driveway! The stairs in the house are a little steep, so if you have problems going up and down, I’d suggest staying in the lower bedroom! And as someone who has trouble sleeping in beds that aren’t theirs, these ones were very comfy and did the job well! All in all, it’s a beautiful place to stay!"
2022-03-01,5,Group trip,Good location for just about anything you want to do
2022-03-01,5,Group trip,"This is a fantastic house in a great location for snowmobiles or ATVs. The trail is right next to it, and it's easy to access all Sault St Marie has to offer. The house is clean and simple and accommodated our group of 6 perfectly. If we're ever back in the area we will have this one saved!"
2022-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,This is a snowmobilers dream stay! Literally right on the trail. Very clean and organized with a ton of attention to detail. The basement is perfect for drying your gear and the kitchen and bathrooms are stocked with anything you could need. Great communication beginning to end. We had a blast and made great memories.
2022-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,GREAT PLACE VERY CLEAN MUST GO THERE FOR SNOWMOBILING 100%
2022-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,Great clean place to stay for snowmobiling especially easy trail access and in a awesome location. Julia is a great host and is there for any questions or concerns you may have. Definitely recommended!
2022-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great snowmobile place would do it again.
2022-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Perfect place for snowmobilers! Good room for trailers and super close to the trails
2022-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Julia was a great host. Very clean! Awesome location for snowmobiling!
2022-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great location
2021-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Exactly as described, with all the household supplies needed- and more!
(We were happily surprised by the games and cards, and had a great time squabbling over Trivial Pursuit.)
Location was fantastic also- easy access to I-75, downtown, the Shallows, Portage… Thanks for a great stay!"
2021-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Great cabin centrally located. Easy on and off the highway and also very close to town. Julia is a wonderful host. The home was exceptionally clean and well stocked. Thank you!
2021-10-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Clean, cozy house with character. It was a good location for us to base our Sault Ste. Marie adventure."
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,A good place to reunite with friends or family. Colors are just starting to turn . The drive north is beautiful. The Soo is a great vacation area.

2021-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,Wonderful house. Great location. Had a fantastic time.

2021-07-01,5,Stayed one night,Amazingly outfitted house. Thank you Julia!
2021-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,Amazing home and an even better hostess. Julia was able to help us big time accommodating our move to Sault Ste Marie.
2021-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"A great place to stay! The house was clean and lovely, and the host was wonderfully responsive and helpful. Kitchen was large and well-stocked- pots and pans, towels, bedding all seemed brand new. We were comfortable with the fans on, and it was nice to be able to sit outdoors on the deck."
2021-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,House was very clean. Lots of beds to sleep in for a large group. Kitchen was well stocked with cooking items. The only downside was no air conditioning. There was a window air unit downstairs which cooled it off nicely but upstairs bedroom was warm but we did bring fans which helped. We will definitely stay again when in the area
2021-07-01,4,Stayed with kids,"Julia’s house is lovely, incredibly clean and cozy. It’s conveniently located and a quick drive or bike ride to the downtown area. We spent three relaxing nights here, and highly recommend it. It was a bit warm in the upstairs area, but opening the window and fans helped make it very comfortable since it cools off so much at night and the humidity is very low. Be sure to check out Sherman Park for awesome sunsets and a lovely beach/playground for the family."
2021-07-01,4,Stayed with kids,Be sure to have one large high powered fan with you. The house has no ac and there were two fans provided. They weren't enough to combat the heat. I had brought two and had to get a polar wind turbo fan to get enough air circulation. Beyond that the house was amazing. We had an amazing time up North and being able to come back to a house after a day out. Especially with two littles was a huge relief. I would recommend staying here and will also consider this property over others next time.
2021-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,Close to town.
2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Place was so charming and beautiful! Massive kitchen and great yard!
2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very pleased with our stay! Beautiful home and great location!
2021-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Absolutely perfect. The house is super clean and decorated cute. We had a blast riding the trails, which are right beside the house. The backyard was perfect to let the kids run around pulse there’s a little fire pit to have a camp fire. We will definitely stay here again!
⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️"
2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Very close to downtown, safe, clean, overall a great experience. We would stay again!"
2021-05-01,5,Group trip,"Host was great at communicating all that we needed to know. She left a to-do list for checking out, which made the whole process super easy.

2021-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place is great to go and get away with your family so many local attraction you were right down the street from the soo locks and all the gift shops, right next to a snowmobile trail for easy access definitely will be back"
2020-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"You will not be disappointed!!!!! This is a home not just a house. First, you need to know I am picky. Lol. This home was so incredibly clean and cozy!! Everything worked perfect. The water pressure in the shower was so nice. The dishes were all new and clean. I truly have nothing negative that I can say.
Things to note: the stairs to one of the bedrooms are very narrow"
2020-11-01,4,Stayed a few nights,This is a great place to stay in the UP of Michigan. Has everything you need for a short or extended stay. Just a short drive from downtown!

2020-10-01,5,Group trip,nice place
2020-09-01,4,Group trip,"This was my first ever Airbnb rental and I was amazed by the ease of things! Julia provided us with a code to get in the home to make check in a breeze. The home was clean and had everything we needed but the food to cook several meals there. The only downfall we had was that we were not aware of how steep/curved the stairs were that lead to a lot of the sleeping area, and that the upstairs bathroom was connected to the third bedroom without a door dividing the two. Other that that minor inconvenience, our experience was great! Julia was an absolute breeze to work with!"
2020-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very clean and well maintained. Quick responses when we asked about baking sheets. Julia brought a set right away without even asking for her to do so. If we work in this area again we will book this place again.
2020-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Was here for work but this home made us feel like we where home.very clean and modern
2020-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Was close to snowmobile trails as described, clean and warm. Would visit again."

2020-01-01,5,Group trip,The place was great we loved it!
2020-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This is a great place to stay if you are visiting the Soo. Especially if you are snowmobiling. Trail is right at the end of the driveway! Host gives the house a very nice touch, and has great communication. Will definitely stay there again if I visit the Soo again!"
