The list of available extras and necessities was top notch! From gum, cold waters, warm cookies and a very welcoming card; to shaving cream, extra toothbrushes, antacids, and allergy medication. Just wow! We booked this home while I was in town for a wedding. Two large mirrors and especially the outdoor area by the pool (which felt great), allowed for amazing photos. Lastly, the comfort and cool temp, which could be adjusted, made for a great sleep! Outside of the home, we were close to fast food and restaurants, grocery stores, and coffee (if you wanted something other than what was already provided). Very very convenient, safe, and quiet home. We would happily recommended this home and would love to book here again!

2024-01-01,4,Stayed with kids,"This place was beautiful, comfy, and in a safe neighborhood. We did have a few complaints but they are easily fixable things:
1. Some dishes were dirty or in poor condition
2. The heating was on a schedule that made it very hot at night time. (73F - 80F) We had to manually go in and delete scheduled temp settings so it would stay on our preferred setting which was within the standard temps that Trent wanted it to stay at in the binder. (68F - 73F)
3. The grill was in poor condition and not clean
Despite these complaints we overall had a pleasant experience staying here. Thanks Trent!"

It's also rare that I've ever experienced Airbnb kitchens, dressing areas and family rooms that are so well-equipped, clean and beautifully decorated with everything needed to feel at home. Thank you also for providing the lovely, locally-made soaps and shampoos -- those additional touches truly enhanced the overall experience.

2022-07-01,5,Stayed about a week,"We loved the place. The beds were unbelievably comfortable. We would like recommend curtains or blinds on the back door and possibly some new pots. The Teflon is chipping off. Stainless steel is a much better option and will last longer.
Also this is the first property that I have been to that has a garage without a garage opener.
So u must let yourself out the garage and then go back in the garage to close it, then through the house to lock the door."

All I can say is that if this spot is avail for your dates, you would be foolish to choose any other home! A+++"
2022-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a great experience with this Air BnB! The home was beautiful and exactly as pictured. We loved that there was a coffee station, sample toiletries in each bathroom, a few laundry pods, and a few dish washer pods for guests to utilize. Trent was a great communicator and made it a smooth process for check in and out. We traveled into town to celebrate Christmas with our step daughter and Trent was very accommodating before our stay and told me that the Christmas tree and Christmas lights would stay up for the duration of our stay.

2023-03-01,4,Stayed one night,"The place was really nice, clean and decorated nicely. However the main reason we chose this place was because it had a jacuzzi, and we really needed that to help us relax because of how over worked we‚Äôve been. But most of the jets in the jacuzzi didn‚Äôt even work. So it was more like just a hot bath. If you‚Äôre gonna have a jacuzzi, the whole thing should work, all the jets, not just a couple, which barely did too. So a little disappointed, as that was the main feature we were excited about."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This is a precious home that has been redone/updated well! The home had all that we needed to enjoy a delightful weekend in Lubbock without needing to contact the host for anything. The house was very clean. The beds were super comfortable.

It had everything you needed. Washer, dryer, nice fridge, good AC, clean bathrooms, great living room, and to top it off an AMAZING pool. We were in the pool about 99% of the time we were at the house. It was super clean and felt amazing. The tree provided great shade and it was perfect. There wasn‚Äôt much more that David could‚Äôve done for the house. I definitely recommend this to anyone that wants a house in a peaceful neighborhood with a pool and a great host."

2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,This was a great place to stay in Lubbock. The pool was great and the house was beautiful and comfy. Marisa was a great host who responded quickly to a few requests that were above and beyond.
2023-08-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Marisa was very accommodating with a bad experience at the initial booking location. The AC was out so she offered this location at a discounted price to help us out as we did not want to be in a house where the temperature was 85 degrees. I was a little disappointed that this home was not offered at the same price as the first booking seeing how what occurred there was out of our hands but in the end the host tried the best they could to help us in a tight spot as there were no available hotels for us to go to. Overall a good experience and I would rent from this host again when in the Lubbock area. We will be here often as our son is a TTU student.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,This is an excellent property. we loved everything about it and the hosts were friendly and extremely responsive. I'd book again for sure.

Unfortunately, although no animals are actually allowed to find dog hair at check-in on some upholstery and cover. We also had to free the beautiful and really spacious garden from dog droppings before we could use it.
For our guests number, the equipment in the kitchen for self-catering was sometimes a bit scarce. Otherwise, the house is really super equipped.
So overall, we were happy with a few restrictions."

2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The Chilton House was amazing. Based on past experience, our expectations of Airbnb in the Lubbock areawere not high at all. But Sydney has an amazing offering. Not only is the house named after a famous....ish, drink discovered in Lubbock. But Sydney was kind enough to leave the ingredients for us to make a Chilton upon our arrival. And then we gave ourselves a tour and we were very happy with the place. The beds were extremely comfortable. My wife actually joked about taking the comforter home with her. Our daughter loved the 2 other bedrooms (somehow she used them both).
We were there to visit with family, so there was no cooking. But, the kitchen was stocked with everything you need, even if you want to BBQ. Sydney even provides coffee!
All in all, this was a great place just barely outside of Lubbock, on the best side of town. Stay with full confidence that your time here will be very comfortable."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Such a cool and comfortable place to stay for us and our daughter and her little family. All the beds were sooooo comfy! Our little three year old granddaughter slept in the office bed! Her first time to sleep by herself in a big bed and she slept like a log! Everything was extremely clean and all of the amenities were wonderful. The special touches we loved were the coffee and creamer and the Maki gs for our fave drink, the Chilton! Such cute lemon themed decorations! We will certainly consider the Chilton House on our next stay in Lubbock with our family. Sydney was a very responsive owner! Good job you guys and God bless. ü•∞üôèüèª"

2024-04-01,3,Stayed with a pet,"Zane was very responsive in his communication, which is always appreciated. The house itself is basic with straightforward amenities.
The two things to be aware of is the very strong smell of air freshener plug-ins and that the yard is full of foxtails. One of the reasons we booked the house was for the yard since we were with our dog. Unfortunately, both the front and & back yard was completely full of foxtails, which can be deadly for dogs, so there was no way we could let her off her leash."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"Loved our short stay here! Great open kitchen and living space. We cooked dinner, played games sitting at the dining table and relaxed on the couch to watch baseball on the large tv. The backyard was great for our dogs.

As for Zane, he was extremely responsive via text. About 30 minutes after the 10am check out, we realized we left some of my mom‚Äôs clothes hanging in a closet. I texted him of the situation and he replied back quickly saying he would provide me with a new access code to go back inside up retrieve them. This was after we left the house at 7:45am for a doctor‚Äôs appointment. Very accommodating.
When we got back home 2.5 hours away, my mom realized she might have left her keys at the house. I texted Zane, and he jumped into action right away. He was able to find them and offered to mail them back to me free of charge. Very kind and we are extremely grateful.
Great house and even better host. A+++++

Zane is a responsive host, the bed was comfy, and we enjoyed walking our dog to the nearby park."

Our dogs absolutely loved the backyard, especially after such a long drive and had plenty of space to run around and play while we enjoyed the seating area. The location was great, with many places to visit and restaurants nearby. I also loved the special touches put into the place, like the Lubbock and Texas wall design which was a perfect spot for a picture. Also offering a local wine to relax with and I especially loved the ‚ÄúYou had me at woof‚Äù sign which definitely goes with the Rest your Paws‚Äù theme.

It was nice having an ensuite bathroom and a tv in the master bedroom. The house was close to Target and several restaurants. The neighborhood was quiet.
Only thing is there are a few lightbulbs that are out, the tubs were kind of dirty so I ended up cleaning them and the tv stand in the master bedroom was very dusty.

2022-07-01,5,Stayed one night,Came in for a concert with my cousin. We both live on the south plains in fact my business is in Lubbock but we decided to stay the night. Bri was wonderful to work with and the house was amazing. It even got cleaned earlier than expected and we were allowed to enter at that time. Loved the minimalist aspect of the house. We just wished there was a bench at the foot of the beds to put luggage on instead of the floor. We plan to try and stay here anytime we have overnights in Lubbock and I will definitely be telling others about this great house and perfect location!!
2022-07-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Awesome home. Clean, comfortable, spacious, great patio, game room and whirlpool bath. Home decor was pure Texas. Hosts were responsive almost immediately to all requests. Only great things to say. Will stay here again next time in Lubbock."

We'll definitely be staying here again!"
2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This was our 2nd time staying at this location and we absolutely loved it!
2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,What you can expect at this house is an at home experience. They have great little touches that a lot of homes do not have and really makes you feel comfy. Oh and the couch has recliners on both ends which we did not find out until the second night. The back courtyard is very nice with TV to enjoy as well. The communication and whole experience is well above any place we have stayed.

2022-02-01,5,Group trip,"This was our second time booking this house. We love it. They are great about making you feel at home, but yet they still treat you like a guest. They take care of cleanup and you're not having to run around trying to figure out where to dispose of trash when you leave. You don't have to stress about getting beds stripped when you're trying to just get on the road. It's a small thing, but, it makes a difference when traveling. They have snacks, water bottles, dinnerware, silverware, etc. They provide a laundry detergent pod and dryer sheet in case you need to wash anything. The beds & bedding are super comfy. The jet tub is AMAZING! it was great for my gf's back after a long day of working. We didn't use the arcade this time, but it is really cool. Just be mindful of the stairs as they're a little steep. Check-in was incredibly easy! The keypad is a nice feature. We'll definitely be back again."
2022-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This was a great house to stay in. It's in a good location and the house has lots of space. I would definitely stay here again.

2022-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We love this house.
The hosts are very thoughtful with the snacks & water they give you. It's immaculate, organized, and worth the stay. We loved checking out and how they handled cleaning the home after. Like going to a hotel and not having to strip beds etc., we don't mind doing it, but it's nice to not have to worry about it. Don't forget to go upstairs and kick back into the 80's with pac man üòä"
2022-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Amazing stay. Comfortable beds, amazing location! This was a perfect place for our family."
2022-01-01,4,Stayed with kids,Great house and location. Really enjoyed the game room and being able to park in the garage. Only complaint is the use of air fresheners through out the house. We are a fragrance sensitive family and it was hard to breathe. Please consider removing all artificial fragrances or replacing with essential oils. Same with the laundry detergent and no dryer sheets.
2022-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,Wow!! This home is greatly catered for families! We enjoyed the arcade room and loved the cleanliness of the home . We will be back !
2022-01-01,5,Stayed about a week,"My daughter had major back surgery and this place was such a comfort to come home too after long days at the hospital. Brianne was supper accommodating even when I needed 1 more day at the beginning of our trip, last minute too. Can't thank her enough!"

2023-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,We had a great time with family! Great outdoor space and the kitchen was equipped with everything we needed!
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Oh this home... As beautiful as the pictures are, it is more amazing in person. This home was just breathtaking.
Entering the beautifully landscaped front yard, one is greeted with a safe entryway. Simple keypad access, no keys to lose, or messages to send. Open the door, you are greeted by a pleasantly clean, and very wonderfully smelling house.
The kitchen; Jevon has a coffee setup that is amazing. The sink has a filtered water dispenser. No need to be running out to buy water and Ice.
The laundry room was clean, and well organized. The washer and dryer are newer; with all the bells and whistles.
We loved the game room. it was a magnificent place; where the family enjoyed each other's company.
Cooked dinner, and ate on a clean, large, and very elegant dining room table. Cleanup was easy with a dishwasher, and provided dish soap and hand soap, and cleaning sponges. Book this place if available. You'll never want to stay anywhere else in the Hub city!"
2023-09-01,5,Group trip,We absolutely loved our stay here! The back patio and pool was the perfect spot to hangout with the family. Jevon was super responsive and awesome to work with! We will definitely stay again when we have a group with us!
2023-09-01,5,Group trip,"The bedrooms we‚Äôre comfortable and well apportioned, the kitchen and living room we spacious and had every modern amenity but (for us traveling in early September) the star was the back yard and patio: the grill, seating area, tv and pool were fantastic for warm evenings. The high fences made it feel very private too!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We went to Lubbock to watch the Jelly Roll concert and we were so happy when we arrived. This home is beautiful and clean. It smelled fresh, very private and was so comfortable. The pool was a welcome amenity, as we had had over 60 days of 100+ degree weather where we live. Jevon was super responsive every time we messaged with questions.....that was awesome. I always worry about the beds when I stay at Airbnb's so I went straight to the master bedroom to try it out and it was AMAZING. We had a blast during the evenings, playing in the game room. All in all, this home is probably one of the most comfortable, secure, safe feeling homes I have ever stayed in. We will definitely be back, should we ever need a place in Lubbock again!!!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great house! Loved all the extras: pool, fire pit, covered patio, bar, grill area, & fuze ball table."
2023-08-01,4,Stayed with kids,"Nice neighborhood. Fabulous backyard with pool and fire pit. The new game room is awesome and adds 4 twin beds for additional sleeping options. The host was extremely responsive to every need. Of note, the pool area and outside patio have cameras that monitor all your activity. This is stated in the listing. Also, you will sign an additional rental agreement for this AirBnB and put up a refundable deposit (ours was $300). Once there, you will be asked to sigh a waiver regarding damage and injury while using the pool and fire pit. That was all a different experience for us since using AirBnB. Overall, a positive experience. If I listed one con it would be the need for improved kitchen supplies (which I will message the host about in detail.) Loved the home, it was beautiful. This is my best Lubbock AirBnB experience so far. Would definitely stay again."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This was the perfect place for daughters graduation weekend from Tech for our family to gather.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,We do Air BNB 2-3 times a year so its not super frequent. This house was one of the best places that we have ever stayed in! We took our kids to Hamilton and Dude perfect for a nice local getaway for us since we are from a nearby town. I really enjoyed the attention to deail that Jevon showed toward the coffee makers in the Kitchen. He was so thoughtful about adding most different types of coffee makers so that whatever your style is he had it covered. Outside was like a private secluded oasis. Our kids enjoted playing corn hole while we relaxed by the pool with comforable reclining furniture. The back yard had a TV and a BBQ gril both of which were immaculate and in perfect working order. All the towles and linens were included and where you would expect them to be. The garge was converted to a game room with Air hockey and foosball. Our kids absolutely loved this room with the small chairs that were on the floor for gaming and watching TV. We Will be back!! 100%
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Absolutely fabulous stay! Impeccable in every way! This is by far one of our favorite places we‚Äôve ever stayed. We felt right at home. The rooms, bathrooms, living room & kitchen are just the best we‚Äôve ever had the opportunity to stay in and enjoy from Airbnb. Definitely the Best and most well stocked kitchen along with the BEST coffee bar we could have ever asked for. The backyard was simply fabulous and beyond what we expected. Though all the photos are beautiful, the entire house is even better in person. We can‚Äôt wait to be back!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The place was great, comfortable and clean. The pool was not very clean and the skimmers weren't working. We used a net that we found but it had tons of holes in it. We still used the pool. It just fell short of what we expected."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,Beautiful place that was ready when we arrived. Location allowed easy access to our events through out town. The location provide activities for the children and adults so everyone was able to entertain and enjoy the stay.

2022-10-01,5,Group trip,This is a 5-star place and was everything we hoped for during our last stay in Lubbock. The house and all of the amenities are exactly as described and I would give the back patio even higher grades. All of that and it was considerably cheaper than booking 3 overpriced hotel rooms. This place is outstanding! We will definitely be back!
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Jevon‚Äôs home was fantastic. Everything was well kept, clean and updated. This was perfect for our week stay. The backyard was beyond our expectations. Very nice, inviting, and fun. We loved spending our evenings outside."
