2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Rachel was amazing, she gave clear and concise directions to the location prior to the trip. Check in was very easy and she was waiting for us when we arrived. The location was large and contained every accommodation we needed and was also very clean. Rachel is very good at communicating on her end as well as responding to any questions or needs regarding the stay in a timely manner. As great as the location was, Rachel is what made the stay go from great to amazing, she’s also a great cook. I would highly recommend ‘The Lodge at Medicine Creek Farms’."

2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We couldn't believe our eyes!
The lodge is on such a beautiful land right on the Missouri River.
The location: Very easy to find. It is only a ~ 15 minutes from Pierre and really easy to get to.
The space: Wonderful spacious rooms. Super clean and had all the amenities. The peace and waking up to the sounds of nature was unique.
The breakfast: Finger licking good! The scrambled eggs were from fresh farm chickens, and they were Delicious!
The host: Rachel is an amazing person. They have done so much on the farm, and she runs the lodge perfectly. We really enjoyed our conversations with her and learned so much.
Thanks so much, Rachel, for your hospitality."

2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,this was the most peaceful and comfortable place to stay. I would highly recommend staying here if you are in the area. Rachel went above and beyond to be hospitable to us!
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This place is uniquely beautiful! The common area has a massage chair, pool table and foosball, but what’s even better are the surrounding environment. The place is located on the river. They have all kind of animals you’d find in a farm and you’re allowed to stroll anywhere. Rachel has been a kind hostess to us. She also cooked a warm breakfast for us. Wished we stayed there longer. Highly recommended for a quiet getaway from city noises."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place was such a gem. The views of the river from our room were breathtaking, we even had access to the patio. The room itself was huge, actually had a sectional couch in it, our own tv, comfortable bed, and everything was spotless. Rachel was the best host, provided a home cooked breakfast that was delicious, coffee every morning, fresh baked cookies and other snacks really more than we could have asked for. Rachel was also very helpful with directions and just the sweetest person. We were only there for a short stay, but I would recommend 100%! We really loved this place and wish we could have stayed longer."
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Absolutely amazing spot! Highly recommend! We had the place to ourselves (plus the host). Super beautiful, quiet, relaxing location.

2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Rachel was a wonderful host. The lodge was clean, spacious and the breakfast was delicious."
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This was the best airbnb experience my husband and I have ever had! Rachel was super professional, kind, and an excellent communicator and host. The lodge was stunning, luxurious, and comfortable. We were traveling across the country for a move and it was a super convenient location for us. My husband and I had the privilege of having the whole lodge to ourselves the night we stayed—which was an added unforeseen bonus—but I think we would have loved it nearly as much and possibly more if there were other guests we could have shared the common spaces with. (We were looking forward to meeting other people!) Finally, the breakfast Rachel prepared for us was spectacular. Truly, our expectations were exceeded at every turn. We would recommend this airbnb to everyone!"
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Very nice place, really spacious common area, Rachel was super gracious and welcoming us, showing us around, offering to fix breakfast for us but we left early the next morning."
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Rachel is wonderful! Her place is spacious and comfortable in a beautiful setting. This is the kind of place you hope to discover when traveling or needing a home away from home.
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Rachael is an amazing host. The lodge was beautiful and located right in the river. Best breakfast in town. 😋
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Hands down the best AirBnB ever. The house is in an amazing location (right on the river), extremely clean and comfortable. In the common area, we could use the pool table, massage chair, and foosball table. Breakfast included home-grown bacon, which was absolutely out of this world. Internet was fast and reliable. Rachel was super nice and gave us plenty of privacy after the welcoming check-in. Our only regret is that we could not stay longer."
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"My husband and I truly enjoyed our stay at the Lodge. The lodge was beautiful inside and the grounds were so peaceful. Our host Rachel, was so accommodating, from helping us with dinner recommendations to making a great breakfast. We can’t think of anything that was overlooked. Really an exceptional place to unwind and relax."
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This is a great find near Pierre, South Dakota. We loved the peaceful location on the river, the fact that the property is on a working farm, and the house was spotless! I recommend highly and would love to come back again someday."
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful location, spacious lodge, and a home away from home for our family of 4. A big thank you to Rachel for graciously hosting us."
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"amazing place to stay at, this will be my stop every time we come to town. perfectly cleaning quiet and the food and coffee were excellent"
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"A truly memorable AirB&B experience. This is the real deal--a working farm/ranch that doubles as a spacious, comfy guest house, at a spectacular location right on the Missouri River. It's only about 15 minutes east of Pierre but feels like a world apart. My room was one of the suites with a private door to a patio overlooking the river. It was sizzling hot outside, but the room's A/C did the trick. Tons of stars at night! Rachel was super-communicative and cooked a wonderful eggs-and-pancake breakfast. The crowning touch was the otherworldly experience of the massage chair in the commons area...how a mechanical device can simulate a real massage so skillfully, I'll never know."
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Our stay was wondeful and we so appreciate Rachel graciously greeting us and the homemade breakfast which was such treat. The lodge and our guest suite were so perfect- we were sad we had to leave. Amazing place, people and view!!"
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Beautiful location, spotless house, incredibly peaceful and quiet. The breakfast was amazing!! If I’m ever passing through again, will be certain to stay here over a motel in the area."
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"A picture perfect view, very clean, amazing breakfast, wonderful atmosphere & hospitality! I bet the hunting is great too if that is your thing. We loved our stay here as a family of 4 that wanted to visit Pierre, but didn't want a traditional hotel stay & it was absolutely great!"
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We were very happy with our stay at Medicine Creek Lodge. Beautiful views of the Missouri River with great sunsets. The lodge was very clean with great service. Would definitely stay there again.
2020-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We unfortunately only stayed here for a short time passing through. It was a beautiful location, with great views of the Missouri River. Fantastic common spaces, and Rachel was the best host. She made an amazing breakfast for us before we got the road, and our daughter even got to play with their toys."
2020-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Clean, spacious, peaceful. Great amenities and hospitality! We enjoyed our stay!"
2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Our stay here was perfect. Rachel was an amazing host and the view was incredible! Breakfast in the morning was delicious and we appreciated the great hospitality.
2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,One of the best AirBNBs I've ever had. The serenity of being by the Missouri River was surpassed only by the hospitality provided. This stay is a MUST if I come back to this area.
2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This place was amazing! Was able to use fridge and freezer space for my cooler items. It was summer, so we were the only guests for this large space. We were able to have the suite room which had a patio right off the room and overlooking the river. Beautiful spot, awesome amenities, and Rachel was a great host!!! Highly recommend!!"
2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Rachel's place was so incredible!! Such a beautiful farm house. She was such a gracious host and put together a fabulous breakfast for me. It was really nice to chat with her and to here all about her family and the history of the lodge. Her family is beautiful and I was sooo happy to have met their two black lab puppies. The puppies were a wonderful, pleasant surprise!! Oh and the massage chair was heaven after driving for a handful of hours!"
2020-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Upon arrival, Rachel greeted us at the door and was very friendly! She gave us the tour of the home, and was very courteous to us! The breakfast she fixed the following morning was phenomenal! I would highly recommend staying at Rachel's place at Medicine Creek Farms!"
2019-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This lodge is located a few miles outside of Pierre on a bluff overlooking the Missouri River with spectacular views. It is one of the most comfortable places we have ever stayed with Airbnb. The common areas of the lodge provide open spaces where guests can sit and chat, watch TV or just hangout. The bedrooms provide private areas with plenty of space and spotless bathrooms. The outdoor areas are accessible and we were able to interact with the owners chickens and goose, hear coyotes howling in the distance and see mule deer in the front yard.
Breakfast is included and features true farm to table ingredients prepared by Rachel and made fresh each morning. This is a very special place."
2019-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Rachel's accommodations are spectacular - just as expected based on pictures. She was a terrific hostess providing suggestions for dinner locations, refrigerator space for our cooler items and a wonderful breakfast. The space was spacious and bed comfortable. Anyone selecting Rachel's accommodations will be in for a special treat! Thank you Rachel! Roger and Linda"
2019-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Such a wonderful host. Lodge is beautiful inside and out. Great location. Couldn’t have been a better experience. From the wonderful welcome as we arrived, to the spot on recommendation for an awesome dinner, to an unbelievable breakfast that gave us the perfect start to our day. Would come back and stay again as well as would definitely recommend!!"
2019-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Rachel was very quick to respond and kind to help us check-in late. She was very friendly and provided everything we needed. The location of the lodge was a nice, quiet country setting with a river view. The bedroom was spacious and clean. It was a big help to have a refrigerator and freezer to use for our travel cooler. Breakfast was happily provided and convenient. This lodge is perfectly set up for hunting groups, but worked well for us as we passed through the area and needed a place for just 2."
2019-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"What an amazing place! I came here on business with two of my associates, and we really had an amazing stay. Rachael was just outstanding to work with, and went above and beyond for us!"
2019-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"If you plan on spending time in Pierre, plan on staying at Medicine Creek Lodge! Amazing experience, amazing place, and Rachel is fantastic!!!"
2018-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"It is definitely worth going out of your way for this AIRBNB. It offers amenities way beyond expectations, beautiful views from every window over looking the Missouri River, everything spotless, huge flatscreen TV with a variety of choices, delicious homemade breakfast with fresh eggs from the hen house, private baths, laundry facilities available,etc! Rachel is “the hostess with the mostest”!"
2018-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Rachel is a great host. She communicated with me prior to arrival. When we did arrive, Rachel was there to greet us. Gave us a tour of the lodge and ensured that we had everything we needed. The lodge is excellent, we were a bit spoiled as we were the only guests at the time. Breakfast was great. I would definitely recommend staying here. I will go again."
2018-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"You MUST book this Airbnb if you are ever in the Pierre, SD area! My two siblings and I stayed for one night at Rachel’s place during our road trip across the US. We were pleasantly surprised with the place and had more than enough space to rest - we each had our own separate rooms within a suite.
Rachel is such a great host! We arrived later than expected (forgot to consider the change in time zones), and Rachel didn’t get mad about it at all. Rachel even cooked the three of us breakfast with pancakes and fresh eggs from their family’s free range chickens.
I can’t even describe in words about how amazing our stay was! This was definitely our favorite Airbnb spot during our trip. I’d recommend checking in before the sun goes down since the place might be harder to find at night. Dinner and lunch spots are also a 15+ drive into town. Last tip: use the massage chair! Amazing!"
2018-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We love staying at this place, which is the closest to a ""home away from home"" of all the airbnb's we have stayed at. Rachel is the best, the location and overall ambiance is superb. Can't recommend this airbnb highly enough to others!!"
2018-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Rachel's home is huge. She provides guest the highest quality of bedding and breakfast. She is amazing, raising up six children and running airbnb at the same time. The room is super clean and the view is stunning. A great experience of country side stay."
2018-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Clean, comfortable, friendly and a great location on the edge of the Missouri River with beautiful views all around."
2018-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Thanks
2018-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We were stopping over on a trip from the Black Hills back to Bismarck to fly home. What a magical place! Why stay in a tiny hotel somewhere where you could have a lovely space on the river just a bit out of town?! We were able to get a cab ride into town for a night out with drinks. Such gorgeous views from
This place. Plenty of space and privacy. If you had a large group, for either reunion, fishing or hunting, it’s amazing! I would book it if we lived in a neighboring state. Perfection for relaxation"
2018-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The lodge was a great place to stay!
The beds were comfy and the space was clean!
The breakfast/brunch was amazing! Rachel was so accommodating to our plans. She was great at communicating ahead of time and great to make sure the space would be great for us!
Even though it was a few minutes out of town, it was well worth the drive!
We look forward to stay there the next time we are in Pierre!"
2017-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Rachel was very welcoming, she came out to great us when we arrived. She was very accommodating, and breakfast was great!"
2017-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The Lodge at Medicine Creek Farms was the find of our vacation. Perfectly placed along the river with stunning sunsets and outside dining to enjoy dinner rather than drive the short distance into Pierre. Rachel is an excellent host and along with her family make this the only place to stay in the Pierre area.
We hope to return here and would recommend anyone else to stay. Perfect for couples, families or business travel."
2017-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This was an unexpected gem. Rachel was so great at communicating before our stay and during. The lodge was stunning! Right on the river. There is an apple orchard, a chicken coop and stunning views. In the morning, Rachael made us breakfast, pancakes, fresh eggs, and sliced apples from the orchard! I can't say enough great things about our stay there. Our room was clean. Bed very comfortable. Choice of several dvds to use as well as wifi and direct tv. My husband and I felt very comfortable there and will definitely book again on our next vacation. And for all that it was very reasonably priced."
2017-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This accommodation is a gem of a find as the location is so peaceful but the real bonus is being greeted by a wonderful family.
Regards
Bob"
2017-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Danlynn's room is located in a safe and quiet area, very close to the mall.The room is clean and cozy, and fully furnished.The host is enthusiastic, attentive, and has a beautiful backyard for children to play.Best choice in East Yellowstone, good value for money, highly recommended!"
2017-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Stunning location, located right next to the Missouri River. Private bathrooms and comfortable, hotel quality beds. Fantastic experience and a reasonable cost. The place to stay when visiting Pierre. Bonus, Rachel is an amazing hostess!"
2017-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Rachel is an exceptional host. And if you want some peace, beauty and a chance to get mesmerized by the Missouri river this is a great find."

2017-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Our stay was too brief to take full advantage of the amenities offered and the spectacular location of the lodge, but we had a restful, quiet night and enjoyed meeting Rachel, who also cooked us a wonderful breakfast in the morning."
2017-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Fantastic lodge! Well worth it
2016-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The lodge was easy to find; you can spot the tower from a distance. The location was a very quiet, scenic stretch of the Missouri River. You can hear every bird singing and cow mooing from miles away. Stargazing late at night was amazing. Host Rachel was there to greet us when we arrived, giving us information about the facilities and nearby dining. The room was very nice, put together for easy cleaning to accomodate hunters. Every room has its own bathroom. They are building a large addition, scheduled to finish in the fall of 2016. Breakfast was pancakes and eggs from their own henhouse. Take it easy traveling down the driveway, as the chickens are a little slow to get out of your way. Also fresh fruit, yogurt, juice, coffee, etc. This was a very unique and interesting place to stay on our way to the Black Hills. We really enjoyed our stay."
2016-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Would give Rachel and the Lodge a six if we could. We loved the location on the Missouri River outside of Pierre. On a working farm, the Lodge is comfortable and Rachel provided a full breakfast. Sitting outside in the evening watching the river was peaceful and relaxing. We would come back!"
2016-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Rachel was a great host - we had everything we needed. Very comfortable accommodations, and a generous breakfast to send us on our way. Thank you for everything!"
2016-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Very nice accommodation, lovely family great breakfast. We would very highly recommend this and great views, peace and quiet wonderful!!"
2016-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Rachel's lodge was incredibly beautiful. Prior to arrival she kept in touch and made sure that we had directions and knew where we were going. She greeted us at the door and made sure to show us around. Her lodge is spacious and cozy, making it feel like we were right at home. The following morning Rachel made a delicious breakfast for us. Throughout the stay shel was very accommodating and made sure that we were comfortable. We would highly recommend Rachel's lodge."
2016-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Can't say enough good things about this place. The hospitality was great, the place was amazing, and everything was well thought out. Would love to stay there again someday!"
2016-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"What can I say about Rachel and Joe? They were fantastic! Very helpful, made me feel right at home. Great atmosphere, great conversation and wonderful food. It almost feels like a second home."
2016-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Another superb experience! One of the best airbnb lodgings we have found. Rachel & Joe are absolute lovely, and the home made hot breakfast was once again wonderful. We will return again & again!"
2015-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Rachel was a wonderful host. We booked kinda last minute and Rachel was great and fast at approving and finalizing the booking. Then we checked in later in the evening and Rachel again was great and accommodating, making us feel welcome from the get go. The place was really beautiful, spacious, and comfortable. Then the best part was the homemade pancakes the next morning. Rachel's pancakes were the best I've had in a really long time, and maybe ever. You'll definitely want to use the massage chair as it was really nice and relaxing. I would highly recommend this place."
2015-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We were only at the Lodge for about 12 hours, unfortunately, because it is a really great spot. We arrived at sunset which was beautiful over the river. We had two rooms and two bathrooms which were really clean and comfortable. Rachel was very welcoming and helpful and cooked us a great breakfast before we left early the next morning."
2015-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Very relaxing after a marathon and 3 hour drive! Rachel did everything to make you feel right at home!
2015-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We love Rachel's house. It's such a wonderful stay there. The house is so beautiful and we enjoy our privacy. Rachel and her children are very nice, they offered us great breakfast and even allow us to use their eggs for free. Rachel is really a great hostess."
2015-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"My wife and I spent a good night in the farm. The place is awesome. Very spacious and clean. There is a breathtaking view from the room with river and farm outside the window. We had a good time with the animals in the farm, feeding the cow etc. I will strongly recommend this place and wish I could stay several days more."
2015-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Rachel was a wonderful host. Although we stayed for a short time, we were welcomed well and we felt at home."
2015-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The lodge was very quiet & right on the river. My room was amazing (very comfortable bed, super clean, large wraparound couch) and the living area had plenty of couches, chairs, TV, massage chair, refrigerator & freezer (great for packing my cooler & water bottles).
Rachel was very communicative beforehand (and nice!). She made a lovely breakfast for me & fabulous coffee.
I would rate my experience a 6 if I could - exactly what I needed (rest, comfort, quiet). Definitely would come back & recommend staying here! Directions were good, you have to be watching for the lodge but you'll know it when you see it."
2015-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Even though we arrived much later than expected due to heavy winds, we were delighted by the beautiful space, comfy beds, and delicious breakfast.
And we were glad that Fred was able to assist us with a duct-tape car repair so we could get on the road tout suite!"
2015-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"You should definitely crash at the Medicine Creek Lodge when you're near Badlands. Rachel was a generous host, upgrading our room because of vacancy. Amazing view, spacious, peaceful, just enough out-of-the-way, and with breakfast included, a real bargain."
2015-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Beautiful lodge on the river with an amazing room! Would highly recommend!
2015-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"What a fabulous place. The Lodge was a perfect place for some r&r for the two nights we were there. There were no other guests staying at the time, so we had the whole guest area to ourselves, which consisted of an enormous living area with comfy seating, a massage chair and a huge TV, much to my husbands delight which meant he could watch football (soccer) on Sunday morning before we headed out for a walk along and then a dip in the Missouri River, perfection.
We had their largest suite which was wonderful, very comfortable with a large corner sofa, but best of all, were the river views to wake up to.
Rachel and and Joe were wonderful hosts, very welcoming and interesting to talk to and we were astounded at how hard they work and with such ease and grace.
A 5 star breakfast was served each morning, which was an unexpected delight, and among other choices, there were eggs freshly laid by their free range chickens.
Cattleman's club steakhouse, half a mile up the road from the Lodge is a must for any visitor, incredible. I would highly recommend staying here. Rachel and Joe, thank you so much."
2015-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We had a great stay at The Lodge. The room was spacious and comfortable, the view was beautiful. We highly recommend booking a stay here and will gladly return if passing through. Rachel was friendly and accommodating to our changing schedule. The breakfast provided was delicious!"
2015-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Rachel was a great hostess from sending perfect directions to making us feel at home. The lodge was actually more beautiful and comfortable than expected including the kitchenette, group dining and sitting areas and large screen TVs with movies available! Rachel made sure that we had information regarding restaurants and sites to see. We wish we had planned more time in this gorgeous setting!"
2015-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Staying with Rachel and her family was a absolutely awesome experience. Rachel is very responsible and easy to communicate. She sent us detailed instruction on how to find the farm to check in and wait for us even though we arrived quite late. Rachel even made a great breakfast for us the next morning. The farm locates right next to Missouri river and it is very beautiful. The lodge is spacious, clean, and super comfortable. You can find anything you need. My friend and I are really surprised and amazing by staying with Rachel. I would highly recommend Rachel and her farm to anyone traveling around Pierre."
2015-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This is a fantastic place right in an idyllic setting on the Missouri River. The room was spacious and the bed was very comfortable. Rachel is so nice and gracious, and made me feel right at home. And breakfast in the morning was delicious! I would definitely stay here again in a heartbeat. A+++"
2015-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"See my previous review but to reiterate, this is a perfect ""R&R"" owned by a great couple who are so hospitable and just lovely people. Another wonderful breakfast, massage chair time, views out our bedroom window of the river and sunset that take one's breath away. You could not do better!"
2015-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Location, Location, Location! The Lodge at Medicine Creek, which sits on the shores of the Missouri River, belongs to a darling couple, Rachel and Joe, who could not have been more hospitable, welcoming and accommodating. Our bedroom was beautiful, clean and so comfortable with a priceless view of the river. Breakfast was delicious. An unexpected perk was the use of their massage chair which, after long hours of driving, felt wonderful and relaxing. We have spent two nights here and will be back whenever travelling through the area. Highly, highly recommend!!"
2015-06-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"We had a great stay here, wish we could stay longer. Rachel made everything very nice for us. Loved the homemade breakfast, the beds and pillows were awesome. Everything was superb, loved the dinner recommendation for the Cattlemans club."
2015-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This is the second time I stayed at Rachel's lodge, and it was, once again, fantastic. The rooms were large and high-ceilinged with a great view of the river. I had the massive common space to myself for the evening, so I set up on the dining table with my laptop and worked quietly the whole night on my laptop. She was super nice and made us breakfast, which was perfect before we had to get out the door for our meeting. I love staying here, and I'll do it again in a heartbeat the next time I come to Pierre."
2015-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We had an absolutely wonderful stay at The Lodge and would definitely recommend it. The facilities are comfortable and Rachel is very welcoming. The Missouri river is just a few feet away, and the land is just beautiful. Everything was great."
2015-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Staying at Medicine Creek farms it's like...medicine to you :)
Wonderful place and Rachel is a wonderful host with care for every little detail, if you are nearby don't hesitate to make a detour up to Pierre and have a reinvigorated rest, the massage chair is a must do along with delicious morning pancakes."
2015-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We arrived horribly late. Much later than we had intended owing to bad weather. Cell phone reception is patchy on and off the highways so communicating with Rachel was difficult en route. Rachel stayed up until midnight to let us in and showed us our room. She was welcoming and understanding despite the lateness and showed us our room. The rooms are large and airy and are on the banks of a beautiful river. The landscape is stunning. Rachel made us a wonderful breakfast which sustained us for the next chapter of our journey. It was wonderful to meet Rachel and get a small insight into life on the ranch...we wish we could have stayed longer.
2015-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The listing description was totally accurate and it didn't even express how beautiful and peaceful it is there. I didn't realize it was 56 miles off the interstate (my fault) but it was worth the drive!! They greeted us so nicely and made us feel right at home and part of their family. Which they have a lovely one. Our room (suite really) was so nice and private. It was like we were in our own home. Rachel made breakfast and it was so good and we appreciated the time she took to send us on our way with a good breakfast. It is a beautiful lodge on a gorgeous setting. We got to watch the sun set, really pretty. Loved this place and hope we can come back some day."
2015-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We had a wonderful stay at the lodge. Rachel could not have been nicer! Everything was clean, comfy and inviting. The unobstructed view of the river is spectacular and Rachel's Saturday morning breakfast delicious!"
2015-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Very nice place, hosts are obviously experienced and the whole setup is smooth :) Breakfast was great! A little stroll on the riverside is a nice bonus and by Rachels recommendation I had a great steak down the road."
2015-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We loved staying at the Medicine Creek Farms. Our only disappointment was that we could only stay one night. View, bedroom, great room and breakfast was fantastic. One word of caution, the massage chair is addictive."
2014-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Rachel and family were fabulous hosts! We were in the area for a family adventure and they helped us succeed for sure! Her Italian restaurant recommendation ""La Minestra"" was very good. It was also fantastic not having to plan and drive for breakfast. The French Toast was our favorite! We can't wait to return next year now that the kids want to make it an annual adventure. The facility could also make for a perfect family reunion or small destination wedding! Thanks Rachel!"
2014-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"A delightful place to stay in Pierre, SD! Rachel was a great communicator prior to our arrival so we felt welcomed even before our arrival. The description on airbnb is very accurate, but the setting defies words - it is absolutely beautiful. As for the accommodations, everything was spotless. Extras include the ability to use the fridge and freezer - a boon to us with our cross-country supplies in our cooler. Dinner recommendation for the Cattleman's Ranch down the road made for a perfect evening. And a full farm breakfast the next day was an unexpected pleasure. Thanks, Rachel!"
2014-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I don't think I can adequately describe in words how great the Lodge is. If you are planning on staying anywhere around Pierre, definitely stay at the Lodge! I am amazed at how wonderfully spacious and luxurious everything was for such a low price. And it's right on the river! We only stayed for a brief night but commented to each other about how wonderful it would be to take a long, relaxing vacation here. What a special place.

As far as Rachel, I don't think we could have met a sweeter person. We arrived after midnight but she stayed up just for us and gave us a tour and answered all of our questions. She made us a delicious breakfast at the time of our choosing in the morning and also allowed us to use the kitchen even though that was not a listed amenity. We ended up staying for a few hours after checkout because of our long night and were not interrupted or asked to leave at any point. Rachel and the Lodge have my highest possible recommendation."
2014-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"My stay with Rachel was comfortable, clean, and all around great experience. It was my first stay with an Airbnb and I now prefer it over staying in a hotel. Rachel was very hospitable and accommodatating. I am definitely staying here again next time I come to town."
2014-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We had a fabulous stay in Rachel's beautiful home. The room was huge, immaculate and had everything we needed. The view from the room was gorgeous, and if you're a star-gazer, this is the perfect place to be.

Rachel and her family were very accommodating. We felt welcome from the moment we arrived. Breakfast was delicious and Rachel provided large portions of everything. My son had a great time playing with her kids, who were extremely quiet and well-behaved. We found ourselves not wanting to leave, and when we're back in South Dakota in the future, we will definitely come back to Rachel's farm!"
2014-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We had a wonderful time, from the re-assuring round of phone calls for directions to the lumberman's breakfast send off. We recommend the place without reservation."
2014-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Absolutely gorgeous lodge in a fantastic location. Cannot rate our experience highly enough.
We were very late arriving and Rachel and her family accommodated us without any complaint!
The lodge itself is amazing, absolutely spotless and decorated beautifully. The views when we woke up in the morning were out of this world.
Breakfast was excellent and Rachel was an amazing host, genuinely nice person."
2014-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We wanted our ""citified"" kids to get a little taste of country life, and they sure got it at Medicine Creek Farms. When we arrived, the alfalfa had just been cut and it smelled SO good! My daughter and I took some lovely walks down the bank, to the river. All 3 of our kids were fascinated by the chickens and the idea of eating fresh eggs.
Sitting in the middle of all that beautiful country is a really cozy lodge. Our private suite was just the right size for us to share family time and still have some elbow-room.
The breakfasts were absolutely delicious. Our favorite was the ""French Toast Bake"", but the ""Apple Pancakes"" were a very close 2nd.
The gorgeous sunsets over the Mighty Mo were the frosting on the cake. The pictures we took were hang-'em-on your-wall gorgeous!
We look forward to staying at the Lodge again next time we're in the area."
2013-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I had a conference in Pierre and decided this place would be *way* more interesting than a cookie-cutter hotel. It was completely worth it. It's about 15 miles from town, so it took about 20 minutes for me to travel back and forth from the convention site, but it was a beautiful drive along the Missouri. The lodge itself is situated right on the river, with fantastic views. I happened to be the only guest that night, so I practically had the run of the place. The corner suite was huge, with large windows, a patio looking over the river, a massive sectional sofa and a very comfortable queen-size bed. It was also incredibly quiet: the hosts have five children (with number six on the way!), and although my suite was adjacent to their living area, I didn't hear a thing the entire time I was there.

The hosts serve breakfast for guests, but I only had time to avail myself of the coffee before I had to get out the door in the morning. If I'd needed dinner, the lodge is only a few miles down the road from the Cattlemen's Club, a long-established steakhouse along the river.

The hosts were incredibly friendly. I arrived mid-evening, and they were more than happy to let me plug in my Chevy Volt overnight so I could get a full battery charge. They even indulged me on a tour of the place. Their expansion will be amazing when it's done, with a beautiful great room, large fireplace and viewing tower overlooking the river and the prairie. They've even got a hot spring on-size that they'll use to heat the place. I wish I would have been able to stay longer to get to know their family better.

It's obviously geared toward pheasant hunters, but the lodge is a super great choice for anyone traveling to central South Dakota. Because of the way the suites are laid out, it would be especially great for families or large groups traveling together: each suite is sort of a self-contained unit of three bedrooms and two bathrooms, so even groups of six or eight would have room to spread out.

Overall: great experience, friendly people. beautiful location. I'll definitely look for availability the next time I'm in Pierre for business."
2013-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Rachel was a lovely host. She made us feel very welcome and the breakfast was delicious. The view in the morning, overlooking the river, was breathtaking and we slept so well in the peaceful serenity of the lodge."
2013-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We stayed at Rachel's place for one evening. What an awesome experience. She could not not have been more kind. Her place is beautiful and the views are beautiful as well. Would highly recommend her place. You will not be disappointed!!
2013-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"If you are in Pierre, SD, this is where you want to stay. Seriously. Gorgeous location, spacious and comfortable quarters and friendly folks. The large breakfast Rachel served us was the icing on the cake!"
2013-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I LOVED the Lodge and the hosts were incredible. My room was very spacious with lots of light, and exceptionally clean. I really enjoyed the moonrise over the lake beyond the lodge. A surprise treat was a huge morning breakfast to start the day. I definitely recommend this lodge."
2013-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Rachel and her husband went out of their way to provide a immaculately clean, safe and comfortable stay. They even allowed me to park my motorcycle inside behind one of their own vehicles. They are smart hoteliers and generous with their accommodations and hospitality. They will be my first choice if I travel anywhere near the Pierre region of South Dakota. Highly recommended."
2013-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Our second stay with Joe & Rachel, just as nice as the first. If you stay with them, try the massage chair, it's a hoot! As before, beautiful location, clean facility and friendly hosts."
2013-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Rachel and her family have a wonderful place on the banks of the Missouri a bit west of Pierre. The drive out to the property was fantastic as the Missouri winded and bended. I stayed in the corner room and had great views. Breakfast was tasty and Rachel is very friendly and it all went very well.
2013-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We strongly recommend to everyone traveling along I-90 to get out of their track for a while spend some time at Medicine Creek Farms. Rachel and her husband were great hosts and they were soo accommodating even though we arrived late at night. The breakfast is the best that you can find anywhere between east and west coasts. . .
2013-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"If you are going to the Pierre area, this is the only place to stay. Huge room, nice & neat, great hosts. We enjoyed our stay and will return on our next Pierre trip."
2013-06-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"Best breakfast!! Clean and quiet. Beautiful view of the Mississippi River. 12 miles to Pierre for shopping. Be careful if you are on a motorcycle, - the gravel road is challenging."
2012-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We drove across the country and stayed with Rachel and family for a couple of nights. Our stay was relaxing, the house and location are spectacular, the food was great, and it was like staying with friends.

We would definitely stay there again, and would recommend it to anyone who is looking for a more ""personal"" stay."
2012-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I enjoyed meeting Rachel and her family; they were so friendly and accommodating. I was so excited to discover their place, as there aren't many options while driving across South Dakota. The lodge is in the countryside, on a beautiful, secluded spot, but it's not far off the beaten track, which made it very convenient for me since I could only stay one night. I stayed in the queen suite, which was huge with a spectacular view of the river. The bed was extremely comfortable. Breakfast was hearty. The Wyatts are great hosts. I'd definitely stay here again."
2012-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Rachel and her family were amazing hosts. They welcomed me warmly into their home. I slept amazingly well as the bed and room were super comfy. Breakfast in the a.m. was fabulous and a great way to start a new day.

They are great hosts... don't miss a chance to visit their amazing home and meet such wonderful people."
2012-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Driving up to Rachel and Wyatt's at sunset was a beautiful sight. We stayed in the suite overlooking the water. In the morning we were visited by cats and ducks and other animals at our window, which we really enjoyed. And the breakfast was delicious and charged us for a great day. I would highly recommend their place to anyone passing through the region. It was simply lovely."
2012-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"My boyfriend and I stayed at the lodge for one night, but we wish we could've stayed longer! Rachel was a wonderful host. She was welcoming and generous, and she made herself very available. Her husband was very knowledgable about good hikes in their area (of which there are plenty).
The lodge itself was idyllic--very spacious, clean, and comfortably furnished. Moreover, the river-facing windows throughout the place offered amazing views of the Missouri and surrounding landscape.
We especially loved our private room with its own bathroom and walk-out patio. More pluses: two kitchen areas with fridges and freezers; super comfortable bed; adorable kittens playing on the farm; and a delightful porch swing.
Breakfast was as described: hearty--truly a treat after so much traveling.
We wanted for nothing during our stay! Our highest recommendation!"
2012-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"     Medicine Creek Farms is located 15 miles east of the South Dakota capital of Pierre.
     This bed & breakfast is owned & operated by a very nice family that has big dreams to provide lodging for hunters, fisherman and anyone looking to experience nature. Rachel was extremely helpful and informative with any question.
    Not many places can say that they overlook the Missouri River.
The view from the bedroom was amazing. You are able to walk out your bedroom door down a path to the river bank.
    We were wanting to find a jewel off the express-way & we found it. We hope to return but with fishing poles!"
2012-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The lodge is a really comfortable spot to stay, if you find yourself in South Dakota. The landscape is beautiful, it's about 10 minutes from Pierre and Rachel and her husband are very accommodating. They helped us find a place to find some food late in the evening, set us up with a big clean room with a view of the water and made us a big, hearty breakfast in the morning. I highly recommend them."

2023-10-01,5.0,Group trip,"Cody’s place was exactly what we needed for 6 guys, 3 pickups, and 3 boats for a week of fishing!! Plenty of parking space and the air conditioned garage was awesome for working on our gear when the first few days were hot outside!! The inside was spotless and exactly what he said it would be. This would be a great place for a family gathering, or a group of buddies getting together for a hunting or fishing trip!! We will definitely stay at Cody’s place when we are back in SD!!"

2023-06-01,5.0,Group trip,Cody’s place was an excellent base camp for our time around the Pierre area fishing. Cody’s excellent garage space allowed us to keep our boats inside in the evening and enjoy a drive into town for an evening meal and check out other close by attractions. The space had many perks that allowed for a restful time off the water and allowed our group to enjoy each others company. All around great place would highly recommend!

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Lots of room with four bedrooms. Built in 1911, it was in some ways as much a museum as a comfortable home for the three of us."

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,You will enjoy both your room and the very special place this home is.
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Exquisite historic home with generous owners. They were very welcome to me (as a solo, male traveller) and I felt so privileged to stay here compared to a hotel, and to learn about the home and its original owners.
The set-up is great, and one will have access to a water dispenser and mugs, tea/coffee in the next room- this was very convenient. The en-suite bedroom was first-rate, with wifi access and streaming networks. I would genuinely have paid much more to stay here, but it really was meeting the current owners- Ashley and Kevin, in addition to Sherry, that made it a fantastic stay. They are nearby if you need anything, but at the same time leave you to make use of their house (within reason!) It actually wouldn’t have been the same if they were away."

We will stay there again if we go through Pierre."
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The Farr House is a fabulous historic home brought to life and filled with charm for the lucky Airbnb guests that come upon it. Ashley was quick with communication, full of wonderful suggestions for filling our time in Pierre and provided the perfect balance of availability and space during our stay. We will absolutely stay here every time that we are in Pierre and wish hosts and homes like these were available in every place we travel."
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This house is such a treasure! The common areas are historic beauties. I especially loved having my coffee on the shaded front porch and then playing a board game in the evening in the beautiful dining room.
Check-in was secure and easy, using a key pad. The individual room where we stayed had its own key to lock the room, which was a plus. The bathroom is attached to the room, which also gave it added privacy. Also, there is a small walk in closet to put your luggage and hang up your clothes. I really liked that!
This house is also tucked away from traffic, but still only a few blocks from the downtown center. I thoroughly enjoyed my stay and look forward to staying there the next time I’m in Pierre!"

The view from the deck is for stargazing and the sounds of wildlife make you feel you are in the wilderness.The bedroom off the deck has a slider that allows you to open and let in the fresh air and the sounds of nature. Beds were dressed in beautiful linens, and were very comfortable. The house is filled with all the amenities that anyone would need. The refrigerator had condiments, and all the little things you would not remember to bring. Patrick's home is a top notch place to stay. We highly recommend this house for a wonderful experience. Patrick is a wonderful communicator and we did not have to wait anytime for his response to our questions. All in all, a GREAT experience."

2022-07-01,5.0,Group trip,"The place was great. It was clean, spacious, and exactly what we needed. There are only a few minor issues - 1) there was a wasp nest above the garage and midday they would come and swarm out which made getting in and out of the house fun and 2) (owner has no control) the streets leading up to the house are a bit rough. Not high eat your tires-potholes but enough to rattle your brains a little"
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,We really enjoyed our stay! It was perfect for two families with kids. The kids loved the provided toys and the backyard.

Amenities were close by. I had questions during our stay and Patrick was easily accessible and answered quickly.

We hope to make it an annual trip and appreciated how perfectly this home was set up for all ages."
2024-02-01,5.0,Group trip,"Hope’s Anchor Airbnb is absolutely pristine! We would definitely book again in the future! The hosts were absolutely lovely & personable & I loved learning unique little things about the property that Darcy and Andrew shared with me.
It was a bummer that the weather was SO foggy for the 3 days we were there, as I know the scenery out there is beautiful & it would have been nice to see the views, but that is just one of those uncontrollable things. Do beware that if it is rainy/wet/snowy, the muddy roads are not good. We saw 2 vehicles stuck. Again, doesn’t take away from the property at all. This place is 5 stars all day long!!!"
2024-01-01,5.0,Group trip,"We loved the house and really enjoyed our stay. It was warm and cozy on our cold January stay. All the amenities listed were present and the beds were comfy with plenty of extra bedding if it was needed. We needed a place for 8 to stay for a 2-day event in Pierre and it was a bit outside of town. The drive was easy and it really wasn't too far, especially for the cost (way cheaper than it would have been for a hotel for all of us and way more fun since we all got to be together). We will definitely keep it in mind for future trips to Pierre."
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Andrew’s home was perfect for our large family. Big, beautiful kitchen and the house had plenty of space for all of us. We felt right at home.

Excellent hosts and accommodations!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Group trip,"Outstanding and spacious vacation home in a beautiful location! The home exceeded our expectations, especially the kitchen. All seven beds were comfy! This is a brand new home thoughtfully built.

One of the best Airbnb’s we’ve stayed (and we’ve been staying at them over past 3 mo or so). Why you ask?
* Excellent communication with Katie, she was very responsive and friendly
* Quality appliances, dishes, knives etc
* Comfy foam queen bed, (I think the full bed in the front room is a pillow-top)
* strong water pressure in shower (although the standup shower was a bit small, but not at all a deterrent for us)
* loved having front door open with the glass door, let so much light in!
* extra space in the closets was nice to have as we were traveling with quite a bit of bags
* super close to the river and town
* if it’s summer, make sure you go to a Pierre Trappers baseball game! This stadium and hospitality is TOP NOTCH!
If your travels take you to Pierre, and Katie’s place is available, you’ll wanna book and stay here!"

The home was cozy and comfortable and had ample space and beds for all adults to have a large bed of their own for a recharging rest, especially after our back to back hunting days. The beds are all comfortable and exceeded our expectations. These owners really took care to provide quality sleeping for their guests, which can be hit or miss with most Airbnbs. Some hunting party members were even able to do a little early morning telework when they needed in the private downstairs den as us folks who know how to unplug and have a proper vacation enjoyed our socializing upstairs in the main den! Ample space for a few trucks to park up at the garage, great mud room and laundry facilities, and a kitchen just like at home if eating in. This is hands down THE place to stay!"

,,,"Staying at the Lodge was fantastic. I was greeted by Rachel's father, who took me around the grounds and showed me their gorgeous river access, introduced me to their two very friendly dogs, and gave me a tour of the addition they're working on. He also gave me recommendations for food in Pierre. Rachel was helpful, friendly, and warm when I met her, and the room I stayed in was immaculate. There's enough space here for a great group outing, and I would have loved to come here with friends. The breakfast Rachel whipped up for me in the morning was great, and she was a very thoughtful host. I really wish I'd been able to stay longer! I definitely want to come back some day soon."
,,,"The day I arrived in South Dakota I had been on the road for 10+ hours. Rachel made me feel welcome immediately. The lodge is amazing! Wide open spaces, breathtaking views of the Missouri River. Rachel is a kind and thoughtful hostess and I enjoyed my visit, although I would have loved to have had more time to explore the beautiful countryside. I'm so glad I chose this from Airbnb's list!"
