2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Location is perfect!! Great tiny apartment close to downtown. My daughter and I stayed here for a visit to the university. We were pleasantly surprised by 2 deer in the yard. We definitely could have used an extra mirror or two, the only one is located in the bathroom. Parking isn’t the greatest right in front of the apartment, luckily we had a small SUV that could fit in tiny spots."

2024-02-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"It worked well for us - honestly tho the pictures looked way better than the place does in person. Its pretty small with old carpet but cute. One kid slept on the couch which was not very comfortable, I just stuffed the cracks with a towel to make it flatter and added a comforter below so it wasn't so hard. Had to go hunting for some linens and blankets for the couch but found them. The kitchen was really well stocked and I appreciated the provided coffee and there was extras too that we didn't use. So kind. No problem parking. It's a small apartment that is part of a larger house so a lot of people around but no noise. It was overall a very nice stay."

2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Jennifer is rightly a super host. Her place is full of light, super clean, stocked with safe cleaning supplies . The apartment is centrally located but quiet. We were treated cordially by the long term tenants of the building, who jumped to assist us ""older folks"" with information and kind welcome.
This dwelling has real bathroom supplies, enough kitchen basics to get through supper and breakfast in a last minute stay with high quality, no dollar store stuff here. A strong air purifier runs 24/7. Cable and internet are top notch.
This place embodies everything lovely about the ""Missoula vibe.""
A special Shout-out to Jennifer: when I expressed concern about their second floor location and how we slightly older folks might be a bit worried: We stayed in for a snow day Tuesday. We ventured out Wednesday with ice trax in hand.....and the steps were clear and dry along with the entire walkway.....and we slept through it all.
This is a wonderful place."
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Jennifer was helpful, friendly, and very responsive! When I asked for a recommendation for a local yoga studio, she responded with a great recommendation —and left a yoga mat for me to use. Great location and great host!"

2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My SigO and I visited my mother in Missoula this past week, and stayed at Jennifer’s apartment near downtown. The location was central to every place we wanted to visit: a great grocery store, restaurants, shops (Rockin’ Rudy’s is around the corner), First Friday Art Walk, parks, mom’s house, etc.
The apartment was super cute, cozy and clean. The bathroom and kitchen were well stocked with all of the necessities, including a coffee grinder and French press. I’m sure we used more of the supplied coffee beans than the average guests. Haha.

2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"My husband and I road-tripped from Seattle to Missoula with our 3-week old baby for the wedding of our dear friend. Our stay at Jennifer’s place made it all possible. We could venture out on foot to the Hip Strip, River front walks, and beyond. There was plenty of space for the pack-and-play and the full kitchen had everything we needed to cook a few times for ourselves during our four night stay. The bed was very comfortable and the soaps in the bathroom were high quality- that sounds like a funny thing to highlight, but when you don’t get much sleep with a newborn, the morning shower with nice soap makes all the difference… as does the coffee and tea that were stocked in the kitchen. Jennifer has really thought of everything! Thank you!"
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Jennifer's apartment is the ideal place to spend time in Missoula! I felt like I was in my own nest there, the quiet location is ideal - end of street/cul-de-sac with parking out front, couple blocks from the ""hip strip"" with great restaurants and the riverfront trails, and downtown across the bridge. One block from a neighborhood grocer, and very private. The apartment is adorable, with personal touches and fully stocked kitchen great to cook in. Big comfy chairs for coffee in the morning sun. Comfy bed. Really just a sweet place to stay. Highly recommended!!!"

2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Jennifer makes staying at this very comfortable and convenient home super easy. Awesome host, quiet setting, great access - lots to like about this location!"
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This ""hip strip"" location hosted by Jennifer is the perfect location for a solo traveler or a couple. it is minutes to everywhere - downtown, the river, the eponymous Hip Strip, the campus - but at the seem time it is quiet and makes sleeping and relaxing easy.
The location is very well stocked, especially if you are a coffee enthusiast. I found organic fair trade caffeinated and decaf coffees, multiple sweeteners, and even a choice of a ""Mr Coffee"" type brewing device and a French press.
the furniture is neo-retro, and is both funky and comfy. I am a picky person when it comes to bedding, and the main bed, its linens, and its pillows all get high marks from me.
P.S. I lovedd the ""Missoula Intersections"" poster on the living room wall that I found it on Etsy and ordered one for myself and one for my brother."

2021-09-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,Really cute little apartment in a great location downtown. Jennifer was super hospitable and made the entire process very simple and easy. She also provided lovely Missoula recommendations which we enjoyed (especially Clyde Coffee!). There is a park across the street which was perfect as we were traveling with kids! I'd definitely recommend Jennifer's place for two people but it would be a tight squeeze for more - the couch futon wouldn't be great for more than one night.

Great location close to everything we wanted and needed, very clean, very well priced, and had all the little extra amenities we needed.

2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Naomi has so many sweet touches. I found her place to be perfect for the road weary. Very clean, open space to set my bags down, colorful and inviting space, clear directions and a cold beverage (or hot) waiting. The chips and salsa were a sweet touch too. In my opinion, even if my husband had been there, we would not have felt cramped. We would've had plenty of room to watch tv, to stretch out w our travel yoga mat, make a little dinner. I love that the bathroom is not close to the bed so even though it's small ,one feele like you enjoy privacy in the bathroom. It's a magic space that is quite small but does not feel that way at all. The water pressure in the shower is great and the sheets terrific. Naomi is a thoughtful and amazing host! I'm looking foward to staying there again."

2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Great, cozy place filled with wonderful natural light..... I would stay again. Felt relaxed and safe and sweet after two weeks of wilderness and intense outdoors exertion. As a woman traveling solo, this is just what I needed. To be able to sleep in the fresh and soft linens, take a long shower, and catch up on emails (good wifi) after being out of touch with folks was relaxing and nice. The kitchen had it all and I could cook meals in and not have to go out. The sunlight coming in (I loved that sooo much!), being up in the trees at bird level with lilacs right outside, the little flowers from the garden left in a vase and obviously just picked. Home-made salsa left in the fridge with a bag of chips to go with... (what a sweet surprise!) You can tell she just loves really following through and going the extra mile to REALLY make sure you have everything you need - and more. She is very thorough in her communication and I appreciated that being a detail-oriented person myself. LOVED."

Naomi had really great amenities/touches like a huge selection of tea, seltzers, etc. great location. Naomi was a superb host with recommendations and communication. We'd suggest staying with Naomi!"

2020-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Naomi’s loft was clean and inviting. The sofa bed was much more comfortable than I had anticipated (definitely high end) with soft linens and a generous amount of pillows. Naomi checked in with us periodically and seemed genuinely invested in our well-being. Will bring my slippers next time because the floors were quite cold in November being above the garage. Would definitely recommend.
2020-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Naomi respected my space, but also checked in a couple of times to make sure I had everything I needed and to ask if I had any issues or questions. The space was well-equipped, comfortable, cozy and quiet. I very much enjoyed my time there."

2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This Airbnb is an absolute jewel!!! The first thing that I noticed was how sparkling clean the studio was. Everything was shiny, beautiful and the floors literally gleamed. Then it was the little touches, like extra pillows and towels, and I was thrilled with the color therapy dual showerheads.
I really appreciated how responsive Naomi was when I needed something for the kitchen, which was sweet and easy to use. I loved how everything was labeled which really set my mind at ease. It’s obvious that Naomi is conscientious and adheres to all the safety protocols. It was the exact sanctuary that I needed and it was wonderful to have the whole place to myself.
I loved being able to get fresh greens out of the garden for my morning shake. The location was perfect for me. Very central and it’s close to a health-food store and a wonderful river walking path. I would definitely stay here again and would love to come back and stay during each season."
2020-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Naomi has thought of all the little things. Every detail and amenity was available that I could think of, things I didn’t even know I needed until I did! It was a quiet retreat with food walkable distances. Naomi was very responsive and even let me check in early which was a HUGE help. The bed was pretty comfortable for a sofa bed and everything worked well. Very grateful for my stay at Naomi’s place; is go back in a heartbeat."
2020-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was the perfect space for my mother-in-law’s visit - she had everything she needed and appreciated all of Naomi‘s special touches! We live just a block away so are quite partial to the location, but it’s really a great way to be close to everything but still have that quiet neighborhood vibe. Will be using Naomi’s place again soon!"
2020-07-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Naomi’s place was the perfect weeklong getaway! The apartment is well-equipped with a cute kitchen, comfortable desk and work area, and beautiful grounds/gardens. It’s a short walk to the river, river path, and an excellent cidery! I’d love to stay again!"
2020-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Naomi's studio was absolutely perfect for what we needed this week.

She was SUPER responsive to our needs, and could not have been more accommodating."
2020-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This cute studio apartment was perfect for our brief stay in Missoula. It was clean, provided privacy, and was well located (we walked to downtown)."
2020-06-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"A comfortable loft space in a quiet neighborhood. Naomi has thought of just about everything to make such a small space work for one to two people. We appreciated the good communication, the efficient cooking area, ventilation in summer (and fan), and space to sit and work for one person if you choose to keep the pull-out couch open during the day. The outside chairs on the landing entrance to the loft were nice although scenery is not that enticing from up there and we didn’t use them. You can get around Missoula easily from this location via Mountain Line bus. We really were happy staying there even for an extended time."
2020-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"One of my favorite airbnb finds so far! Excellent value. Place was charming and clean. Naomi was an A+ host, gracious and accommodating. Would recommend and would stay again!"
2020-05-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"We stayed with Naomi for over a month and felt at peace the entire time. She is a graciously hospitable host, accessible whenever for whatever. Her property is located in an easy-going, quiet neighbourhood with landscape views in all directions--and the studio itself has a sunset facing deck that provided us serene evenings throughout our stay. If you're looking for somewhere to call home, even if just for a moment in time, Naomi's place--with its sense of warmth--will be just that. We already miss it!"
2020-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This place is perfect for a weekend getaway either solo or with one other person. Naomi provided snacks that were dairy free without even asking which is incredible because I am dairy free and have the hardest time finding things to snack on. She also decorated the place for Valentine’s Day because we were there over that weekend. She is a very thoughtful host and replied back to any questions I had within 5 minutes! I would definitely recommend this place and will for sure be staying here again if I’m ever in Missoula. Great location and easy access to pretty much everywhere ya need to go.
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Matt and Ashley were very nice. At one point we had a few glitches with the TV due to the internet wifi and Matt purchased a new Router and installed it while we were there to accomadate us. They take pride in the property.
Very nice stay. Would definitely stay there again. Thanks Matt."

2023-07-01,4.0,Stayed about a week,"I was confused about several details when I arrived because my AirBnB app was having problems and Matt was communicating almost solely through that. Once Matt and I talked, he was fantastic about appreciating my situation and quickly put together a printed binder of info that could now be left in the house for any renter to find. Kudos! And the house itself has a nice layout, very comfy. The A/C was provided only through the bedroom, but letting it run with the door open did take care of the rest of the house. The location was very convenient in many ways."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Matt was a fantastic host. He was extremely responsive to any questions. We felt right at home!

2023-06-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"Matt's place was great for the quick stay I had. I didn't get to utilize the cute patio tho. It was clean and comfortable.
A few things that would be good for guests to know, is I had a hard time finding local stations on TV, and that could've been operator error (lol), and the sprinkler system came on around 3-3:30 and we had to dodge them getting out of the house and into the car.
I'd stay again!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Fantastic find! A great little place in a quiet area and very close to two trails.

2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great place off the beaten path - but still close to everything. Quiet, private, and clean. Matt went above and beyond to accommodate us with a few of our (unplanned) odd requests. I would choose this place again when in Missoula. Perfect place for 2-4 people."
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"Matt’s place was perfect for my 2 1/2 week stay. Very comfortable and clean with all the amenities one might need.

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This was the cutest place to stay that I've ever experienced. The description and pictures were spot on. We went to a concert at The Wilma and being able to just go downstairs to the venue was amazing. We had drinks and an appetizer at the restaurant, Scotty's Table, in the building and the service was wonderful. The Wilma Digs felt like home away from home and I really hope to have the opportunity to stay there again. The experience and the memories were well worth the price."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The airbnb was great. It was right in the middle of downtown and my wife and I enjoyed the spot. We were able to walk to every place and did not need to Uber. The place felt safe and had a perfect view of the city and mountains. That’s is the main reason I chose this location.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We visit Missoula often and this is by far our favorite place to stay! It's beautiful, peaceful and close to everything. Nicole is always very responsive and friendly and we can't wait to be back"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My recent stay at this apartment in downtown Missoula was fantastic! The check-in process was a breeze thanks to the easy-to-follow instructions provided by the host. The apartment itself may be small, but it's cleverly designed with great amenities that make the most of the space.
The decor was stylish and modern, and the furniture was comfortable and in excellent condition. However, I must mention that while the bed was cozy, it wasn't the most comfortable I've slept on. I would recommend bringing your own pillows if you're particular about them.
One minor issue was that the room could get a bit stuffy due to the radiator, but opening the windows helped to alleviate this. Despite these small quirks, my overall experience was very positive.
The best part of this apartment is its unbeatable location. It's close to numerous shops, restaurants, the hip strip, and the river, making it easy to explore everything that downtown Missoula has to offer. I enjoyed strolling along the riverban"

2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had an amazing time! Being from a more rural area, it was really neat to be up on the 6th floor and see the surrounding city of Missoula and the mountains beyond. It snowed while we were there too. The bed was extremely comfortable! We will miss that bed! It was an easy walk to many restaurants and shops from the Wilma building. Scotty’s Table is actually inside the building on the parking lot level. It was a great place to eat. We had everything we needed right there. I would highly recommend this spot for any couple!"
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We’ve been lucky to stay in several condos in the Wilma and this is by far the best. The corner location on the 6th floor gives you an incredible view of downtown and the river side as well. The place is so adorable and thoughtfully put together. Love everything about it!
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I am hesitant to write an honest review…because that will mean more people will follow find this condo. We stayed here when we saw a concert at the Wilma. Obviously the perfect location! The place was clean, appropriately stocked with amenities, and the bed was super comfy. Definitely a plus to borrow an umbrella - I forgot my raincoat and it rained while we were in town. We will definitely stay here again!"

2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great little oasis in the middle of downtown Missoula; half a dozen restaurants and bars just within a block of the building, but up on the 6th floor you feel like you're away from it all. This place really has everything."

We rented a car so we could drive to around and site see however there is no need if you are looking for a great downtown spot. We highly recommend a short walk to Veera’s donuts! If we are ever back in Missoula we will 100%rent this place again. Thank you Nicole for hosting us.
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,The place was great ! Looked just like the photos and I really appreciated the fast responses. Would definitely stay again the next time I’m in town !

2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"If the code to the unit could be the last four of your phone number it would make it easier to remember, if you have control of the code. Also the elevator took multiple attempts to work. Once we found the lock box for the entry key and saw that it was under the bridge it made sense, but there was some confusion to the location and the parking. The location feels very safe and many cute shops and restaurants within an easy walk."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Nicole’s place was perfect for my husband & I. We only stayed one night but it was exactly as described. We enjoyed walking to dinner & exploring the town my parents grew up in. We would definitely stay again!

Sometimes stays are not as bright as they appear in the photos, but this one really is. Many small touches throughout show that they care about their guests. Ice in the freezer was my husband’s favorite. Quality coffee and liquid creamers made for good mornings for me. And I just loved the vibe of the building, especially the Otis elevator. If we have cause to visit Missoula again, we would certainly see if Wilma Digs was available."

2023-06-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,We’d stay here again. It was clean. Nice location if you want to hang out downtown. We stayed on a busy weekend so parking at the spot for the apartment was a bit of a pain since the lot was full for most of the night we arrived.

2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Went to Missoula for a concert and stayed in Nicole’s studio. Upon arriving, I can say we did get slightly confused trying to find parking but after a couple minutes we did figure it out. After that it was smooth sailing and getting to the room was very easy. It was the perfect little spot. So many windows and so much natural lighting, I found most of my time spent in the studio was on the bench watching the activity outside. Perfect location for everything. We were only there for a night but we had everything we needed. Would recommend to anyone who is looking for a cozy spot right in the heart of Missoula!"

2022-06-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"Wilma digs was one of my favorite stays. The building is gorgeous and the apartment couldn’t have been any cuter. There were games and books, and we all loved the window seat. I would love to stay again someday."
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great location for downtown Missoula. Condo is well equipped if you plan to cook some of your own meals. The apartment is very secure. Keys required to enter the building and codes required to operate the elevator and get in the unit. The parking garage is large and easy to access.
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This is a fantastic place to explore Missoula. Location can't be beat; it overlooks a park that hosts events and is an easy walk to everywhere. Bed and furniture are very comfortable. Check in is a bit more complex than some places, but Nicole sent a very informative PDF that I was able to use. The free parking is a great bonus that will save you a lot of cash! We hope this great bad will be available next time we're headed to the west."

2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"A great spot for a single traveller or a couple, this bright condo has more storage space than you'd first think!
Located halfway between the two fun shopping areas, you're right at the bridge and can walk everywhere in town. The view out one side is the river where you can wander to in less than five mins to catch the surfers and kayakers on the wave. The other views are of the town and city, and there's a nice reading nook in one of the windows.
We visited the one full week of the year that it rained every.day so we were glad to have the included underground parking.
Nicole and Andy are responsive and were quick with answers/suggestions to any of our Qs.
I'd stay here again in future.
Thanks!!"

It's a very comfortable place for resting, for cooking and dining, and especially the bed for sleeping. Wow, we want to get a mattress like that! The location is excellent. The place is as described and well appointed. If you are a walker, the campus and downtown are easily accessible. My wife and I did a 3.8 mile walk through campus (which I attended 45 years ago) then toward downtown for a nice dinner at Ciao Mambo Italian restaurant, ice cream at Sweet Peaks, and finally strolled around downtown before heading back to the house. Missoula is an energetic and exciting town. People were out and about all over town for a Wednesday. We highly recommend the Poplar Retreat for a relaxing and comfortable stay in Missoula."

After opening the coded lock, was greeted with a very inviting space. From the attractive wood floors to the sleek loveseat, the more than ample kitchen, the very comfortable bed, and the deep claw foot bathtub, we were pleased and impressed with it all. What's more, it was pretty darn cold outside, but the house was toasty warm.
The location is perfect for access to the University and downtown, both of which are walkable.
Looking for a comfortably appointed, reasonably priced, easily accessible place in Missoula? Then you can't go wrong with Eric's place."

Eric was exceptionally quick to respond and accommodated a special parking request.
I would highly recommend staying here."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Eric's place is great. I don't know when it was built or refurbished but it looks pretty much brand new. Everything was super clean and tidy. I didn't have a car but it's a pretty quick walk into town. Great price. And there's a fly shop nearby if you're looking to get out on the river. Thanks Eric!
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Erics place was just what i needed for a base camp before a trip to Glacier. Easy to get downtown for food and the many local breweries! Wifi was solid with no issues. I did not try zoom calls so i cannot speak to zoom.
Good spot for a couple or solo traveler to lay their head while visiting Missoula. Oh and the price was great.
Located in a quiet area, easy to feel safe."
2023-09-01,4.0,Stayed one night,Eric's place was exactly what I needed for my one night stay
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Our stay was great! The place was private and easy to find. I was most afraid of finding street parking, but there is a very accessible spot in front of the garage in the alley (they gave us a giant truck at the airport and it still fit just fine). You must use the bathtub. I am in love with that tub.
The bed was very comfy, and there is a lot of closet space. We were here for a wedding, so it was nice to hang things up.

2023-09-01,2.0,Stayed one night,"The night and daytime trains pass every hour that make their horn sound for 2 minutes. This was really very loud so we didn't sleep not even with earplugs. This should be mentioned in the listing. On the fridge and around the window frames there was a lot of dust and dead insects. There were too few cooking pots to prepare a full-fledged meal. A cleaning fee of 38 euros is very high in this case because you have to take away your garbage yourself, wash the towels and do the dishes. The accommodation itself was cozy and pleasant. Sorry about the area."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,There weren’t any issues finding this cute guest house. Eric called and helped me when I couldn’t find the instructions to get in. Listed lots of good local restaurants :)

2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The house very nice and the bed was comfortable. Bathroom had a bear claw tub/shower with good water pressure. Perfect size little guest house for 2. Location was the main attraction for us, as we drove to Missoula from Helena to see Nathaniel Rateliff and the Night Sweats at Kettlehouse Amphitheater. It's right off the Interstate and only a mile away from the Top Hat in case you plan to take the shuttle (wish we did that).
I can't say enough about how cute this place was, how quiet the neighborhood was, and there was place plenty of parking. Will go back in the future! 👍👍"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"A most comfortable home with everything you need. Comfortable linens/bed, clean bathroom, laundry, and well equipped kitchen, everything a traveler needs for a comfortable stay. You'll find it as an ideal home for multiple days.
NOTE: For the noise sensitive, while the neighborhood is sleepy and quiet, there is a freight train that passes multiple times during the day/night. This train will blow its horn while going over a nearby crossing, so if you are noise sensitive, this may be a problem for you."

2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We loved this little house. Perfect size for my husband and I. We came to Missoula for MaggotFest Rugby Tournament and we were very grateful to have a private quiet place to return to after busy days.
CLEAN, everything was perfectly clean and not a speck of dirt or dust anywhere!
Kitchen had dishes, pots and pans which was a welcome surprise for us. Lots of storage and a very nice bathroom :)
The hottest day was Saturday and Eric went out of his way to put not one but TWO air conditioners in so we were comfortable. We were very grateful.
Only downsides are that the curtains were almost sheer, so the living room felt like everyone could see us... and that the water heater did not last very long.
9.5 out of 10 for us!!!!! We will definitely be renting again next year for MaggotFest if it's available!!! Thank you very much Eric!"

2022-09-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"We stopped at Eric's place for a night just to break up the drive between Yellowstone and Glacier and to just check out Missoula. So this place was perfect for a night. It was small (which we knew) with TV and coffee pot in the bedroom so I don't think most folks will want to spend a lot of time in the apartment. On the flip side, it was a great location. Right off the highway (NO highway noise at all), less than a mile to main street with lots of bars/restaurants and if you want a little exercise, it is two blocks away from the Mt. Jumbo Trailhead which we go up early and hiked. The place was emaculate and the coffee beans and grinder were an awesome touch. There was a little yard (kudo's to Eric on the lawn!!!) with chairs. We sat outside in 72F weather and enjoyed a cocktail and sat in the late September sun. After that, we drove into town, had a nice dinner and the next morning we went for a hike and were on the road by 9am. Short but sweet stay!"
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"A really nice little spot close to downtown Missoula! Eric and Sally are great hosts, super kind and helpful.

They also have guest parking, so it was very convenient to park my car outside. The neighborhood was beautiful, facing the mountains and very quiet. As someone traveling alone, I was deeply grateful for their recommendations and their quick response time. 5/5 stars. Would highly recommend!"

We would definitely recommend."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was such a lovely airBNB that had all of the amenities I would ever need.

2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"My husband and I enjoyed every moment staying in this modern farmhouse suite! Thayer and Jaclyn were so passionate about making sure our stay was everything we wanted it to be, and it sure was! They were accommodating and made themselves available whenever we needed them. The mountain views were incredible, we were close enough to downtown to enjoy the night life, but far enough away to get away from it for a peaceful night in. If you’re heading to Missoula, you’ll absolutely want to stay here!!"

We booked last minute and although Thayer and Jaclyn were busy that day, they were able to go out of their way to accommodate us which we were very thankful for! Their place was nothing short of perfect! From the views to the ambiance, it was a great stay! They even have a noice canceling machine next to the bed that allows you to pick any sound you’d like to fall asleep to! Though it was not needed, it added to a great nights sleep! I would highly recommend staying here!"
2022-09-01,4.0,Stayed one night,Location is close to town and and quiet. Has a nice balcony to sit outside. Good value for this popular area. Small and cozy rental. Kitchen is equipped with a hotplate for cooking. I would recommend this rental for someone that is looking for a good value that offers some nice accommodations. There is a steep & narrow spiral staircase up to the rental which could be an issue for some people. We are in excellent shape but it was difficult to take up heavy or larger luggage. Other reviews mentioned loud noises at night. We personally didn't find this a problem with a fan running. However there are ear plugs and a noise machine for those who would like to use them.

2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"What a great place to relax. Thayer and Jocelyn were very nice and accommodating. I was only there one night, but they very much made me feel welcome.
On to the important stuff… first of all, the description and pictures are 100% accurate. Next, it is extremely clean and well stocked. They have thought of most everything.
What else is important? The unit is very well laid out. Info on WiFi, heat, etc. is easy to find. The bed was comfortable and I loved the white noise machine. Yes, it is close to the interstate, but I did not find it intrusive.
The convenience store across the street was super handy, too.
Downtown is a quick 5 minute drive and Thayler recommended a great place to eat too.
Overall, this is how you want your AirBnb experience to be."

2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Small but nicely appointed apartment! Clean fullsize bathroom and porch looking over hiking/walking trail a plus. As noted, it is next to highway. With the sound machine provided (and earplugs if desired) I did not have trouble sleeping, but some may. New kitchen but remider as noted in pictures/list hot plate (no stove/oven) and spiral staircase to get up. A few games, and good visitor/local information binder as well as host responsivenes made it an enjoyable stay!"
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Thayer's place in Missoula was perfect! Super clean, modern but cozy at the same time. I loved having the balcony to walk out on.

2021-10-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,Was a really nice place and east to find. Only thing was the bed was extremely uncomfortable. Also the hand towel rack in the bathroom wasn’t attached to anything so kept falling when you tried to wash your hands which was annoying

2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This was a really cozy and clean place to stay. Unfortunately I was only passing through and only stayed one night. The kitchen seemed well stocked and the bed was really comfy. You can hear the traffic from I-90 but I was able to sleep through it, and the black out curtains were amazing! I'd love to stay here a little longer next time if I'm in the area."
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Beautiful place! I loved visiting and hope to stay again.
2021-10-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Cozy place with all the amenities required. Host greeted us with a bottle of wine, water and snack. Board games and books available. Very clean. Easy check-in and good communication with host. Close to highway exit and lots of parking. 7 min ride to downtown Missoula, very convenient. From living room we do not hear cars on highway but from bed room, cars passing can be a nuisance for falling alseep. Would recommend."

2021-09-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Nice cozy clean apartment. Nice view- small kitchen with microwave and two burners. Keurig coffee pot was nice- bring creamer and sugar though since none was provided. The tv had good wifi connection and we were able to download our Disney plus app to watch select shows! Showers worked great- amenities like hairdryer and flat iron were even provided- nice touch! Host was great keeping in touch if we needed anything. Be forewarned that rumbling and shaking happened each night around 10-11pm - possible train nearby???

2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,A great little place to stop near Missoula. The apartment is located in East Missoula but it is quick and easy to get to off I90. Super clean and ready for your stay. Emily and Thayer have thought out all their guests needs. I did take take a star off for “location” because the apartment is located on the back side of a convenience store stop.
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great place and location! Had a cute little kitchen and a bottle of wine! Perfect for the two of us!
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great place!
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Clean, cozy and stocked with everything you might need including coffee for the morning. Also within a very short walking distance of a convenient store. We chose this listing because of the close proximity to Kettle House Amphitheater. The host shared some great tips regarding travel to and from the venue as well as what to expect once arriving. Authentic and friendly hosts, quick to reply to messages, would happily choose this listing again!"
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was the perfect place to stay for a couple days to explore Missoula. The space is the perfect size to accommodate a couple people, and had everything you could need -- even a curling iron! It's close to town, the university, and is very conveniently located right off the freeway. The hosts were super communicative and helpful with the check-in process, and also offered assistance should I need anything. I saw a couple reviews noting the noisiness at night, but it didn't bother me at all -- for anyone who's not used to complete silence, it will likely be a pleasant white-noise. Will definitely stay again if I find the need to stay in the area in the future!"
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Great location, and the little studio is adorable. It’s not as quiet as I thought it would be, especially at nice, but that didn’t seem to bother my partner as much as me. Very close to everything you need in Missoula, I’d highly recommend."

2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This was the perfect resting stop on our long drive to Yellowstone’s West entrance. It was clean, extremely comfortable, and we were greeted with a charming assortment of wine and snacks. When I couldn’t find the corkscrew , they sent one over in about 20 minutes and saved the day! The stairs were a bit narrow/steep, but this was not an issue for us."

2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This AirBnB was very cute and just what we wanted! The inside was so cute and the AC was on when we entered (it was a very hot day). There was a bottle of wine and some snacks waiting for us as well (included). Wifi with password was easy to find and connect to. And there was a hair straightener we could use, which was so fun after a week of camping! We didn't spend too much time at the AirBnB, as we went into town for the evening. But we enjoyed the time there. I could hear some traffic at night as it is close to the freeway, but was still able to sleep fine. It was easy to make coffee in the morning in the small kitchen. It would have been too far to walk downtown, but was just a 5 minute drive away. We enjoyed this place and would definitely stay here again!"

A country mouse may say the interstate is a bit close for comfort, but noise is tolerable unless you're a very light sleeper. Great hosts, very quick replies and great communication, very helpful for recommending whatever you need. This place is a great base camp for exploring town, or farmers market, or the nearby outdoors. Thanks!"

We found this place to be very clean, comfortable, and perfectly sized for one to two people. The bathroom and shower were excellent.

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Mike's home was just what we needed for our extended graduation weekend in Missoula. He was so quick to respond to my inquiries, and very personable when we met him. We stayed in the Goose Room w/ a private bath, and it was perfect for our needs. The bed was very comfortable too. Thank you again!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Mike was a top-tier host! So communicative and kind and helpful. Would highly recommend him to anyone visiting Missoula. The space was great and cozy, and the kitchen was easy to use."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Thank you Mike for a great experience!
This was my first stay at an AirBnB and if every host is like Mike, then I will be staying at more. The process was very easy and after I booked my room, Mike contacted me immediately and told me that a guest was staying longer and offered another room, with a private bathroom for a little more money. It was a bargain!
The house, my room and bathroom were very clean and comfortable. I had my own key for the lock and access to the kitchen, living room, which had an inset fireplace, and laundry if I wanted. I was in Missoula visiting my son so I only saw Mike the first night and the day before I left. Both times, I felt comfortable with him and wished that I had been able to spend more time with him but my son had plans for me! I was able to meet two other guests who were also friendly. The atmosphere at Mike’s felt like a home away from home.
Do NOT hesitate when deciding if you should stay at Mike’s. You SHOULD!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was an amazing place to stay! Everything was comfortable and clean. The room door locked from the outside which I really appreciate and there was plenty of amenities like access to a washer/dryer and kitchen. The room we stayed in had its own bathroom with amazing water pressure in the shower and little shampoos were provided. The walls were a little thin so we could occasionally hear other guests but that’s to be expected and other than that it was completely perfect, such great value."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Mike is a great host and engaging person. We plan on staying with him whenever we are in Missoula. Honestly the world needs more people like him.
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"Mike's home is a level above Super Host. I was at Mike's for 5 months as I transitioned to Missoula. Mike is a rare human in that he's sincerely thoughtful about your comfort. His home is extra clean and comfortable and is situated in a quiet neighborhood in the best part of Missoula. His local suggestions from bakeries and restaurants to the nearest biking trails and events are better than a professional guide. You can choose quiet solitude or mingle with Mike and other guests in harmony. Mike was a chef and you'll find all the latest kitchen gear featured on America's Test Kitchen to cook with. Plus, Mike always seems to be making fresh bread so the whole house smells like freshly baked bread and so beautifully done like a photo from a cookbook. There is no better home in Missoula to stay for one night or several months as I did. Mike has all the amenities, modern tasteful furnishings and much more and you'll be more comfortable and cared for than the finest hotels in America."

2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The Goose room was a dream come true after a long, smoky drive from Billings. The king bed was so comfortable with perfect linens and fluffy pillows. The private attached bathroom was a sweet spot to decompress in a hot shower. It was a delight to leave my mess of luggage in the walk-in closet with dresser drawers, where I could shut the door and relax. The desk in the bedroom was charming and utilitarian with a comfortable chair. Fast wi-fi and a window unit for extra A/C comfort. The kitchen was fully stocked and labeled with shareable items. The living room was so comfortable for reading and winding down. The designated parking spot and keypad entry made the whole check-in a breeze. The neighborhood was lovely and close to everything and as a cherry on top, Mike was a fantastic resource on what’s cool as well as a pleasantly social but unobtrusive host. I enjoyed my time here greatly and *will* be a repeat visitor the next time I’m in Missoula! Excellent place to be!"

We had a great stay and highly recommend Mike’s place!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"Mike is the BEST! Super friendly, responsive, easy-going. The room I stayed in was the master (Goose Room) which was very comfortable. Mike had installed a window A/C unit before I arrived which worked like a champ. I was able to use the desk for my remote job. Everything in the kitchen is labeled which is amazing. I had plenty of fridge space even with others staying in the house. The washer/dryer was super convenient. All in all, one of my favorite stays to date. I hope I can come back sometime!!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Mike's house was full of everything you need and was clean and organized. Mike was very flexible with my checkout time and my flight.

Ann's friendly demeanor made us feel instantly at home, and the space was absolutely perfect for my partner and I. Beautiful views out the window to a lovely back yard, black out curtains in case we wanted privacy, and the location is close to all of the best things that downtown Missoula has to offer.

2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Ann's place was extremely comfortable. It had coffee, and also everything we didn't know we needed. Amenities such as bathrobes and bath salts, charcuterie boards and cutlery, fluffy comforters and knit booties, made us feel pampered and relaxed. It is quiet as a church. There are lots of windows, but also black shades that can be drawn for near-complete darkness. Best of all, there are actual paintings that are actually good and a lovely, eclectic pottery selection that honors Missoula's ceramic heritage -- try finding that in a hotel."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Quaint little place.
Ann clearly shows pride in her space."

Short walk to downtown coffee shops, restaurants, the public library and much more.
Area rugs on concrete floor, with warm slippers available for use. :)

2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I had a quick stay in Missoula for a work conference. The Air Bnb ended up being right around the corner from where my conference was held. The location couldn’t have been any better. The bed was also extremely comfy, I shared the bed with my husband and toddler while being 33weeks pregnant and I had a great nights rest."
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Ann’s studio was a great place to stay for my visit to Missoula. I was in town for the Big Sky Film Festival and it was easy to walk to the screenings and workshops. It’s close to everything and very charming. I especially liked choosing which of the beautiful hand-thrown mugs to drink my morning coffee out of. Thank you!
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Ann was so kid! Cute, cozy place. Very close to downtown."
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Ann's room with bathroom was fully stocked (really too stocked) with items you might need/want during your stay. The bed was comfy and the location close enough to walk to all things Hip-Strip and the UofM. Perfect place for a night or two. The bedroom has some really cool items but there is so...much...stuff (books, chachkies, linens) that it makes it hard to keep track of your own things and find places to put them. The bathroom is very dark. There's only one bulb above the mirror which makes it challenging to put on make-up or take a shower after dark. The room is located on the first floor. If there are guests upstairs, you will hear them. There is a designated parking pad close to the door which is great. Maneuvering out of the neighborhood is a bit tricky due to Front Street being a one way street. You have to cheat the wrong way (just a hair) if you want to go downtown. Not a deal breaker but a need to know. I met Ann real quick and she was helpful and Missoula cool!"

2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Came to Zoo town for a show at The Wilma. Small, quaint spot, close to town, but far enough away to get away from the hustle and bustle city vibes. Ann was sweet and flexible with check-in/out. Would definitely recommend to a friend, and stay again if available!

Convenient walk to paved trail; one bridge away from dog park on the river. An easy walk.
Traffic noise from busy street bridge (next door & slightly above) and train whistle (~6 blocks away) was not an issue for us. Its Fall and windows were kept closed.
Lovely overnight stay."

We had to take our truck in for some surprise repairs which caused us to have to stay longer than expected. Ann tried to get us another apartment but everything she had was booked.

2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Ann’s sanctuary is exactly as shown and described. Comfortable, clean, convenient, & cozy. Highly recommend…my third stay, says it all!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Great value! Somehow peaceful in the middle of the city. Ann let us store our kayaks in the garage which was extra nice. Lovely decor. You’ll definitely hear the folks above you walking around now and then, which is to be expected. I didn’t hear the train at all!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Nice little room with plenty of amenities in a cute neighborhood. Loved it!
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Ann's place was super comfortable to stay in with lots of cozy touches. It's perfectly located in the center of the town. Convenient parking pad and beautiful outside area.
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Wonderful little eclectic cottage conveniently located in Missoula was a pleasant surprise on our westward journey. This cottage is on the outskirts of town but it felt very safe. The eye candy of beautiful landscaping around the cottage was only a foretaste of what was inside. There was such an attention to detail in each little comfy chair, cozy dinner table, and decor. It is a small area but did not feel cramped. There are long term guests on other floors but the sounds were minimal - I slept like a baby. You never fully know what you might find when picking online lodging but this host and cottage are worth commending and recommending."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,GREAT location! Ann was very helpful and allowed me to park earlier at her place! Appreciated the a/c and thoughtful touches. Very comfortable and just what a wanted!

2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Feels like staying with family who've thought of every small detail you might need or want while traveling. So comfortable and charming, great value and location. My favorite Airbnb I've stayed at in a while. Price cannot be beat. I'll look to stay here again if I'm ever back in Missoula."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This was the perfect stay for us - I was dropping my son off to begin his freshman year at U of M. We could wander around downtown and to campus - he really got the lay of the land! Wonderful dinner at The Top Hat which Ann recommended. We originally thought he would not be staying with me - Ann kindly provided an extra twin mattress to facilitate us both. Clean, cool neighborhood, AC (we were there in triple digits) and I wanted to take all of the furniture, artwork, and beddings home with me. 💖"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Perfect location for our overnight stay in Missoula. The unit was cozy and comfortable with everything we needed. We walked to breakfast the next morning nearby. Great place to stay in Missoula.

2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"What a great place to stay at in Missoula! It was homey and had everything you could need - even half and half for coffee. The towels were so soft, the bath mats felt so cushy. The bed provided a much needed comfort after a long day of driving. The dogs loved walking around the peaceful neighborhood. Just down the road is a nice park right on a big river. We even got to meet the hosts kittens - so cute!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"What a lovely place to stay! Comfortable, cozy, and such an eye for detail. Ann's place was perfect for an overnight stay in Missoula, will definitely stay here again if I have the chance!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great little place in perfect location! We will stay here again when we’re in town next!
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Rather than end this review with a resounding ""we'll be back!"", I'd like to begin the review with a resounding, ""we'll be back!"" This sweet little place exceeded our expectations; it was private, inviting, cozy, comfy; we slept like logs in the supportive, dreamy bed. The owners could not have been more thoughtful when it came to appointing this space with lovely, useful furniture (such as the antiquated hutch with coffee, tea, cutting board and knife); we left feeling rested and inspired. Oh, and we walked everywhere from/to this darling home base; to the river, to campus, to get pizza...! Looking forward to spending more time in Missoula come next adventure, hopefully our dates will align with this delightful b n' b again. Thanks Ann!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Gem of a spot! If you are visiting to do anything downtown, this is an amazing spot to be able to walk to wherever you want to visit."

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This little gem was perfect for a one night stay in Missoula before leaving. We walked to dinner and breakfast. Small but amazingly packed with everything you might need. We saw the picnic basket n the outer hall. Wish we had more time. Beautifully decorated in a unique stay we loved. Directions were great too
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Ann was the best host. She offered lots and lots of great recommendations for local activities and also for the next stop on our trip. Her place could not offer a better value. It was a great location for walking to restaurants and to float the river directly from her home. We will definitely return. Thank you Ann!!!
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We really enjoyed our stay (only a night) at Ann’s. It was as described and we were very comfortable. It was great having access to a washer and dryer after many days on the road. Anne was very receptive and allowed us a later checkout due to flight times. It’s a lovely space (though we were worried we’d inadvertently pickup/leave something behind with all the tasteful decorations). Thanks for having us.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Such a cute little studio space! Perfect for just one person or a close couple to explore Missoula. Tons of good restaurants and coffee shops are walkable, plus you can get right down to the river from the place- and the host provides tubes for floating!! Very charming and calming aesthetic; you feel like you’re surrounded by a garden. Will be staying here again the next time I’m in town!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Charming little unit, loved the personal touches. Ann was quick to respond to questions. Privacy and blackout blinds appreciated. We had the first floor accommodation so some noise from upstairs heard as well as other guests going up and down the stairs. Not a complaint, just pointing this out. It was very hot but a/c worked well."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Very quaint and clean place. Walkable to festivals and restaurants. The flower gardens around the house were a beautiful attraction.

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The ground floor room in this three storey block was cool and shaded by surrounding trees. The artisan furniture and furnishings are homely and a little quirky which I enjoyed. Ann the host is friendly and was very informative and helpful.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I, unfortunately, was stranded in Chicago and not able to stay in Ann's place. She was an amazing host, communicated well, and was very accommodating with my last minute cancellation. I would recommend staying with her."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Ann’s place was just what we needed for our one night stay. We loved that the place was so close to restaurants and breweries.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"What a gem! Ann's place is full of treasures, she provides a write-up with directions for all of the location attractions and restaurants, and she even has amenities for your excursions!

2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Ann's place was a great, quiet escape but also close to things to do. We had been driving all day and could check in quickly and recover in a quiet relaxing space. It was within walking distance of many great food and drink options. Ann knew that most map apps provide inaccurate directions to the location so she shared clear directions for us to follow which made finding the place very easy. We would definitely stay again if we pass through Missoula in the future."

It has just about anything you could need including coffee, half n half, robes, slippers, books, a sound machine, speaker, and so much more. There is a table for extra counter or work space. Ann responded to my texts and quickly came over when I had issues getting the key out and was a super flexible host. I would definitely stay here again."

The space was even better than described, the energy was so peaceful and the bed was incredibly comfortable. So many thoughtful details to tea, knitted slippers with cute little bells, plush bedding, cute little treasures places thoughtfully throughout the space. And a beautiful view outside! I 100% recommend this place and would love to stay there again. The 12pm checkout was really nice too, I didn’t feel I had to rush out of there. It felt private and like a peaceful little oasis. Ann was very quick to respond to communication and she and the space felt so very welcoming."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Ann is a wonderful host. She is everything you would hope to experience with a host. Her place is very cozy, nice art, pottery, very colorful with great windows, lovely energy. This was my second stay with Ann, and I would not hesitate to return. She even shared a plant out of her garden with me. 😀"

Ann graciously provided information on all things Missoula. For those of you who have not been to Missoula- it is a FUN and relaxed small city. The University is only a few minutes away- always lots to do!
Thank you, Ann, for a great stay!"
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Cute and perfect location!!!
2023-04-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful room in great location. Very responsive, reasonable host. It is a first floor room with other renters on second floor, and everything upstairs is quite audible; this won't be an issue for all visitors (I was by myself and didn't mind), but those that are light sleepers or traveling with sensitive pets should consider."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I love staying at Ann’s place when I’m in Missoula for work. Quiet neighborhood, very walkable or a 5/10min drive to everything in Missoula. Ann is a wonderful host - highly recommend!"
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"This was just right for us. Wish we had stayed longer in order to enjoy it more fully. Ann noticed we were running late and sent a picture of after-dark locating, and made sure we got there okay. The room is beautiful—well furnished, carefully designed, and welcoming. Loved the windows, lighting, and hutch with a sensible collection of good titles. Comfortable bed—luxurious and royally made. We will definitely make this our place to stay for future visits to Missoula. ❤️❤️❤️"

2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Nice spot. Good location. Very comfortable room. Very easy check in process.
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great location. We were in town to go to a show at the Wilma. We walked along the river to a great restaurant near the Wilma and then went to the show!
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This was such a nice place to stay! They even let my boyfriend borrow their iron so he could look pristine for his interview that we were in town for. Couldn’t have asked for anything better!
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"I so enjoyed my stay at Ann's with my dog. The unit was perfect for my needs - comfortable bed, good light, mini-fridge, blazing fast internet. I did a lot of walking, and it was convenient to both recreational trails and the commercial center. Ann was very accommodating in every way, including making sure I was alerted as soon as the unit was clean for an early check in. I would definitely stay here again."
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Very cozy place to stay for myself and my pooch. We really enjoyed the dog amenities (dog bed, chew toys) as well as the people amenities (coffee maker with fresh grounds). The room was comfortable and a very homey space."
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We thoroughly enjoyed Ann’s space for our anniversary trip to Missoula! Close to downtown but peaceful. Ann was also incredibly responsive and even helped us out when our delivery food accidentally got delivered to the wrong address! Highly recommend.

2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Very comfortable bed. Lots of pillows of varying firmness.
2023-02-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"We booked this AirBnb as 2 Missoula locals wanting a night out, not in our own home! It was a lovely apartment space with tasteful decor, good heating and cooling and a stellar location in Missoula.
I will admit, we arrived fully expecting a kitchen space to cook dinner and breakfast the next day, so we were a little disappointed (mostly in our selves for not catching that when we booked the place) that there was no kitchen, but Anne provides amenities like a water heater, coffee maker, water pitchers, mini fridge and microwave, so everything ended up working out just fine.
It was a pleasure to stay in the Iconic green building that is such a staple to the entrance of Missoula, and I would absolutely do it again!"
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I loved the decor of the room, the use of antique furniture, the carpets that covered the concrete floor etc. The bed was compfy which is key to a good night's stay! Our pet was allowed and we know where to take her around town to run and play etc. this might have been tricky for others without that information. The BEST amenity was a little fridge with 1/2 & 1/2 in it! This made my day. Because we had to get up and out so early we actually didn't take advantage of this wonderful amenity but for those of us who put cream in our coffee this is a deal maker!
In addition, I left a pair of earrings there and she responded right away and provided me with an opportunity to retrieve them easily. I would rent here again in a minute."
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Perfect stop for our ski trip. We only stayed one night but the suite is very well put together. Had everything we need. Comfy bed.
,,,"Place stunk of mold- they had two commercial air purifiers and an in room a/c machine running to try to clear it. Obviously aware of the smell, but held on to my $ when I said would not stay. Place was clean however and in good location- just need to remedy the mold issue."
