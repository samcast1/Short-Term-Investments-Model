2024-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,The house was just what we needed for the size of our family. The youth loved the media room. It was wonderful that there were three king size beds.
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great, private space. Giant TV in upstairs media room was great for team gatherings to watch the Mavs win! We will look for this place again when we return to Longview!"
2024-06-01,5,Group trip,"This place was absolutely great. It is very spacious, when I say spacious I mean spacious. The pictures truly let you see what it looks like inside. This was a great pick for our Girls Trip stay! All the ladies loved this place. Very close to many stores, restaurants and etc, we will definitely keep this on the list to come back to."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Very cool, private feel in an urban area!"
2024-06-01,5,Group trip,They were very responsive and accommodating. This is great property especially with all the out door space and game rooms! we loved our stay and have discussed doing so for other occasions.
2024-06-01,5,Group trip,The best Airbnb my crew has experienced. We really liked how the host up cycled wooden doors to create decor. The flow of the house allowed mini vacations throughout.
2024-04-01,5,Group trip,"This place is fantastic especially for a big group!!!! Highly recommended! I was concerned at first because it’s in more of an industrial part of town but it is very secure and safe, like its own oasis in the middle of downtown! Will definitely stay again!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Absolutely loved this place. Plenty of room for a large group.
The bedrooms are styled beautifully!
Just an amazing space! Owners very responsible."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,Everything went great. Neat place to stay
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Me and my coworkers pick this location to stay in while working out of town and couldn’t have had picked anything better. Home is more than enough and in the best location. I have zero complaints, they were the best. Parking is also a plus, has plenty privacy and room for vehicles. A literal man cave"
2024-03-01,3,Group trip,We had some issues that Courtney and Shane tried to fix immediately but unable to while we were there. They were apologetic but it was not a relaxing stay for my family. The noise and smell out weighed all the things we liked about the place.
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great just!
2024-03-01,4,Stayed with kids,"The house itself is marvelous! We had 3 families staying here and felt that we each had our own space, yet plenty of space to all hang out also. The game room was grate fro the pre-teen boys. Spacious bedrooms and bathrooms. Great amenities! The location of the house is odd, right on the corner of a streetlight, but the secured gate that surrounds the house and yard, which is also where we park, does help. Didn't feel comfortable hanging out outside because of a lot of foot traffic along the sidewalks on the other side of the fence. Overall a great experience!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,great place plenty of room for a big family
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We really enjoyed our stay at this beautifully remodeled home. It was spotless and welcoming, with so many thoughtful details accounted for. We fully utilized the kitchen and had guests over for dinner with plenty of space for all. The trains add a fun vibe but you should use ear plugs if you’re a light sleeper. Overall a lovely stay!"
2024-02-01,5,Group trip,We enjoyed our stay; it was very close to our wedding venue and all of our wedding party fit in the Airbnb!
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Had a great stay. House was huge and had everything you would need. Felt like being at home. If your a light sleeper this may not be the place for you because of the train depot behind the house. We would of extended our stay there but the house was already booked. Maybe next time.
2024-02-01,5,Group trip,Thanks for everything
2024-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,Me and my family came down from DFW to celebrate a family members birthday! The house was amazing and is great for all age levels !

2024-01-01,5,Group trip,This place was excellent to house the groomsmen and their plus ones for my son’s wedding weekend. The host was great at communicating and made sure that our stay was top notch! It was nice to have plenty of space for the guys to stay together and have more time to visit during their stay! I was also very impressed with the cute decor and the many amenities provided with this property!
2024-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,GreatTime Thankyou
2023-12-01,5,Group trip,The house was great for our family. We enjoyed our stay. The library area was pretty cool.
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This was perfect for our vacation - great set up and very roomy. The kids lived in the theater room and game room and adults enjoyed the downstairs. The whole backyard is fenced and the kids enjoyed building a fire. The train track runs behind but it never bothered us. Great rate, very clean and smartly decorated. We will definitely rent again.
Gena"
2023-12-01,4,Stayed with kids,Huge place with tons of room! Super comfortable king size beds in 4 of 5 bedrooms! Media Room and Game Room were fantastic!!
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful place. Great place to hang out with family and friends and have a good time.
2023-12-01,4,Group trip,"The house it self was amazing. The remodel of the building was done well. They have made very good use of the space. The one thing I would say is the location. There is a fence all around the property, but has a railroad changing station right where you enter the property in back of the house. The trains can be a little noisy during the night.
If you are having a large group need to stay this is the place for you. Lots of room inside and out."
2023-11-01,5,Group trip,The House was very nice! It was huge! We hosted Thanksgiving dinner and it was amazing. Plenty of space and the hosts thought of everything needed for a home away from home! I will definitely be going back when I visit Texas again. 5 stars all the way!
2023-11-01,5,Group trip,"This air bnb was a perfect place for our friendsgiving! it had lots of space, we enjoyed all the options and it was comfortable. thank you so much again for letting us stay :)"

2023-10-01,3,Group trip,Cool house great remodel job! Trains are loud behind the house! Sketchy neighborhood!
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Woooooooowwww!!!! This place is crazy good!!!! Plenty of space for what they publish. Super clean and very modern! Great parking space. Plenty of things to do without leaving the house.
Very very much a diamond in the rough!"
2023-10-01,5,Group trip,It was a very nice comfortable stay peace full I absolutely loved the library lots of old books and an old desk that was remarkable rear gate was a pain but there working on fixing that and I’m positive they will get that worked out asap no worry’s

2024-06-01,5,Group trip,"We LOVED the place. From the beautiful emerald green color to the beautiful wooden elephant on the wall, the house was beautiful, relaxing, and clean. We would definitely stay there again if we're in the area."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,very artistic house with a big yard
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We had such a great stay here! We were there for about two weeks and Larry was responsive and attentive the entire stay. We realized our dog was getting out of the fence and he immediately had someone over to replace the broken board(s).
The house itself is super cute and very comfortable. We loved the layout and the kids loved the backyard—lots of safe room to play inside and out. We enjoyed being near the cute downtown area too.
There's some traffic and train noise at some times of the day/night since it's a corner house and a couple blocks from a railroad crossing but it sits away from that side of the lot so it still felt private. Just bring your sound machine if you're a light sleeper. Even the occasional night train did not wake the kids.
We would definitely stay here again with our family."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,Larry was an amazing host! Extremely accommodating and graciously allowed us to extend our check out time due to inclement weather. We will be back!
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The Emerald Elephant was a very unique house. We loved the decor and location. Thanks for a great stay!
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Highly recommend The Emerald Elephant if ever need a place to stay in the Longview area. Can’t recommend Larry and his place enough. He was over the top helpful and we can’t wait stay when back in the area next year. If looking for something different than a plan small hotel, The Emerald Elephant is the best Airbnb in the town no doubt! Thanks for everything!"
2024-03-01,5,Group trip,"Great place, very close to where we needed to be in town, great communication with the host."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Larry's place was exactly what we needed. Check-in was super smooth and easy, and Larry was very responsive and friendly.
The house is absolutely beautiful, and super clean. You have everything you need.
Will definitely be staying here again when in Longview."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Beautiful house with lots of personality! Love the big back yard and all the sitting areas throughout the house! Beautiful light
fixtures! But OMG! the bathrooms and wallpaper! 😍 Love!!"

Charli"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Loved loved the house. Beds were SO comfy with ample linens. Photos looked exactly like the house. Great kitchen and bathrooms. Really don’t have enough nice things to say. Larry was super responsive when needed. And did I mention the little details? Espresso maker. Yum. Cozy blankets everywhere. Favorite though - porch swing with fabulous cushions. Stay here!!
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,This airbnb was everything we wanted and then some! We will definitely be staying here again anytime we are in Longview visiting family! Thank you so much Larry for hosting us in your beautiful home & for being so responsive and friendly!

2023-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"It was charming to say the least. A beautiful home. Beautifully decorated. Updated and plenty of room to spread out.
Very impressive.
If I could have picked it up and dropped on my lot in Missouri, I would.
Thanks again,
Larry"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Beautiful house, it works great for our trip."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,Gorgeous gem right by down town Longview! The renovations on the house look very well done and gives it a luxurious feel. Larry is also very helpful and has lots of recommendations for local activities
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with a pet,We loved our stay! The house was beautiful and Larry was such a great host.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great stat thanks for everything.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed over a week,"Larry’s house is a real stand out in Longview and no one could be disappointed with a stay here. It’s right in downtown which from our perspective is definitely the best part of town. Amazing beer, coffee and kombucha in the Silver Grizzly local coffee shop and the house itself is recently done up and immaculate in all aspects!
Larry is super responsive and I would add very thoughtful, our baby daughter was delivered in Longview hospital during our stay and he arranged for a small gift to be sent.
Thank you Larry!!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We loved this house! So many beautiful details! Very clean! We had everything we needed. Larry is very welcoming and personable, fast to respond. Plenty of room. Close to downtown where there are many things to see and do. I highly recommend staying here! We will be back!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Loved this beautiful, charming home! Larry was friendly, helpful and quick to respond. He offered lots of suggestions for restaurants and downtown activities. Would definitely stay here again while visiting the Longview area!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Awesome place beds where comfortable host was always available and responsive. If I came back to Longview I would stay here
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We came to town to participate in an event. Unfortunately, the weather was not good and caused a major power outage in the city and surrounding areas. Larry was great through it all, did what he could and was available to help figure the details out. The house was very cute, unique and has a great backyard area for hanging out. Great kitchen with nice appliances, overall a nice rental. Thanks Larry."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Perfection...loved everything about this house
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,It has a beautiful backyard and very nice decor inside.
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Super clean, well laid out, and comfortable beds. We brought cots for our two little kids and had plenty of room in the master. The house is close to a main road but didn’t notice it when we were there. We were in town for a high school graduation and was able to host grandparents there which was great."
2024-06-01,5,Group trip,"I booked this place for my family and they absolutely loved it! Nothing but great things to say. They said “if they ever come back to Longview I should make sure I book this Airbnb because they don’t want to stay anywhere else”.
They enjoyed the peaceful neighborhood and relaxing backyard with a nice deck. They said they were amazed how clean the place was."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This is an older but still great area of Longview with a great surrounding neighborhood. Our dogs loved the backyard, but the area is also a great place to walk your dogs. This home sits on a circle drive one way in one way out street so it's perfect for a little exercise around the block with your pets or for yourself. 5 minutes away from Longview's main restaurant area, shopping and a top area hospital. Very clean home well taken care of. We will be back."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Great home in a quiet neighborhood. very close to all the venues in longview. Our dog liked their fenced backyard very much. Will definitely comeback!!
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very nice house a good location.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"It was just as described. The kids loved the bunk bed. Everything was clean and neat when we arrived. Overall, we would stay there again."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This home was perfect for our visit! It was conveniently located in between Letourneau University and retail/restaurants. It was clean, safe, and a great spot to relax."
2024-04-01,5,Group trip,Great stay!
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Really enjoyed your place was 1/2 way between my kids places. Great back yard for the fur babies and grandkids to play in. The grandkids loved the toys that were provided.
Thank you"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Had a blast with family. Location was close to alot of shopping, and food."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Great stay for me and my family
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great people! Only stay at their homes when I come to Longview!
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,Great quiet place. Great for family time.
2024-01-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Courtney & Shane's place was great for us! We had family from several states coming to Longview to connect between Christmas and the New Year. Their place was perfect for our small gathering. I liked how bright it was, and it was also nice to know we had full use of the garage as well, which would have been amazing if it would have been super hot or rainy, but our weather was perfect. The driveway was plenty big for the cars we had, so no street parking was necessary (although there was room). We also loved the backyard for our granddaughter and her pup to safely play and run around in. Although we could hear the traffic from the main road, the neighborhood was quiet, even on New Year's Eve!"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,Courtney and Shane's listing was exactly as advertised and very clean. If I needed to return to Longview I would stay there again.
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Wonderful place to stay communicated very well and had a beautiful home! Would recommend to anyone
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great job guys - proud of all you’re doing and happy to celebrate & support any friend of Beckie’s (from Hope, AR)! Godspeed in 2024 🙌🏽"
2023-12-01,5,Group trip,"We had a great stay. The place was spotless, with convenient access to stores and restaurants."
2023-12-01,5,Group trip,This home was exactly what we needed for a family gathering! The home is a nice size in a convenient location. It is exactly as described! I liked the decor too. We felt very comfortable there. The home had everything we needed for our stay. We would gladly stay there again if we are visiting the area!
2023-11-01,5,Group trip,This was a home away from home. Very clean and spacious. The house was beautiful I can’t wait to go back!
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,We had the best time!!! The hosts were great at communicating and being accommodating to any questions or requests we had.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Spacious , comfortable & nicely decorated . Very nice property with a beautiful patio to relax and enjoy nightfall - def recommend this home ! All appliances were functioning and aesthetically appealing ."
2023-09-01,4,Stayed with kids,"A very nicely decorated, comfortable place to spend some family time.
The back yard and patio are very inviting.
The living spaces are nicely decorated, comfortable and spacious.
The only negative was the low water pressure. It made taking showers difficult."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with a pet,The house was very comfortable and well equipped.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Nice place in this little town
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The place was perfect. Easy check in, very clean, comfortable bed. Would definitely recommend and stay again!"
2023-08-01,4,Stayed with kids,"This was our second stay at this property over the last year. The house is in a good location and easy access to Longview. Other than the issue below we had a good stay. Unfortunately this time there were large amounts of pet hair on the sheets, in closets, and in the fridge/freezer from a previous guest. To the hosts credit we contacted them and they offered to come immediately and change the sheets on the beds and do some additional cleaning. This was not a problem last time. We are aware they allow pets and have no problem with this at an Airbnb. It seems like the cleaning crew was not being thorough enough."
2023-07-01,4,Stayed with a pet,"Plenty of eating/shopping establishments near the location. Even though it’s next to a major road, it’s super quiet. Dogs lived the backyard. Very comfortable and plenty of room!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Very cozy, private and comfortable spot in a great location, about 8 mins from just about everything in Longview. The property owners were attentive hosts and quick to respond."
2023-07-01,5,Group trip,Super cute and clean place. If you like a firm bed you will love it! We stopped here unplanned but travel delays had us looking for a place for a night. They were kind to accommodate us on very short notice.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed about a week,Great place - worked very well for us!
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Very comfortable home! So much better than staying in a hotel for a week!
The washer and dryer was a life saver!!
VERY quiet location.
VERY quick responses from host.
We were in TX for the D3 Softball National Championship games in Marshall.
It was less than 30 minutes away.
Every store and fast food imaginable was just 10 minutes away.
LOTS of dining options within 10 minutes.
5 minutes to Guthrie Park.... and pickleball every morning from 8-10am!
Great paths for walking/running."
2023-06-01,4,Stayed with kids,Overall the house was a nice place to stay. The only downside during our stay was we felt like it could have been a little bit cleaner. Mainly the floors. Everything else was nice and comfortable. The host was responsive. We would most likely stay here again.
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Perfect, central locations to easily get to stores/restaurants with all the necessities to stay in if we wanted to. The home was clean and the private back yard was a huge plus!"
2023-05-01,3,Group trip,"It was easy to find and check in. The place is quiet, even though it is next to a laundry mat and gas station(which made me feel a little unsafe) The place was a little dark inside, but it is just an older house too. The freezer looked like it needed to be wiped out and the primary bathroom needed some body wash. I got in the shower and then realized there was no body wash in it. I also found a small worm/bug near the baseboard and there likes to be pet hair on the pillows. We did not bring our pets since the owners charge $100 per dog. A mysterious key also showed up on the front porch on the morning of our check out. It was a key to the front door and also made me feel unsafe knowing that there was a front door key just sitting outside while we were still there. Not sure that there are many Airbnb rentals in the area, but next time, we will probably stay elsewhere."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"It was such a great place to stay and had more amenities than listed. Loved the Retro furnishings. Oh yeah,and the bed was so comfortable. Loved it!! Could use a gate for the fence, I had to go look for one of my fur babies. It was my fault for not looking. I highly recommend staying there!!! Thank you, Lee"
2023-05-01,5,Group trip,Great stay at a wonderful location in Longview.
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place was great. Very clean, nice back yard and the kids play kitchen kept my toddler more than entertained which is a big factor when we stay anywhere."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Very cozy, we enjoyed our stay"
2023-04-01,4,Group trip,"Great house - good stay. Just wished there was better communication. Asked a question about the garage fob that was provided, but the responded hours later asking me to take the trash out if I was going to be there Monday (I was not, but no big deal).
Overall, pretty decent place to stay."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,We just loves this house! Excellent location! We will be back when we come back to Longview. Thank you for everything!
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,This AirBnB is a home away from home. Loved all the little details that were thought about from a sign in book saying hello to a profile on Roku setup just for us to use. Our kids loved having a bunk bed and toys ready for them to play with. It was such a great stay.
2023-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This place was beautiful, spacious, clean except for some leftover hair throughout house (Recommend Rainbow Cleaning system) But 10/10 for my stay, Beautiful Beautiful home!"
2023-03-01,5,Group trip,Love the stay and definitely would stay again. So comfy and cute.
2023-03-01,4,Stayed with kids,Very nice home and welcoming. Lots of available space and big backyard.
2023-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This home is as described: cozy, clean, no clutter, spacious. The owners made the whole experience perfect, straight forward instructions, easy checking/out, responsive to questions pre-stay and plenty of recommendations. If you come to Longview with kids, there’s not a whole lot for kids to do so I was happy to have enough space for them to play, as well as a great backyard! As you see in the picture, the porch is the perfect place to have your morning coffee and watch the sunset in the evenings. Looks like a tin roof that covers the porch, it didn’t rain while we were in town, but I love the sound of rain on a tin roof so I would’ve enjoyed that too!"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,Thanks so much!
2023-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,Beautiful home. Close to everything we needed. Easy to get to. Will stay again when going to see family.
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Perfect little place for our visit to LeTourneau University. Close to all we needed and then some. Enjoyed the outdoor space as well. Comfortable beds & convenient to have laundry facilities as well.
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,loved it!
2023-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,Our hosts thought of everything we could possibly need prior to our visit and were ready to accommodate any needs. Mornings I would take my mug of coffee and sit under the covered patio listening to the playful chirps of local birds while the wind swept gently over treetops…so peaceful and reflective. Ample room inside for 4 adults and 3 rambunctious toddlers. All the comforts of home with all the little luxuries of a resort. The play kitchen in the bunk bed room was a tremendous hit and kept the little ones entertained for hours. Fell in love with the roomy refrigerator as I prepared several large trays of food to take to my son’s college. The master bedroom seemed like a secret bungalow as it blocked out many of the sounds from the main part of the house and contained a private bathroom. All in all a wonderful stay!
2023-02-01,5,Stayed one night,Cute clean house in a convenient location! We enjoyed our stay!
2023-02-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Great stay, lovely home!"
2023-02-01,5,Group trip,Highly recommend and will definitely be coming back.
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,thank you
2023-01-01,4,Group trip,"This home is a nice size and neatly staged, and the beds are comfortable. The backyard photos do not show the noisy street the yard backs up to. The showers are low, and the couch seats are small, so they are not the best fit for a tall family. They did supply some coffee, but I would have liked to have seen some sugar and creamer options."
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Loved the place. Very comfortable and when we had questions the hosts were very responsive. The location was 5 minutes from shopping and restaurants. Great stay.
2022-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We had a great stay at Lee's place. Our kids loved the huge bunk bed and the play kitchen. The bedrooms were spacious and clean. The kitchen was well equipped. The dining and living spaces were comfortable and seated everyone in our family.
We had some issues getting in as the keypad locked us out. However, Lee was very quick to respond and helped us immediately to be able to get in.
Overall, this was an excellent place for a family to stay and we would gladly stay there again 😃"
2022-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We are a military family and natives of Longview. Our family has grown in many ways and we felt it would be best to stay in a place of our own instead of with family for the first time. I will say it was the best decision we could've made, this place offered the space and the peace we needed to be able to truly enjoy the holidays with our children, their significant others, two dogs, and our local family members. We just so happened to visit Longview during a time when they were experiencing an unusual cold snap the temps dropped to 9 degrees at one point! I do not think the homes heating system was ready and neither were we!! The heater wouldn't heat past 65 and I reached out to the owners and they responded and had it repaired immediately. I truly appreciate their responsiveness to our needs and concerns. The house is updated and located in a part of town that I felt comfortable in. I would stay here again. (S/N: Backyard is not fenced all the way around for those bringing dogs)"
2022-12-01,5,Group trip,"Excellent place, we definitely recommend it"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"It was a very clean, very comfortable place to stay the week. Great location, and close to everything in the Longview area. Would definitely go back and stay again!"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,Had a great stay with the family….
2022-09-01,5,Group trip,It was a very nice and comfortable stay. They were very kind and responsive!
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We had a great experience. The house was great. Thank you!
2022-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,Great Stay. Left a shining guestbook review message in the home. lol
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Thank you for opening your home to us! My sister & I had a wonderfully comfortable stay & would recommend this place to anyone looking for a quaint retreat home away from home.
2022-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,Very nice place and enjoyed staying. Felt like home. The owners were very nice and wonderful to work with and answered our questions quickly.
2022-09-01,5,Group trip,"Clean, convenient, and easy check in."
2022-08-01,4,Stayed with kids,"This house was cute and had so much potential. After booking, it is clear that Courtney and Shane own/rent out multiple properties, as there were multiple messages sent outlining the check-in process as well as house rules. Same thing happened before and after checkout. I can appreciate them wanting to keep guests well-informed, but the tone in some of the messages was a bit harsh, in my opinion. For example, there were many penalties laid out (Stolen towels? We will charge you $10/towel. Damage to home? You will forfeit your deposit and can possibly incur additional fees. Late checkout? We will charge you $15/15 min increments. etc etc) It was so over the top that I felt it necessary to message them the morning after we checked in to outline items that were broken upon our arrival so that we wouldn't potentially get charged for that. I have always prided myself in being a considerate guest when staying in other people's homes, so this wasn't a very welcoming way to begin the trip. HOWEVER, I do understand that not everyone is the same and they are just protecting their assets.
As noted, there were quite a few items that were broken when we arrived - crooked cupboards that wouldn't close, guest bath door wouldn't close all of the way, toilet paper holder hanging from the wall, etc. To their credit, after I notified them and sent pictures, they quickly replied and said they were aware of some items needing correction and would add the others to their repair list.
The location is fine. We were about five minutes away from our family's home, so that was convenient. The house is at the front of a neighborhood located directly next to a washeteria and a gas station, so take that as you will. We didn't have any issues while there, but I was very grateful for the garage where we parked our car throughout our stay. The neighborhood stayed quiet.
I read a recent review about a brown recluse issue - we didn't see any bugs throughout the duration of our stay, so I assume that problem was rectified. I did agree with that poster on the living room couch - it is extremely uncomfortable. The master shower is quite short (I'm 5'9"") and I had the same issue as a previous poster with trying to figure out which gel was the shower gel/shampoo and which was conditioner. Not a huge deal, they both smelled fantastic. :)
We (and our toddler) appreciated the play kitchen that is stored in the guest room to keep her busy in the mornings and the evenings before bath time.
The house is extremely spacious - it's an older ranch home, so the rooms and closets are large. I really liked the layout of the home. The back patio is a nice add, although we didn't use it, and I like the option of bringing your dog (although we didn't take advantage of that). The yard is a nice size and is enclosed/fenced. The laundry room/mud room is gigantic.
Overall, this was an OK stay. The owners did a good job with renovating the exterior and parts of the interior. I did feel as if the home is represented in a more modern way in pictures than what it actually is. The bathrooms are in serious need of updating. There is definitely room for improvement, but it isn't a bad place."
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Absolutely loved the house! Beautiful and exactly what we needed. Prime location with easy check-in and check-out. Will book this home in the future!
2022-08-01,2,Stayed a few nights,"I don’t ever leave reviews but feel this one is needed for others safety.
Cons: I was bit three times by a brown recluse while sleeping in the bunk bed room. I’ve had to go to the Dr for ointment and pain due to the bites which has resulted in me missing work. If I’m lucky it will take a couple of weeks to heal. If not so fortunate I will have to go back to have the section cut out of my back and leg. I’m glad this happened to me and not my son or another child. Please have the house treated.
Master bedroom mattress is horribly uncomfortable and the bed frame squeaks with each move. Master bathroom shower is made for a short person, I’m 5’6” and had to bend backwards to wash my hair. The couch is also extremely uncomfortable, it’s very hard. Shower gels are a nice touch except they’re not labeled so you don’t know which is body wash vs shampoo/conditioner. The house is right next to a laundry mat which brings in questionable people.
Pros: AC works great. The house is cute with so much potential. Plenty of room. Check in was easy.
Overall I would not recommend staying here. I can overlook the uncomfortable couch and bed but I cannot get past being bitten by a brown recluse."

2022-06-01,5,Group trip,Great clean place to stay! Great for larger group or family and the back porch is awesome!!
2022-05-01,3,Stayed with kids,"this was a nice place to stay. The plumbing is poor because it’s a old home that was re-renovated, nicely. Brought the problem of the plumbing concerns to the owners attention . They came and took a look at it fixed what they could at the time. Still issues in the home which the owners are aware of. Would be nice if the beds were softer the beds are very hard in the guest bedroom and the master bedroom. The children’s room for their beds were very nice , the children had no complaints. Would be a five out 5. Star Pl. to stay if the plumbing & Comfort & softness of beds, was better.
Thank you Courtney & Shane."

2022-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We had a wonderful stay here, Courtney and Shane are great hosts and communicated promptly with us when I had a question. The rooms are cozy yet mostly minimal .

Thanks for a wonderful stay!"
2022-05-01,5,Group trip,"Courtney and Shane were wonderful hosts! They accommodated to our large group and made us feel comfortable at all times.

2022-03-01,4,Stayed with kids,"we loved our stay here, and the hosts were very responsive and accommodating. our only complaint is that they charge a high cleaning fee, but require you as the guest to take out trash, wash all dishes, strip beds, organize dirty towels, etc. for what we paid for our stay, we did not see the value in also paying the cleaning fee."
2022-03-01,4,Stayed with a pet,Nice updated home. Easy check in and check out. Many streaming services available on the tv was a big plus. Centrally located for easy access to everything in the area.

We were incredibly fortunate as Lee's place was one of the few locations that had power. This meant that we could enjoy the refreshing coolness of the air conditioning despite the scorching 99-degree days. Our family and friends in the vicinity were envious and eager to visit us, seeking respite from the intense heat. The central location of the property made it convenient for everyone. The accommodations were cozy and provided ample space for us to relax and move around comfortably. When we return to town for another visit, staying here again will definitely be on our list of considerations."

Loved making meals in the updated kitchen and the bed and hot shower were wonderful! Highly recommend!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,"King beds were very comfortable! Very clean! Modern, updated. The only problem we had was the keypad did not work, so we had to download the app and then it worked easy. But the app only works if you are next to the door.
Appreciated having shampoo/conditioner, Q-tips, cotton balls, and nice clean towels in the bathroom. It's the nice little touches like that that make a difference! Thank you for a nice place to stay in Longview!"

As others have noted, the bed was too soft for our liking. And while we didn’t use the keurig for coffee, there was only 2 k-cups when we checked in. I don’t know if it was an over sight ( or I didn’t read the listing correctly) but I was glad we brought our own shampoo and shower soap.
It was very clean tiny home!"

It was darling!!! Oh! And super clean!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was the perfect location for our needs. We had a family wedding with lots of back and forth to events over 3 days.

2023-08-01,4,Stayed about a week,"Barry did a great job of communicating and responding to request. His associate, Jimmy, was super helpful when checking in, and even got us a wine opener. There were some larger spiders, but when I reached out to Barry he was responsive and let me know they were taking care of it for future guests. This is a deal if you are looking for a quiet place to lay your head while in the Longview/Kilgore area."
2023-07-01,3,Stayed over a week,"This is my first ab&b stay.
Cheapest last minute option, decent, private, but I should have found a place closer for my needed transit. And, it is not for someone with bug issues. Crickets and ants come out of the framework, and flying insects invade when opening the door. I managed.
More or less served its purpose. I was unfortunate to book time when construction started next door (only 2 days of 11). Airport is small, so really no issue with noise.
I don't like hazelnut coffee, so bought my own. Instant oatmeal was present but didn't use that either. Plates are plastic and marked on bottom ""not for microwave."" Again, used my own.
Please mark the address clearly. (No numbers found to match)"

Told us where his house was if we should need anything. We were very pleased with the accommodations. Noticed there was an ample supply of towels. He had wash cloths strictly for make up. Laundry supplies were furnished. We will stay there again."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Barry's house was exactly as described. His home's design was so well thought out that my wife made a video of Barry's house so we could make something similar. It is close to all amenities and was very peaceful in the country.

2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This tiny home was immaculately clean and well designed. We chose this property because we were attending the Great Texas Balloon Race festival in Longview, but also wanted some peace and privacy. This property is close to Longview for any college or family events, as well as close to the lake. Communication was friendly, responsive, and proactive. If you ever have a need to visit the Longview, Texas area, I would recommend staying here. So many amenities that you can't get at a hotel for a very reasonable rate. Barry and family...it was great! We want to come back for the balloon festival next year and stay here again!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,We had a great quick stay! Everything was extremely clean and comfortable. Barry was a great communicator and I would recommend this listing!

We wanted a space that had room for my two kids to play and also have the family we were visiting to come over for dinner and spend some time with us. Chinmay's property was perfect! And exactly what we were looking for. The house was incredibly clean. The kitchen was very well stocked with cooking utensils. The area was quiet and welcoming. The host was very responsive and proactive. They always let us know if anyone was coming by for yard work or anything else. We had a fantastic time and loved the house! We try to visit the area once or twice a year so we will definitely be hoping to stay again! Thank you for the great experience!

Want to leave and neither did I ! My birthday was so relaxing and this house made me feel so at ease!!! Close to restaurants and the neighbor hood was very quiet and friendly! I will definitely be staying here again! Definitely my home
Away from home !"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very aesthetic kitchen and living room and overall comfortable stay while in town for business!
2024-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,Home away from home!! My family and I traveled here for our daughter’s volleyball tournament and stayed in this home. It was comfortable and very well taken care of. It is close to many shopping areas and restaurants. It is also a walkable distance to a dollar tree and a Walmart was a very short distance away. A very lovely and quiet neighborhood. Just a great place to stay for our whole family.
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This beautiful home looks exactly like the pictures on the listing. I felt very safe in the neighborhood and it was centrally located. There are many restaurants as well as shopping close by. The house was spotless and was what we needed on very short notice.
Chinmay was an amazing host and went out of his way to help me. I accidentally put the wrong dates and Airbnb was going to charge me over $600 but Chinmay called them and i was refunded in full. I haven’t had any other host that really went out of their way to help when it didn’t benefit them. I will never forget it. Also, my last visit was at a different property of the same host. I left my gold earrings and he mailed them back to me. I didn’t realize i had left them but he sent me a picture of them. I will only use Chinmays properties when I return to Texas. Honest and kind!"
2024-01-01,5,Group trip,"I booked this stay for my family and I because we were in town for a family reunion. My parents can be very picky when I comes to cleanliness and safety so I was hesitant to book a location that would provide everything we needed to make our trip comfortable. However, Chinmay’s listing exceeded all of our expectations. The house felt extremely safe with the security system and location. The instructions were abundantly clear and made me feel at ease throughout the entirety of our stay.
Furthermore, the home was the cleanest I’ve ever seen at a bnb. Spotless. Could it have felt cleaner. Cherry on top was the exact amenities needed to make the space feel like home.
Lastly, I had to work during our trip and the dedicated office table and chair was the right amount of space to do just this. However, there was ample space for me to work from without the worry of waking anyone up or being in the way.
Would absolutely book another future stay!"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This house was great. Spacious and stylish - just like the pictures portrayed. It had plenty of room for us, and was very close to our various destinations in the Longview area. Chinmay was super communicative and responsive. We had a wonderful time."

2023-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Super cozy & pristine place that fit all of our family's needs! Loved the open concept where we could keep an eye of the kids while busy in the kitchen. Chinmay thought of everything - from the starter packs in the kitchen & bathrooms to the items available for the grill. Excellent communicator, checked in often and even accommodated a request for a late checkout. We will definitely look no further when we have to stay in Longview in the future!"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This house and host was great. It by far was the best place to stay in Longview. When we return, we will stay here again. Thank you for the little extra on the day of my sister’s funeral."

We were in town to visit my dad and Chimnays home was less than 5 minutes from my dad’s house. Plenty of space to cook Thanksgiving dinner, relax, and enjoy each others company.
Large, open layout allowed for lots of visiting and spending time with one another. All amenities plus more were included - definitely worth it!
Thank you, Chimnay, for a wonderful stay!"

Everything in the house is state of the art and in working condition which is really saying something. I’ve been to a lot of places that offer a bunch but nothing is working.

Plenty of room for us to have family over to visit. Great back yard with corn hole, chairs around the fire pit, barbecue grill.
Cassidy could not have been a better host. She went above and beyond to provide the best for us. My husband loves coffee. There was only a Keurig and she bought a wonderful coffee maker and brought it right over. Anything we needed, she was right on top of it. So friendly and helpful!! We hated to leave! Highly recommend!!"

2023-10-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"If this place is available - BOOK IT NOW! Over the last year, I have stayed in the Hallsville/Longview area numerous times renting Air BNB's and hotels. This home is by far the best house I have rented. Communication, check-in and location were excellent! The beds are comfortable and the house is decorated just like a Chip & JoAnna Gaines house. Smart TVs in living room and master. House is new, very clean and the neighborhood is safe and well kept. Nothing is sketch about this rental. I would certainly rent this one again if its available."

2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The house was exactly as described. We had no trouble checking in and getting situated. We liked and appreciated the fact that the beds were comfortable making it possible for us to get a good quiet night's sleep away from home. Also the house was clean and ready for us to enjoy the moment we walked in. We didn't get spend as much time at the house as we would have liked but we did enjoy the quiet comfortable feel of the house -- like being at home type of comfort.
And just as important, the house is in a quiet, well-kept neighborhood that felt safe.
We enjoyed our stay there and hopefully we will be able to travel back to TX in the future and once again stay here while we visit our family.

2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,My daughter and her family needed a place to stay when a bad storm knocked the power out across east Texas and Nagelle was so flexible and willing to help in a time of need. The house was perfect for my daughters family of 5.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,A great place to be able to relax while on the road.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Nagelle has a lovely home with an awesome screened in porch and backyard. Quiet neighborhood.
Simple, clean aesthetic. This was our second stay in less than 6 weeks. Unfortunately we were there for my dad’s funeral. Nagelle was kind enough to leave a sympathy card and allow us to have family over after the service for lunch.
She was very responsive and proactive. The Wi-Fi went out and we didn’t even have to reach out to her. She got a notice and she reached out to us with a simple solution to get it back on board.
Highly recommend! When we find ourselves back in Longview this is definitely where we’ll stay again."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This house is a beautiful example of a well-maintained and updated mid-century home. The neighborhood is nice, heavily treed, and peaceful. We enjoyed our stay very much!!"

2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Girls’ trip to Longview was so much fun! Nagelle’s place is so spacious, super comfy and centrally located. We each had our own room with plenty of space to gather for meals and games. A huge storm chased us into town and we were able to park inside the garage to protect the car from hail damage. The screened in room was great for a late night glass of wine with the sounds of nature singing beautiful music that brought back so many childhood memories of growing up in East Texas. Nagelle was quick to respond and her place is even better than the pictures. Highly recommend a stay here if you are visiting Longview."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Loved our stay! Very thoughtfully decorated home that was welcoming and comfortable. Attention to detail was wonderful and lots of little extras like s’mores supplies and candy on the counter which my boys loved. Will definitely stay again!
2023-03-01,5,Stayed over a week,It is hard to find accommodations for our field crew. It is always appreciated when hosts understand our circumstances and are willing to host us. We appreciate all the efforts on everyone's part when it comes to giving the hard-working Utility Inspectors a place to rest.
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Nagelle was such a caring host! The home was clean and comfortable! Better than pictures ❤️
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Will definitely stay here again. Everything is brand new, host is amazing - THANK YOU!"
2022-12-01,5,Group trip,"We made the best choice by choosing
this home. Everything was immaculate, there was more than enough space for 3 couples and guests. Our host was amazing, her response was timely and she made sure our stay was comfortable, we can't wait to come back and stay again. It's an honor to be your first family to stay.
You will not be disappointed 🥰"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Conveniently located right off the highway and easy to get to town. Everything was nice and clean. Carol was very responsive and made sure to leave the porch light on for me so I could see when I got there. There is Central air but I think the temperature must be controlled from one of the other units as I couldn't find a thermostat, but there was also a window unit if needed. Huge plus that I was able to bring my dog. It worked out perfectly for what I needed."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"The house was tiny but perfect for me and my dog. The location is a bit out of town (not a surprise, the map was accurate) and right next to the freeway, but still relatively quiet all things considered. The only negative really was the dirt driveway, with a dog it was hard not to track dirt in. But overall a great restful place to stay. Thanks Carol!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,This home was beautiful! Perfect for our family to stay during a last minute trip to Longview for some family things. The home had everything needed from the kitchen to the bathroom. The game room space was PERFECT for the kids to entertain themselves for some time. Beautifully landscaped & large backyard. We would definitely stay here again on our next trip if needed!
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,Very nice home and the host was extremely responsive. I had a wonderful stay and appreciated the quick communication. Highly recommended!

2024-04-01,5,Group trip,Our stay at this home was incredible. Very close to where our wedding venue was and the neighborhood was very quiet.
2024-04-01,5,Group trip,"We loved our stay. The house was more than what anyone could ask for. It felt like a home away from home. The house was squeaky clean and in a perfect quiet location. Our host was amazing. Any questions, she responded immediately. I plan on booking this house again when I get back to Longview and I would recommend this house to everyone. If I could give 10 stars, I would."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"""Absolutely loved our stay at this beautiful house! The decor was stunning and the ambiance was so cozy. The check-in process was a breeze, and the host was incredibly responsive to any questions we had. Highly recommend this Airbnb for a comfortable and enjoyable experience!"""
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"LaCheria's place is just as it looks which is nice because sometimes the pictures are nicer than the place. Everything was clean, there were plenty of wash cloths which a lot of properties tend to miss. The information booklet was a nice personable touch. The neighborhood is quiet and there are plenty of restaurants that are close."
2024-03-01,4,Stayed with kids,"We enjoyed staying here. The backyard is beautiful and big! It is the perfect yard to throw a football, kick a soccer ball, play tag…
I think it’s a fairly new rental and they are probably still in the process of getting a few things. The kitchen had all of the basics you would need; but didn’t have a lot of other cooking items. But- it was actually a treat to eat out all of meals! And if you happen to be going to wedding at Dove Hollow then this house is a great location- nice and close. Also, there were plenty of wonderful bath towels and wash cloths; but there weren’t any hand towels. There was a hand towel ring- so I’m guessing that they just hadn’t gotten around to getting them yet. Really not a big deal though since we could dry our hands with the bath towels. All in all, everything worked, it was clean, the a/c worked and we all had a great time."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed over a week,I travel for work so I stay in a lot of air bnb with the guys that work with me. The house was absolutely spotless and cleaning services were provided throughout our stay as well. Any issue that we had was cleared up asap the host is very responsive and one of the most polite and understanding host I’ve yet to deal with. I wish she had places in San Antonio where I’m headed next. Thanks for the stay and the accommodation as well.
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This house was absolutely beautiful. Our host was very quick to respond when I requested a simple accommodation. I would highly recommend this home. THANK YOU!
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great Place to stay! Highly recommended!
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"I am extremely happy with my experience. This home is a beautifully remodeled modern home. It was extremely clean, peaceful, and welcoming. Communication was easy and we had no issues from start to finish with the host. I 10/10 recommend staying in this home."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The place is beautiful the was really attentive everything brand new and clean security system i felt safe and secure
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is likely THE place to stay if you need a 2BR place in Longview, TX! The host's amenities were spectacular -- they truly thought of everything you might need during your stay. The kitchen is well-stocked, and the place could not be cleaner. The outside is nothing to look at, especially the grass and shrubs, but once you get inside you will be glad you rented the place. The host could not have been more helpful and kind, and we look forward to staying here again when we're back in the fall. This is likely in our Top 5 Airbnb places we've stayed at globally!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Our original Airbnb host cancelled our booking, and the host of this Airbnb was a huge blessing! We were worried we might have to completely cancel our trip to see family we hadn’t seen in three years and a new grand baby. The host of this Airbnb took our last minute booking and had the place pristine by the time we arrived. She made sure everything was right and went above and beyond, including fresh cookies that were a hit. We had a minor issue with the front door locking system, and as soon as I texted and made her aware, she responded and fixed the issue.
The location its self is a smaller Texas town, and the area around the Airbnb was very quiet and we felt safe. It was big enough for our family to hang out during the day, yet quaint and homey feeling. We would highly recommend you use this Airbnb if you’re staying in the Longview area!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We had an amazing time at Carolyn's home. We were traveling with an 8 month old, the home provided a portable crib, lots of games and toys to keep the little one entertained. Highly recommend if you are traveling with a little one. The kitchen and washrooms were equipped with everything you would need.
Carolyn was extremely accommodative and responsive to all our needs and queries, and made our stay very smooth. Thanks Carolyn for all the help.
If I had to share any feedback, there would be 2 things:
1. There is no microwave in the kitchen, so heating up food every time was a huge task. A small microwave in the kitchen could go a long way.
2. Maintaining the garden and front yard: The house would be even more comfortable if the garden was cleaned and well maintained."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Clean and affordable for what we got. Decent place to stay for work travel. Lots of little goodies throughout helped minimize the extra things I need to pack that I usually would need to bring to a hotel.
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Great stay. The house is as good as it looks in the pictures and in a great location next to restaurants, coffee shops, and stores. You can tell there is a lot of time and love that went into this Airbnb. The hosts went above and beyond to make sure our stay was enjoyable and very prompt in responding."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Wonderful Stay enjoyed the home, exactly what it states and see in the pictures. Would stay there again, enjoyed my stay all the way 5 of 5 stars. Well located to most places within Longview area!
Great Stay..."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This property was very clean the host was very responsive and friendly and very accommodating. The pictures say everything the property is perfect, especially if you love nature. I cooked a big dinner and everything I needed was there they made sure if you forgot anything they had it. The beds were very comfortable they had plenty of everything. We didn’t run out of toilet paper trash bags dish soap or anything. I’d definitely stay here again and will recommend to any of my friends."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"I love everything about the house was very nice , & spotless clean I really enjoyed the home ☺️"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Chris was amazingly helpful, kind, and responsive to any questions. We were pleasantly surprised with every part of this home. I loved it so much, I may steal the floorplan. Pocket doors added to the ambiance. The hues of whites, blues and greens were calming and chill. So many amenities. Top house of my Airbnb extensive experience. Thank you. I hope to stay here again."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We came down for a tattoo convention we were working and this was the perfect place.. it was amazingly clean.. (and I'm picky about cleanliness) it was quaint, the master bed was super comfy and we overall had a GREAT experience.."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,We just moved to Longview on Monday and then on Tuesday we lost power due to the weather so completely last minute I reached out to her to find out if this location had power and she said it did and we were able to book completely last minute. She even reached out the next morning asking if we needed to extend. I would definitely stay again if we ever need to. The price was very reasonable and it had everything we needed for the night. She was very responsive as well.
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"April was the most efficient in clear,
Friendly communication.
I have traveled extensively for work, although this was for pleasure, and this truly deserves a 10 rating!
Easy access to town. Quiet.

2024-01-01,4,Stayed with a pet,"April was a very communicative host and the house was perfect for our visit in Longview. We were in town visiting family and mainly just used the house as somewhere to sleep and get ready everyday. It was the perfect even though we didn’t spend much time there.
We had a few hiccups with WiFi and running out of supplies but April was GREAT at communicating quickly and resolving problems.
Great house and we’d stay again for sure!!"

2023-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This was the perfect stop for my family overnight during our road trip. The size was perfect for my kids to stretch their legs and play before bed.

We will be staying here next time we hit the road!"

I highly recommend this beautiful, spotless, adorably decorated home!!! Just perfect!"
2023-05-01,4,Stayed a few nights,the plumbing valves in the shower and kitchen sink are backwards. it took a minute to figure out. but cold is hot and hot is cold.

2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was our first time staying in an airbnb. We have been traveling every weekend doing business in various places for 25 years. We have reached hotel overload . The house was charming and extremely welcoming, We had every item that you use at home. I was shocked at how they thought of all our needs. The bed was unbelievably comfortable. I have severe back issues, and I slept all night without pain. The dining room table was ready with place mats. I never had such a wonderful experience when we travel. We are working, so a comfortable place to stay is necessary. We have booked again for all our shows in Longview."
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Rodney’s Farmhouse was beautiful, peaceful, and comfortable! We got the much-needed rest we needed, and Rodney was great to communicate with!"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We loved our stay. It was so comfortable and cozy, especially with the Christmas decorations. We stayed over New Year’s Eve and it was perfect. The backyard area was perfect for our daughter and dog! We had a bonfire and loved hanging outside. The bedrooms were spacious and comfy too! If we had a larger group we would definitely have rented the whole house, with the upstairs rooms also, but the main downstairs level had everything we needed. Rodney was communicative and always helpful. We would definitely stay again if we were ever in the area again! It was probably my husband and my favorite airbnb rental and we have stayed in A LOT!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This is one of the most charming air bnbs we’ve ever stayed in. The beds were comfortable, the place was clean, and all of the instructions were clear.

2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My husband and I stayed two nights while attending a conference. It was so nice to come back each night and unwind. The house was just as described. It was decorated for Fall, but not over done. The bed and furniture was comfortable. It was a great stay & we would definitely stay there again! Also, we got into town earlier than anticipated and Rodney was so kind to get the house ready for us to check in a couple hours early!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Great house, easy location. Decorated so very cute!! My only issue would be if you have dogs with you there are two cats in the backyard. But if you are looking for a cute, comfy home to stay in without a pet then it’s perfect."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Loved the place. Relaxing and comfortable. Exactly as advertised. Thx for being a great host.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,nice place close to the airport I was working out of. super friendly host and great communication. Only thing is the traffic is very busy at all times.

Thank you Rodney"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed over a week,"Once again, we had a wonderful time at the farmhouse and a great experience with Rodney, the host! As our annual mother daughter trip to Texas, we have family in Longview and at Lake Cherokee, so this is always the perfect place for us to call our own for a few weeks. The fenced yard is perfect for a little K9 playtime, and the house always seem to have a few upgrades every time we come. Cozy and quaint—we will be back soon!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Rodney 's place was such a welcoming place from the moment we walked up to the front porch and walked thru the door in the spacious entryway. The farm house Cottage decor was lovely. I so enjoyed the beautiful flowers outside in the front and back yard. My 2 grandsons came over twice and loved the beautiful back yard . even did a little yard work. Beds were good, Loved special little soaps in bathrooms. his sweet barn cats greeted us in the mornings SORRY we were little late leaving my daughter in love wanted pictures of the boys on the porch swing & It took a little longer than we hoped. But we got to meet Rodney in person , he's such a personable man and puts a lot of his self in to the atmosphere of place. We will be back ."

2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The house sits at a somewhat busy four-way stop, but don’t let that scare you away.

The two outdoor farm cats were the star of the show for us - so cute!! 😊"

Rodney was a great host, very accommodating and always quick to respond with any questions we had."

2022-10-01,3,Stayed with a pet,Dated farmhouse on a very busy and NOISY intersection.
2022-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"My daughter and I have had a few trips to East Texas over the years except when COVID came around and we love staying at the farmhouse. The accommodations are wonderful and it is nice for us to have a home base to rest and regroup before we head back out for adventures and family time. Rodney has always been an excellent host and he responds very quickly. We hope to not only come back next summer for our annual mother daughter trip but also to bring the rest of our family. With access to the second floor bedrooms, there is room for all!"

2022-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We thoroughly enjoyed our visit to the Grable Creek Farmhouse. Rodney was a fantastic host and provided us with great information and details both prior to and during our visit - his communication was outstanding! The place itself was wonderful - the home had a historic charm to it, had all kinds of nice appointments, and had everything we could have asked for to enjoy a comfortable stay. The added bonus is that it was situated in a great location - easily accessible and a great jumping off point to various restaurants and activities in the area. We'd whole-heartedly recommend it based on our positive experience!"
2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,awesome little house
2022-02-01,5,Stayed one night,I have stayed at Rodney's place on multiple occasions and it is always a pleasure to visit East Texas because we know we always have a quality place to stay outside of town. Our 2 labs love the room to run and play. I highly recommend this property.
2022-02-01,5,Stayed over a week,We had a great stay in a comfy home and near the family we were visiting. Host was responsive and all went well!
2022-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,We were in town for a funeral for a couple days. Everything was clean and organized. The home is decorated beautifully. The master bed was extremely comfortable. My kids loved feeding the cats. The jacuzzi tub was also very relaxing. I would definitely recommend staying here and would come back again.
2022-01-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This was such a neat place. We rented the downstairs of this house and we’re very happy with our stay. A little close to the road but was a very nice location. Out of town but close enough. Yard was plenty big but our dog did try to get under the house so we had a few scares. Overall the house was very comfortable, I would recommend it!"
2022-01-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Charming and quaint, a little gem that was easy to find, park, and enjoy."

2021-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We have stayed at this charming property on multiple occasions. The ambiance of this old farmhouse is so much fun….and our dogs love to play in the large yard.
Even though we are allergic to cats the barn cats are adorable and we love caring for them as well. We highly recommend the property and the owner!"
2021-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"This home has lots of curb appeal especially at night. The front porch is a great place to sit in the evening. There’s also a patio in the back yard that’s more private. Everything about the home is comfortable and inviting. There is quite a bit of nighttime traffic at the intersection, so it might be necessary to turn on the bedroom window unit air conditioners to mask that occasional noise. For those missing pets back home, there are some very healthy cats that come to the front porch expecting a meal- cat food and dinner service provided in the kitchen. A great location just far enough away from the hustle and bustle of Longview."

2021-04-01,5,Stayed over a week,"We had a wonderful 3 week stay at the Farmhouse! It was nicely decorated, charming, and comfortable. We were able to relax inside, on the front porch, and at the fire pit out back. Just a short drive for groceries and to Beautiful Elder Lake at Synergy Park where we took walks almost every day. Rodney was quick to respond to our communications, friendly, and made sure we had what we needed. If ever in the area again, we would definitely stay here at the Grable Creek Farmhouse!"
2021-03-01,5,Stayed about a week,"If you are looking for a place that makes you feel.tou never left home, this is it. Very easy access to major roadways and close to good food. very inviting to just set back on the porch and watchthe sunrise or enjoy games and fire on the back patio with family."

2020-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My fiancé and I absolutely loved staying here! Normally we come to Longview and stay in hotel but we decided to try out an Airbnb and we were not disappointed with this place! It is a beautiful little farmhouse, perfect for a quick get away. Everything was clean, they provided us so much information on what to do around town (things we didn’t even know about), and they were extremely welcoming and communicative the whole time we were there. When we come back to Longview, we will definitely be stay here and I highly suggest it for anyone else."

2020-02-01,5,Stayed one night,Expect just what you need for a homey place to stay.
2020-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Nice space, well decorated. We only used the main level. The two bathrooms were nice. The water pressure in the larger bathroom for the sink was rather poor, and the show in that same bathroom had similar issues, just not as bad. Using space heaters for the entire place was a bit of an annoyance, trying to balance out the temp for the whole place was not easy. We did enjoy the company of two barn cats."
2020-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Definitely a great place to stay. Felt like being home.
Would definitely recommend this place for any event you're attending in the Longview Texas area."
2019-12-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Designated superhost for a reason. Excellent communication and attention to detail for making our stay as comfortable as possible. Can't say enough about the value of staying in such as wonderfully decorated home over a boring hotel room! Others have mentioned the four-way stop. We didn't find it very destracting at all since most traffic died down once it got dark outside. Rodney, Priscilla, and Shelly did a great job of providing a warm and welcoming home away from home. I miss Sandy and Smokey (the outside house cats) already. We'll be back for sure."

2019-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place will stay here again
2019-08-01,5,Stayed about a week,"My husband and I stayed here 9 nights while taking care of some business. I can honestly say the minute we walked in the door it felt like home away home. Very comfortable and peaceful. It was kept clean and i have to laugh at the two cookies. They were so pretty I thought they were magnets until I saw my husband eating one. Everything was well thought out to make it feel like home. I thought the dog dish and biscuits was super sweet for us dog lovers. We stayed during one of the hottest weeks, it was 100 degrees one of the days, but we were comfortable. It's on a country intersection but still quiet and didn't bother us."

2019-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We stayed at the farmhouse for three nights while my husband was on business. We were very comfortable and had all the amenities we needed. SO much better than staying in a hotel. We enjoyed being able to fix our own breakfasts in the morning in the very well stocked kitchen.
Rodney was very accommodating, and the house was fun and eclectic.
Something to know, the house sits on a corner of 2 busy country roads, with a 4 way stop. So expect some traffic noise most of the time."
2019-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We used this as our first night at husband and wife (since we had family at most local hotels and even staying at our own house). It was very clean, decorated cute and had what you would need for a mini vacation. we even met and fed the sweet cats in the morning. Definitely recommend this place 👍🏻"

2019-03-01,5,Stayed about a week,This place is absolutely amazing. I will be staying again in a few weeks.
2019-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is a picturesque country home decorated beautifully, with many amenities, & a great functional kitchen. Lovely front porch & a nice private back patio with a fire pit & grill. There were only 4 of us but the space would work exceptionally well for larger groups of 8-10 or more. Plenty of space to spread out.
Sits on the corner of 2 very busy county roads with a 4-way stop so expect some traffic noise."
2019-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,Rodney is a very responsive host and always available to help.
2019-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My family and I thoroughly enjoyed staying here for a couple of days! The home is cozy, unique, and the beds were super comfy. We loved the two little cats on the back porch too :)"

2018-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is a charming, comfortable farmhouse. The bottom floor is available for 4 people, foyer, living room, dining room, two beds-two baths- the upper floor can be rented for more than four. The kitchen is well equipped for cooking if you intend to do that - we did. It is situated on a fairly busy intersection of 2 FM highways so the extra noise could be a factor to light sleepers. The information that is available to prospective renters is accurate."
2018-11-01,5,Group trip,"This home is beautiful and perfect for any type of trip. If you want to go to town it close to many places. If you want a quiet place to rest and relax it gives you that too. So many personal touches, Rodney really cares about making your stay great. I can’t wait to visit again."

It got a bit chilly at night, the place heated up nicely. Throw blankets were nice to have. Thank you, hope to stay again real soon.
Regards, Tracy"
2018-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My husband and I won a free night there after our wedding and then bought a second night to make the most of this beautiful home! The home is beautifully decorated and is clearly an antique home with modern luxuries. It has been well taken care of and renovated and has more than enough space for a decently sized group. My husband and I had the whole downstairs which had two bedrooms and two bathrooms which, for two people, felt rather luxurious. Since this was a part of a contest, they left us some very sweet gifts and I must say they truly know how to make their guests feel special!"
2018-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful and stylish, history and comfort in one location. Just outside of town, country living close to town. Loved loved loved the location. Pet friendly was a plus, we could bring our fur baby and the outside cats are some attention seeking critters!!!"
2018-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Traveling to Longview, there are two specific places I will usually stay. This has definitely been added to the mix. This trip I needed more space since my sister, her four year old and her 7 month old twins were coming along with my dog and I. So we needed space and somewhere that takes pets. I found this place and I was impressed. Lots of space, very clean, huge yard with a cool place to chill in the back. The front porch was great! Beds were comfy, smart TV was great for kids shows on demand. I was very happy with our stay and our host was very quick with communication. Stay here if you get the chance! May seem far just because of location but it’s actually very close to everything!"
2018-09-01,5,Stayed one night,This house is the perfect blend of peace and accessibility. I loved the thoughtful touches!
2018-09-01,5,Stayed one night,I can’t say enough great things about this place! There is plenty of room to visit and spend family time together. The house is decorated beautifully. It has everything you need. I will stay here every time I am in the area.
2018-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"You won't regret booking this house! Grable Creek Farmhouse is a quaint place in the Piney Woods of East Texas perfect for your get away. Conveniently located just south of I-20. Comfortable beds, spacious house, special touches throughout. We plan to stay here again!"
2018-09-01,5,Group trip,"Great place, amazing house, very comfortable. The host was considerate. Will stay here again. Thank you."
2018-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"This place is everything! I am from the big city so this was a lovely quiet getaway not even 4 hours from home. Pulling up to the home is beautiful, like a blast from the past! Very elegant, yet chic. Then you get inside and the patterns are farmhouse/country chic with elongated wood floors stretch all the way back through the house, with the first bed room and living room on your sides. You keep walking in and there is a stunning kitchen filled with lovely snacks and views the you can easily enjoi. And across from that, the second bedroom! There is also a very lovely sitting area out back and as well as upfront where you can just lounge about, and enjoi the evening. All in all this place was enchanting! The inside was very nicely decorated. There were sighs in numerous places that help you navagate around the house such as ""Welcome"", ""Wifi password is _____"", ""Excuese the mess! This area is closed due to remodeling"" and ""Farmhouse"". Things along those lines. It was very cute and very appreciated! I could go on and on about how lovely this place is, but I'm not one for too many spoilers! Go see for yourself and fall in love with the countryside for a weekend! You'll love it!"
2018-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Came to Longview for work for the weekend. The location was perfect for us traveling back and forth to the Maude Cobb Event Center. The house sits alone and makes for a very relaxing quiet evening. The house was VERY clean, beds were extremely comfortable, and we especially enjoyed the back porch. Highly Recommend!"
2018-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Quaint 1920s farmhouse is just what I needed. Will definitely stay again when I visit Longview. Comfortable and clean!
2018-08-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Rodney was an excellent host. He supplied accurate information, coffee, soft towels and quick responses to our questions. His old, but nice farmhouse is quiet, except when the country traffic stops and goes at the intersection, which he explained in his description. White noise from the window air conditioners cover most of that. You can’t tell from the pictures, but the bathrooms are not next to the bedrooms and can be a problem from less mobile individuals."
2018-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Cute, quaint farmhouse! The king-sized bed was very comfortable and the location was perfect for The Balloon Festival! We enjoyed our visit and would not hesitate to go back.😊"

2018-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"My wife, daughter, black lab, and myself all stayed at Rodney's place 4 days / 3 nights. It's AMAZING!!! There is so much space, nice furniture, it's super stylish, and a very cool experience to be in such an old home. They have made great renovations which allow for modern luxuries, at the same time they preserved the historic feel of the home. Literally, my wife and I cannot express how much we recommend this home. The beds are comfy, and wifi allows you to keep up with your favorite Netflix show. The front porch is gorgeous and the back porch has lights strung around it, comfy chairs, a firepit, and a charcoal grill. We grilled fajitas and had a good time around the fire with friends. If you want a relaxing weekend getaway, or family vacation home, you'll not be disappointed with this spot!"
2018-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"We really enjoyed our stay at Rodney's place. It is a very well decorated, charming farmhouse. I wish we could have stayed longer, but I'm sure we'll be back since we have family in Longview!"
2018-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This home was the perfect getaway from the hustle and bustle of every day life.... and to do absolutely nothing. I loved sitting on the porch swing watching the sunrise and sunset. The beds were so comfortable! The house was very clean and decorated with the perfect mix of elegant modern farmhouse furnishings. I loved the little touches like big fluffy towels and pillows, dog biscuits for my dog, breakfast bars, cream and coffee and sleepy time tea. I was so relaxed the whole time...I didn’t want to leave. I am already dreaming about going back. Rodney and Priscilla were amazing! So helpful, laid back and accommodating. I loved this place❤️"
2024-06-01,5,Group trip,"Charming house! We found it very pleasant to sit on the front porch to enjoy our morning coffee. More spacious then shown in the pictures. Adorable furnishings and comfortable bedding. If we have another reason to be in the area, we would definitely stay here again."

2024-03-01,5,Group trip,"A wonderful farmhouse with two lovely bathrooms and four full size bedrooms each with its own bed (And, isn't THAT hard to find?). The kitchen has all of the needful things (and a few extra). The flowers and trees around the front of the house are lovely, and viewing them from the porch swing and other patio furniture is quite comfortable. The home smells fresh and clean, and the decorations are so fun! The bird feeders in the back drew many fun, lovely birds, and the barn cats are sweet.
My family had a wonderful stay there!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,The perfect place to spend our wedding weekend! Coffee on the front porch was my favorite. The bed was so comfortable…felt just like home!

2024-01-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Fascinating place , comfortable, homey"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Great visit overall. The house was well sized to handle our family Christmas ! Grandkids enjoyed playing in the yard, and playing games in the house. There is plenty of room to spread out for 2 families with kids to share the house. Plan ahead for items you need as the local grocery is a bit of a drive. Very nicely decorated for Christmas! Plan ahead for cook wares as the house is limited on cooking items. Great spot for family gatherings."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,This place was perfect for our family over the Christmas holidays. We had sold our home and are living down the road at Fernbrook RV Park. This home allowed us to all be together at Christmas. Thanks so much!
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Fantastic perfect place for our family get together. Made us feel like we were on the set of a hall mark movie set our whole family felt special. Loved the kitties
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We really enjoyed our stay. Cozy and cute place with great amenities. Very responsive host. Just be sure you know this is at the corner of 2 very busy farm to market highways. I would recommend staying here.
2023-11-01,5,Group trip,"This was such a great find. My cousin lives close by so we visit her and her family often. My mom, boyfriend, sister, brother-in-law, niece and I all came up from Houston and this was the perfect house for us all to have own space to relax together and separately. We wish we would have arrived earlier to spend more time here! We can’t wait to stay again."

thanks, Rodney!
Sherry Cupp"
2023-05-01,5,Group trip,"I was so pleasantly surprised with this house. Not only did it match the pictures and descriptions, but it had positive surprises like laundry detergent and 2 washers, a nearly fully stocked kitchen equipped with ice, a dog bowl for my fur babies, dog treats, and dishwasher detergent. We literally only had to bring shampoo and conditioner. Everything else was there. The house was so clean-not even a spec of dust! The ceiling fans were on and some lights and the AC had cooled the house. We arrived and felt welcomed. The beds were comfy. Coasters would have been nice in the rooms since everything condenses in the humidity but that’s not a huge thing. The shower only bathroom door kept popping open even when locked so we got creative to let others know it was in use. I appreciated the fenced yard for kids and pets. We enjoyed the fire pit and lounge chairs out back. And of course the front porch swing! Upstairs had window units for air that worked great and kept the noise of the road dwn"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Rodney is an excellent host and very responsive. We highly recommend him!
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,Perfect place for our family to stay when going to our nephews graduation in Longview!

2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We had a girls weekend and we each had out own room and were not tripping over each other. We had a good time and when we were at the house we enjoyed sitting on the front porch in the shade with a nice breeze blowing.
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Rodney’s Place was very charming and comfortable. Every bedroom was comfortable and cool. There were also two full bathrooms that accommodated all our needs.

Smokey and Sandie were bonuses we all adored."

2023-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Lovely stay at the farmhouse. House has everything you need and is neat and clean, has lots of room and character. Having the backyard was definitely a plus. The location is good and surroundings are nice but the 4-way stop directly outside is quite busy and noisy."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Communication was great. House was clean and as described. We didn't spend much time there as it was just a place to sleep while at a golf tourney. Some of us had a little bit of trouble sleeping with traffic noise even with the window units running. Other than that, it was great."
2023-03-01,5,Group trip,We loved our girls getaway! We really enjoyed the details of the decorations! Perfect amount of room! Thank You!

2023-01-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We were in town visiting family. There were 6 of us staying at the house and it was very comfortable. The house is larger than the pictures show and it had everything that we needed. We traveled with our dogs and the fenced back yard was a plus. There are 2 sweet kitties that live outside but were very dog savvy and steered clear of them when they were in the yard. As other reviews have said, the intersection outside is very busy and you can hear a random car here and there. We just turned on some white noise and the a/c in our room and it was not an issue. We would definitely stay again when in town!"
2023-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Felt right at home, beautifully decorated for our Christmas family time! Thank you, we will be back!"

2022-11-01,5,Group trip,"We were so excited to arrive and see all the space. The pictures online do NOT do it any justice. We stayed because our daughter got married at Reserve Event center and needed a place with space that wasn't too far away. When we arrived and realized it is 2 story with all the room, we were so excited. My mom had room to finish final alterations on wedding dress and bridesmaids dresses while my sister had plenty of room to decorate the cake. In the mist of all this chaos, we were very thankful for all the Christmas decorations which just reminded us of the season and to take a deep breath in that moment. We felt we were in a Hallmark Movie and everything was very heartfelt and touching.
We did not have any issues, but did reach out to host a couple of times with questions and he responded very quickly each time."

2022-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,This is a really great place my family and I always enjoy our stay! Mr. Rodney is really nice and is always there to answer every question or concern!
2022-06-01,5,Group trip,"There is nothing about this home that I did not love. Simply stated it was beautiful beyond words, clean and spacious. The nuance of the era is framed with such a coziness that you can’t help but feel at home the moment you cross the threshold. It was the perfect venue to host our baby shower and we will return for future events.Kitties we’re a surprise bonus, too!"
2022-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"The only negative thing about this place, is the vehicular noise from the 4 way stop."

2022-05-01,5,Group trip,We had a fantastic time celebrating my graduation weekend here. I would highly recommend anyone to stay here. Rodney was very responsive to the needs of his guests.

2022-04-01,5,Group trip,If you’re ever passing through with family or staying in the Longview area you should definitely check this place out. Plenty of room for a family of 10. I can’t say enough positive things about this place.

2022-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Cool old house.
It was actually bigger than it looked in the pictures, esp the kitchen. Perfect for a relaxing extended family vacation."
2022-03-01,5,Group trip,"This home was perfect for our family gathering. It had plenty of space and the front porch breeze was so nice.
Even though it’s location is at a busy intersection, the window units were great at night to drown out the sounds and the beds were comfortable. We will definitely keep this one in mind for future gatherings."
2022-02-01,5,Stayed one night,Very beautiful house! Very homey and peaceful. Clean and cozy! We loved our stay and will definitely come back.

2022-01-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"What a lovely and charming home! It was great to have a place to rest after a long drive. The beds were very comfortable and the yard was great for the pups and kiddos.
It’s definitely a bit noisy at night from the traffic so bring your ear plugs if you’re a light sleeper. Regardless, we all slept great!"
2022-01-01,5,Group trip,"Rodney's farmhouse was the perfect place for our group to stay. We were a group of five high school seniors and a chaperone from Pennsylvania who were visiting a local university. The house was spacious, clean, cozy...would definitely recommend it to anyone and if we are in the area again...I hope it's available!"
2022-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,"I was so grateful to see Rodney’s place available when my family was planning a gathering! It was the perfect place to accommodate multiple siblings and their partners. The place was peaceful, and Rodney was an incredibly attentive host who responded to our questions as they came up."
2021-12-01,5,Group trip,"We enjoyed our stay, would definitely stay again."
2021-12-01,5,Group trip,"This is the perfect air bnb! It’s close to Longview and Kilgore. It is way bigger in person, the pictures don’t do this house justice, it’s absolutely beautiful. We came close to Christmas and it was all decorated nice."
2021-12-01,5,Group trip,"Cute house, decorated appropriately for Christmas! We enjoyed our time here celebrating our son's graduation from college! My mom, who uses a walker had a few issues with the thresholds and uneven floors. Overall, had a great time and loved the friendly, barn cats!"
2021-12-01,5,Group trip,The house is amazing and so quaint.
2021-12-01,5,Group trip,"Stunningly beautiful property with plenty of space both inside and outdoors. The host was friendly and helped us with some forgotten items. This location is best for groups or families, there is just so much space to enjoy at this home!"
2021-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,The house is more spacious than what it looks like in photos! Only downside is the second bathroom door doesn’t have a lock and there isn’t a washer and dryer but other than that it was so nice to stay here.
2021-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,Charming experience
2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Amazing place! Its like living in a Norman Rockwell painting or something. Great if you like old buildings, very well presented and cared for!"
2021-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,Feels like at home of warmth and comfort
2021-11-01,5,Group trip,Great place! Would stay again

2021-10-01,5,Group trip,House was very clean.
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place super clean and had all the accommodations we needed!
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The house was super cute. It has comfortable communal areas and a great little kitchen. We enjoyed the outside seating area and grill. The fire pit was nice but we didn't have time this weekend to light it. The kitchen pots, pans, and serving/cooking utensils were great! Having both central AC/Heat AND the window units was awesome as each guest can customize their own room. LOTS of nice pillows and covers on the beds.
The yard cats were very cute and friendly.
Rodney was super responsive and very very nice.
My only suggestion is bring ear plugs if you are a light sleeper. The house is on a 4-way intersection with a stop sign. I was the only one in our group that had issues but I'm a super light sleeper."
2021-10-01,4,Stayed with kids,Cute farmhouse!
2021-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,We had a great stay the house is very nice and accommodating the beds are very comfortable we enjoyed sitting on the big porch area and backyard. We had a good stay& great time! Mr. Rodney is so nice and responded back fast to whatever question I had. Our family enjoyed!
2021-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We love the place, it was clean and neat! It feels like home. Thank you!"
2021-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,Excellent on everything my family and I loved it
2021-09-01,5,Group trip,A lovely home and fabulous host!
2021-09-01,4,Group trip,"The Grable Creek Farmhouse is full of character. We enjoyed the historic details of the farmhouse's original segments!
Guests should be aware that most closets in the home are rustic and not suitable for hanging a wedding gown or other formal clothes. In addition, the 2 upstairs closets are only half height. Only one closet in the home (within the queen-sized bedroom on the 1st floor) is suitable for hanging wedding attire.
If you have elderly guests in your group, please note that a large, high step separates the main floor's queen-sized bedroom from the rest of the home. It could be difficult for elderly guests to navigate. We chose to switch rooms so grandpa didn't encounter trouble with a misstep."
2021-09-01,5,Group trip,This is a must stay!
2021-09-01,5,Group trip,Thank you!
2021-08-01,5,Group trip,It was exactly what we needed. Thanks Rodney.
2021-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This farmhouse is amazing!!! It was the perfect place to host a large family gathering. Everything you need is there. Beautifully decorated, comfortable beds and furniture and love the property."
2021-08-01,5,Group trip,Great home! Super clean and spacious. Definitely recommend!
2021-08-01,5,Group trip,"Amazing place! Communicative and friendly hosts. Large and comfortable house that was made to feel like ‘home’. (Outdoor Cats included!) The beds were super comfortable and the AC was well maintained.
The only thing that caught us off guard was the noise from the intersection, as cars and trucks were passing by during the night. Those of us with street-facing rooms had a hard time sleeping through this. Perhaps double-paned windows would do the job here.
Besides that, strongly recommend this lovely home!"
2021-08-01,5,Group trip,"This cute farmhouse is a great place to stay and close to Kilgore, Longview, and the Gregg County Airport. The beds are comfortable and their is plenty of AC to keep you happy."
2021-07-01,5,Group trip,This place is beautiful! Well decorated and cozy. We will definitely be staying there again!
2021-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"we enjoyed our stay during a baseball tournament. The kitchen was fully equipped with everything we needed. The house was clean and we got clear instruction and good communication from Rodney.
The house can be noisy because is next to an intersección, but that wasn't too bad for us, we got so back to the house so tired from the games that we went to sleep right away.
The bathroom had plenty of extra clean towels."
2021-06-01,5,Group trip,This is a wonderful place to stay. Beautiful home and great communication from our host. We would definitely stay there again.
2021-06-01,5,Group trip,"Country home, but close to restaurants and stores. We enjoyed the country charm."
2021-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"From the decor and architecture to the kitties and artisan soaps, this home is my favorite I’ve ever stayed at. Beds were comfortable, house was spectacularly clean, and there was abundant room for every guest we brought. Thank you, Rodney, for the amazing experience!"
2021-06-01,5,Group trip,"Rodney was fantastic! Excellent communicator, and the house was astonishing."
2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I’ve stayed In Airbnbs in 3 countries and by far this experience was superior to any of those. Rodney’s home gave my family a place to relax and reconnect after a very long year apart. From the moment I entered the house, I felt like I’d found a home that I didn’t know I missed."
2021-06-01,5,Group trip,Its awesome house.
2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The Grable Farmhouse is incredible. Perfect for our girls weekend getaway. Our group of 3 found it ideal for a mini quilting/crafting retreat. The natural and artificial lighting in the dining room is a crafters dream. Convenient to Longview. Beautifully decorated. Spacious. Comfortable. Clean. The warmth and coziness inviting. Look forward to future getaways at the Farmhouse. Highly recommend.
2021-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We had a wonderful time and loved the uniqueness of the home. I love homes with a little charm. The updates made are so nice! Beds are very comfortable and it was really nice to have ceiling fans in every room. I appreciated having tons of bathroom towels available. I would recommend providing more kitchen towels and wash cloths. I would recommend providing the renters with a broom, dust pan and/or vacuum. With the kids in the house, there were crumbs everywhere and we really needed something to clean that up. My sister wanted a washer and dryer however it didn't bother me b/c I wasn't going to spend my vacation doing laundry :-). Overall, lovely time beautiful house and gorgeous landscaping. Thank you for the hospitality."
2021-05-01,5,Group trip,"Eight of us stayed at the house and several more joined us for a LeTourneau graduation party. Everyone slept very comfortably, and we were easily able to prep food for the party in the compact but very functional kitchen. We loved the charm and history of the home, and how we felt completely out in the country but were only minutes from town. Our reason to visit Longview has now graduated, but if we find ourselves back in the area, we would definitely stay again. Texas countryside at its finest."
2021-05-01,5,Group trip,"Beautiful home, flawlessly maintained, and the beds were really comfy. Housed 5 adults comfortably! If you’re a light sleeper, you might have an issue as it sits right at an intersection, but not too much traffic at night since it’s a ways from town."
2021-04-01,5,Stayed one night,Very clean and comfortable home!
2021-04-01,5,Group trip,"We received such great communication, hospitality, and clean, spacious, and comfortable accommodations from Rodney. Grable Creek Farmhouse was perfect for our adult family of 5 to meet and enjoy the weekend."
2021-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,This location was convenient to the family we were visiting. It was more cozy than a hotel and allowed our party to stay together. We loved meeting the kitties!
2021-03-01,5,Group trip,"We loved the large beds and the individual room air conditioners. All of my children managed to set their rooms at a comfortable temperature.
We loved the front and back seating areas for sitting out in the afternoons and evenings.
Plenty of parking and remote enough to enjoy our privacy, but still close enough to Longview and Kilgore to find plenty of places to eat when you didn't feel like cooking."
2021-03-01,5,Group trip,I would give this place six stars if I could! My 6 bridesmaids and I stayed here the night before my wedding. The space was beautiful and comfortably slept all of us. You can tell Rodney has intentionally designed the space. Absolutely loved it!!
2021-02-01,5,Group trip,The house was wonderful to stay in and it was super cozy!!! I would definitely come stay again
2021-02-01,5,Group trip,"The farmhouse is really quaint with comfortable beds. We had the full house and used every room. Our group of seven plus two fur babies were able to spread out, relax, and enjoy the little time we had between events for a family wedding and Dove Hollow Estates. We enjoyed walking through the house and imagining what it once was like when it was a general store. Rodney, the host, was quick with replies to any queries we had. If you need somewhere to stay in that area, we all agree that this is well worth every penny."
2021-02-01,5,Group trip,"Clean, a beautiful home, & Rodney was a great host. I would definitely recommend!"
2021-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,This house was perfect for our extended family and us as we prepared for our son's wedding. Very easy to get to the interstate and other places in Longview. Lots of common area spaces inside and out! We appreciate its availability--much better than renting several hotel rooms and hanging out in the lobby with masks on!
2021-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay
2020-12-01,5,Group trip,The farmhouse was pretty perfect and exceptionally clean. We loved our stay there!
2020-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Very cute and cozy, an ideal spot for a family gatherings or for friends to bond. Close enough to town to find food quickly but far enough to be secluded and quiet."
2020-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"Staying here is like home away from home! It has everything you could think of! It’s so so clean, so cozy, and in the perfect location. Private but also close enough to anything you may wanna get out for! We can’t wait to stay again"
2020-12-01,5,Group trip,"You’ll find a well decorated home, clean, good beds and linens, hot water and two good showers. The bathrooms are not connected to a bedroom and are on the first floor which worked well for our group because there was always one available. Property is on a road corner with fair amount of fast traffic, need to be careful with little ones in the front yard. Back yard is safe. There are fans in every room for climate as well as noise control. This place was very clean, well furnished and decorated, and I’d live in it in a heartbeat!"
2020-11-01,5,Group trip,Loved spending Thanksgiving here! Lots of space for our family.
2020-11-01,5,Group trip,Very charming 1920 farmhouse! Would stay again.
2020-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,"So beautiful, charming, decorated well, and super comfortable. Rodney has been working hard in this beautiful old Texas home, and I hope to return here again. Thank you Rodney for your hospitality!"
2020-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Rodney's home is well decorated, comfortable beds, plenty of space for our whole party, and was in a great location."

2020-10-01,5,Group trip,"Amazing stay! Rodney was a great host and communication was very easy! This house is such a unique and cozy place, we loved it!"
2020-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,We rented this place for Hurricane evacuation. We ultimately didn't get to make it there but Rodney was very good with communicating with us about check in times and other details. If we ever find ourselves in this area we will surely book with Rodney!
2020-10-01,5,Group trip,"Cute, cozy house!"
2020-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Can’t say enough wonderful things about this property. We absolutely enjoyed our stay and will stay again!

2020-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Everything is perfect, clean, and truly a home away from home. Superb place for family gatherings."
2020-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We had a wonderful time at this house. It was exactly what we needed. Rodney answered every question we had promptly. We came as two groups at two different times and it was no problem at all. (The second group arriving when the first group couldn’t be there) Cooking breakfast for my crew was fun. There was much laughter at the table as they enjoyed each other’s company on our first evening. Overall it was a huge success!! If we needed a spot in this area again, we would choose this same place!"
2020-09-01,5,Stayed one night,Good
2020-08-01,5,Group trip,This was the perfect spot for our bride and her bridesmaids to stay for the weekend. So much room! The home is welcoming and warm. Highly recommend.

2020-07-01,5,Group trip,"We had a wonderful time staying in this cozy farmhouse and sure we’ll miss it. Hosts were responsive and considerate, even let us check in an hour early. The barn cats were lovely and sweet. It’s fun feeding and playing with them. Plants are pretty in front and backyard. Plant lovers will enjoy watering them for sure."
2020-07-01,5,Group trip,Enjoyed my stay at Grable Creek Farmhouse.
2020-07-01,4,Stayed one night,"Beautiful home! Clean, and welcoming. There are some things that cannot be changed such as the home sits on the intersection of 2 highways which are busy.
Also, there were some things asked of us as guests that I thought was too much.
Otherwise the place was beautiful and happy and Rodney was very kind and helpful."
2020-07-01,5,Group trip,The place is just wonderful way better than I thought our host were amazing and will definitely come back if we are in town again!
2020-06-01,5,Group trip,"This is a beautiful home! We had 5 adults and a dog and everyone slept so well and enjoyed our time. Plenty of parking, lots of space for outdoor activity, and beautiful indoor decor and amenities."
2020-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Perfect little getaway in East Texas! We loved our stay and it was perfect for the family and our dog. Would recommend this home to anyone in the Longview, TX area."
2020-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We had two families with kids ages 1-13 stay at Rodney’s place. There was plenty of space for everyone and room for the kids to play, both inside and outside. The house is comfortable, relaxing and charming. We had everything we needed and will stay here again if we need a place in Longview!"
2020-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We had the most wonderful time here. We stayed here with our children & grand children the week that our youngest son got married. This house made our week just perfect! Rodney took care of every concern we had immediately. He was kind and so helpful. The wifi was slow, but he even called his company to try to resolve that issue. Highly recommend this beautiful farm house."
2020-06-01,5,Group trip,"Enjoy a spacious and relaxing farmhouse with whimsical, artsy details!"
2020-05-01,5,Group trip,Awesome place! Stayed here with my bridesmaids the night before my wedding and it was absolutely perfect!
2020-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,We had the most peaceful stay at this beautiful farmhouse. We were amazed by the beautiful accommodations and the incredibly beautiful and comfortable beds. If you would love a get away into the country with your family this is the place to go.
2020-04-01,3,Group trip,Beautiful home. Bring cleaning supplies.
2020-04-01,5,Stayed about a week,Outstanding Farmhouse. Very cozy and relaxing! Rodney was very responsive anytime we had questions! The cats are awesome and friendly!
2020-04-01,5,Stayed about a week,Very charming place! Nice getaway from reality being able to sit out back with a fire pit and enjoy the outdoors.
2020-03-01,5,Group trip,"I can not thank Rodney enough for his hospitality. We had rented Grable Creek for the weekend of my son’s wedding. Rain and mandatory “social distancing” changed our plans at the last minute...Rodney stayed in contact with us the whole time so that we were able to make the absolute best of our weekend.
The house was perfect! It’s beautiful and spacious and was jus what we needed. Thank you so much for everything!"
2020-03-01,5,Group trip,"Rodney’s place is wonderfully decorated, clean, and has the MOST comfortable beds!!! Super close to the wedding venue I got married at and it was extremely convenient. Would love another reason to stay there again!"
2020-02-01,4,Group trip,"Beautiful house, would be better if it had AC unit for the whole house."
2020-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We had amazing time! Love the furnishings in the cute knickknacks.
2020-01-01,5,Group trip,Beautiful home and perfect for family vacations. It was kind of like a home away from home. It was very pet friendly and we also enjoyed the company of the 2 'resident' outdoor kitties that greeted us every morning.
2020-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,Recommended place to stay off of the beaten path. This home will be just like your own.
2020-01-01,4,Group trip,"This place was beautifully decorated. Would be perfect for 1-3 couples to stay and relax. We had ten people and it accommodated us just fine, but the couple on the air mattress was cold since there is no central heating! We also didn't use the fireplace, but it was there and beautifully situated underneath beautiful strung lights. A picturesque little patch of calm."
2019-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We enjoyed this house so much! Super cute and cozy, and very easy to communicate with the hosts. Definitely recommend this house!"
2019-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The farmhouse is lovely with four/five bedrooms as there's a room on the landing with a drop-down sofa bed that can serve as a 5th bedroom. (You just have to go through it to get to the king-size bedroom upstairs but it was perfect for our 9 year old grandson who wanted to be near his parents in the adjacent room.)
The house was charmingly decorated for the holiday season. It was cold when we arrived and it took awhile to heat up the house which is reliant on floorstanding space heaters/window units. Once we figured out how not to trip the circuit, it stayed warm.
You feel like you're out in the country even though it's not far from the I-20. It's on the corner of the intersection of 2011 and FM349 which is an established truck crossing. The house is easy to find because the street sign on the corner actually says 7830 FM349, plus the front porch faces 2011 -- it looks just like the photos."
2019-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The hosts are amazing at what they do! This farmhouse will not disappoint! The cozy home feeling to the amazing touches they have done with such things as the goat milk soap (amazing btw) This house is not just a place that feels like home, but is large enough for a family event or get together."
2019-11-01,5,Group trip,Enjoy my stay and will rent aga
2019-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Lovely space with a cozy cottage feeling, but with all the modern amenities. Beautifully decorated and well-maintained home!
We especially enjoyed our evenings around the fire pit with the cafe lights overhead - a wonderful touch."
2019-11-01,4,Group trip,"Great host, cozy farm house!"
2019-11-01,5,Group trip,No issues
2019-11-01,5,Group trip,"Loved it! Slept 8 comfortably. Kitchen was roomy, it was a bit cold for us to use outside area, but it was lovely! Loved, loved, loved the cats!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
2019-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great rental stayed here many nights and enjoyed the hospitality.
2019-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great place to stay, i stay her often while in Longview."
