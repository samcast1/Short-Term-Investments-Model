2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We have stayed here before because this place is awesome! Very convenient to everything but in a super nice, quiet neighborhood ‚ù§Ô∏è From the wonderful bottle of wine to the snacks that were waiting for us, the experience is always way above what you would expect! This is always going to be my ‚Äúgo-to‚Äù when visiting Natchez!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This location and house were perfect! It was close to downtown and very peaceful. Its 2 bedroom/2 private bath floorplan fit our 2 couples' retreat wonderfully. The kitchen, dining and living were in the middle, while each bedroom and bath were at the ends. To top it off, Berdette provided a bottle of local wine. We really enjoyed our stay. Thank you!"

2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I have stayed in Natchez 7 times in the last ten years and always bring friends who have not experienced this gem of a city. Berdette's house is my new favorite! It is walking distance to almost everything we wanted to tour on the spring pilgrimage and to my favorite places to eat: Fat Mamas, Slick Ricks, PigOut and Frankies on Main. This house is wonderfully maintained, absolutely clean, with TWO baths and the beds were total comfort. The neighborhood is quiet with off street and private parking, no street noise and friendly neighbors. We had everything we needed, which wasn't much, but there is no lack of option to actually cook if anyone would like. Personally, I would never consider cooking in a town of culinary delights like Natchez.
Berdette was great with communication, and the visit didn't require much as everything was PERFECT."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Immaculate home, decorated well, plenty of amenities and extras (coffee, tea, etc), and close to almost everything! Loved our experience."

2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This house was super cute and clean. I was impressed with all the extra towels and washcloths and linens. She also had plenty of keurig cups, creamer and sugar. Berdette goes above and beyond on stocking her home and helping you feel relaxed."

2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This home is by far the best Airbnb I‚Äôve had the pleasure of visiting in Natchez! EVERYTHING WAS EXACTLY AS DESCRIBED! Berdette left us a bottle of wine and communicated well! I will be back soon! Anyone looking for a home away from home in Natchez would cheat themselves if they didn‚Äôt reserve this home!

Berdette has thought of every detail one might need including a very well stocked kitchen.
We were greeted with a lovely bottle of wine that was left for us to enjoy.
The house is even better than how is depicted in the pictures. The location is perfect; just minutes away to most places of interest in Natchez and in walking distance to restaurants and downtown.
Berdette is very attentive to any need and responds immediately.
Our two night stay was much too short, we didn‚Äôt want to leave.
Thank you Berdette for your absolutely lovely home, it made our trip to Natchez extra special."

2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This charming period home is so tastefully redone and comfortable for a short or long stay we didn‚Äôt want to leave. Berdette has outdone herself to make it stylishly decorated and have some of the most comfortable furnishings we‚Äôve experienced in all our travels. The linens in both the bed and bath are excellent. The kitchen was well equipped for our indoor cooking needs and a BBQ was provided also. Private parking in the rear is safe and secure. Albeit obscure to find the path to the house the first time, it‚Äôs between the Pink House and Green House on Washington St., we were grateful we didn‚Äôt have to park on the street and hike up the hill to the front door. Rear entry is easy and only 3 steps onto the deck entry and French doors.
We highly recommend this rental and look forward to another visit with friends. 2 bedrooms with 2 private baths was a winner!

2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Wow!!! What a gem!! We had a change of plans when game 7 of the world series didn't happen, and were headed from Jackson to Texas for work...Natchez seemed like a great place to stop. Berdette responded very quickly to my questions and request to check in later the same day. She was incredibly accommodating and we were in love with this house. Tons of character and so inviting! I do not feel like the photos give it justice and show all the touches put into this place to make it feel like home. There was even wine and a goodie bag, which was a very kind touch. We look forward to coming back when we pass through again! Thank you, Berdette for sharing your home with us!!"

2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a wonderful stay at Berdette‚Äôs Airbnb. The pictures do not do this home justice. The house had everything we needed. A well-stocked kitchen, plenty of room, comfortable furniture, very clean with lovely d√©cor. The location is excellent as it‚Äôs ideally located near everything, making exploring Natchez easy. It was the perfect home away from home. Berdette was a great host, very responsive and helpful, leaving plenty of useful information about the area and points of interest. We loved our stay and would highly recommend it."
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Hello Berdette,
Your home was so amazing and beautifully decorated. No stone was left unturned and the entire d√©cor was detailed and picture perfect. We were worried about the a/c as it was amazingly cold but well deserved after a night out for a group of 50 + ladies. The back porch was such an amazing piece of this home, the birds and trees as well as the area allowed me to indulge a little in the recollection of my childhood days. My only regret was amount of time at this home. I look forward to staying here in the future. We did prepare some meals as we have solid roots in Natchez and eating at the Blues & Soul Super Bowl would be a direct insult to our upbringing. We prefer homecooked meals and your place had the space, cutlery, pots and pans to make each meal memorable. The excitement of eating in your dinning area reminded us of meals with our parents. Natchez is the oldest city on the Mississippi river and thank you for allowing us to experience this comfortably.
Grateful,
The Laurant's"

The beds were super comfy, and the kitchen had everything we needed. We also enjoyed sitting out on the deck and porch. The arrangement of the house is perfect and gave us each our own bedroom and bathroom with plenty of privacy as they are on separate sides of the house. We will definitely book this house again!"
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Cute house with a lot of character. The host was very friendly and responsive!
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My friends and I needed a quiet weekend away so that we could celebrate our birthdays and spend some quality time together, and Berdette's home was perfect! The check-in/check-out process was so easy and clear, and Berdette let us know that she was available for any questions we might have had, though we didn't have any because she provides a lovely notebook with information/instructions along with brochures and magazines to help people explore what Natchez has to offer! The home has a private parking behind the house, and the home is beautiful with two bedrooms/two bathrooms and a pull-out couch. The kitchen was well-stocked for our weekend with a lovely dining room, and the bedding was so comfortable! Everything was provided that we needed, and the house was so cozy and warm that we were happy to stay in one day when it rained most of the day. I highly recommend Berdette's home for your visit to Natchez -- it's close to everything you want to visit downtown and is perfect for relaxing, too!"
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,This was only our 2nd time in an Airbnb and it was a hit. The place was very clean and cozy. Berdette was a great host and very easy to communicate with.

The home is immaculate. Everything- I mean everything has been recently painted. It is clean. There‚Äôs not one speck of dust!
The kitchen is nicely Updated and Modern and fully stocked.

Parking was on the street and accessible, never a problem. Joanne was reachable at all times and called back with instruction/answers prior to our stay. Joanne popped by to check up on us during our stay. The beds in both rooms were comfortable. The living room was appealing to the eye and also comfortable chairs. Full size refrigerator, lots of counter space. Myself, my wife, brother-in-law and sister-in-law all agreed that we would stay at this apartment again, upon return to Natchez MS."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great place in the middle of a nice place. More a traveler has nothing to be desired.
2024-04-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,"Pros: Very clean, very easy instructions, great location. Everything we needed. Provided towels and linens, complimentary coffee and tea, and cleaning supplies. Within walking distance of downtown, and the river walk. Small corner bar and horse pulled carriage ride tour within feet of the condo. A very neat experience. And yet very surprisingly quiet in the evenings.
Cons: found out we were not allowed access to the back yard.
Wood bees on the back deck, didn‚Äôt allow us the pleasure to enjoy the outdoors on the property. (However the walk to the river wasn‚Äôt far, and it was enjoyable) and also no secured or private parking. (Which is noted in the description)"

2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Our stay at Joanne‚Äôs place was fantastic. The location was perfect. We arrived and parked on Friday and didn‚Äôt move our vehicle until we left on Sunday.

2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"This was the third time we stayed at Joanne's place. we love Natchez, and her place is in the center of everything. I read before that the corner bar was noisy, but we have never heard any noise from there. It is a comfortable place and we will soon visit there for the fourth time. The bed was so comfortable (we only used one bedroom) , I sleep better there than at home. We stayed 7 days, and after parking (we parked right in front), we didn't get into the car until checkout. We had stayed at other places before this one, but after staying here, we have not stayed anywhere else. If you love Natchez like we do, you won't find a better place to stay. We walked to Under The Hill Saloon, the Camp,the Magnolia Grill, the Bluffs, the Corner Bar, the Pigout Barbecue, The Diner, and almost every other place. Great town with friendly people , and lots to do and lots of places to eat."

2023-10-01,2.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great Hostess, we book with her all the time. However, this place was not well kept.
kitchen floor full of dirt, food under table. Stinky smell in living room area, which turned out to be baby bottles under TV console full of rotten formula.
steep steps, which are loose, hand railing has spinters in it, so holding on while climbing was not an option."

2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was a delightful home for a week of work in Natchez. We enjoyed sitting out on the deck in the evenings, and the Riverwalk is only one block away; most shops are a four block walk. There is lots of information in the apartment on local restaurants and activities.
This upstairs apartment is well equipped, and we appreciated being able to cook some of our meals and do a load of laundry.
We met Joanne twice and she is very calm and professional and a wonderful hostess."

2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Heart of Natchez number two is a great location. Close to everything the unit is fully equipped and comfortable, and if you‚Äôre lucky you‚Äôre able to park right out front. Sitting out on the upstairs deck at night is very peaceful.
I recommend dining at the Camp restaurant, at Natchez Under the Hill. The Pig Out Inn is also excellent. Natchez Coffee Company for breakfast. Or the donut shop, great homemade donuts.
Take an extra day or two and explore the history of Natchez. It‚Äôs worth it."

2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Very enjoyable experience. Joan was very gracious and the place was very comfortable. There‚Äôs no sofa, so couch potatoes beware üòä. There were 3 comfortable chairs for relaxing. The pictures don‚Äôt do the back deck Justice. It was much bigger than it appeared in the photos, runs across both bedrooms and with just as much depth. I will definitely stay again."
2023-03-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,We had a very good stay here. Extremely well located in Natchez such that almost everything is walkable.

2023-02-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"A fairly good spot if you need to be close to or in downtown Natchez. Bed was super soft but pretty comfortable. Nice to have a washer dryer. One of the balcony doors was unlocked when I got there, which was not too concerning because it is a private balcony but still not my favorite."

2023-01-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"There were a lot of positives- very accommodating and responsive host, excellent location, comfortable beds, kitchen stocked enough to use to cook, washer and dryer worked fine, pet friendly is great, patio is nice!
And a few drawbacks- someone had smoked on the patio before we got there and it took a day or so (and having the door open) to get rid of the smell, I didn‚Äôt see that this apartment only had a small shower which was tricky with toddlers, and I agree that the living room chairs are old, uncomfortable for watching television."
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,awesome
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,We loved our stay and will be back.
2022-12-01,4.0,Stayed one night,Convenient downtown location .

Apartment was lovely with two bedrooms, a nice kitchen with a Keuriq, and a great big TV in the sitting area as well as smaller ones in each bedroom. Looking forward to returning when the weather is a bit warmer."

2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We enjoyed our stay. Location was close enough to walk to down town shopping and restaurants, but we frequently drove due to cold weather. Parking in front of the apartment seemed to fill up in the evening, but we always found a spot within a block. Apartment had everything we needed and both bedrooms were good sized and had comfortable beds"
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"This was our 5th visit to Natchez but our first at Joanne's place. This was our favorite by far, the location was perfect. We parked our car accross the street and never got back into the car until 7 days later when we checked out. We walked everywhere. We had a blast in Natchez, as usual, we love this city. The home was so perfect and cozy. It had everything you would need to prepare meals, but due to all the great places to eat, we never cooked. We will definitely stay here every time we are in town. We are retired and fell in love with this town, everyone is so friendly, and the history is so fascinating. The river is beautiful and very close to the airbnb. Definitely a great place to stay."
2022-11-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,"The house has a great location for exploring Natchez. The river walk is 1/2 block away and downtown just around the corner. House had plenty of space for wife and I.

2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Right right, right enough, and a bonus balcony! The furniture and layout is very useful. There are many o-toons for coffee/tea. I appreciated the set up of the two closets and especially liked the tables within the closets ‚Äî much nicer way to lay out a suitcase. I also appreciated the extra hangers.
I also appreciated the extra effort getting a burned-out bulb replaced in time for my friends arrival.
Thermostat was responsive. I liked the moderate amount of decoration : had some spots both over-done with clutter and others overly austere. This place is a nice balance."
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great location. Very close to conference center and restaurants.
2022-10-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Great location. Can walk to great restaurants. Beds are very comfortable. TV is Fire Stick only. Unable to watch any sports events. Den furniture is uncomfortable.

2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"LOCATION LOCATION LOCATION!!! Walk everywhere! Horse and carriage rides right across the street, Corner Bar, downtown churches, Stanton Hall pool and lunch‚Ä¶ Expertly curated kitchen supplies - 3 different coffee makers for your preference and even a cheese grater! The balcony would be perfect, maybe in the winter, but we enjoyed it nonetheless, 75% humidity and all.
Excellent hostess! Easy, late-night check-in!
Just ensure to bring your own bathroom necessities - sparsely supplied. And forget the dryer, takes 3 cycles to dry anything."
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This space was large, clean and adorable. We got in easily and were able to explore the walkable riverfront, have dinner and learn about Natchez. Coffee in the morning before the next leg of our journey was appreciated. We recommend this apartment highly."

2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Joanne‚Äôs place was so perfect for our midweek Natchez getaway. If location and walkability is important to you it doesn‚Äôt get any better than this. We barely moved the car while we were there. We found the space to be perfect for our needs- the full kitchen is nice and also the balcony is wonderful- we were able to eat dinner out there one night and the cafe lights around the balcony are so charming. Joanne also has plenty of brochures and menus for local
Natchez things and they were quite helpful for us. We adored Natchez and can‚Äôt wait to return and when we do I hope this place is available!"

Close to everything, most within walking distance, great restaurants nearby, it has everything. The apartment is easy to find and parking was never an issue. Checkin and checkout both a breeze. The apartment itself is well appointed and stocked with everything you need. The back deck was our favourite; a place to sit with a glass of wine and relax. I highly recommend staying here to anyone looking for a carefree visit to Natchez."

2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We are from the south and this cute, comfortable, welcoming place was reminiscent of visiting family during the holidays. We loved being so close to restaurants and close to Louisiana. We parked on the street directly across from the getaway so taking in luggage was easy. There are stairs up to the cozy spot that is tucked away but is in the middle of downtown. We enjoyed sitting on the deck that provides privacy but allows you to enjoy the sounds of the downtown activity. We look forward to staying here again."

2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We had a great vacation in Natchez. There is a lot to do in this quaint river city. The place is well kept and close to everything!

2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great location to explore all of downtown. Parking is never hard to find and most everything is perfectly walkable. Everything you need for a comfortable stay is right in the apartment. Lovely place for a weekend or even longer.
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The absolute best location! It has a great deck out back, as well. Joanne supplied everything we needed, which was important since we cooked dinners ‚Äúat home‚Äù because of the pandemic."
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Joanne's place is in the perfect location for anything you'd want to do in Natchez! Clean, comfy, and right in the heart of downtown. Would definitely stay here again!"

I highly recommend the Heart of Natchez 2 to anyone looking for a nice and quiet place to stay when visiting Natchez, Ms.
Debra P."
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Joanne‚Äôs place is perfectly located for easy walking around town. The bed is super comfy and overall this was a great place to stay.
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Such a cute place!
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Loved my stay! Was out of power due to the hurricane so I decided to come spend 4 days in Natchez. This place is walking distance to everything in downtown! Will definitely book again when I come back!
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Location is excellent, two blocks from the Main Street business district, walking distance to any of the restaurants in the downtown historic district, several of the tour-friendly antebellum mansions and just two blocks from the bluff. Parking is on-street, but I never had to park more than a quarter of a block away. Besides, it's so walkable you'll likely not get in your car again until you leave.
The upstairs unit has two bedrooms with ample closet space, both of which open to a deck, full kitchen with dishwasher, standard sized refrigerator and to-the-ceiling cabinetry you'd expect in a moderate sized home (as opposed to the typical ""kitchenette""), dining and living areas. The single bathroom (a consideration if two couples are sharing) was generously stocked and has a stackable washer / dryer. The kitchen is also generously stocked with cookware, coffee, tea & water.
Natchez has much older architecture than most destinations, with more than its share of old, musty, not-so-clean venues. Everything was thoroughly clean with none of that ""old house"" musty smell. Decor is charming enough to let you know you're in Natchez but clean, modern and functional where you'd want it.
It's apparent Joanne places considerable effort and priority on generating repeat visits. We will certainly be one (or more)."
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great location.
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Excellent spot for a weekend getaway to Natchez! This was our first visit and we had a wonderful time. Joanne‚Äôs place is in the perfect location.

2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"You cannot ask for a better location to the Mississippi River with a beautiful walking area right along the bluffs. Incredibly easy check in, wonderful mattresses and a very cheerful, homey atmosphere. Nice addition to have washer/dryer and do a load of laundry after a long trip. The only suggestion is a new showerhead is desperately needed."

I think every booking site needs a bed review and this stay has amazing beds- soft and comfy- for me this is a must!"

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We LOVED this space. We were just passing through Natchez for a night with our dogs and The Carriage House was available and walkable to the water/downtown. The space was beautiful, just like the pictures well-decorated and a million things to look at. So stylish! Fridge was stocked with drinks and there were also lots of snacks and coffee available.
The bed was super comfortable and there was lots of seating including a comfy daybed by the big windows in the kitchen. I want to go back and work remotely there!
It is up the same driveway and shares the same gorgeous yard as the main house, so not extremely private when outdoors if you're looking for that but the owner was extremely friendly and helpful :)"

2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"It was very easy to find the carriage house and we were delighted to have our own parking spot. The house was lovely and I‚Äôd love to know who decorated because it is absolutely beautiful! It was incredibly cozy and after a long day of exploring it was nice to be welcomed by such a comfortable bed. The area felt very safe and had plenty of restaurants and coffee shops within walking distance. We found ourselves at the brewery each night for a pizza and a beer (if you‚Äôre lucky you‚Äôll get to pet the brewery owners cat). If not, don‚Äôt fear, Jim has the sweetest dogs that will happily accept head scratches. Everyone we encountered was incredibly kind and I wish we could have stayed longer.

We have explored many parts of the South but never Natchez until now. The property is absolutely gorgeous and surrounded by notable antebellum homes (it's basically in the heart of what's known as the On-Top-of the-Hill Historic district). I had a few questions about Internet and how to adjust the heat which Marla promptly answered. For breakfast we enjoyed The Little Easy, a short walk away."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"The photos do not do it justice, this is an absolutely beautiful home. My fiance and I found ourselves referring to it as home, I loved every little detail and pieces that were put together. From all different cultures, you can tell there's a lot of history in the pieces they chose and in the home itself. There were a lot of different drinks in the fridge and tons of different snacks, it was nice to have that. We met the property owner, Jim, and he was really nice; he greeted us when we arrived and we were packing up to leave. There are plenty of food options around, we were able to walk to them easily and each place we went to was superb. My fiance and I had a wonderful stay and will definitely be coming back again. We'll be recommending this home to all our friends and family. Thank you Marla and Jim for providing a splendid stay."

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I was looking for a quiet spot with a pretty view to enjoy a holiday weekend away. Close to the river, the Terrace Carriage House couldn't have been more perfect.
The key was left in the mailbox for easy check-in, and I appreciated not having to chat after a drive and a walk around the city. The house was clean, cool, and welcoming, and the wide array of snacks, good coffee, and drinks was far above my expectations.
I spent my mornings reading and writing, enjoying the delicious feeling of having been happily left behind a tour group in a museum, free to drink in the beautifully curated collections around me in solitude. The many lamps and thick, dark curtains made the space feel cozy and private, and I loved hearing the bustle of the day outside, knowing I wouldn't be interrupted.
The hosts have thought of absolutely everything ‚Äî big, thick towels, soaps and a nice hair dryer, a comfortable bed, and every appliance you might want. This unique little spot is an oasis and a dream!"

2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"A lovely, comfortable, highly original place in a beautiful neighborhood. Easy to walk to lots of places. There were lots of little treats for us when we arrived, which we appreciated, and it was very easy to check in. The place was really lovely. The one slight hiccup is that the wifi information on airbnb is out of date: there's a different set of wifi login information on a sheet in the living room which we didn't notice until a couple of days later."

2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"This is the second time I have stayed in one of Marla's properties and she does not disappoint. This place is in a beautiful historic neighborhood that is easily walkable to restaurants and the lovely Mississippi bluffs.
The rental is just as pictured. Each of her places seems to be designed with guests in mind. Everything you could need (coffee, tea, snacks, a bottle of wine as well as quality linens and towels) is provided. The spacious rooms are full of interesting things that must have been carefully curated to create a relaxed but lux feel.
I will look for Marla's places every time I visit the area because when I stay in them I really feel like I have been somewhere. She is the Natchez hostess with the most."

2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,We greatly enjoyed our stay. Myrtle Terrace Carriage House is a perfect short stay little home. The owners stay in the Main House (Myrtle Terrace) next door and they are great. Friendly and accommodating. They love animals too (dogs and cats). If you love animals you will be welcomed by both the furry friends and the owners equally. We are bicyclists and we‚Äôre allowed to store our bike in the car port to keep them out of the weather.

The home is stunningly and eclectically decorated with pieces from all over the world. We spent quite a bit of time just browsing the artwork while there. The bed was very comfortable and the fresh fruit, snacks, drinks, and even a bottle of wine were an unexpected pleasant surprise. It is located just a few blocks from the river, situated around gorgeous historic homes, and you can walk to several great restaurants or the river for the sunset. Try the Little Easy for breakfast and if you like pizza and beer, the brewery down the block. We highly recommend staying here! Only thing to note is that there are 4 dogs living on the owner‚Äôs property who are very sweet, but they do bark at times. We were out exploring the beautiful city and it didn‚Äôt bother us much. The city in general has poor cell service / wifi or maybe it‚Äôs just Verizon that stinks. Other than that, it‚Äôs a must see city and home!"

2021-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This house is super cute, very close several restaurants, and the hosts were very friendly and accommodating!"
2021-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The hosts were wonderful. welcoming and inviting, not only into the apartment but also there home as well. you'll be treated like a family friend come to visit and not someone who's spending there time in a rented room. while Natchez may offer plenty of options for overt stays non will be as welcoming and enjoyable is this."

Amazing decor and really interesting pieces from all over the world. Within walking distance of lots of stuff. And that is just your space.
We were also able to connect with the lovely hosts who live in the main house. They gave us a tour and made us feel like visiting friends. The grounds are beautiful. They are lovely. We will be back and will send our friends."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Awesome host, I forget all my toiletries and they had everything.
Would 100% stay again, thanks!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The home is extremely comfortable and cozy. The owners were not only responsive but were flexible with an extended check put time due to a late arrival.
The home is immaculately clean and inviting. We are looking forward to visiting for more than one day."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Everything was clean and as described. I would not recommend the place for two couples, as the sliding barn doors on the bedrooms and bathroom do not offer much sound privacy, but it was just my husband and me this trip, so it worked well for our needs. We utilized the kitchen for preparing our supper and breakfast and had everything we needed. The location is great. It's just a short drive to the river."
2024-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I stayed with my parents during a family trip down the Mississippi. It was a great stay. My parents are quite picky about accommodation, and even they liked the place a lot. The house was spotless and everything was very well organized. Even the towels and the beddings smelled fresh. The area felt safe and it was a very short drive to the downtown area. Frank had been very helpful and super responsive. I would definitely consider staying here again if visiting Natchez."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We enjoyed all the small, thoughtful details in the unit. We walked into town easily, following the Natchez trail & its historical signs there & back, which was also nice. We also enjoyed drinking morning coffee on the porch & watching/listening to the numerous birds in the surrounding trees."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great stay! Thank you!
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very good stay in the accommodation.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is a great place to stay in Natchez. The house is great, everything feels new inside. The kitchen is well stocked for those of us that like to cook. It is a lovely, comfortable house. What makes this even better is how much is within walking distance. We walked to restaurants, the Visit Natchez store, the river (twice), museums and Stanton Hall."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Everything was great! The beds were amazing... loved all of the bed pillows.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"A really nice apartment. We felt very comfortable. The amenities were great, especially the stuff in the kitchen was new and high quality. Especially the little touches have made you feel welcome immediately."

2024-03-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Frank & Mandy were very responsive. Rental has obviously been updated recently. I don't want any of the following to reflect poorly on them or the rental, but I wanted to point out the things that would have made the place much better for our (& future renters') needs. There's only 1 extra blanket provided & no extra linens. We were only 3, but one of the kids was in a bed & the other on the couch. Toilet's small (not elongated & low to the ground). It is also slow to flush (you have to hold the handle down). Shower floor's very slippery. Showerhead's mounted low (it almost touched the top of my head & I'm 5'9""). The shower curtain is hung too low, so a good 3""+ bunches on the tub floor (not only icky-everyone's runoff water is collecting on that curtain, but also a trip/slip hazard. Only light in the bathroom is 2 spotlights in the ~10' ceiling (terrible lighting for makeup/hair) & there are no other mirrors by outlets. Barn doors don't provide privacy & no handle to open from inside."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Perfect location to walk just a few blocks and be in the heart of Natchez. Spacious living room.
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,The place was beyond expectations and loved the small town. So much history!! Thank you for the awesome stay!

2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Absolutely Percect!!
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We had an amazing time for our girls' weekend. There was a small issue upon check-in that was addressed IMMEDIATELY and we were SO appreciative. We parked our car on Friday and didn't move it until we checked out on Sunday. We walked everywhere. I'm already planning our next stay. ‚ù§Ô∏è
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We loved this 2BR unit. Less expensive than many hotels in area with many amenities. Very fair cancelation policy and fees. Loved modern inside but old charm of outside porch and swing. Easy walk to Main St. shops and eateries and to the river. Felt very safe.
The host added a lot of thoughtful details like a throw blanket, bottled water and selection of items travelers often forget like toothpaste, razors and shampoo.
We also loved the deep south and Natchez decor in house. Just so perfect. Great communication with Frank and Mandy. Hope to stay here again."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We enjoyed our first stay the house was beautiful looking forward to a great visit again
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My sister and I had the best time at Frank and Mandy‚Äôs place. For starters, the house was super cute and very clean: it smelled fantastic! The house was stocked with basics and a few extras‚Ä¶coffee, creamer, toiletries and some snacks. The location is perfect. Far enough away from the river to be quiet, but close enough to quickly walk anywhere in the area. We walked to the river, to dinner, to coffee and shopping. It was delightful! We‚Äôre hoping to make our sister trip a tradition, and will happily return to Frank‚Äôs place the next time we find ourselves in Natchez. I‚Äôve stayed in my fair share of Airbnbs, and this was probably the best value I‚Äôve found."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Charming rental, great location in quiet neighborhood near downtown."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We enjoyed our one-night stay and wish we could have stayed longer! The house was exactly as described and pictured. High-speed internet (perfect for me as I work 100% remotely). And the beds/pillows were the comfiest of any hotel or Airbnb we have ever stayed at. If you're heading to Natchez, I highly recommend you stay here. We will be back! :)"
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Thanks a lot for welcoming me into your place! It was everything and more. We had such a great time and couldn‚Äôt ask for a better experience. It‚Äôs was exactly the way I pictured.

2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Frank's place is excellent and I highly recommend it! The location is very convenient to downtown Natchez restaurants and the waterfront both by car and on foot. Both beds are comfortable and it was easy to adjust the heat and a/c settings. Coffee, tea and convenient breakfast foods were available as were toiletries in the bathroom. The keypad gave us easy access to the property and we parked conveniently across the street. (There is also a gravel parking spot available). This was one of the most comfortable, convenient stays we have ever had with Air BnB."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Clean, Cute and Cozy! The host was attentative and responded quickly."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Beautiful property with excellent amenities. Walkable location downtown and loved the little extras like the complementary toothpaste and razors! Those little touches made a big difference. The only downside which is not too bad is that the walls on the duplex are a little thin so you can slightly hear the people next door, but it was fine. Highly recommend."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Franks place was just as described. Frank responded to our texts very quickly, and the amenities he offered we above and beyond what we needed. The place was spotless and we felt very safe. We could not have stayed at a hotel for what we paid for this fabulous place! Would recommend 10 out of 10 times!"
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The duplex seems to have been recently renovated to a very high standard. It was very cozy. The place is very clean and they provided little details most host don‚Äôt.
It‚Äôs right near downtown and all the shops and restaurants. The off street parking was an added bonus.
Would definitely stay here again. Thank you for making our stay in Natchez so nice."

2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place is a gem! The home is tastefully decorated and free of clutter. It was spotless! It even smelled good when I walked in. There was no problem using the lockbox. It was plenty spacious. You could move easily from room to room because of the barndoors which also provided a nice separation of the rooms for cooling. I liked that you could adjust the temperature of the rooms individually. The sheets were soft and comfy. I felt safe in the area, too. I liked that I could drive right up close to the door so I could unload all my stuff. Frank responded quickly with any concerns I had. This is a great place to stay!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My stay was simply amazing.! The room was clean, spacious and just breathtaking. The shower had the best water pressure ever. It was the perfect location! I will be staying here my next visit for sure."

Loved the walkability to dozens of great places to eat and shop. James was great and kind enough to provide extra towels so we didn‚Äôt have to do laundry. But they do provide a laundry room with 2 new washers/dryers as well as detergent, etc. A hidden gem on the river! We will certainly be back!"

Noise on Friday and Saturday nights until 12 am was louder than anticipated"

2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"If I could give this place more than 5 stars, I would! It was perfect for our weekend getaway.

Very roomy with a super nice bathroom. Located over a bar and grill and can get a bit noisy. James provides ear plugs if needed. The sound of people enjoying themselves never bothered us. We already booked our next stay in July! Thanks again James.
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful room, comfortable bed & furniture. Peaceful and comfortable balcony with great views. We enjoyed our stay and will be going back."

2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I love historic homes and places. This Airbnb is charming, clean, quaint, walkable in front of the Mississippi River, and renovated. It's located above a restaurant which gets a bit loud toward the evening - but everything closes around 10/10:30 pm so the noise didn't bother me. The host was super responsive and helpful. Would recommend it and stay again!"
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The place was great if you‚Äôre looking for a stay that‚Äôs a good walking distance from everything in Natchez.

2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Great location. Large, private room. Walked everywhere I needed to go. I was there on a weekday work trip, but this place would be a great weekend getaway. Wish I had longer to see Natchez."

The bathroom was spacious and clean as well. And has amazing water pressure.
Room was easy to come and go as we pleased and next to all of the local shops, eateries and dives.
We can‚Äôt wait to visit Natchez again and will bring friends to this same spot the next time we come!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I had never been to Natchez, so I picked this cute place because I loved the pictures of the surrounding area. The building is an old cotton warehouse, that has been transformed into bedrooms upstairs. I had a little difficulty finding it at night, but James was super responsive and helped me find the place. The room was huge and has a shared balcony. My mother and I enjoyed our short stay, and I would love to come back again!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was absolutely a gem. We stayed here during the 4th of July it was the perfect spot to watch the fireworks. The room was spacious, clean, and quiet. I only wish they had a microwave for warming left overs. Definitely worth the stay! The host were very responsive and accommodating. Thanks for a pleasant experience."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Beautiful balcony view of the Mississippi River. The room is spacious and well-appointed. I love the historical vibe of the building but with more traditional, classy decor. Watching the sun set over the MS River was our favorite part."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Perfect little room, perfect location! My mom and I had a great stay and had fun walking everything. So many shops and good eateries close by. If we ever go back to Natchez, we‚Äôll definitely be re-booking!"

2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is a most fantastic place to stay in Natchez. It is walkable to many of the Antebellum homes, in sight of the river, across from a beautiful park/bandstand/walking trail. The room is so gorgeous with the old timber framing and brick. The only negative is the bar below. On Friday and Saturday nights there is live music and seemed to be right under our room making the floor shake. We were aware of this before booking and we would stay again in spite of it affecting our nights to some degree."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Perfect location
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My husband and I enjoyed our stay, especially the view of the Mississippi River from the balcony. The place is walking distance from restaurants and shops. Perfect place to stay. üòä"

2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The pictures and description were 100% spot on. Great location, across the street from the walkway along the bluffs above the Mississippi River. The bathroom was clean, spacious, and nearly instant hot water. There's access to a long shared balcony. For some reason late night revelers chose the table outside our room to set up shop, but the noise was negligible. There is a ton of shopping and excellent restaurants within easy walking distance. A private off street parking lot offered plenty of room. Told all our Natchez friends about it, so they could tell their other out of town friends. FYI -I think this place fills up pretty fast, so I'd not waste any time if you're interested"
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Love staying here, love the relaxing atmosphere, enjoy people watching from the balcony! This is one of our favorite places we come and specifically for this location"

2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Perfect spot for a Natchez get-a-way! This is located above a delicious restaurant so some music can be heard but it didn‚Äôt bother us at all. Patio was beautiful. 10/10

2023-02-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Great location and awesome suite with nice view. Some of the amenities are getting a little dated. During our stay the elevator was broken and it was a little loud. Great venue overall especially if you like the ‚ÄúNew Orleans‚Äù feel‚Ä¶
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful room with an awesome view! It is located in the middle of everything so there is a lot to to within a walkable distance but once you close the bedroom door you felt like you were in your own little world!

This may become our little secret getaway (from NOLA).
Oh, we also had a late-ish night dinner at the restaurant below and the staff were great! We didn‚Äôt get a chance to visit the wine store but we will next time.
Thanks, James. ü§ù"

The only negative is there is a bar/restaurant right under the rooms that plays live music. I wish we would have been told about it before hand. If you are one to join in(which we did) it‚Äôs fine. But if you plan on going to bed early, not so much. They do provide earplugs. Other than that it was a great experience."

2020-12-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,"We could have managed with the bar noise from down stairs, especially since the room was absolutely beautiful and impeccably clean. Unfortunately the suite and other rooms next to us were rented out for a birthday party (20+ people) that was beyond loud well into the night. Beautiful room, great location, but do not recommend if you are looking for a relaxing, quiet weekend. If you plan to party downstairs until the bar closes (and hope the rest of the hotel isn‚Äôt rented for a birthday party), it‚Äôs a great choice."

The room had a few short comings(situated directly above a live music venue, shelving missing in shower, and a lack of soap) but nothing that took away from the overall stay quality.

The home was cute and comfortable, and the kitchen had everything you could need! Our one complaint was that the toilet was small and wedged very tightly between the wall and sink, which Joanne couldn‚Äôt fix without a major remodel so we didn‚Äôt mention it.

The AC works well‚Äîreclining sofa was nice to have. The piano was awesome to play. Very quiet neighborhood, peaceful. The refrigerator had opened/used condiments, etc., for your convenience to cook with, which we prefer not to use at all (you just never know who stayed before you and used it or how old something might be‚Ä¶not very sanitary). If you don‚Äôt mind that, it is a nice thing to have on hand if you‚Äôre cooking a lot."

The home felt both spacious and cozy, and special touches were provided, such as coffee and cookies. Buttons the Cat was a delightfully unexpected surprise, and his friendly presence enhanced our experience! It is probably important to mention that parts of the surrounding neighborhoods are shockingly dilapidated, but Joanne's home is nestled in a lovely enclave and I felt completely safe both in the home and walking in the neighborhood. At sunset, we walked through the neighborhood to the trail that meanders along the bluffs overlooking the Mississippi River, and walked back after dark. It was a very pleasant evening and I would without hesitation stay there again."

2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Joanne's place in Natchez is a true gem. The location is wonderful - I walked each morning to the Bluff or the Old Cemetery and I miss those walks terribly. The area is gorgeous, the people are kind and friendly (in no other city have I collected so many cheerful, genuinely nice ""good mornings!"" on the street than in Natchez), and the house itself felt like home from the moment we arrived. The garden is meticulously planned and lush (we loved our breakfasts on the patio, surrounded by hummingbirds), the bed and the couch in front of the TV comfortable, the kitchen is spacious and well equipped even if you want to cook. There was even a piano and Scribble to play :). As for Joanne, I emailed her three times with various questions and she emailed me back promptly and with good advice each time. Truly, I have nothing but praise for Natchez, the house, and Joanne herself."

During the day I was able to walk back and forth to my conference at the Grand Hotel in less than 10 minutes. I wasn‚Äôt comfortable waking alone at night, but that comes from living in New Orleans for too long.
The house was easy to locate and instructions for check in were a breeze.

All the amenities were provided, fridge included filtered water and ice, lush throw blankets and extra pillows galore. Even stocked coffee station ready for us ü§©
The house was a block away from town, so super quiet. Walking distance from the river and several places to hang out. A few highly recommended stops‚Ä¶
1. Dinner first night, get takeout from Rolling Rock. Try the Rolling Rock Egg Rolls, fried broccoli, and small rib tips‚Ä¶ feeds two easily - mouthwatering.
2. Steampunk Coffee the first morning is a 10 minute walk through all the beautiful homes in the morning and provides eclectic view to people watch.
3. For a delicious early dinner (and awesome beer selection) head under the hill to The Camp, then swing next door to the Saloon for a cocktail and darts.

Enjoy!"

The floors have been preserved so well and literally shine. The calming effect is indescribable. The location offers the best of both worlds watching the neighbors head off to work each morning but only blocks away from the shops and restaurants.
I could have stayed forever."

The house is absolutely adorable and you can tell it was restored with such care. Also they have thought of everything you could need for your stay- the house is so well-stocked! The king size bed is extremely comfortable and the decor is so nice. The kitchen is surprisingly large for a smaller home and though we didn‚Äôt have the time to cook in it I wish we did because it was beautiful! The location is so great. We walked everywhere.

Neighborhood noise and police cars all night, but still felt safe Inside the home. Natchez is a beautiful historic city, and we would stay here again, we loved the home so much and the bed was very comfortable!!! We would just drive to where we want to go after dark, that's all.

The original wood floors on this restored old home are just a bonus. We highly recommend Sarah's place!"

Can easily fit a large kennel with plenty of room. About 1 mile from Joe Bobs Bait Shack. About 4-5 miles from the Vidalia public landing. Can easily walk to many of Natchez favorite restaurants. We had no problems fitting a truck with a 16ft boat attached in the driveway. Plenty of yard for dogs to go potty. Beautiful front and back deck to sit on. Hosts are so easy to communicate with, and only one text away for any issues. We‚Äôll most definitely be back for our next river fishing trip!"

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Joanne was easy to work with and helpful during our stay. The cottage was clean and cozy. The bed is comfortable as well as the bedding. We loved the porches and enjoyed seeing a few fireflies in the courtyard area. The kitchen and living areas are small but has everything you need and the space is utilized well. We also rented the Southern style home located in front of the cottage and this space was perfect to accomodate our larger group. We appreciated the covered and screened in area joining the two homes which kept the mosquitos away from us when going between the two houses. In the event that you do not need both homes, the owners have done a nice job of maintaining privacy between the two houses- separate parking areas/driveways, multiple porches that do not face each other, and plenty of curtains/blinds/drapes. Overall, it was nice visit."

2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place is super cute, quiet, and perfect for a couple in need of a relaxing space. The cottage is exactly as the pictures depict. The back patio was my favorite space and the kitchen proved quite useful. I would definitely recommend this space!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This small cottage is perfect for a couple‚Äôs getaway. My fianc√© and I felt very comfortable for our short stay. The deck of the patio ties very nicely.
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"It was perfect for our weekend getaway, it was our first time in Natchez, the cottage was quiet and peaceful"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great little place to stay.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Fantastic host !
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Wonderful and quite for a weekend getaway. Very peaceful and a great porch in back with a nice garden and fig tree. Loved the outside lights and everything that you would need for a relaxing time and space. JoAnn was very prompt in getting back to us when we decided to stay an extra day. This was a great place to stay for a long weekend in Natchez.
Sarah and Mike"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This is a beautiful place and feels very private. Lovely porches to relax on, and a nice garden as well. The home is spacious and clean, and classic. I liked the set up and Joanne was friendly and helpful. I arrived at night so as I was approaching the place the neighborhood seemed somewhat dodgy, but the cottage is separate and isolated enough where I didn‚Äôt feel unsafe by any means. It‚Äôs a super quick drive to downtown and very convenient. I only got to stay here one night but would have stayed longer if I had time."
2023-07-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"The home is lovely, and the gardens are beautiful. The area is very quiet for a relaxing stay."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very comfortable accommodation.
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Really enjoyed our stay
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This place is a rare jewel. It was a perfect place beautiful & quaint on the inside & out! It had everything we needed. Comfortable bed, large shower, lavender scented towels & the best back porch to relax on. We will definitely be staying again!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Really cute little cottage. Exactly the right size for a couple. Nice secluded little porch on the back of the cottage. Had everything we needed for the weekend. One thing that really stood out is how clean it was and unbelievably clean the ‚Äúfloors‚Äù were. That is a pet peeve of mine. I loved feeling comfortable enough to walk around without shoes and socks on after a shower and my feet stayed clean.
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Good stay!
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"beautiful home, inside & out!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Really neat little cottage tucked away in Natchez! 5 minute drive to be right in the middle of downtown and yet the cottage feels like it‚Äôs totally peaceful, quiet, and private!
I definitely plan to go back! Loved the place and love Natchez!"
2023-06-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"Billed as a B&B, but came without the breakfast. No notice of that beforehand. Came with coffee and water, but no other amenities like soda, juice, snacks (chips, nuts, etc.). Joanne also advertises that the unit is walkable to everything. Unless you are young and very fit, that is not true.
Gardens are a work in progress, but it is almost summer and a lot of the work should have already been done. Having said all the above, we love Natchez and would book Tupelo Cottage again on a future trip."
2023-06-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,This cottage was better than expected. It felt like it was a tucked away little fairy garden. It‚Äôs connected to another house but still felt private. Giving 4 stars because the only bathroom is right in the main living/kitchen area and had shutter doors which was not very private. That was a bit uncomfortable. Other than that we thought it was adorable and want to stay again!
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Quaint little cottage, clean & cozy."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We enjoyed our stay here. A very nice place. We did NOT walk anywhere from the location as it is more than a short walk to town but had no problem driving and finding parking. Neighborhood appears to be a bit ""sketchy"" when you arrive (the cottage itself is in a better section of town), but we had no problems. Great parking! Dryer has no dial for cycles - there is a pair of pliers to turn shaft BUT you don't know what cycle you are on. Still, we managed to use it without problem. Lovely, private yard! The bathroom is split in two (like many RV's) with the shower and a sink on one side of the hall and the toilet and another small sink on the on the other side of hall (you can visualize this in the pictures). A bit quirky BUT it was nice to have two sinks. Very comfortable for two people - just my wife and me. Met Joanne at checkout and she was very pleasant and kind. Very clean and comfortable. Would highly recommend."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,My stay at the Tupelo cottage was very peaceful and relaxing. Would definitely stay there again when visiting Natchez MS!!

2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We loved our stay in Natchez. We will definitely return and stay longer next time.
2023-03-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Recluded and secluded house. Next to a cemetery. House is well appointed and clean indoors. Outside would need a lot of maintenance. On the other hand, all windows were functional and had a mosquito net. Sufficient hot water and WiFi ok."
2023-03-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"I did find Joanne to be a bit hands off with recommendations and general communication. But she had everything set up when we arrived. The location was far enough from downtown that it was it peaceful, but close enough that we were able to access everything place we wanted to go very easily. The louvre bathroom and shower doors were hard to open and close, but the shower was just luxurious. It had a giant shower head and unlimited hot water. The backyard was large and open, but still very private. I think we would stay there again."
2023-03-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,The Tupelo Cottage is very nice for a couple. Walkable to downtown and the bluff walk. It is quiet neighborhood. Adjacent to historic cemetery that has some points of interest. The larger cottage on the property is also very nice. We met guests Jack & Pam who were staying there and had opportunity to see inside that cottage.
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We loved this place! It was so peaceful and looks exactly as described, close to all the wonderful things of Natchez and also super close to the cemetery!! We loved everything about it!"
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We throughly enjoyed our stay. The place was spacious, and comfortable. There was a nice porch out back to sit on. The kitchen is well stocked, although we ended up going out for dinner, because there are plenty of good restaurants in the area. It was within walking distance to the river, so we went for a walk. We wish that we were able to stay longer than just the one day, so we‚Äôre definitely going to have to return soon. I know if you were to stay here you would enjoy it as much as we both did."
2023-03-01,4.0,Stayed one night,It was nice to be able to walk to the bluff and the cemetery. Lots of history in this community.

2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Was exactly as described. We loved the place and our stay.
2022-11-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Description was inflated- I liked it okay.
But much missing information. I needed to wash and dry clothes. There was not a dial for the dryer yet there was a pair of pliers next to the dial and no info on how to use/turn the metal rod. It took me over 4 hours of drying for the one light load. I needed to do a second small load but couldn't due to the wet clothes"
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"An amazing place for a quiet and relaxing environment. The porch of the cottage offers tranquility that provides a time to read, have a drink, and coffee. The location of the cottage is close to downtown for biking and walking distance. Close enough to start your walking journey at the River Front Trail."

2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Everything was clean and comfortable. We really enjoyed our stay.
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The property exceeded my expectations. I was in the back cottage and had my own parking off the street. Entry was keyless, so even though I got in after 9 pm, it was still easy to access. The drive-in down Linden Ave, with all the 1890's grand homes, is always a treat during the day. The property was excellent, and I will be staying there on my next trip to Natchez. I would highly recommend this for your trip to Natchez."
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Easy check in. Had everything we needed. Thanks for letting us to stay.

2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We loved our stay at the Tupelo Cottage although it was cut short due to the electricity going out after a storm caused a tree to fall on the power line. Joanne graciously set us up at another property she hosts, The Heart of Natchez Apartment. The Cottage was very quiet and private and although near downtown, it is a good little walk to get there. The Apartment was located downtown and around the corner from all downtown has to offer. We would definitely choose to stay at one of Joanne's properties again."

Then we found Joanne's property. What an amazing experience. Loved the little town and the the house is an absolute delight. We travel often (and own a vacation home) and so feel as if we are vacation rental pros (and perhaps snobs?). There's NOTHING to complain about in this wonderful little property. It is comfortable, charming, clean and convenient. We think it's the ideal romantic getaway."
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great cottage! Simple checkin, super clean, had everything you need for a wonderful stay. Super comfy bed and wonderful back porch for morning coffee.

2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Joanne is either a great landscape artist or has a good one on call; to my untrained eye, the place is beautifully decorated with lovely exotic plants! There are two - yes, two - porches! Joanne allows you access to Netflix and other streaming services, and there is a decent WiFi connection for the cottage. The place is cozy, features painted hardwood floors, and it is impeccably clean! Guests are minutes away by car or slightly longer by foot from the shops and venues downtown; of course, you are just a stroll around the corner from dozens and dozens of beautiful homes and from the trail that encompasses the river bluff. My wife and I stayed here for the balloon festival, and we were not disappointed! I love Natchez, and I come here as often as I can; I will definitely be keeping this little place in my list of preferred lodging!"

2021-09-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"My friends, my wife and I stayed overnight at Joanne‚Äôs house on our way to Florida. The house is sweet and cute with spacious nice patio and full kitchen. I‚Äôd say it is a perfect stay for a couple, might feel a little small for 4 people. And for sure please note that the air matress is quite firm in case you are a sensitive sleeper. Thanks Joanne!"
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great little cottage with lots of character. The porch in the morning while sipping coffee is so relaxing. So many birds to watch. Very peaceful. Loved the morning walk along the bluff. Very private and peaceful.
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,The cottage was as described and everything you need is on hand. Quiet street and walking distance to downtown or ride your bike. Host was available when we needed something or had questions. We also stayed at her other rental and she made the transition over go very smoothly and even brought our items over that we left behind. I would recommend Joanne‚Äôs place to anyone in a second that is staying in the area and we will definitely stay again! The neighborhood is beautiful. You won‚Äôt be disappointed.
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Quiet and private with every amenity thoughtfully provided. We walked to town and back without a problem. Joanne was responsive and everything from coffee and creamer to laundry detergent was provided.

2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We just stopped for the night on the way to Atlanta and then again on the way back. Remarkably private location very close and walkable the to the Mississippi River walkway. We were surprised how large the cottage is and we never heard a peep at night. Buttons the Cat met us and was bewildered why we had no cat treats for him!
Bottom line, we would stay here again without a doubt."
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Excellent. Clean, quiet, roomy, well-stocked, with beautiful gardens and a charming kitty. Close to downtown, though not really a convenient walking distance. Definitely would come back."

2021-06-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"This property was very clean and comfortable. The grass is well kept, but the flowers and greenery closest to the house are severely overgrown and in need of being cut back. Our greatest surprise/disappointment was the location. Having never stayed in Natchez, we had no idea that ""being in walking distance of everything"" would put you walking through neighborhoods that most people would be afraid to drive through, much less walk through. As long as people know where they will be staying, they can make an informed decision."
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Wonderful, quiet place to stay with all of the comforts of home!!"
2021-06-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Very private and relaxing. Loved the cat that visited us.

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"In a world full of non-stop stress, this cottage and stay with Lynn was a breath of fresh air. The cottage itself was perfect in size, amenities, and location. Lynn was kind, informative and welcoming. It felt like a home away from home. Our 3 year old child and dog were able to play in the spacious yard next to the cottage. There was even a hiking trail that we got to explore. If you are looking for a place to stay while in Natchez that offers comfort, convenience, security and a dose of nature, Lynn's cottage is the place for you!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Loved the stay. It was perfect and convenient to my destination. We will be back!
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Absolutely loved Lynn‚Äôs place. I am from Natchez and have a lot of friends and family in the area but my boyfriend and I wanted our own place for the weekend. Lynn was very nice and this place was tucked away but not too far from everywhere. I love visiting home and I will be back at Lynn‚Äôs for sure.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at Cliff Crest cottage. Upon our arrival, Lynn welcomed us and immediately made us feel right at home.

As for the cottage,it is located in a corner of the countryside, 10 minutes from the city center of Natchez. The decor is relaxing,and the porch is great for a drink facing nature.
It has everything you need and above all everything is very clean!
Thank you Lynn!Happy hosting!"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Lynn was an exceptional host from the start. My husband is disabled and Lynn helped us unload and load our vehicle. He checked on us daily and was so friendly. Will definitely be back! I highly recommend!
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Honestly was a great stay. Ly√±n was extremely friendly. The trail was amazing and had a beautiful sun rise. Was in a very peaceful spot too.
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Of course you can stay in downtown Natchez if you want. Or, you can stay about five minutes away at a very nice cottage on a beautiful and quiet woodsy setting. Each of us have our own reasons for staying at different places. My choice was to stay at Lynn‚Äôs place. I made a great decision."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Lynn was an amazing host! We loved every moment of our trip. The house was perfect for a weekend alone. Lynn did come and visit with us and we laughed and toured his grounds. He knows alot of history of the area. The house was exactly as described and VERY comfortable. It had so many little touches to make our stay enjoyable. The house is 5 minutes from downtown so you are close to the houses to tour, antique shops and lots of restaurants.
We made a friend in Lynn and we will be back!!"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Spent a beautiful 3 days touring Natchez. Feel lucky to have found this amazing cottage just outside of the downtown area. It was a cozy, quiet and relaxing space. Spent my evenings on the front porch and enjoyed the comfortable bed and nicely appointed kitchen & bathroom. Lynn was an amazing host. Very generous and kind. I highly recommend this place if you are traveling to the wonderful city of Natchez."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Cliff Crest Cottage was the perfect little place to stay for a couple wanting to get away. Our daughter just got married and we took my son to the airport in Jackson to fly out to London. We hopped on the Natchez Trace and drove down to Natchez. We love visiting this quiet, quaint town. We will stay here again! All the amenities, and the necessities you need. We have stayed in a lot of different places in Natchez but this was our favorite. It was stocked with everything we needed. The trails behind the cottage were a great place to walk and relax. Lynn was great and was there when we needed him while being respectful of our privacy at the same time. We will definitely stay here again if it‚Äôs available."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We thoroughly enjoyed our two night stay. The accommodations were exactly as specified. It is close to area activities. And most of all, Lynn is a very personable, friendly person with lots of good recommendations and stories. We would love to visit again ."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This cottage is beautiful. it feels very nice.
The host is very kind"
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"It's difficult to express how good the place and the host were. Lovely casita in a woodsy area, totally equipped with everything you could need including food and beverages, even a few beers. Lynn was more than a super host -- he was like a close and friendly neighbor. (But certainly respectful of a guest's privacy.) And when I left to go home and my car was making a funny noise, I went back to him and he solved the problem -- a twig stuck in the undercarriage. Thoroughly enjoyed my stay there."
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Nice peaceful getaway in Natchez. Very nice touches throughout the space. Very comfortable accommodations. Would stay here again if in the area.
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at Cliff Crest Cottage and the lovely town of Natchez. The location was quiet and peaceful, with easy access to the picturesque town just a few minutes away. Lynn was a friendly and informative host, and provided helpful recommendations for places to try on later portions of our trip. The cottage had everything we needed for our stay, and a short walking trail behind the house provides a dramatic view of the Mississippi river from a high bluff."
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"What a beautiful cottage in a beautiful quiet setting! Lynn is such a gracious and helpful host. I can't say enough about this experience. I was in the process of moving to a Natchez from out of state, so Cliff Crest Cottage really was the perfect respite from my overly busy and stressful week there. Highly, highly, recommend, even if you are not in the middle of a move. The Cottage is quiet and remote, yet minutes from everything Natchez has to offer. The cottage itself is charming and has everything you need. I will definitely be recommending it for friends or family who come to visit (and need their own space). Thank you, thank you, Lynn."
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,great place. nice folks. super cute town. loved it!
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Lynn is the absolute friendliest host you will ever have. The location was perfect, close to town but also rural with plenty of room for my dog to play and explore. I will definitely be staying again next time I'm in Natchez."
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"This cottage was just as described. The owner was very friendly and responsive (lives next door to cottage) and helpful. The location seemed rural but was very close to historic Natchez, which has many great restaurants and things to do. Everything was very clean and well done. We cook a lot of our own meals, so maybe a few more cooking/dish items would be helpful. Lynn leaves many great extras to enjoy though, so that was really nice. We would definitely recommend this cottage."
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Cliff Crest Cottage and our host were amazing! Lynn provided detailed information that helped us enjoy our time in Natchez. The snacks and drinks were appreciated. This is an amazing cottage at an amazing rate! It was quiet and peaceful! Clean and tidy!!

2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"A frequent flyer to Natchez, this is a beautiful and comfortable spot to stay with my dog. A huge front yard to play ball. Short drive to all Natchez' historic downtown, with so many great places to eat and walk through. Lynn was so friendly and generous. Thanks for having us."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"WOW! Lynn's AirBnB is literally the best I've ever stayed in. Helpful, responsive host - cabin is absolutely lovely and immaculate - & I have never had any more add-ons and amenities provided in a space as here. Definitely, definitely plan to visit again!
Local recommendations, as well as the most gracious host and lovely location are unparalleled."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"this cottage is perfect if you are staying in the area! the hosts are wonderful. the cottage makes it feel like you have your own home, and there's a fun walking trail right behind it! fully recommend staying here! the price is great as well."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Lynn was so friendly, greeted us when we arrived.

We will be back and have already recommended his cottage to friends and family. Thanks again Lynn!"
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great place to stay in Natchez!
Thank you Lynn for your hospitality :)
Hope to see you soon!"
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Lynn's Cottage is delightful, the surroundings are beautiful and include a walking trail. The Cottage is five minutes from Downtown Natchez where you'll find great food, entertainment, and shopping. A wonderful walkway along The Mississippi has an exquisite view of the twin bridges. All within minutes from the solitude of Lynn's Cottage. I recommend this wonderful location when you visit Natchez."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Can‚Äôt say anything bad about our stay, can‚Äôt wait to be back in town, for another great stay‚Ä¶"
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a relaxing two-day stint at Lynn's place. I'm sure the other reviewers have covered all the amenities, but in addition to those, we enjoyed walking on the property along the bluffs, where there's a woodland trail with a view of the river. Rural location, yet very close to downtown Natchez, Bluff Park, Under-the-hill, and Longwood. Great place to stay!"
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"What can I say that would describe our stay? Outstanding, fabulous, superb!!! Lynn and Leigh are the perfect hosts! The cottage was easy to find, clean, and felt just like home. It had everything we could have needed including beverages, snacks, and even toothbrushes (just in case you forget yours). This is a true gem and a must stay. We are already looking forward to our next visit (and we'll bring the beer)!"
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Lynn was a fantastic host!! His cabin is super clean, very cozy, private, and quiet. Bed is super comfy, too. Lynn stacked the kitchen with goodies. So thoughtful. We talked with him every day! He's got great stories to tell and gives you lots of information on Natchez and surrounding areas. We will definitely be back to stay with Lynn and wife Leigh."

2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We loved the cottage. Very comfortable visit. Lynn was welcoming and knowledgeable about the area. Lots of fun stories! We felt like we were visiting with a beloved uncle. :)
We would definitely stay there again if we were in the area and highly recommend his cottage.
Thanks, Lynn for the wonderful southern hospitality."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The spot is so perfect for visiting the Natchez area. Close enough to get to everything around town, and far enough away to be private.
Really enjoyed the stay here. Lynn is so helpful. Ask him to see his truck when you go. :)"
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,My mother and I loved it. Great host. Easy to find and close to all things we came to see. Would stay again . Telling all my family and friends. A must stay. Thank you so much.
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We very much enjoyed Leigh and Lynn's place. It is a short drive to town and located in a quiet, peaceful setting. There is a walking trail, but we didn't get to enjoy it this visit but will next time. Lynn is very responsive and very kind. The house has everything you need and is very comfortable. I liked having some food and snacks on site to enjoy; this was appreciated and was an extra benefit that usually is not provided at other air bnbs. Mom liked having regular cable, too, and not just streaming. Anyone would be happy staying here."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I‚Äôve stayed in a lot of b&b‚Äôs and this was the best yet! We basically lived on the screened front porch listening to birds watching squirrels, chipmunks and armadillos! Lynn is the most layed- back host! Went for hot air balloon festival and one morning they flew right over the house! Fridge was well stocked with water, soda, orange juice and even a few beers! Plenty of towels and blankets. Lots of area to walk my dogs and Lynn wasn‚Äôt fussy about them being there. Very comfortable bed. We will be back!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The check-in was easy and uncomplicated. Snacks, beer, beverages and detergents were free of charge. The cottage and the estate it is located on are both unique and very quiet. The space in the cottage and around is awesome. It was clean and tidy. Absolutely incredible. It was perfect equipped. Everything worked well and was high class maintained. The instructions and guest information was profound and easy to understand. Ly√±n is a very kind and attentive host. He is interested and he gave a lot of useful information for the region and the surrounding. Whenever I will be again in that REGION,I hope the cottage is available for another stay. AAA+++"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Ly√±n is a fantastic host! We immediately felt at home. The accommodation is beautifully quiet on a large property, but you are still everywhere in a few minutes. The equipment was perfect, even the fridge was filled. Ly√±n is incredibly charming. We would stay here any time"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"This was hands down the best experience I've had staying at an air bnb. Lynn made sure I had everything I needed and made me feel very at home. The trail in the back is perfect for a nice, peaceful walk. I took my 2 dogs on it several times. The place was clean and very peaceful. I enjoyed drinking my coffee on the screened porch with a good book. I will definitely stay here again in the future. Highly recommend!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This was our second visit to the cottage. We love the beauty of the landscape and the friendly reception we get from Lynn and his wife. We spent many peaceful hours on the porch. We will return for a third visit!
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Lynn was a proactive host and anticipated every need. Superb hospitality! His cottage offers a comfortable respite from the hubbub of downtown Natchez while being close to all the going ons.
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We enjoyed our weekend spent in Natchez. Everything as described and great place that was nice and clean. Lynn was a gracious host with great recommendations on what to do and where to eat. (The camp was by far the best) he also surprised us with a gift for us on our anniversary.
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"If we could give 6 stars, we would not hesitate. It was an exceptional stay from the point of hospitality, equipment and site.
We had the pleasure of sharing some beers with our host and his wife one night.
Lynn really wants her visitors to lack nothing.
And finally, the center of Natchez is very close as well as the Mississippi.
We recommend it to everyone!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Would definitely stay here again! It proved a restful 3 day weekend. I instantly felt at home - almost like visiting with extended family. Thankfully, the cottage was cozy. I didn't feel like I had to hold my elbows close for fear of knocking over some priceless knicknack - meaning I could actually relax. The space definitely had many of the same amenities as a hotel room - more even because our host provided several additional things, even a toothbrush! Lynn went above and beyond as a host - even shared dinner with me and my sister during our visit. Can't recommend this cottage and host enough. Would have loved to stay longer."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Our stay at Lynn‚Äôs place was exactly what we needed after two weeks of being on the road. It‚Äôs a beautiful, peaceful home away from home and Lynn was the most gracious host we‚Äôve ever met. From the friendly welcome, the snack foods left for us, the clear instructions and recommendations, to the feeling that we were with a long time friend; it couldn‚Äôt have been any better. If we‚Äôre ever in the area again, we will definitely be looking to stay here! Thank you, Lynn & Leigh, for a great end to our vacation!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Lynn‚Äôs place was just as described! It was clean, well stocked (even with snacks and bottled water), and very quiet and peaceful. Lynn was very friendly and a great host. I would absolutely stay here again!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Just an outstanding stay! The host provided drinks & frozen food in the freezer! Such a wonderful thing when you first arrive & have not had time to food shop. He was very friendly & helpful!! A super host!
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I hate to recommend places that I plan to go back to, because it increases the competition to rent them, but Lynn was such a great host that I have to bite the bullet and tell the truth, for his sake.
It's an affordable and peaceful haven about a mile from the center of town and directly on the main drag. it is modest, but a fantastic bargain, miles better than any hotel room, and more affordable. it gives you a separate small house that has been completely remodeled with all important air conditioning (our new weather paradigm raised the temperature to 105 while we were there) a full kitchen and large bath with washer and dryer, and a small living room and bedroom for 2.
It has a sizable shady and fully screened front porch and a really wonderful setting on a large property with woods, great shade trees, lawns, and plenty of parking away from the road.
Lynn is a native son and an authority on the area and happy to share his knowledge. Strongly recommended, as is Natchez."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was a wonderful location to stay for our anniversary. It's peaceful and quiet. Very clean, and the hosts are friendly! I highly recommend staying here!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Lynn was the perfect host. Always attentive. The cottage was in a quiet location which I wanted but yet minutes from all that Natchez has to offer. The ac was super cold which was great since temperature outside was triple digit. Lots of beverages and treats which are a surprise to find and enjoy in the kitchen. Have more bathroom supplies than your average hotel. It was just perfect and dog friendly
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Cliff Crest Cottage was a lovely experience. The grounds were beautiful and the cottage was just right for the two of us and our little terrier. We have always enjoyed the Natchez area and now have the perfect ""home away from home"". We will be back!
Gary and Trudy"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Lovely little cottage with a homey feel. Absolutely peaceful & relaxing any time of day on the amazing porch! Loved going out every morning with our coffeeüíó

2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"My gosh, hard to sum up how great our stay was at this beautiful cottage. Lynn was absolutely welcoming and made us feel like family. So many good conversations while walking his property and he made sure that there were extras especially on our initial night. Lynn and his wife are a delight. Natchez is a delight. This is the place to stay!"
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We loved everything about Cliff Crest. This cozy cottage was clean, comfortable and stocked with many thoughful items you may need when traveling such as snacks, drinks, condiments, and toiletries. The property has a great wooded trail along a cliff that ends with a view of the mighty Mississippi through the trees and the screened in porch is a wonderful spot to relax, listen to the birds and absorb the serenity of the surroundings. Lynn, the host, is a real delight. We thouroughly enjoyed meeting him. Thanks Lynn for making us feel so welcome. We absolutely would stay here again if we're in the area."
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a wonderful stay at Lynn‚Äôs cottage! Cottage was exactly as pictured in listing. Tastefully decorated, very well stocked with drinks and snacks, squeaky clean and super comfortable bed! So many thoughtful touches- we had absolutely everything we needed- and then some! Host was great at communication and quick to respond. We arrived in the evening of Super Bowl Sunday, and Lynn had the house unlocked and the game on waiting for us! Location is very quiet and private- seems like you are out in the country- but in reality you are only 5 minutes from downtown Natchez. We definitely recommend this property, and are looking forward to our next stay!"

2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"5 star stay!
Very comfortable accommodations, nice large bathroom, comfy bed, awesome screened porch, great for walking dogs, unbelievably close to downtown! Lynn goes out of his way to make his guests feel special. The fridge was stocked with drinks, the freezer was full of frozen food options, and the cabinets were full of snacks. For those with dogs, we found Little Easy and Natchez Brewery to have lots of outdoor space as well as good service and great food!! November is an awesome time to visit!

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Our Girl‚Äôs Get Away was made extra-special by having this amazing home to call our home base during our visit to Natchez for the Spring Pilgrimage. The front veranda was our favorite place to gather for morning coffee, afternoon card games and evening cocktails. The front parlor was a great place to gather and watch a movie or play a game. There was so much space to spread out and not be in each other‚Äôs way and we didn‚Äôt even get a chance to play pool or poker in the separate game rooms! The well equipped kitchen was wonderful, so we were able to prepare some of our own meals as well. We walked right across the street to Stanton Hall, one of my favorite homes on the tour and enjoyed the central location with Main Street, restaurants, a casino, the Mississippi river and other homes to tour just a short walk away. Thank-you, Jacqueline for making our trip so memorable!"
