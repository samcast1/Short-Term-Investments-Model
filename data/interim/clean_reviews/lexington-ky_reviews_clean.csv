2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This was such a wonderful place to stay ! Just a very short drive to Kentucky Horse Park. The area was beautiful and we loved the peaceful quiet of the cabin. Very cozy and comfortable. We enjoyed sitting on the screened in porch in the morning and evening and enjoying the sounds of nature and watching wildlife at the river. Wish we could have stayed longer. Beds were very comfortable and it was well stocked with anything you would need. I highly recommend it.
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We loved our stay. Well stocked kitchen, very tidy & clean, very comfortable bed, nice linens, and relaxing view of the creek on the screened porch. During the day we visited two nice off-leash dog parks 10-15 üê∂mins away, botanical gardens, and Henry Clay home/gardens. Highly recommend Sage Rabbit restaurant, W. 6th St. brewery & Smithtown seafood, and Wallace Station (all dog friendly) & delish!! Also, a cycling friendly area. üö¥üèΩ"

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Loved it. The enclosed porch was great for coffee in the mornings. The fire pit was great for gathering around at night. Will definitely stay again if available.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"The cabin was charming and cozy. The screened in porch with views of the lovely creek and trees was a nice spot for morning coffee & an evening glass of wine. Listening to the many types of birds chirping was definitely serene.
It was a very cozy place to come back to after a long day at Keeneland or a day out visiting horse farms & exploring Lexington.
Even a drive along the beautiful country roads surrounding the cabin was delightful.
The added amenity of having horses right on the property was much appreciated. The horses loved our visits with peppermints, carrots & apples in hand.
The cabin is out in the countryside & very quiet & peaceful and yet it is an easy drive into downtown Lexington with the many restaurants & activities available there.
It was a perfect retreat for us as a couple & we will definitely try to return next time we visit Lexington.
Thank you Hal & Julia for being such wonderful hosts!"

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was my first vacation in years, like 15 years! I wanted a place that was quiet and more country instead of city all the time. When I pulled up it was so beautiful. I honestly didn't want to come back to the city. I did kayaking for the first time (there is a creek with 2 kayakes in the back) and that was a blast with the family, I fell in love with one of the horses (first time up close with a horse), we checked out Red State BBQ for food and um yes that was yummy! I literally was so close to asking if we could stay another few days. We will definitely be coming back again. Thank you!"

2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Very peaceful and beautiful setting. Well suited for two people. The only negative for us was the road to get here is not very walkable and definitely not for biking. The road is very narrow without a shoulder. We took our bikes to the Legacy trail, which is only a few minute drive.
We enjoyed feeding carrots to the ponies and also saw some deer and a fox out by the river in view from the screened porch."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This beautiful creekside cabin was everything we had hoped for and more!

2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Our stay was a wonderful way to get to experience a bit of what makes Kentucky famous. The surrounding countryside is dotted with picturesque horse farms.

Feeding the horses apples and carrots was definitely a highlight of our stay!
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Such a wonderful little cottage with easy access to everything. We spent a week exploring, Lexington and the surrounding communites, horse farms and distilleries with our two dogs. This was the perfect place to start our day, (complete with carrots, apples and pony pets) and at the end of the day, bourbon sipping and sunset from the screened in porch was a delight. Clean, comfortable, and wonderfully appointed. We will definitely stay again on any future trips to the horse capital! Thank you Julia and Hal - it was hard to leave!"

2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Just returned from a beautiful 4 day get-away with friends. Hal and Julia were wonderful hosts. Their property is lovely and we enjoyed feeding the horse and pony carrots and apples. The cabin had everything you needed for cooking, grilling, and even a stocked Kuerig. Beds were comfortable and we got a lot of use out of the fireplace. (Hal was quick to replenish the firewood when we ran out! ) Sunsets over the creek were spectacular and watching the water was so peaceful. We all felt very comfortable and safe and have already talked about returning."
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Beautiful view, so peaceful and quiet. Very convenient location."
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Beautiful grounds and the horses were so gentle when we fed them carrots and apples. Close enough to town but far enough away from all the hussle to be completely relaxing!

It has a private feel but is still close to surrounding cities including a 10-min drive to Lexington. The horses were super friendly. We had sone weather related issues (out of control of host) and they were very responsive. We appreciated the prompt and friendly communication, firewood and starters, comfortable bed and two bathrooms for getting ready."
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Very relaxing. We loved the fire place. Would return!
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This cabin on the river was so peaceful and comfortable. With a well stocked kitchen, comfortable furniture, beautiful interior, amazing views and a comfortable main floor bed, we felt right at home. We did stay in cold weather months and brought our 10 month old son. He slept in his playpen which was pretty cold as it rests on the floor. The floor is very cold, which would be nice in warm weather for sure. They have plenty of area rugs but bring slippers and just know it‚Äôs very cold for crawling or sleeping little people. It‚Äôs a very convenient location and again a beautiful setting next to the river among the horse pastures. We will definitely stay again if we are in the area."

2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The property is lovely and easy to find. We woke up to find deer grazing by the creek outside our windows.

An enclosed deck to sit and watch it while drinking a cup of coffee. a bit smaller expected and no privacy between rooms as they not fully enclosed.

We rode bikes from the Airbnb to downtown Lexington one of the days to visit Blue Stallion Brewery-beautiful ride with a lot of hills. We had an issue with house cleaners at check-in, however, the hosts did everything and more to remedy the situation. We would happily stay here again!"
2022-08-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was a really cute cabin- rustic but very clean. Perfect for a weekend stay. Just a note- if you need internet or WiFi, it is really slow and cell reception is bad in the cabin. That is the only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5. Hosts very responsive and nice."

2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"What a treat to stay in the heart of horse country on a private horse farm! This cabin is in the most peaceful setting, with birds and horses making their sweet sounds all around. The beds are very comfortable and the kitchen thoughtfully supplied with a Keurig, coffee pods, bottled water and all kitchen appliances and cookware. You would not need to leave the property to have a wonderful getaway, however it's within 10 minutes of the Kentucky Horse Park and 30 minutes from Claiborne Farm.

2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We absolutely loved our stay; the pictures and descriptions do not do this cabin justice. There was plenty of room for our family of four. The kitchen was well stocked, plenty of games for family game nights, and a full size laundry room with detergent. The children enjoyed petting the horses, playing in the creek, and ziplining. The drive to the house is breathtaking! While visiting, we toured Mill Ridge Farm and had a good southern dinner at Ramsey's Diner. I highly recommend both.
We hope this won't be our last trip to your Airbnb!"

2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We loved staying at Julia and Hal‚Äôs cabin. It was the perfect place for us to unwind and relax after our time in Louisville for Derby Week.
The cabin was extremely clean and well maintained, and had everything we needed to cook dinner both nights of our stay. The grill worked well, and the deck was fantastic to relax on, with a tranquil view of the stream below the cabin.
We loved spending time with the horse by our cabin, and he loved eating carrots and apples from our hands!
The bed was comfortable, we both slept well. We were thrilled to do some laundry in the washer/dryer, it cut down on our packing considerably!
We accidentally left our souvenir bats from Louisville Slugger behind after check out. Those could have been lost forever, but Julia and Hal were very accommodating and allowed us entry to the property to retrieve them. That mistake could have put a damper on our whole trip, thankful it didn‚Äôt!
We would definitely stay again next time in the area, hopefully for longer!"

2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Cherish the cabin! Our family had the best time staying at Julia and Hal's cabin (can you call it a cabin with it has a master suite with its own bathroom?! Everything was as outlined in the listing, but better. The cabin is located at the back of Julia and Hal's property, overlooking a beautiful stream and surrounded by rolling hills. You'll have company from at least one of the resident horses, which hangs out in the field right next to the cabin. Our kids loved petting the horses, riding on the zip line and exploring area around the cabin. Pro tip: bring a few apples or carrots and you'll make a new best friend.
For the most part we hung out at the cabin, BBQ'd on the Green Egg grill and enjoyed the evenings on the screened-in porch overlooking the stream. Within 20 mins you can be grabbing dinner in downtown Lexington or going out on a horseback riding adventure. We'd definitely stay here again. Thanks Julia and Hal for sharing!"
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,What a wonderful stay we had on this gorgeous property. We would highly recommend staying here. Thank you!
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Great place in a great location. Perfect for exploring the Lexington area.
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We really enjoyed the peace and quiet at the horse farm. The first few days we spent
reading books, watching the river and listening to all the different bird songs. Very calming. We did break away, though, for Mass in Georgetown and some sightseeing. We toured Bluegrass Distillers - fun, and Mary Todd Lincoln's home - interesting. We went antiquing and stopped at a very nice gift shop that surprisingly had Meissen monkey band figurines. The Lexington Cemetery is peaceful, historic and a pretty place to walk. A hike at Raven Run Nature Sanctuary brought us to a gorgeous view of the Kentucky River. We spent a morning at the International Horse Museum, broke for lunch, then did the sculpture walk and visited the barns in the afternoon. It was a most pleasant day. My husband enjoyed his chats with Hal. We're both thankful we got to explore a bit of Lexington. The countryside with all the horses is beautiful."
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,We enjoyed our stay at this cabin. The wood burning fireplace was especially nice. The cabin is situated on a horse farm with views of the creek. We plan to return.
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Located in picturesque horse

2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"A Beautiful location in the heart of horse country. Location is excellent , close enough interstate but secluded enough to enjoy the quietness of the country. Guest house if excellent with beautiful views of river and neighboring horse pastures. Fully stocked kitchen, covered porch for morning coffee, Can‚Äôt wait to go back."
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Very nice, private place in a great location if horses are your primary reason to visit Lexington. Awesome views and all amenities are there. Only issue, not that it was that bad, was the bed could be more comfortable. Beautiful place to spend Christmas with our daughter. Will definitely consider staying there again when we visit her later in the year."
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Lovely cabin in a very peaceful setting. We plan to stay again!

2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Highly recommend! The property is stunning and the location is very convenient. We saw plenty of deer and turkey crossing the creek, which was an added bonus to the trip. The ladder to the loft was a little wobbly (would not recommend for young ages or elderly), but that's honestly the only downfall I noticed. Communication was easy, as Julia and Hal were very quick to respond. They provided everything we needed from check in to check out, and we are so appreciative. We had such a great and relaxing time staying here and will likely stay here again!"

2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We loved our stay here. The drive is so picturesque and it was delightful to have two friendly horses greet us just outside our place. The fireplace and furniture is so cozy with a beautiful view of the creek. The kitchen was well stocked with tea, coffee, and the necessary appliances. I would note that the upper loft is only for people who are able bodied and it is not for small children as it is a bit tricky to go up and down. However it added to the charm and adventure of the place. We will definitely stay here again on our next Lexington trip and hopefully with more time to use the kayaks!"
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Lovely and just perfect! Could not have been more charming-We can‚Äôt wait to visit again!

2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This is my husband‚Äôs and my favorite place to truly unplug and relax. Julia and Hal are super helpful and responsive for anything you need. The cabin is fantastic and the screened in porch overlooking the creek is my favorite place to wake up with a coffee and take in the surroundings. We cooked almost all our meals in the well equipped kitchen and obviously got some great grilling in on the Green Egg! We usually play in the creek with our dogs and visit with the horses just outside our door. This location is also right in the heart of some of the best biking if you are into that! We love cruising through the horse farms and taking in the views. Highly recommend. (we will certainly be back!)
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My daughter and I thoroughly enjoyed our stay on this farm. The guest house was comfortable, it‚Äôs location was great, and the surroundings are beautiful!

2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,This location is absolutely perfect for those wanting to explore horse farms. It is a rather short drive to downtown Lexington if you want to explore the city. The accommodations are comfortable and the scenery is perfect. Hal was very friendly and showed us around the property. Plan to visit again someday!
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This place is great! It's right in the most beautiful part of Horse Country. It is located on the hosts property yet it is secluded and safe. We found it very relaxing. It was super clean and cute as could be inside. We met Hal in the driveway and he immediately emailed us dining options in the area. We will definitely try to stay here again if we come back to Lexington.
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My boyfriend and I stayed at this beautiful cottage for two nights and absolutely loved it. We fed the horses carrots and apples and we were able to walk around the property to see the animals. It was a quick drive to down town Lexington, but also very secluded and private . I would definitely recommend! Our dog Bodhi also was a massive fan!"

2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This was one of the cleanest places we have ever stayed. Being so close to the horse barn was awesome! Short drive to Lexington where we found some cool places to eat and get coffee. Recommend the DV8 kitchen and Old School Coffee. If hiking is your thing it is worth the drive to the Red River Gorge. The Keeneland Horse Track was awesome. You can watch the morning horse workouts. Loved that the airbnb had an indoor fire place and a fire pit outside. Highly recommend!!!!
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Julia and Hal were great! Very quick at responding, and very helpful with a last minute schedule change. Nice, relaxing stay at their property."

2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very good. As advertised..
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This was one of the most beautiful places I‚Äôve ever stayed in. From the moment you enter the front gates the property takes your breath away. And waking up to a mini horse greeting you every morning just puts the cherry on top of the cake. This is the only place I think I‚Äôll ever stay when I return on trips to Lexington.
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"A great property for a quite getaway. The house is very cozy with a beautiful view of a bubbling creek. Julia and Hal have thought of everything you may need, with wonderful linens, stocked kitchen and even cream, chocolates and hand-written note! Our dogs loved playing in the creek and watching the birds and horses. We hope to book again for a longer stay."
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Great place! Perfect for a couple, could make use of the loft beds if you had a teen that you were comfortable using the ladder that‚Äôs a little trickier than other ladders.
Place was clean, plenty of room, little sitting area by the tv. Was lovely being able to sit on the screened porch by the stream, and was very convenient having laundry.
Location is amazing for the horse park, and reasonably convenient to rest of Lex area if you‚Äôd rather stay in a pleasant rolling hills country setting rather than town.
Can‚Äôt say enough nice things about the place."
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The perfect getaway. Beautiful setting. Julia & Hal make all the special touches on a picturesque setting. We couldn‚Äôt have asked for more. It was the most beautiful time!

2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The cabin was warm and inviting with great views of the creek. Julia and Hal responded quickly when contacted but we didn‚Äôt need anything extra as everything my husband and I needed was available. It was a great place for peace and quiet.
2021-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We really loved staying at the Pond Cottage with our dog Luna. Julia and Hal have thought of many little nice touches to add value. They supply your own Big Green Egg. They supply firewood for the fireplace. The setting could not be better. You are on a hill overlooking the beautiful creek from the screened porch and the other views are typical Kentucky horse farm. The cottage is very private from the main house. We have no reservations about suggesting this rental for other people.
2021-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We had a wonderful stay. The location was beautiful --- so peaceful and serene.

2021-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The creek side cabin is Amazing! The screened-in porch was perfect for relaxing, viewing the sunset, and enjoying a cup of coffee or cocktail. Such a beautiful property! The creek was peaceful and the various birds contributed to the tranquility. Our dog, Harry, loved visiting the white pony every chance he could get! Julia and Hal provided us with anything you could need including a variety of toiletries. If you should need anything, they are very responsive! A destination well worth the trip!"
2021-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Seriously amazing spot! Loved every minute!
2021-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at this quiet retreat. The sunsets were stunning - sitting on the screened porch, listening to the creek and watching the horses across the creek as the sun set was deeply relaxing.
The house is perfect for one or two people or a family with agile kids (the ladder to the sleeping loft is no joke).
We cooked several meals there and found the kitchen to have the basics we needed, which was appreciated.
Everything was spotless.
We locked ourselves out and Hal came with the key within five minutes - he's our hero!
Bonus fun: The horse across the drive loves apples and carrots."
2021-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We loved staying here! The pups had a great time and it was a great location. We went to Keeneland and downtown within fifteen minutes, the screened-in porch was perfect for relaxing and watching March Madness while enjoying the beautiful views. Dusty the pony was adorable and everything was clean, tidy, and very welcoming. Would definitely stay here again!"

2021-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Beautiful and peaceful
2021-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Beautifully appointed creek side cabin in the picturesque bluegrass area of Kentucky. Hard to convey with words the lovely long views and peacefulness of this rental - conveniently close to all the Lexington has to offer. Hard to leave; hope to return.
2021-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Amazing cabin with a creek just outside the backdoor, Relaxing water sounds, fantastic hosts, really nice cabin, and a great setting. Toured Claibourne, Keeneland and Lanes End all within a convenient drive away. HIGHLY RECOMMEND!"
2021-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This cozy cabin is nestled in the most beautiful spot. The beds were comfortable, we had everything we needed and we were even able to order in dinner even though we felt like we had escaped on a horse farm. This was the perfect spot for a Mom getaway. I highly recommend."
2021-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This is a pretty cabin with wonderful views. The hosts are great. We loved it.
2021-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We loved our stay at Julia and Hal‚Äôs place. It was the perfect spot for a quiet anniversary getaway with a six month old baby in toe. The cabin was the perfect size for us with a separate master and main living area. It included a small kitchen, two full bathes and a laundry room (which came in handy with a baby). There were several lovely touches including cream in the fridge (which we had left ours at home) when we arrived. They also had a pack n‚Äô play and baby swing we used. They were prompt in answering questions and communicating throughout our stay. The cabin over looks a large creek and we also were able to walk around the property and visit the horses. Definitely recommend this unique stay!"

2021-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Quiet, beautiful scenery, privacy. Very nice ‚Äúwelcome‚Äù amenities. We stayed in February and had a lot of snow. Supplied firewood was much appreciated."
2021-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I cant speak highly enough about this cabin and Julia and Hal as hosts. A week before our trip Julia and Hal informed us that a winter storm was rolling in and worked with us on how to handle our reservation just incase we couldnt go. Having this level of communication really helped ease the stress of our trip possibly being canceled. Luckily it all worked out and we were able to continue with the trip. The cabin is divine, the area is super quiet and all the windows makes it so peaceful. The little kitchen was perfect for cooking and the two bathrooms was a huge bonus. The cabin was super clean and the fire place was stocked with firewood and fire starters. And to top it all off we were greeted by a wonderful happy horse running in their paddock when we arrived. We had an amazing valentines weekend and I cant recommend this cabin enough if you just want a get away or if you want to explore kentucky."
2021-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Amazing little place. Magical for a quiet weekend escape. We loved every detail of the space and the views were amazing!

2021-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful and peaceful cabin. Serene overlook of a river on one side and a horse farm on the other.. but the best part was the fireplace, which came stocked with wood and even firestarters! The owners had coffee and had half-and-half, along with water in the fridge. They went above and beyond for our anniversary in many ways. Very romantic! Thank you Hal and Julia!!"
2021-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Perfect spot. Quiet, clean, and perfect location for those in the horse business. WiFi is a little slow, but otherwise it exceeded expectations! Will definitely come back!"
2021-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Absolutely beautiful views, great place to relax."
2021-01-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Julia and Hal‚Äôs place was even more picturesque than the photos show. We loved seeing the horses and the creek just outside the windows each day. Julia and Hal were very responsive and made our stay easy. Many hiking trails, including those in the Red River Gorge, were within a 1 hour drive from the cabin. The only way the place would be better is if the large bed was updated and less squeaky. We would definitely stay again the next time we are in the area and highly recommend to other guests."
2020-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Amazing stay at the cabin!!! We highly recommend you stay here for a weekend getaway in the woods. The place is so cozy and clean and everything you need is provided. If you love horses and nature this is a no brainer.

2020-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Let's just say that i was relaxed from the minute I arrived. The guest house is wonderful and the view of the creek is so relaxing. I enjoyed coming back and walking down by the creek after driving around the beautiful area. I had everything that i needed. It did not matter that there was rain. I enjoyed the fireplace and staying inside. I am looking forward to a return trip soon!
2020-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Julia and Hal were easy going, kind, and quick to reply. My girlfriends and I loved the little space, cute, clean and perfect for our low key weekend."

2020-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We had such a wonderful weekend staying at this beautiful farm!! So many special touches! We enjoyed sitting out on the back deck and building a fire in the awesome dual sided fireplace!! It was so nice having the view of the river out the back doors. All of the French doors were lovely to enjoy the beautiful property. We also loved meeting the cute pony outside the cabin! We hope to come back some day!
2020-10-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"My wife and I stayed at the Horse Farm Creekside Cabin in mid-October. The location of the farm is about a 10-minute drive to both Lexington and Georgetown Kentucky, which makes it very convenient to see the sights in the area.
The cabin was well equipped with all the comforts of home. It was great to sit out on the screen porch with a cup of coffee or a drink just relaxing and looking at the stream down the hill from our cabin. My wife and I enjoyed every time we stepped out the front door to look across the field to see a row of trees that had turned bright red with fall colors. We also enjoyed walking the farm and to pet the horses and then feed them with carrots and apples. It was pretty funny when we would step out of the cabin and Dusty the horse would come running across the field knowing Dusty was going to get a treat.
Our hosts Julia and Hal were easy to work with when setting up our reservation. We had some follow-up questions before we arrived because of Covid-19 and they got back to us within an hour informing us of Kentucky‚Äôs travel policies. When we arrived at the cabin, my wife and I were comfortable that the cabin was thoroughly cleaned.
If you are looking for a relaxing vacation, to be near by some great sights and a beautiful location, we highly recommend you stay at the Horse Farm Creekside Cabin"
2020-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Can‚Äôt say enough good things. Great location to equestrian experiences. Beautiful, peaceful setting in the middle of horse country. Our 8 year old daughter loved Julia & Hal‚Äôs miniature horse, Dusty!"
2020-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place is perfection. Clean, comfortable, and surrounded by beauty.

The hosts are there if you need them and quick to communicate. And all around great weekend, thanks Julia and Hal!"

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very Happy with this place! It really saved us to walk the easy 0.4 mile to Rupp arena for my daughter‚Äôs graduation because of the traffic in downtown. Everything in the house was perfect as was described. And my 21 year old son said the sofa sleeper was not bad at all! The host is fantastic in being responsive immediately. Walkable to west sixth brewery and blue stallion brewery is very close. We loved the goose restaurant too! Felt safe in the neighborhood too. It‚Äôs size if perfect for two- 3 people. But might be too tight if we had 4. Occasionally we can hear the people upstairs walking around but wasn‚Äôt really a problem. I would definitely rent again especially if I was attending events at Rupp.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We had a wonderful time during our stay. The airbnb was so spacious and the perfect place to stay and enjoy Lexington and the surrounding area. We thoroughly enjoyed it and would highly recommend!

2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,The home was beautiful and very clean thank u
2022-07-01,3.0,Stayed one night,"I gave it a 3/5 because it wasn‚Äôt terrible.. it was cleaner than the hotels in Lexington. Which isnt much of a statement but hopefully my experience was just a one off.
Positives were the quiet, amount of living space, great air conditioning, very hot shower, and free parking behind the unit.
The negative was the cleaning misses:
3 major ones stood out.
1. The kitchen siting area had food residue and hairs throughout it as well as a spider so I had to wipe those down and evacuate the not paying guest from their web.
2. The shower was decent but was definitely not wiped down very well as there were a plethora of hairs on each wall. (As a bald man hairs stand out the most to me.. ) ..but also the rust from the rack sitting on the floor in the shower indicated that it had not been taken out after numerous showers. Meaning the floor of the shower has likely not been wiped so its no wonder the walls have had no loving human contact either
3. A used condom wrapper was in one of the cabinets..after that I stopped looking around the unit.
To sum it up, the place was decent.. it just wasn‚Äôt as clean as I‚Äôd hoped it would be. Hopefully I just caught them on a fluke day."
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Danny‚Äôs place was clean, tidy, comfortable and had everything we needed. The location was easy access to downtown, Distillery district and horse farms too. Great coffee maker w/supplies. Did not do any cooking but there were ample cooking pots/pans and utensils. Danny gives you a wealth of information when renting plus there are some great books in-house. Enjoy your stay.
Note-if you are a light sleeper you may be bothered by the upstairs renters. However, there is a white noise machine on the night stand which proved to be invaluable."

I would definitely recommend this space for anyone looking for a nice stay in Lexington."
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Lovely home and a great host! Super close to everything. I would go again in a heartbeat!
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We were in Lexington for a UK basketball game and to visit with friends. It was perfectly located for a walk to Rupp (half mile) and to so many restaurants in the area. Danny‚Äôs place is gorgeous and comfortable. We had more than enough room and everything we needed.

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,We will be back!! This is the perfect place for us!
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"I stayed at Thomas's home for nine days to visit family in the area. Overall, I enjoyed my stay there and would certainly consider coming back for a long term stay the next time I am in Lexington. The positives: a beautiful location that is walkable into downtown Lexington which has lots of amenities, the space itself is perfect for a long-term stay, and the bed was super comfortable. Something to know before you book though - as others have mentioned; the stairs are dicey. I would not recommend someone with physical limitations to stay here, and do not bring massive suitcases; it will be difficult to get them up and down the stairs. One area of improvement for the owner would be to deep clean the kitchen. While I appreciate how stocked it was, the kitchen could use a good scrubbing, including the refrigerator, drawers, and walls. It isn't enough to deter me from coming back, but I would love to see it cleaner than it was left for me. Otherwise, I had a great stay!"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"It‚Äôs a beautiful place to stay. We experienced a bit of everything, light snow, cold, rain and sunshine.

2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"I have to say this is one of the best places I‚Äôve stayed. What I liked the most was the communication from Thomas. He answered all questions which made my stay very comfortable. The studio itself was very cleaned and the bed was better than I anticipated. I actually felt like I could stay here long term with the clean bathroom and amenities. Everything is provided from dishes to washer machine pods. I work remote and I loved that he allowed me to connect my own connection to the modem. I would most definitely book again. Note: There are some stairs you have to climb to get to the studio so be mindful of that. Thomas also has a guess notepad in the room which previous bookers would sign & leave a thankful message‚Ä¶ I suggest you also leave a kind note as I did. 5 stars, Great place!"
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Everything I could hope for in an airbnb and more! Great location, great space, great hosts. Thank you Tom and Miki!"

2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"I really enjoyed staying at Tom's Airbnb. I stayed here for a few months before I moved from Lexington and the Airbnb was everything I needed.

2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"I just wrapped up three months here and couldn't have asked for a better stay. The unit is quiet, comfortable, fully outfitted, and immediately made me feel at home. As a remote worker, I appreciated the fast, reliable internet as well as the fact that I could walk to one of several coffee shops. I also enjoyed being within an hour's drive of some incredible parks, including Red River Gorge and Berea Pinnacles. The host, Miki, is super responsive, and I enjoyed my conversations with her and Tom. I would definitely stay here again!"

2021-01-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"After striking out on BnB‚Äôs 3 times on this one travel contract, I‚Äôm SO happy I found this gem!!! Nothing was better than knowing I was coming back to such a peaceful space after a crazy shift at the hospital! This place was PERFECT for what I needed for a long stay. Miki is super hospitable, flexible, and responsive. The location is perfect, super close to downtown, the hospitals, and all the coffee shops (the most important thing of course). A few things to ‚Äúnote‚Äù about the space: the stairs are STEEP so don‚Äôt bring your biggest piece of luggage like I did and there‚Äôs no ‚Äòentertaining‚Äô space (but that‚Äôs clear from Miki‚Äôs accurate listing). Those are the only things I would VERY loosely calls negatives. Once again, from a ‚Äúpicky person‚Äù, you‚Äôll be thankful you stayed with Miki!"

The bed is super comfortable and the kitchen got everything you need."
2020-10-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"Miki's place is great. She was a great communicator and responded to messages immediately. Any questions you might have are addressed in the house manual. The space is a great value and optimally located in an open minded neighborhood with many historic homes. All of the appliances in the kitchen are clean and work great, and the mattress was very comfortable. The laundry machine and drier are super convenient. The place was extremely quiet and great for working. One caution would be that the stairs leading up to the apartment are very narrow and steep so you need to be extra careful on the way up. Overall, we truly enjoyed our stay!"
2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"I absolutely enjoyed my long-term stay here! Miki was a fantastic host, and the apartment had everything I needed.

An easy, one-mile walk to downtown ‚Äî a few blocks from a some great restaurants ‚Äî and really near to Transylvania University. The apartment itself is clean and cozy - no living room, but we found the chairs in the bedroom perfectly adequate for our needs. The bed is comfortable and the shower provides plenty of hot water. But, the best part? A washer and dryer right in the unit!!!!
Miki and Tom were thoughtful, friendly, helpful, and unobtrusive. We are so happy we met them!"
2020-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Absolutely the best place to stay in Lexington!!!

No need to run to the grocery store for some olive oil for cooking dinner. There were plenty of towels and blankets, and the full size washer/dryer was so convenient. I will definitely book again when I return to Lexington."
2019-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Charming little apartment that has everything you need. The bed was amazingly comfortable and the apartment was stocked with lots of little extras. I highly recommend staying here. Communication was great and I had everything I needed. As past travelers mentioned - this is not a place for people who can't navigate tight twisty stairs. But, if this is not a problem, the value and comfort is worth the stay. Also loved being 2 blocks from North Lime Donut & Coffee Shop!"
2019-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Adorable place with all the extra touches! Definitely recommend it and the location was an added bonus!

2019-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"By far and away one of the best airbnb experiences I've ever had. Miki and Tom are warm and generous hosts and made me feel very at home. The apartment is beautifully appointed with high quality fixtures as well as the necessities you need for a nice quality of life on the road, be it fluffy towels, nice soaps or good coffee and cooking basics like olive oil - stuff it can be a pain to buy if you want to use a kitchen but aren't staying long. In short, you can tell that Miki and Tom appreciate the good things in life and want their guests to enjoy them, too. That made their airbnb feel like home, something I was very grateful for.
The location is perfect, too. A beautiful leafy street within walking distance of the many cool eateries and breweries the north side of Lexington has to offer. Can't recommend staying here highly enough!"
2019-05-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Great place! Quite neighborhood and easy access to downtown. Stairs are a little steep to carry heavy luggage.
2019-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Lovely little apartment and in a great location - in a quiet and leafy street, but only ten minutes' walk to downtown, and ideally placed if you're driving, too. Lots of lovely little touches - including things like new toothbrushes, toothpaste, razors and shaving foam - ideal if you arrive in town but your luggage is on the next day's flight... A great find with superb hosts and much recommended"

2019-03-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,The place is very cozy and clean. Check in was very easy and Miki is the best host you can ask for.
2019-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Miki's place was lovely and chock full of awesome amenities -- more so than your typical AirBNBs. We just wish we could have visited during warmer weather and seen the chickens. The instructions on how to use everything were pristine! If you need a place to stay where you want to cook and eat at home -- this is your haven -- fully stocked kitchen and a pantry with extras.
2019-02-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Clean, comfy, cozy and quiet. All the essentials!"

2018-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is an amazing find. It is walking distance to quite a few great local spots. The studio is cute and clean and has everything you would need or want. The stairs were a bit tricky coming down, but just overall part of the charm."
2018-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We completely enjoyed our stay at Miki‚Äôs place. The apartment is very private, tucked away behind the house. It was clean, comfortable, and full of character. Miki has provided thoughtful touches throughout. We would definitely stay here again!"
2018-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This a charming comfortable space and Miki has provided many thoughtful touches. For example, it was rainy, and I noticed an umbrella near my door and a personalized welcome note was by my entrance. Instructions on how to use everything were detailed and very helpful. I was surprised to see a full kitchen. Though I didn't use it, it was nice to know it's there for future visits. I will definitely be staying again."
2018-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Nice clean place very quiet.

2018-09-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,A place you want to return
2018-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Charming little apartment in quiet residential area. Tons of extra amenities and thoughtful touches. Very clean. Comfy bed. Easy communication. Stairs are steep and tight- fine, just not for someone with challenges. Highly recommend!"
2018-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This apartment is cute full of character and in a great location. The block itself was fairly quiet while we were there, but just a short walk in either direction and you can get to coffee, beer, and bbq. What more can you want? The apartment itself is cozy, just the right amount of space for two people on a short visit to Lexington, and offers everything you might need. The spiral staircases up to the apartment would be trouble for guests with mobility issues, but if you can manage the steps you owe it to yourself to give Miki's place a try."
2018-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Miki's place was very nice, comfortable and a perfect location for getting around downtown. Definitely would recommend staying here!"

2018-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Miki was an outstanding host. The place is beautiful and very functional. She has thought through all the details and we didn't lack for anything. Our second day we came back to find fresh cut flowers on the steps...such a thoughtful touch! We highly recommend staying here if you travel to Lexington.
2018-07-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,this space is so lovely and Miki is the best host! i can't recommend renting here enough!!!
2018-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Miki‚Äôs place was excellent.....very, very clean, comfortable, walking distance to nearby restaurants, brewery, and distillery as well as to downtown Lexington. The neighborhood is very quiet and her yard/ urban garden very peaceful. Lexington feels like a small city and is easy to get around, especially with Miki‚Äôs location!
We certainly enjoyed our stay and appreciated the good communication we had with Miki. We highly recommend her place as an excellent vacation destination!"
2018-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great location, gracious hosts!"
2018-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is a great place to stay in Lexington. Extremely well located in walking distance to Smithtown Seafood, East 6th brewery, County Club, bike path, and nearby bars and coffee/donuts. Super easy to feel at home in cozy quarters."
2018-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"What a lovely place to stay. This place was just what we needed. It was clean, super comfortable, parking was easy, walkable to a few bars & restaurants, and more space than we expected. We had a small hiccup with a sink leak, and Miki & Tom got it fixed asap. Would highly recommend & would stay here again without hesitation."
2018-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Miki's place was exactly as described. Check-in & out was easy and communication was good. It was a great location that was walking distance to West Sixth Brewing and some other places to eat/drink. Directions to get there were easy & parking was simple. I would recommend Miki's place.
2018-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"If I could sum up Miki's place in one word, it would be 'lovely'. A few more that jump to mind are clean, accessible, and comfortable. As long as you are able to climb the windy stairs, this place is a gem. Miki has thought of everything down to a motion-detecting light in the bathroom for any middle of the night trips. Thoughtfully stocked with any and every amenity you could need including soaps, towels, hair dryer, and even a few pantry staples and condiments in the fridge. All of this while being very well decorated, comfortable and clean! A lovely place to stay for two (or one!) with quick access to all Lexington has to offer. I will definitely be looking to see whether Miki's place is available for my next stay in Lexington!"
2018-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We stayed for 3 nights. Everything was great in the room. I had to work from the apartment the first day, internet connectivity was great, including voice calls."
2018-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Miki has an awesome space! Close to West 6th- one of my favorite breweries. Close to downtown and easily accessible. The space was clean and it seemed like Miki had thought of just about everything you might need at an airbnb! Would absolutely recommend

2018-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place is everything you could need and more. All the extra little touches made the stay even better and the bed is super comfortable. I highly recommend this place to stay, I know I'll be back as soon as I'm able to get away again. Miki was a great host, quick response and gave great insight to the city with suggestions on where to go and what to do."
2018-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Once again, Miki made our stay in Lexington fantastic. Miki's place is so close to everything and a fun brewery just a few walking blocks away!"
2018-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Secluded but yet close to everything in Lexington. Charming, clean and stocked with everything you need."

2018-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Incredible location among houses being appreciated for their historical splendor. The urban farm is a peaceful gem in Lexington. For couples looking for a great getaway, this is the place to be. It is convenient, tastefully decorated, and has a historic feel to it. The ""girls"" in the back yard are sure to greet you with a warm ""cluck"". This is what AirBnB is all about!"
2018-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great little place! A great value - hope it‚Äôs available the next time we come to Lexington. Host was quickly in touch and we had everything we needed.
2018-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This is an ideal spot to stay at - so many burgeoning new businesses are happening in the immediate vicinity - and the historic area is so very pretty. Miki is the kind of host that you cross your fingers and hope for - she has amazing attention to detail in her explanation of the place's features and the amenities she thoughtfully provides.
2018-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Miki's apartment was very comfortable. It looks like it was recently remodeled--the sinks and tub and fixtures were new. There was WiFi, washer/dryer, smart TV and other amenities that made the place really cozy and relaxing. She also stocked the bathroom and kitchen with small toiletries and snacks. Overall, I think Miki put a lot of effort into creating a nice experience in the space. I would visit again."
2018-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Miki's place was perfect for our NYE weekend! Very clean and welcoming. Miki was also always available for quick replies when we had questions. If you're looking for a cute AirBnB on the northeast side of Lexington, this is a great spot!"
2017-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Very cozy bedroom, bath, and kitchen. Quiet and was able to sleep REALLY well. Near a nice brewpub."
2017-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Another fantastic stay. I very highly recommend Miki's place!!
2017-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Miki goes above and beyond to make sure her guests have everything they need.
There are spices to cook with & extra condiments in a fully stocked kitchen.
Her home is impeccably clean & has a warmth about it that makes one feel instantly at home.
We have enjoyed corresponding with her & all of our stays there during our relocation to Lexington.
Highly recommend!"
2017-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Another great stay at Miki's place. Highly recommend for any Lexington or Georgetown travels!
2017-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Miki‚Äôs place was perfect for a weekend get away! We were able to walk to take an Uber (about 5 dollars) to any of the places we went. Miki gave us an extensive list of great restaurants to visit and things to do.
2017-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Another great stay at Miki's studio!
Highly recommend her place!"
2017-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Miki's place was so clean, cute, cozy, and at a great location. My husband and I came to Lexington for the weekend and we were able to walk to lunch and dinner and enjoyed the neighborhood- lots of old homes built around 1900- they were so beautiful. Miki was very quick to respond from prior to booking until the end of the weekend. The little apartment was so quiet and she offered a lot of accommodations. Lots of little soaps and toiletries, pantry with snacks/spices, coffee and creamer, and even candies on the counter. We felt at home in her cute little place! The price was a fraction of what the hotel was charging down the street and a hotel wouldn't have offered as much as she did! Loved the cute chalkboard greeting, the various things offered for us to use (pantry items, coffee, umbrella, washer and dryer, Netflix, wifi) I loved staying here and if we find ourselves back in Lexington- we will be booking with Miki again! Best Airbnb we have stayed in to date (and we travel quite often!)"
2017-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Another great stay at Miki's place!
So quiet in the evening, had a great nights sleep.
We are already discussing booking a weekend with her to go to Keeneland next year. It'd be a close, fabulous home base."
2017-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was my first experience using Air bnb and it surpassed all my expecations! I have been coming to Lexington for the past 3 years to see my son and have always stayed in hotels. I was looking for something a little more economical and close to downtown and Miki's place gets 5 stars in both. The apartment was just as described but even better. Quaint, cozy, and cute were the first words that came to mind. Still not sure how they got that bed up that spiral staircase but I'm sure glad they did because it was just heavenly!! Will for sure be staying here my next trip! Thank you Miki for being such a kind host! Hope to meet you next time!"
2017-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This is our third stay at Miki's place & it is becoming a welcome ""Home away from Home""
Very happy we have found this gem while doing our relocation to Lexington with Toyota. It is close to all that we want to explore in downtown Lexington & a very easy drive to and from Toyota!!"
2017-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place is perfect for one person or a couple for a weekend getaway or an extended stay. This little place has every comfort of home you could wish for including snacks and coffee in the morning! The photos don‚Äôt do it justice for how nice it really was.
Not to mention, this place is extremely walkable to some great restaurants and bars- we even walked downtown to the church where the wedding we were attending was held.
It was such a great deal- definitely stay here! I would stay here again."
2017-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is a return visit we booked to Miki's place due to its comfort, cleanliness and ease of being close to many things in downtown Lexington.
So quiet in this studio ~ had a great nights sleep & was able to cook dinner inside one night in the fully stocked kitchen.
A great stay!"
2017-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Miki and her husband were excellent hosts! I found everything in order, just as she had described and check-in was easy. I wasn't able to meet Miki until my second day there, but she was very welcoming throughout! I was very surprised when she invited me to join her and friends for a small cookout around the campfire in their cute back yard. The food and company were very enjoyable!! The space was perfect for my needs. It felt very cozy, was clean, quiet, and very safe, which was a must, since I was staying alone. Thanks for a wonderful stay!"
2017-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"What a gem of a place! Miki's responsiveness was quick & she was helpful with all questions.
The studio has lots of great warm touches that make you feel right at home. Comfortable, Well stocked & super clean.
It is within walking distance to several places to grab a coffee, evening drink or a bite to eat.
Wonderful stay!"
2017-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The apartment was perfect for my husband and I for a five day trip to attend a wedding. The apartment included numerous amenities including a full kitchen, a washer, television, and a full bathroom. The bed was extremely comfortable. I would highly recommend staying here."
2017-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great little apartment! Super cute and awesome location for seeing all things Lexington. Walkable to restaurants, bars and breweries, yet quiet place to relax!"
2017-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is the best Airbnb in Lexington! Comfortable, cozy, private, quiet, safe, meticulously clean, great location, ample street parking, full amenities--an efficiency-apartment version of home that makes it feel like you are in fact at home. Miki is so welcoming and so fast with communication that it feels almost instantaneous. Cannot recommend her place highly enough!"
2017-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Amazing apartment, I would definitely stay again. Very clean and cozy, highly recommend!"
2017-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Miki's place was lovely and exactly what we we were looking for. The apartment was well stocked, very clean, and Miki was so helpful with the instructions for check in. I'd definitely recommend staying here!"
2017-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Nice spot and down the street from 6th Street Brewery. I enjoyed walking the neighborhood to Doodles and seeing all the great architecture. The parking was easy and convenient across the street and it wasn't an extremely busy place.
2017-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This little attic apartment is a cozy home away from home. It is impeccably clean and well-kept, with beautiful bed linens, a comfortable bed, and lovely d√©cor. It is private and comfortable, in a safe and pretty neighborhood that is walking distance to Transylvania University (5 min), downtown and Rupp Arena (15 min), and the University of Kentucky (30 min). Free on-street parking is a very nice plus. Miki is the consummate host, and has tended to and foreseen absolutely everything, as summarized in a detailed set of instructions that she leaves out for guests on the kitchen counter, and there was even a sweet personalized message waiting for me on a chalkboard outside the apartment door. Miki was incredibly sweet and accommodating of my schedule and told me I could drop my bags off early, but when I got there the whole place was ready and I was able to check in a few hours early. Communication throughout was fantastic. The house itself is absolutely beautiful and charming, with gorgeous landscaping and floral blooms in the front and back yards. I can't recommend Miki's place highly enough!"
2017-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay while in town for a conference!
2017-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,A lovely apartment with a lovely host.
2017-08-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"This is a great long term stay option. I spent the summer in Lexington, and this was a great place. I never had to park more than three doors from the house, and generally parked straight across the street. The stairs are a little challenging to move heavy bags up and down, but not impossible. Pack wisely. The apartment is a little bigger than a studio apartment, and very functional. Great for 1 or 2 people. Miki and Tom were great hosts, and we're quick to help with any question or problem I had. Overall, a great place to spend any length of stay."
2017-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The accommodations were just as described plus more. The host did extra things above and beyond such as fresh eggs, fresh mint to make mint julip's, and stocks the apartment with local flavor such as Churchill Downs glasses, area magazines, local wall art. It is truly a charming apartment in a historic district , centrally localized in Lexington. It's only blocks away from Rupp arena and Transalvania University. Restaurants are plentiful nearby. We'd stay there again and recommend to others. The host also provides toiletries and kitchen pantry items that can come in handy. A gem for Airbnb."
2017-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My adult daughter and I stayed here during the Rolex 3 day event. The location is great and somehow combines walkability and urban life with wonderful privacy. It was a short and easy drive to the Kentucky Horse Park. The neighborhood was very charming and we felt safe walking around, biking, and going to the local eateries. The apartment was clean and very charming, the bed is queen sized and comfortable. We really appreciated the full kitchen one night when we were too tired to go out to dinner and the gardens in the back are lovely. I would recommend planning for the small, winding staircase by packing in smaller bags that are easy to carry. Be sure to take the time to walk around and check out the local food and view the pretty gardens."
2017-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Thank you so much to Miki! I loved the space, the bed was so very comfortable, and I appreciated all of the personal touches such as organic treats and welcome note that were there for my arrival. I used a bicycle that was available every day that took me to ""Doodles"" for breakfast, ""Third Street Stuff,"" for fancy coffee/espresso drinks, and Minton's for some healthy and tasty food. so that was wonderful and got me to food and coffee every day. Miki was helpful and available when needed, but otherwise offered complete privacy. I felt very happy, taken care of and comfortable. Thank you again, Miki! This was another great Airbnb experience for me, and I would recommend you to anyone who asks. :)"
2017-04-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"Miki's place is just perfect for one person or a couple for a short or longer stay in Lexington. Miki is very communicative and kept me posted about various important bits of information during my stay (like what to do with a tornado warning and how to turn on the air conditioning if needed). She provided me with fresh eggs from the chickens in the yard - such a treat!
The space had everything I needed for a 2-week stay, including just the right cooking utensils to prepare most of my own meals. It is in a great location, very close to several tasty restaurants (plus a brewery and a micro-distillery) and a cute little park. As Miki notes, the stairs up in to the apartment are indeed very steep and a bit challenging for getting stuff up and down - I would recommend Miki's place without hesitation to anyone except those with limited mobility (because of the stairs)."
2017-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Clean, quiet, a nice stay! The only issue with this location is that there is a pretty tricky staircase to navigate to get to the apartment. Pack light! And if you aren't physically able to climb stairs comfortably and confidently, this location won't work well for you. However, I have no complaints and would stay here again."
2017-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This was a great place to stay for our nephew's wedding. Miki answered all of our questions. The apartment was lovely and was full of everything we needed. The bed was very comfortable. We would definitely stay here again if we ever return to Lexington.
2017-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay.
2017-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I thoroughly enjoyed staying at this adorable, cozy apartment, which was stocked with all the amenities one could hope for. It was a very quiet couple of nights in a great neighborhood. Also, the hosts were fantastic with providing check-in information via message before my arrival. Will definitely stay here again next time I'm in Lexington!"
2017-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The apartment was described perfectly and just right for my needs. It is convenient to a great brewery, restaurant and a 3 minute drive to downtown, Rupp Arena area. The bed was wonderful and I looked forward to it each night. I will definitely select Miki's place for future trips!"
2017-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"A cozy, quaint place to get away! Loved the amenities and wonderful instructions!"
2017-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Wow! Such a find. Extremely well equipped kitchen, cozy bed, great light. Just a stellar airbnb. Fantastic experience!"
2017-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Miki's place is beautiful and very comfortable. Great location and very quiet. She has all the amenities of staying in a home away from home.
2017-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Nothing bad to say! Check-in was a breeze and the apartment was perfect for what we needed. Great home base for distillery tours.
2017-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great cozy spot near Lexington's downtown.
2017-01-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Great location and a very kind and welcoming host. The place has everything we needed, and it felt safe. Will definitely stay here again."
2016-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Miki's place is clean and comfortable and all the little personal touches made us feel very welcome. It's in a very convenient location, super easy to get to our favorite places downtown. We will definitely be booking another stay in the future!!"
2016-12-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"This lovely space is perfect for someone staying for either a short or long stay! Super location and private, and close enough to walk downtown. A very quaint and comfortable space with a full kitchen and excellent host!"
2016-08-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"My best AirBnb experience ever!! The place was more than what I expected. I felt like I was home during the entire stay. Communication was easy and prompt. The place was cute, neat and clean. The location was really convenient. If I go back to Lexington, I am going to use this place again!"
2016-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We enjoyed our stay at Miki and Tom's apartment. A cozy, cool and comfortable retreat with everything we needed to feel at home. She provided a lot of little bathroom and kitchen necessities as well as special touches like flowers and chocolate to make us feel welcome. Being at Breyerfest model horse show exhibition for 3 days it was great to come back to this retreat and make a meal, take a bath, watch movie then have a great nights sleep in a super comfortable bed. A bit of strength and agility is required to get the luggage up the stairs but that was our only difficulty here. Close to great restaurants and central to anywhere you need to go in Lexington, we would stay here again."
2016-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Miki was a great host. She made the space very warm and inviting. Everything my 15-year-old daughter and I needed was provided. She even allowed us to extend our stay an additional night. I will definitely try to stay at her Urban Farm again when we return to Lexington.
2016-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Miki is wonderful guest. We had some memorable days at Miki's place. The room was very clean and well decorated. The room located very near to the downtown. I'll definitely stay here if I come again to Lexington and I recommend this place.
2016-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The apartment was exactly as described. It was comfortable and clean, and Miki did an exceptional job stocking it with helpful ""just in case"" traveller amenities. She also laid out everything it very detailed directions, down to which drawers contained flatware and which light switches operated which lights. The attention to detail was fantastic.

The neighborhood was great; an easy walk to downtown Lexington, and it was quiet and safe.

I would leave 6 stars if it were possible. Would definitely stay again."
2016-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Miki's place was great. The house has a huge backyard that would be very comfortable to sit in and read, and I almost felt bad that I didn't have enough time in Lexington to do so. The room is comfortable although there isn't really a place to eat, so it might not be great for a long stay. The details that stood out to me was having a welcome message on a black board by the private entrance and local chocolates inside the kitchen, both of which did a lot to make us feel welcome.

The place is near downtown, about .75 miles away. Its on the edge of a really nice historical district and it's a nice walk into town, but there isn't much to see in the immediate neighborhood. Overall, a great place and I would definitely stay again."
2016-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Very nice, clean apartment that's great for one person or a couple. Miki provided everything you'd expect a hotel to provide. Nice neighborhood, 3 blocks from a nice brewery, very close to downtown Lexington (walkable on a nice day). Highly recommended it."
2016-05-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Miki made us feel very welcomed. We came to ride in the Horsey Hundred in Georgetown, KY. The studio apartment was very clean and very comfortable. The bathroom was stocked with many items one might need. We only wished we would of had more time to enjoy the area and chat more with Miki and Tom. Their back yard and picnic area looked awesome!"
2016-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Our experience beginning to end was simply wonderful. From the chalkboard sign welcome and local chocolates to the extremely well appointed studio, we definitely felt at home. Miki was a wonderful host and super prompt with communication. The space was well organized and super clean. If business was to take me on an extended trip to Lexington, I would bend over backwards to stay there."
2016-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Miki was a great host and offers a very nice place to stay. I arrived to a welcome board with my name on it, and a very thoughtful plate of local candies/chocolates awaiting. As I was unloading my car, I had the chance to talk with Miki who was returning home - she's a very kind and genuine lady who wants her guests to feel at home! The apartment is decorated in a mixture of artistic-hip and homey, and it has that same feel. The apartment was also very clean and well stocked with anything you'll need, from glasses, dishes, silverware, coffee, extra soap, shampoo, towels, even a toothbrush - very thoughtful! It was also very cool to have AppleTV with Netflix available to catch up on favorite shows and movies. I'd definitely stay here again and recommend to friends."
2016-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Miki's place was nice, clean and comfortable. The location was close to some great restaurants and the neighborhood was ideal for walking. Our stay was short, but we really enjoyed Lexington with Miki's help!"
2016-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The urban farm house in Lexington was a great place to stay while we were in town. Miki and Tom were wonderful hosts and were always available if we needed anything. The room is very clean and spacious. The kitchen was great for cooking breakfast. We would definitely stay here again!
2016-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very well-prepared apartment . Miki made everything available and easy to understand . She just thought of absolutely everything you might possibly need. Would highly recommend this to other people and when I return to Lexington I hope I can book this place with her .
2016-05-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Charming neighborhood with great walking nearby. The space is cozy but has everything you need. A full kitchen and laundry were a big plus.
2016-04-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"i absolutely loved stayed at miki and tom's place. it was quiet, decorated nicely, had everything i needed, and they were so beyond nice. i was staying in lexington for my job and a long trip at that. will most likely be back and have every intention of staying at this amazingly convenient, adorable, and quiet urban farm. plus you can't beat fresh eggs and veggies from their garden! many thanks to you both."
2016-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We traveled with a loose schedule, and Miki was wonderfully accommodating. The space was quirky and beautiful, and everything we hoped for. She had not only what we needed, but additional comforts that made our trip so much simpler. Honestly, this was better than almost every four and five star hotel experience I have had."
2016-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was such a relaxing place to stay! The apt is equipped with so many nice things from Netflix to luggage racks to a fully equipped kitchen :) I loved the Alice in Wonderland inspired treat in the kitchen! :) it was a perfect place to stay. Staying there by myself, I felt completely safe as well. :) 10 out of 10 in my book!"
2016-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The listing was very accurate. The location is on a nice, quiet side street right near a great brewery/restaurant and within easy walking distance of downtown. The apartment was very clean, comfortable and Miki put a lot of consideration into providing amenities, and making the stay very smooth and uncomplicated. We had a great stay!"
2016-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I love Miki's cozy place! Perfect for a getaway. Welcoming, perfectly appointed, convenient...it had it all!"

2016-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The place was great and located in a convenient and safe area. Miki was very accommodating. She let us arrive at a very late and after hours check in time and left detailed instructions about the room. The room was very clean, comfortable and had all the amenities I could ask for. Miki was very helpful and her response time was almost immediate. I'd definitely recommend Miki's place to anyone visiting Lexington. Thanks again."
2016-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Miki's place is exactly as listed and comes with everything you'll need for a comfortable stay. Great location with easy access to downtown and surrounding neighborhoods. The street has many beautiful historic homes and more within close walking distance. Apt has literally everything you need from toiletries to Netflix to reading material and even cute chickens to watch in the backyard. Would definitely stay here again if visiting Lexington.
2016-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Miki's place is wonderful. She had everything we needed and more. This place is very comfortable and inviting. The location is pretty close to downtown (about a mile), but doesn't seem to be, immediately, in the nicest of areas. We felt very safe inside the apartment though. I would recommend this listing to anyone going to Lexington!"
2016-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Miki's apartment was lovely and so well furnished! She's a very nice person, toughtful, and she has made my arrival very easy.
It's also well located, not far from downtown, and the neighborhood is quiet and safe. It was a pleasure, I highly recomend Miki and her place!"
2016-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"What a lovely and cheerful spot Miki has created! When we arrived, the apartment was warmly lit. The kitchen is well-stocked with corkscrews, cutting boards, wine glasses, and knives--and other stuff too, but that's all we needed! There's a perfect chair for relaxing, and an inviting and warm bed--everything you need for a wonderful stay! AND it's right down the block from West Sixth brewery and other fun places to eat. I am looking forward to another visit! Thanks, Miki!"
2015-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Miki was very helpful and made sure my stay was comfortable. I would definitely stay here again.
2015-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Miki made me feel very welcome at her adorable place. I was exploring Lexington after an interview, and this was a perfect location for that in a historic neighborhood. Everything was as described. Very comfortable bed, cute decorations, everything you could need and more. I would love to visit Lexington again just to stay at her place!"
2015-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Miki's place was wonderful! It was clean and cozy and we had a lovely weekend away. We would stay again and we would recommend to our friends and family!
2015-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Excellent experience. Apartment is clean and comfy with lots of amenities. In apartment laundry available, clean towels, coffee, Netflix. Would definitely stay again."
2015-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The listing was exactly as listed and was in a perfect location. They were local breweries within walking distance along with restaurants and other bars. Rupp arena was a short walk, and commonwealth stadium a short uber. Thank you all so much for your hospitality! I will definitely be back!"
2015-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Miki made us feel right at home. Apartment was as described and then some. She made sure we were comfortable the entire trip and helped us troubleshoot some minor WIFI problems. Location is perfect. Was a quick $5 Uber to downtown, or you can walk there in about 15 minutes. It's about a 15 minute Uber ride to Keeneland and a 10 minute ride to the UK campus. I plan on staying here every trip I make to Lexington."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,A beautiful get away.
2024-06-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Quaint and mostly quiet little place. Would have been nice to have a bathroom door for privacy from the rest of the room... nothing but a shower curtain there. Just remember farm chores start at 8 incase you want to sleep in.
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,One of the best bnbs I‚Äôve stayed in. So refreshing to get above and beyond expectations. Farm was beautiful and space was exactly perfect for what I needed. Definitely would recommend!
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Everything was perfect, Janet was a wonderful host. This air bnb is a gem!! Perfect location if you want peace and tranquility!!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We could not have chosen a better place to spend our week in Kentucky. It was so welcoming and comfortable inside and out. We felt at home right away. Beautiful serene environment but yet a short drive from great restaurants and entertainment.
Janet was so genuine and hospitable in all interactions from booking questions months prior to our stay all the way through our departure. 10/10 in all areas."
2024-04-01,2.0,Stayed a few nights,We have stayed there before with no issues. We loved the peace and quiet and beautiful surroundings. This time Janet had two dogs guarding her goats and they barked all night. She suggested that we move somewhere else when we requested that she keep the dogs in the shed at night. Will never return.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Enjoyed our stay very much. Nice and quiet with plenty of animals to see and visit, especially if you have kids. Our son loved the animals. Beautiful views. Host was nice and very responsive. Would stay here again!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This stay was so nice. Space was so comfortable and cute, property was simply beautiful. I thoroughly enjoyed myself."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Exactly as described. Picture perfect location and not too far of a drive to downtown Lexington.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Janet's place was beautiful and peaceful! Janet's location was right outside of Lexington where you had everything you needed.
I would highly recommend Janet's place to stay if you are looking for a place to stay near or around Lexington!"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful views on the drive in, very cozy and had everything we needed. Went above with having soap and lotion, games, movies, little snacks, and coffee pods for us to use."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We thoroughly enjoyed staying at Jan's, visiting with her animals, and speaking with her! Jan communicated perfectly and we'd happily stay there again."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Probably the best place we‚Äôve ever stayed through AirBnB. Peaceful, private, clean, and a great value. What more could you ask for?
We got to interact with the animals every morning which gave every day an awesome start. The horse racing decor is a fun added touch!"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,My first time in the Lexington area was fun and stress free! All of the animals were so friendly and beautiful. Janet has great recommendations for food and entertainment. Thank you Janet!
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"Such a beautiful location in horse country. Quiet and serene, just what we needed. Good location to jump on the highway and get to Nashville and Louisville.
All the necessities were taken care of and the goats and dogs were fun to watch.
Highly recommend for a couple looking for peace and quiet."
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I had a delightful stay at this quiet Airbnb. The serene atmosphere provided a perfect escape from the hustle and bustle. The charming accommodation, coupled with attentive hosts, made for a truly memorable experience. Highly recommend for those seeking tranquility."
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Janet's place is AMAZING. Located in a barn (but separate from the stalls), the space looks out onto a beautiful landscape - complete with goats and a horse! The space itself was spacious (plenty enough for two people), clean, and featured a coffee machine, fridge, a futon, chair, and comfortable bed. Located about 20ish minutes from downtown Lexington, it was nice to stay a little away from the hustle and bustle from downtown. It was an easy drive to downtown, though! Finally, Janet was responsive and left many great recommendations for places around town. I would highly recommend staying at Janet's place while visiting Lexington! Plus, who doesn't love being able to see cute goats every day!"
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Had a wonderful stay here. It was so cozy and the perfect place to hibernate during the rainy weather. Very beautiful and peaceful surroundings.
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Private, peaceful, serene getaway. Such a cozy, beautiful little home away from home. Waking up here is like nothing else. All of your worries are carried away with the beautiful view of farm and wildlife."
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Very adorable, nice little place! Really enjoyed the horse they had there! Regardless of it being attached to the barn, privacy was immensely respected and we were not bothered at all the entire trip. Accommodations such as towels and blankets were plentiful and much appreciated. Even during our stay in the middle of winter, the trip was made so much warmer and relaxing with this barn-apartment! Easy-to-follow directions, personally the item attached to the key was hilarious for both me and my wife. Overall lovely place, very comfortable bed!"
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful place!
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"It was a very cozy place to stay. The goats, horses, and farm kitties were so cute to say hi to. It was a nice peace of country not to far from civilization."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Really enjoyed our stay and plan to book again in the future!
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My husband and I were visiting family for Christmas and needed a place to stay for a long weekend. This place was perfect for us. It's very easy to find and just a short drive from the interstate. Upon arrival, we noticed the horse lodge sign at the end of the driveway which made our turn very easy to find. The driveway is lined with beautiful fence rows and the barn is exactly as Janet described it. It's beautifully decorated on the outside and the inside is simple which is what we like. The views are beautiful and it's a very peaceful location. My husband and I were greeted with the farm cat just about every time we stepped outside. He/She is very friendly. They do have farm animals with guard dogs so you may hear some barking if they spot something outside of the fence they do not like. The inside of the barn is just as pictured. It's a studio apt with all the basics. My only complaint is there were too many scented air fresheners which was a bit overwhelming, otherwise perfect."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We were vising relatives in Richmond for just a few days and stayed at Janet's place due being proximally located, on a peaceful looking farm, and having the opportunity to interact with goals and horses. Unfortunately, it rained the whole time we were there so we didn't end up interacting with any of the farm animals, but we did get to hang out with the cats at least. Overall, Janet's Airbnb was as great and as advertised - clean, comfortable, and quiet. Janet was also very response and left us very detailed instructions during our stay. 100% would visit again."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Our stay was amazing! Such a cute & safe area to stay at! Janet was so sweet when in need of help. The room has games and movies to enjoy. The animals are so adorable!
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,My boyfriend and I stayed at this beautiful barn during thanksgiving weekend and it was an absolute pleasure. We really enjoyed the goats and horse. The animals were so friendly and loved attention. Check in and check out was smooth and easy. The cleanliness was impeccable and the hosts were also great themselves. Will absolutely stay here again when visiting KY.
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"LOVED staying here. Such a beautiful, private location. My 6 month old loved the goats too. Will stay again."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The quintessential Kentucky experience! Cozy and homely room in peaceful, stunning rural surroundings. My husband and our 4month old daughter had a really comfortable night then met the sweet friendly farm animals in the morning, very memorable."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This is our second stay at the Horse üê¥ Lodge and we enjoyed it as much as the first time!! We love being able to interact with all the animals. It‚Äôs so peaceful there. We highly recommend staying here. We will definitely be back again. Thank you again!!
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Horse Lodge met my expectations. It is a beautiful location yet convenient to Lexington. The apartment was clean and very inviting and looked like the photos. We enjoyed seeing the animals and walking on the road.
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful and secluded
2023-10-01,3.0,Stayed with kids,"The main issue was the host. The wifi was down which is annoying but it happens. Janet, however, behaved like she didn't really care. First, she seemed convinced that I just didn't know how to find the correct wifi. Then she acted like it was wrong of me to assume that the wifi would be good enough to stream movies which I think is a pretty basic expectation when the listing advertises wifi. Then, she got annoyed with me when I texted her at 9:30pm because the wifi still was not working and I had had minimal communication from her. The next morning when it turned out the wifi was in fact broken all she offered was to refund me for the next night's stay if I left in the next three hours. I passed and asked for a 20% discount on the stay. She ignored my request but took the time to ask me to not call/text her after 7pm unless it was an emergency. She never apologized once. She's honestly the only bad host I've ever had on air bnb. Disappointing."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This was a lovely place - beautiful and serene!
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"we loved staying at Janet's farm. it was so beautiful. I loved the animals. the apartment was so cozy and welcoming. we didn't want to leave. it was in a great location to restaurants, shops, winieries, and distilleries. if we are ever in the area we will definitelybe staying here again. 10/10 recommend."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Janet's place was cute and cozy as expected! We were in town for just a weekend and it was the perfect spot to get to everything nearby. We would definitely stay again!
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was a special Airbnb experience for us. The apartment is built as an addition to the horse barn, but sealed off from animal sounds or dust. The fact that it is in the country is a great bonus after running around the Lexington area doing tours or tastings or races or whatever. The apt. is extremely clean, the kitchenette area is more complete than most, and the views at sunrise and sunset were beautiful.
The property was secluded, quiet and well-kept; the location was convenient to pretty much any greater Lexington attraction. Janet is friendly and helpful but leaves you alone if you don't need assistance. A very good value."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,My husband and I stayed here for 2 nights. It was easy to find and far enough away from the busy city that it was quiet but still easily accessible. We were greeted by some wonderful farm animals and had an enjoyable time just relaxing at the barn. When we get back to the Lexington area we will be staying here again. Loved it so much!!
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Unique place to stay near Lexington. Great views of beautiful, rural horse country of Kentucky. Small, but enough room for my wife and I, and our college age daughter. We really enjoyed interacting with the horse and goats, and also took advantage of the hiking trials. Janet was very friendly and welcoming. She made sure we had what we needed. 50amp, 240v plug was perfect for charging our EV. Overall it was a great experience and we will likely stay again when we come back for a game."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place for a weekend getaway that‚Äôs still close to the city!
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Very neat stay. Animals where very friendly. Little further out from downtown than I thought, but wasn‚Äôt to bad. Overall we enjoyed our stay."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Really a cute place to stay. Clean and comfortable room, very quiet in the middle of the nature."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Everything just as described. Very friendly and accommodating. Would highly recommend this place to people.
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"My 10 year old daughter and I stayed here while visiting to go to Horse Park. It was absolutely the best. Place was tidy and cozy, and the perfect size for us. My daughter was in heaven with all of the animals to visit, especially the horse. Lots of room to run and look at the stars. We had a blast!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Made you feel right at home loved seeing the animals too. Lastly the communication was above and beyond.
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,My husband and I thoroughly enjoyed staying here. The surroundings were beautiful and it was so fun to wake up in the mornings and see the horse and goats. The apartment was extremely clean and well taken care of. We can‚Äôt wait to come back sometime!
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My wife and I have stayed before and plan to stay again. Beautiful, peaceful location. Jan is always very friendly and accommodating. Highly recommend!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We loved Jan's place! It was a great size for the two of us and had everything we needed and as described and shown in the photos. It felt like a home and we felt at home. The decorations had great local character and made the room feel real, not like a sterile lifeless place. It was also very clean. The bathroom was so clean it squeaked, the kitchen was spotless, and the linens were everything I could have asked for and they smelled nice. Jan's directions were easy. We corresponded multiple times just because our schedules didn't align for a few days. She was always super friendly and wanted to make sure that everything was okay (it was). Finally, the location was wonderful. It's a quick and easy ride into Lexington, but with all of the joy of the country. The view off the porch was beautiful. The landscaping around the barn was really well done. If you're considering a visit to this area, you can stop searching! I'd return in a heartbeat. Thank you!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Our stay at Janet's barn was delightful. The housing is located inside the barn, so you get to see the horses when you come in and out. You also get so see the goats and the dogs. The housing and amenities are true to the description. I appreciated Janet's proactivity at providing detailed arrival info and phone number so we stayed in contact. During our stay, there was an apparent issue with the water heater, but Janet figured it out before us and kept us updated about the issue, which was fixed before we were back. Janet is very friendly and gave us great recommendations. The place is comfy, quiet and in the middle of the countryside. We couldn't ask for more and we do recommend!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Loved staying here. Peaceful and quiet. Beautiful surroundings and the animals were fun to see. Definitely recommend staying here.
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Truly loved this location and if we ever need another Airbnb in the area we will be using this one! Janet was so lovely to talk to and she had great recommendations!
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"this is our second summer staying at Janet's on our way home to Wisconsin. such a peaceful place! love the animals!!!
close enough to great restaurants and attractions!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very nice place. I would recommend. The only drawback is that the bathroom has no door. Only a curtain.
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was my first time in Kentucky and I couldn‚Äôt have picked a better place to stay.
It is really only made for one or 2 people, but that‚Äôs all you need. It‚Äôs a great spot for some alone time and time to focus on you and your issues/stresses/problems. Or to come and get inspiration for a story that you want to finish or start.
I felt at home from the minute I walked in the door.
The 2 cats that live on the property ARE SO CUTE!!! I loved them and they enjoyed my company.
The goats are also very friendly, they will come up to you and let you pet/feed them. Adorable.
She owns a very massive and strong horse. He is so majestic!! She told me how he won a bunch of races, in the past. He was a sight to see!!
You won‚Äôt be disappointed, if you decide to pick Janet and her amazing property. It‚Äôs only 20 or so minutes from Lexington, which is a very big city with many attractions.
My name is Troy and I recommend Janet. Not just the property, but the person. Thank you."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Jan was responsive, helpful and a great hostess from start to finish. The Horse Lodge matched it's description and my expectations in everyway. I would definitely go back if I ever head to Kentucky again!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"I stayed here with my toddler and it was everything I hoped it would be! Our schedule was pretty packed for a family reunion, but we still found some time to feed the goats-which my daughter loved! She also fell in love with the two cats. It was such a beautiful and peaceful stay, and exactly what we needed for this weekend."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We had a perfect stay at Janet‚Äôs place. Location was so quiet and peaceful but still close to everything. We would definitely stay here again.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We absolutely loved this stay! Super peaceful and very well kept. This was my first visit to this area and my husband was from Louisville KY. We wanted to visits some of the surrounding distilleries and we found Janet‚Äôs place to be in the perfect location. We spent a week there and felt right at home.
After a long day of touring the areas, We‚Äôd walk the farm, feed the goats and watch the horses. We loved sitting on the porch to watch the beautiful sunsets!
Will absolutely stay there again when we‚Äôre up to visit!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Janet‚Äôs place was by far my favorite place I‚Äôve stayed in! Not only was the property absolutely breathtaking, but the apartment was clean, comfortable, and SO cute. We loved all of the horse themed decor and the bed was really comfortable. Janet was a great host, very friendly and responsive. Would love to come back and stay again next time I‚Äôm in Lexington!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"lovely place to stay. enjoyed walking the trail and enjoying scenery!
I would say better for a single person or a couple. but you can make it work with a small child/children. there's no door on the bathroom. it's a curtain. the baby who is just learning to walk kept crawling in the shower with us. we also put all the books, DVDs and statue up on the high shelf so the baby wouldn't get into them and covered furniture as extra precautions.
there's no stove. but you can work miracles with a hot plate!
make sure to supervise all kids under 16 when on property. it is a working farm. it was hard to tell my fiercely independent child no if she wanted to run and grab something from car for me or stretch her legs. but it's totally understandable why that rule is in place.
the goats made my daughter super happy and the horse! she's very happy around animals.
this was my first big trip alone without the husband. but the place is very secure and in a good area.
thank you for hosting!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This place was perfect! We really enjoyed our visit! The communication was super easy and quick and the place looks exactly like it does in the pictures. The animals were super friendly and the views were amazing. We would absolutely recommend staying here and we would definitely stay here again!
2023-06-01,2.0,Stayed with kids,"Well I wish my review would be a positive one but this will not be. I may have gotten on her bad side when I accidentally lost the key to entering the room. She said to me several times that she needed to buy a new lock/door knob because she didn't have a spare and she needed to schedule someone to replace the lock. It felt like a guilt trip. When I was apologizing to her in person about losing the key and explaining what I think happened, she cut me off and ended our conversation. My other interactions were just unsettling. I brought my 7 year old daughter to love on the animals and enjoy the farm life setting. Anytime we were around her, in the barn or out by the goats, made it feel like we were intruding. She also made a comment about making sure my daughter was supervised - which she always was. Needless to say, I was uncomfortable with my stay here. Positives- views of this property are spectacular, and we had so much fun with the goats and horses, but we will not be returning"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"If you are looking for tranquility and beauty this is the place to stay. Loved the horse right outside, the landscape, the goats, everything. The space was perfect and we didn‚Äôt want to leave!"

2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"What a wonderful place to stay ! The views are spectacular, we loved the animals and really got a kick out of all their names :) We also loved how it was centrally located and ate at one of the suggested pizza places from the book. Yum ! We got lots of hiking and site seeing in and enjoyed coming back at night to a quiet and peaceful space.
Sarah and Ev"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Really enjoyed my stay!
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stray. Recommend it for a couple traveling that would like a country feel. The goats and horses made our day. We get to give them snacks that Janet has for them. I wish we had more time to hike the trail in the woods. We would stay here again.
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Another incredible stay on this beautiful property! Jan is great. So peaceful and relaxing. Our third time here and can‚Äôt wait to come back!!

2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Janet's place was the perfect, relaxing escape after enjoying our time exploring Lexington. The property was gorgeous and well kempt. The apartment was clean and welcoming."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place was perfect! We wanted something out in the country but yet close to Lexington so it did not take a long time to get into any of the venues we wanted to go to. We fed the goats as soon as the host's daughter brought them up to the large pen nearest the apt. That was fun and then walked down the trail a bit and played a game of cornhole in the sunshine. The apartment is just as it is described and there is a shower curtain now in front of the bathroom so you do have some privacy. A big warning...there is a step down right after you walk into the little area to take your shoes off sitting on the chest that is there. I brought stuff to make pancakes and bacon and panicked at first since no stove; but found a great electric flat grill in the bottom cupboard. There is a hotplate in another cupboard if you need to heat something in a kettle and a toaster oven in a drawer that is provided. Bed was comfortable and we had everything we might need.
I definitely recommend this place!"

Thank you Jan!!!!"
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This is our second time staying here and it was just as wonderful as before! We brought our daughter with us this time to enjoy the animal‚Äôs and the atmosphere.

The place had thoughtful touches and was nicely decorated. The property is really pretty and we did walk down to see the goats. As mentioned in other comments, my only reservation would be that there is only a thin curtain serving as a bathroom door. I would stay again!"
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We had a wonderful stay! The surroundings were beautiful and we really enjoyed walking around. We enjoyed the goats and how peaceful it was. It was a perfect get away to relax away from all the huddle and bustle. Would definitely recommend! Comfortable and cozy.
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Great little getaway that‚Äôs perfectly located just outside of Lexington. We came in for thanksgiving to visit family around central KY and it was the perfect landing spot for us. Plus our daughter loved feeding the goats!
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Jan did a great job of letting us know all the details! Could not ask for better host. Great location, beautiful facilities."
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was an ideal stay for our mini vacation in Lexington checking out some Bourbon trail stops. The location to downtown was convenient but also removed from town enough to really enjoy an exclusive open country environment with awesome star gazing, sunsets, and sunrises. The apartment was super clean and featured all the amenities one could need. We loved visiting with all the animals and also enjoyed the walking trail very much. Check in and communication was very smooth. We would love to come back for another visit."

2022-10-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Janet's place was very clean and it was nice to be outside of the city to relax at night. The one drawback was that there is no door on the bathroom.
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The apartment was very clean and had everything I needed. The location was totally amazing... a beautiful farm setting yet only a 10 to 15 minutes drive to restaurants, shopping, and other activities. The setting was peaceful, quiet, and serene. I loved it!"
2022-10-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"The efficiency apartment is in a very quiet and peaceful setting in the country, as described. I was disappointed with communication with the host after we booked. Each of 2 messages I sent with some questions, I received a response back stating ‚ÄúI really think if you are that concerned you should look for another spot‚Äù. I was only trying to better know what to expect concerning the picnics that are booked on the property while there, I didn‚Äôt want to cancel! It honestly made me very uncomfortable to receive that type of response to a few questions. I‚Äôve corresponded with over 20 stays and never had a host respond that way.
The goats were charming and just across the field, a short walk down the gravel drive. There was 1 horse closeby and a friendly goat, and a friendly cat. The property could be explored, but I never saw any trails marked or straw paths as pictured. The apartment appears to be cleaned and aired out (windows open, fans on) but deep cleaning needs to be done. (windows and fans specifically) . The kitchen is sparsely furnished/stocked with items that were listed in the ad . The Kroger is about 15 min away.
The DVD player was enjoyed and we liked the movie and documentary about Seabiscuit.
While there for 3 nights we visited the thoroughbred farm where the movie was made, Xalapa.
Beautiful country get away."
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I booked this as an anniversary gift for my parents. This is what my mom had to say‚Ä¶ ‚ÄúReally enjoyed our stay!!

2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Loved staying at Janets farm! It was close to Lexington and if you needed gas or fast food, it was just up the road. We took our motorcycles down to Kentucky and this was a great place to stay. Very quiet and peaceful after being out on the road all day long. If I was in the area I would def stay here again. It was fun to see the animals and give them treats everyday! We even went and got Bruno the Donkey carrots. But we did make him share with the horse and goats!"

The apartment attached to the barn was the perfect place to enjoy interacting with Bruno the donkey (we love him üòç) and the horse and the cats, and goats as we were coming and going! We did not do the Picnic with the Goats but took a walk past the Picnic area and Janet out does herself making the most beautifully displayed table settings. Janet is very hardworking and is always ready to accommodate her guests needs but is never intrusive. The apartment is very clean and welcoming and well stocked with whatever you need for your visit as well as extra snacks for humans and Goats!! üòÄ This is the perfect place to relax and enjoy the premises or to return to after a day of adventure around the area.

2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"The Horse Lodge provides a unique stay in the countryside with horses, goats, and two sweet barn cats. Our host Jan was very friendly and welcoming and was great at communicating with us during our almost two weeks there. The only downside I would say is the flies - but of course that should be expected in the summer on a horse farm. The location felt safe - quiet and peaceful but still not too far outside of the city. A truly lovely little stay in nature with amazing sunset views."
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Janet's place was great! Exactly as advertised and would definitely go back.
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This was a truly perfect stay! The property is incredibly clean, spacious, quiet, and well-located. It‚Äôs a great value, particularly for those visiting Lexington for an immersive horse-themed visit.
The bed and sofa-bed were comfy, the equestrian decor was tastefully charming, the kitchen seemed well-stocked, the A/C worked great even on some days with heat advisories, and it‚Äôs hard to beat a place that even provides goat snacks! The apartment is attached to the barn (though we didn‚Äôt hear any noise) and looks out on a picturesque field, with goats, horses, and barn cats to befriend.
Jan was extremely responsive, messaging back quickly when we needed advice regarding how to open up the sofa bed (our incompetence, though she was kind enough not to point that out!). In advance of our visit, she also helped identify a barn for a riding lesson.
In addition to the pasture, there‚Äôs a short trail into the woods to explore with the option to arrange a picnic or bonfire. Everything we wanted seemed to be less than a 15-20 minute drive, often on wonderfully scenic back roads.
Overall, there wasn‚Äôt a single fault found, and we can‚Äôt believe our outstanding luck in finding this gem!"
2021-07-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"The location from Lexington and peaceful surroundings were nice. The apartment is the perfect size for a couple to enjoy a nice couple of days in horse country. There is a slight walk to the picnic area. We enjoyed the kitties, feeding the goats and using the bbq."
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We loved this apartment! The pictures don't do the scenery justice. Sunsets and sunrises were so beautiful here! Jan is very friendly and responsive. Check in was easy, and the apartment was clean and cozy. The horses, cats, and goats make this stay so special. If I could give more than 5 stars, I would!"
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Cannot say enough good things about this place!!! It is even better than the pictures. The kitchen is fully stocked with everything you could need to make a meal if you choose to stay in. The horses, goats, and even the cats are friendly. Jan was so accommodating and gave great recommendations for things to go do or places to eat."
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a lovely, relaxing stay at Janet and Al‚Äôs farm! They were so nice and welcoming as were the goats and barn cats. :) We spent time relaxing on the porch and in the hammock under the trees.
The apartment was very quiet, clean and well equipped. And there are restaurants within an easy drive away - including a great breakfast at Josie‚Äôs.
All in all, a wonderful weekend away!"
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Was exactly as described. Secluded and yet close to everything. Clean comfortable. Friendly animals and great open spaces.
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This was a charming space! Very comfortable and what a treat to see the horses and goats! Janet is a great host and I highly recommend her space!
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,What an amazing place. Quiet and away and not far from shopping and places to visit. Ms Janet was so nice and friendly. Answered the many questions we had and was great with helping us find places of interests. The little cabin was extremely clean and stocked with everything we could have needed. The fireflies at dusk put on an amazing show every night.
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"What a wonderful getaway! Jan and Al are honest, hardworking people with a beautiful piece of land to offer. The animals were incredibly friendly, and there were so many different places to relax outside. I spent the majority of my time on the farm, but did venture to Raven Run Nature Sanctuary nearby. Very beautiful as well! Enjoyable, clean and safe stay."
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"An incredible place to stay at. It‚Äôs a good location from the distilleries near Lexington on the Bourbon Trail. The property itself is absolutely beautiful. The horses, goats, and barn cats add even more charm to the experience. A great place to relax, unwind, and enjoy the Kentucky experience. I highly recommend this location and hope to return again."
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Jan's place is absolute serenity. If I could give all the categories 10 stars, I would. The ""apartment"" is absolutely 100% functional, cute and most importantly, spotless. The property (outside) is a dream. So quiet. All you may hear is one of the kitties beckoning you to come outside, or one of the horses making one of their endearing sounds and the goats! They get excited as soon as you walk out the door.....so you better bring them a little snack.....which Jan leaves an ample supply of in the room :) We loved sitting outside after dark just enjoying all the nature sounds. Our stay really was perfect. And I would be remiss if I did not mention that Jan is the perfect host. She is absolutely a delight to chat with, very responsive in communication and never intrusive. If you find yourself in the Lexington area, you must stay here to experience for yourself. You will be bo more than 30 minutes from all the attractions."
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Such a relaxing place, perfect to de-stress and enjoy Bluegrass country. Jan was great to work with, gave us space, but also available for anything we needed."
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This place is fantastic and Jan is a fabulous host!
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Wonderful efficiency apartment in a beautiful rural setting.
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is a really special stay - magical, we thought. Lovely piece of land in KY blue grass area and you stay in a well-kept, well-appointed and attractive studio apartment that's connected to the horse barn. The barn and farm area are clean and kept super tidy, and the equine boarders are ex-racers and stunning to look at as they graze in their pastures. Amazing sunsets to watch over the meadows from the private open air porch. We loved the goats, too, who are out in their own pasture in nice weather and who love the 'goat treats' (veggie straws) the hosts provide you with.
Jan and Al are super hosts - you want to be a great guest for them so they keep offering this unique experience to Airbnb'ers."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,A nice home to stay in for spending time in Lexington.
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We loved everything about our stay. The main street is very loud at times, however that is not an owner issue. Avena allowed our daughter‚Äôs wedding party to get ready at her home and we had plenty of space for everyone to relax and enjoy the morning!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Avena's home in Lexington was a dream to come home to. The place was roomy, comfortable, charming and felt like home. It was very easy to walk to nearby parks and restaurants and the check in / check out logistics were seamless.
Thanks Avena for sharing your place with us, I would recommend to any of my friends!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Very nice!
Thanks so much"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Loved the historic area and the historic nature of this home. Updated decor was lovely. We felt comfortable right away.
There was noise from the street as it was on the corner of a fairly busy intersection. For my friend and I, it was expected with the location so this is not a complaint. Just noting for others who might want to know."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"I thought this was an absolutely beautiful home. Nicely decorated without being cluttered. Tons of space. Lovely outdoor area. Great layout for relaxing downstairs. Plenty of linens in the upstairs bathroom. Easy walk to doodles for breakfast. My Husband found the street noise to be a bit loud over night, so if you are sensitive to that, I recommend a sound machine, but I can‚Äôt say I noticed it at all. The host was very kind and messaged frequently with updates when I asked to get an early check-in. I‚Äôve already looked at dates for another stay!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great stay in a historic home. We can't wait for a return trip!
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"WOW! I'll be honest, this is by far the nicest place I've ever stayed with AirBNB. It's even better in person. Super soft beds and pillows; great location; super clean; had everything we needed; great parking; darling outdoor space; very welcoming. Gotta see it in person to appreciate how amazing it is. Avena is excellent to communicate with, too! 10 out of 10 recommend! Close to downtown and very close to Transylvania University."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Great place to stay in Lexington! Especially loved the drawer with the kids toys :) Would definitely stay here again!

2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Avena was very responsive and helpful during our stay. The house is beautiful and comfortable. Both beds were very comfortable. Only downside was the street noise at night while trying to sleep but that not Avena‚Äôs fault! Just the location of the house. I would stay here again for sure!
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Arena‚Äôs home is lovely. Everything was clean and easy to find. Beautifully decorated and well appointed.
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Loved our stay here. Very walkable area. We were able to walk to the Rupp Arena, UK, and local restaurants. In fact, except for a day trip to Louisville, we didn‚Äôt need to use our car at all. We stayed during the winter, and the heat in the house worked very well."
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful historic home and convenient location! In town for a conference; quick little walk to the convention center! Had a lovely time :) 5 star Rec!
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Comfortable two story townhouse style home with a big, inviting kitchen and comfortable bedrooms. Loved the piano in the living room. Great location for downtown Lexington. UK Campus was a 20 minute walk. Avena is very easy to reach and very helpful."
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We were thrilled with Avena's place! It was absolutely gorgeous, looked just like the photos, was spotless, and close to so many restaurants.

2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Such an amazing space and location. Would love to stay in one Avena‚Äôs properties every visit to Lexington. A situation arose in which she was a life saver. Such a gracious host with unique and beautiful interior design choices. Two thumbs up!!
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Lovely and spacious. Beautiful full kitchen. Lots of charm and very comfortable. Easy off-street parking. Peet‚Äôs coffee and a nice coffee maker. Convenient to everything. We would most definitely stay again. Thank you, Avena."

2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We used this lovely dwelling for the bridal party to get dressed and for the couples wedding night. They loved the place.
It was beautiful!"
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The highest compliment you can give to an airbnb home and host is that it will be your first choice whenever you‚Äôre in the area. That holds true for Avena‚Äôs home away from home.
2023-11-01,5.0,Group trip,"Great host and place, super helpful and friendly! No complaints!"
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is the second time we have rented this house from Avena and she continues to impress us with amazing accommodations!
Highly recommend!!"
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We loved your place! Walking distance to the venue was awesome! We will be back
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Of all the places I‚Äôve stayed around the country, Avena‚Äôs home was by far my most favorite. Charming and well appointed, I felt like we were living another life for a few days. Plenty of room for all and the kitchen is magnificent for cooking and entertaining. The backyard is super cute and perfect for a late morning conversation and coffee. We had everything we needed for a perfect stay. And the piano was fun for my tween! Super close to downtown, we walked to breakfast one morning! We loved the beds too, sooo very comfortable. We slept wonderfully. One of my favorite parts was having zero check out responsibilities!!! We packed up and left without having to worry about emptying garbage, cleaning dishes, pulling sheets off the beds, and starting a load of towels. Seriously! I felt like royalty!! üòä We of course didn‚Äôt leave the place trashed but it was nice to not have to do extra work. Thanks again, Avena! We WILL be back!"
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Wonderful stay, close to everything. Home is well-stocked with amenities. Even though we didn't need anything, Avena thoughtfully left more coffee, shampoo, paper towels, even cookies at the back door! The home is old, but well-maintained and updated, clean and charming. The only thing I would change is adding a dining table for 4, as we are card players in the evenings, but probably wouldn't bother most people. I would definitely stay here again."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,A perfect stay. Beautiful and spacious home. Convenient parking and great location. Loved it.
2023-10-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a great stay here! Beautiful home with loads of character. Very accurate description and amazing host! The only thing that could be further clarified is that the rear courtyard is shared with another unit next-door. No big deal, but we didn‚Äôt realize we were sharing that common space. But it was a great stay, I would highly recommend."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Would definitely stay here again! Loved it.
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We had a great stay. Very walkable neighborhood convenient to restaurants and bars.
2023-10-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Very Nice stay in a historical home. Walking distance to downtown and to the wedding venue..Carrick House. The this house is located at a corner intersection. Many sirens from fire trucks and ambulances when going through intersection other then that the traffic could not be heard. Very comfortable stay
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Great, walkable location and the house has incredible charm!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"very fast communication, easy to find, clean"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Only wish we could have stayed longer! Avena‚Äôs home was lovely and luxurious with really special touches that made it feel welcoming. Conveniently located and especially appreciated the EV charger. Highly recommend for a stay in Lexington!
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great location and well decorated/designed on the inside. Very comfy bed and high grade upgrades in a beautiful old historic home. Exceeded my expectations

2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Avena‚Äôs place was the perfect place to relax from an action packed wedding weekend! My son was getting married a few blocks away so the location was the best asset for us! Yet, the furnishings are very tasteful including a comfortable queen size bedroom.
The kitchen is well stocked and spacious. And we also enjoyed a few quiet moments on her back porch overlooking a garden. Would definitely recommend and hope to stay here again in the future!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great place with tons of historic featurs and modern updates! Close to all kinds of activities, restaurants, and other things to do. Avena was responsive and helpful when needed."

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We loved staying at this beautiful townhome! We used it as a spot to get ready for our wedding and a first look location (perfect for photos). The furnishings were perfect and very comfortable. Our stay felt like being at home. The home was very clean, tidy, and exactly as described. We would definitely recommend this place!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Avena‚Äôs place was better than advertised. The location is perfect as we were able to walk to downtown, Greyline Station, and Smithtown Seafood with ease. The place was clean and well furnished. We travel to Lexington multiple times a year and Avena‚Äôs place was the best AirBnB we‚Äôve found in town."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Avena has an eye for decor and a talent for hospitality. Her home is clean, beautiful and conveniently located within walking distance of an array of restaurants and activities in Lexington's historic district. We'd love to book another stay if we are ever in town again!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Wonderful home walkable to everything downtown with off street parking. We really appreciated how well the house has been updated and maintained. It's beautiful and a borderline luxurious. Avena was a wonderful host as well! Perfection.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Absolutely stunning and historic home! Great stay in Lexington and easy walking distance to downtown life.
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay in Lex!
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Had a great stay at this town house! I never want to leave!
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We love it here! Have stayed many times and hope to stay many more!
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Great location, and proactive host. We were traveling with our three kids, including an infant, and Avena was conscious of both concerns and amenities necessary for traveling with a baby before we could even ask."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We booked this AirBnB for the Railbird Festival. The house was among the few decent ones left when we booked, so we were pleased with how nice it was, how walkable it was to downtown, and the host was top notch. She even surprised us with a little gift one morning to start our day! She was very responsive to answering our questions about the house, helping us with local details about places to eat and see, and did it all while being friendly. I feel like she's a friend, and we never even met. We will likely try to stay here again when we visit Lexington the next time! Highly recommended place."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This house was superbly located close to downtown and easily walkable to lots of good restaurants and bars. The house was spacious, well equipped and tastefully decorated, with a comfortable outside seating area. Avena was extremely responsive, friendly and helpful. The neighbourhood felt quite safe for our teenage girls to wander and they enjoyed exploring the Transylvannia university campus and walking downtown. We had a great stay."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This place was in a great location and had everything you needed available.
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We adore old houses, and this one did not disappoint. It was SO beautiful! We loved our stay here. Lots of space, very clean, comfy beds, walkable to some great restaurants. The house is duplex-style with a shared wall, but if we had neighbors while we were there we never heard them. Other reviews have mentioned street noise, and it is on a busy street, but if you're used to normal city noise it shouldn't bother you. We never noticed it. The enclosed backyard was really nice, and we ate out there a few times. If you're traveling with really young kids/babies, it might not be the best place for you‚Äîthere is no traditional dining room table, just the kitchen bar with three tall chairs, and each room has a transition piece that is easy to trip and fall over if you're not used to it‚Äîbut our older kids did totally fine and loved exploring the house. My son was especially fond of the reading nook at the top of the stairs. We would definitely stay here again!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful home, exactly like the pictures. Host responded quickly to questions. We had everything we needed in the home, she had thought of everything- extra towels, toiletries, paper goods, coffee etc. Overall excellent find in Lexington!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay here. It was a great location for walking to restaurants and downtown. And convenient for getting to distilleries, a nature preserve and beautiful neighborhoods and historic sites. This was our first time in Lexington and we had a wonderful time. Avena was a great hostess and checked in to make sure everything was in order. Nothing but good things to say!"
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,Avena is a fantastic host!
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Clear instructions on getting in, very clean"
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great location, really cool home! Lots of street noise, but that's to be expected on a fairly busy street. Avena was very easy to communicate with and check-in/check-out was easy. If ever back in Lexington, I would definitely stay at one of Avena's places again!"
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Beautiful home in a very convenient location. Excellent host, clean, and stunning!"
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Our stay was great, no complaints! Arena was quick to respond when messaging."

Close to great restaurants and coffee shops
Will stay here again if in the area
Everything went smooth and the place was beautiful"
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We are locals but lost power due to a big windstorm and needed a place to stay with our two kids while we waited for it to be restored. Avena was super helpful and friendly and her place was a welcome respite in all of that chaos.
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Cute place! Really nice back porch and sitting area! Beautiful kitchen! Clean.
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,House is amazing. Very close to downtown yet not too busy
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Perfect place to stay in a historic part of Lexington.
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Very nice space that is even more beautiful in person. Avena was a great host and we would definitely love to stay next time we are in Lexington. The only thing that we wish was here was a microwave to reheat leftovers but we just used the oven and it wasn‚Äôt a huge deal. Would highly recommend.
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Pretty, spacious, clean, amenities thoughtfully prepared. Avena was very responsive. Enjoyed our stay."
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful home, such a perfect combination of elegance and coziness! Super comfortable beds. Great location for walking downtown, with many great restaurants very nearby. We'll be back!"
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I loved this place so much! It has so
Much personality and the decor is wonderful. I was comfortable and it was so clean. I loved the downtown location, I am a city girl. I felt safe and excited to be there. Avena has great style and it made it so much better than a cookie cutter Air BNB. Would love to stay here again and explore the area i bit. We used it as a stopping point and stayed two nights on the weekend. I don‚Äôt know what mattresses those are but I loved them. Again- what a charming place to stay!!!"
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This house was fabulous!! The architecture and decor were just beautiful. The beds were comfortable and the rooms are super spacious. There were a lot of little extra touches (chocolates, coffee, toiletries, etc) that made our stay special.
The location was perfect, walkable to all downtown Lexington has to offer. The neighborhood was safe. My daughter and I felt totally comfortable walking around, even at night.
Avena was a wonderful host. She was responsive and helpful. I would definitely stay here again!"
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Avena is a great host! She is easy to communicate with, kind and considerate. We very much enjoyed staying in her historic home, which was very comfortable and well designed/decorated with lots of nice touches. The home is in a great location for walking to all of the great restaurants, bars, coffee houses and shops that Lexington has to offer as well as UK sporting events. The private parking is great along with ample street parking. We will stay at Avena‚Äôs place again on our next visit to Lexington."
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Avena's Lexington home may be our new go-to location when we're in town. The home itself is beautiful, with walkable amenities, including a coffee shop, breakfast spots, Gratz park, Juliette market, and walking distance to the heart of downtown.
Beds were extremely comfortable, and unlike other reviewers, we didn't find noise to be an issue. Complete with parking for day-trips and easy check-in -- this place is a no brainer for booking. Check-out was as easy as check-in.
Most importantly, communication with Avena, even before booking - was a breeze. We're looking forward to our next stay in Lexington."
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The location of Avena's place is very walkable to downtown and nearby restaurants/breweries. The place was exactly as described and photographed. The outdoor space was a nice bonus as well!
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a wonderful stay at Avena's. The beds were very comfortable and there was plenty of space for relaxation on our girl's trip. Avena was on top of everything and was very accommodating. I will say that you can hear traffic noise in the front room as there is a stop light right outside. But as mentioned by another review, it quiets down overnight. A YouTube white noise video did the trick for me. The location is super walkable, only about 15 mins to downtown and even shorter for breakfast spots."
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"A perfectly enjoyable stay at this lovely, charming house. We loved it!"
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is the perfect location! We stayed here for a double header Lexington weekend of Keeneland and a night UK football game! This place is SO CUTE and has everything you‚Äôd need. So close to great dining (tons of good spots on Jefferson St) and many more. We loved staying here, would absolutely recommend and stay again!"

2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The house was great, it‚Äôs just as the pictures show. It‚Äôs updated and well decorated! The location is also perfect. It is right downtown and in an area we felt safe, and super close to restaurants and the venue we were using for the weekend!"
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"A lovely, old home (I have a soft spot for old homes) that has been decorated beautifully. The ceilings are at least 12 feet high! Downtown Lexington is just a few blocks away. We thoroughly enjoyed ourselves and I look forward to staying again."
2022-07-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"We had a great time in Lexington, there is tons of stuff to do there.
The house was very clean and the decor was so great. The location is very close to downtown and all the restaurants and a very short drive to the Horse Park.
The only con we had was that there is quite a bit of traffic noise at the house. It does quite down between 11-5 though."

2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I had a very unique stay at this location. While I was attending a theatre conference in town, a storm hit Lexington. This storm took the power out for the last 2 days of my stay. While this was inconvenient for myself, James did everything in his power to help me through the situation, giving me flashlights, lamps, & checking in on me frequently while I was there. All in all, despite the issues out of our control, I had a very amazing stay here, and would recommend this place to anyone wanting to travel to Lexington!"

2022-11-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,"The listing was advertised as the entire place and self check in. When I arrived the host asked me to call him. So I did. He then gave us a tour and purposefully tried to insult us as a ""joke"". We wanted self check in because I've stayed at plenty of airbnbs before and I know the jist of what to do and where things are as well as being socially uncomfortable. The entire night was extremely hot and I had to sleep in my car, and when I asked to turn the heat down for the next night. It was still very hot. The host did not give us instructions when leaving even when asked other than ""normal titying up"" which is very open to interpretation considering all other hosts I've stayed at have given very good detailed instructions on what needs to be done before checkout."
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Perfect location. Creek behind the property is good for birdwatching (ducks and herons). The host is welcoming. I won‚Äôt be back in the area anytime soon but if I do go back I know where to stay :)

2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"five stars, a very accommodating and friendly host. he is hard of hearing so sometimes you can hear him using the phone or TV from downstairs. it was minimal inconvenience for us as our hearing is not perfect ourselves. it may not be perfect for someone looking for a distraction free place to relax. James is a great host and we would stay here again if needed."
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"Completely satisfied! Accommodations were clean and comfortable, with new towels and bedding. Very considerate, generous host, providing everything we needed for our stay. We wouldn‚Äôt hesitate to stay again when visiting the area!"

He also gave us great restaurant suggestions and was overall a great guy to talk to. Would definitely stay here again."
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,Jim was a wonderful host.. available for any needs ‚Ä¶ yet we found that the place was furnished with everything we needed for our 11 day stay‚Ä¶ and did not need to call on him for anything besides a friendly greeting‚Ä¶ will definitely will be back

2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,James was awesome! I came for railbird festival and he even took me to the tracks one of the days - the shortage of uber/Lyft drivers made transportation tricky! The festival was a bust but his amazing hospitality and cute place made it worth it

He touched base with us on when I was arriving so he could give us a tour of the place and go over parking. He is a very sweet kind person which you don‚Äôt see much these days. His place is extremely well kept and very clean! The jacuzzi tub was amazing after a long day competing! Also you have a washer and dryer to use if needed, a fully functioning kitchen for cooking. Needless to say my future trips to Lexington will include a stay at James place. No more sketchy hotels ü•≥ü•≥ Thank you James for sharing your place and being a wonderful host!"
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Fabulous 1-bedroom basement apartment. Very clean, well-decorated, spacious, and easy drive to downtown. Host Jim is very friendly, great to chat with. He shows you how to use electronic gate and the best way to park in his driveway. We loved the private apartment with comfy chair swing on the patio. If you are a light sleeper, ear plugs are helpful, as you can hear Jim's TV upstairs through the ceiling vent in the bedroom. We'd definitely stay again if in the area."

2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,I stayed at this Airbnb for two months while completing a clinical rotation. It was very spacious and it had everything I needed for cooking and cleaning. It is a great location and is close to the mall and many restaurants. James is very kind and helpful!
2021-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Jim is a great host! He made sure I knew how everything worked (like the tub!

2021-01-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"My wife and I loved James's place so much that we extended our initial 2 weeks stay to nearly 2 months!

Overall, highly recommend for anyone who's stopping by in Lexington!"
2020-11-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Everything was good. Buetiful place and very comfortable bed
2020-11-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Overall, had a nice visit to Jim's place. I was visiting with my boyfriend on a long weekend to explore and do some hiking. It was spacious, had a fully stocked/functional kitchen, and comfortable bed. However, would probably not return. I prefer a more hands-off host and Jim was more involved. Also, Jim lives upstairs and I could clearly hear him just about the whole visit (e.g., talking on the phone, walking, watching TV, using the restroom). He is retired and was there most of the time we were. I did not feel like there was enough privacy, especially if you are visiting with your significant other. See below for a summary of my experience.
Pros
-Spacious for 2 people
-Fully stocked/functional kitchen
-Close to downtown/attractions
-Safe neighborhood
-Nicely decorated
-Comfortable bed
Cons
-Lack of privacy
-Noisy
-Hands-on host
-Low shower water pressure and jacuzzi was loud, did not function as hoped
-Parking was crammed (had a small area in the back that we had to back into)"
2020-11-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,This place was amazing clean big and great location you don‚Äôt need to bring anything but you clothes . I would say this is a 5 stars ‚≠êÔ∏è üåüüåüüåüüåü place
2020-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Jim was very kind and funny! Amazing place, very clean, very comfortable!"
2020-10-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Look: if I say too much, then all of you will go and book James's place out solid. Then, I won't get to stay there any more, which would distress me. So, I won't say that the place was perfect. Quaint. Extremely well cared-for. Great value. Every possible amenity. Great location and quiet. I especially won't mention that James was a fantastic host on all counts. But honestly, people should visit Lexington more often and try to stay at James's place. James's place is the paragon of why AirBnB makes travel so much better these days. Great price. Far better experience than any old hotel."
2020-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Jim's place was a wonderful spot for a weekend getaway! It was clean, comfortably furnished, simultaneously cozy and spacious, and well stocked with the necessities and some little touches that made the stay that much nicer. He was great about communicating, and is super friendly and hospitable. Also, the bed is super comfortable, and the room is dark and quiet. Got two of the best night's sleep I've had in weeks."
2020-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Returned to this charming property for a second time. Outstanding value and amenities with a very pleasing host. I will be back!
2020-09-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"Great as always! I work a lot of long hours when staying in town & a quiet, clean, comfortable, safe place is of utmost importance. It's easy in & out, ya don't have to bring as many clothes since there is a washer/dryer rgt off the kitchen. Full kitchen makes it great for convenience of eating in. Nice bathroom with a whirlpool tub, large mirror with great lighting & a seat for the ladies ! King size bed, very comfortable, extra blankets, pillows & sheets.
Will always look to stay here when in town!
Thanks Jim!"
2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Thoroughly enjoyed our stay with James! He gave us a tour of the place upon arrival and was just as nice as could be. The space was immaculate and smelled amazing! The bed was super comfortable and the bedroom is great for sleeping .. really dark! Loved it! The kitchen has everything you‚Äôd need to cook for yourself.

2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Jim Was Very Nice, Only A Phone Call away If you needed anything. I honestly felt Like I was At home. If I ever came back to kentucky Im coming back to the same Location Lol. Very Enthusiastic"
2020-08-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Jim‚Äôs place is very clean, charming, and inviting. We were very busy while we were in Lexington so we were really only around in the evenings. Jim would still check in daily to make sure our needs were taken care of. You can sometimes hear Jim upstairs since this is a basement suite. Otherwise this is a very nice home!"
2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"Jim's place was extremely clean and felt like home. It is also located in an excellent and convenient location. There is everything you could need within a walk or short drive!
His property and the apartment are all very spacious. Myself and a roommate stayed at his place for 2 months with no problems. Bathroom is spacious, kitchen is complete and has full laundry access!
Furthermore, Jim is awesome and an extremely friendly guy. He is always prepared to do anything for you, and is on top of providing anything you might need more of during your stay.
This place was great and had good value!"
2020-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place was a great fit for my needs. It was located in an safe, established neighborhood within 15 minutes of my conference location. The host was welcoming, friendly and helpful. Also expressed that any concerns or questions I had to please let him know. Being a basement apartment with parking just outside the entry way, it allowed me to not have to navigate any stairs. The space was comfortable and lots of pillows. I did love the jacuzzi tub! I even took my own scented bath salts to enjoy. I will definitely recommend to friends and family. This was a great first experience with Airbnb."
2020-02-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Great place and location and private. James is an excellent host and is very attentive to anything you may need during your stay.

2019-11-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"We enjoyed our stay at James's place these last 10 weeks. It was clean, nicely arranged and very comfortable! He was a super host and now a great friend. His location is a perfect spot to get to anywhere you want to go and yet away from noises and traffic and felt safe at all times. Will stay there anytime we are in the Lexington area! He will always meet any need or concern you might have about the place or the area."
2019-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,What a great place. It exceeded my cleanliness standards and offered every amenity imaginable. The setting was private and quiet and Jim‚Äôs hospitality was generous and welcoming. I would recommend this property and will definitely be back when I visit my Wildcat.
2019-09-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"-pros: size of the place, cleanliness, big tub with jets, location.
-cons: if the owner is home he will most likely be working on something outside which doesn‚Äôt leave much privacy, however if you stay inside this isn‚Äôt an issue.
Overall this was a pleasant stay, the value is certainly top notch."
2019-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We really enjoyed our stay at James's place. He met us to let us in and show us around then gave us the keypad code so we could come and go as we please. The space was clean and had everything we would have needed. We loved the location, a nice neighborhood close to a lot of restaurants and stores, not far from downtown Lexington, the airport and Keeneland. We would definitely stay here again!"
2019-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,James is a great host and all the time available for any questions you might have. His place is very clean in a quiet neighborhood.

2019-07-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,The other reviews saying it's even nicer than the pictures make it look are right. The space is very nice James as a great host. The jacuzzi tub was a blast (I'd never been in one before) and being able to do laundry on a work trip was really helpful. I saw at least one review say there wasn't a stove but I don't know if that's out if date or what because there was a very nice stove in the kitchen area along with all the pots and pans you'd need. Overall one of the best AirBNBs I've stayed at and I'll definitely be staying here again if or when I'm in Lexington again
2019-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay!
2019-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This apartment is beautiful, comfortable, and super clean. It was perfectly located for us and James was a great host. We enjoyed our stay and would definitely stay again if the opportunity arose."
2019-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Jim was a fantastic host. He's a very friendly guy, and his place is fantastic. Both my wife and I agreed that the bed was the best bed we've ever slept in. Would highly recommend to anyone."
2019-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Jim is a great and natural host! He was very eager to help us in anyway he could and provided all we needed for a great stay. His place is immaculate and bigger than the pictures suggest, and he gave us a welcome tour of where to find everything we'd need in the apartment when we got there. If you're looking for a hands-free host, that's not Jim. He embodies southern hospitality in his friendliness and enjoyed chatting with us when we ran into each other while coming or going from the house. We had a great week while we were in town for my husband's class at Asbury, and the location, cleanliness, comfort, and homey-ness of Jim's place had A LOT to do with it!"

2019-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"If you‚Äôre on the fence on this one...don‚Äôt be. The pictures don‚Äôt do it justice. The home is in a beautiful neighborhood. The driveway has an automatic gate and leads to the back, walkout basement which is where you‚Äôll stay. It was immaculate in terms of cleanliness. You have a full kitchen, large bathroom with jacuzzi tub and a large bedroom with a huge bed. Cable tv and WiFi rounded it all out and it was convenient to a lot of surrounding areas and restaurants. This was the best Airbnb I‚Äôve ever had and I would definitely recommend. James was an awesome host and always around or available if we needed something."
2019-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Clean. Beautiful furnishings Great neighborhood
2019-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place was so much nicer than the pictures suggested. Very spacious, quiet, beautifully decorated and very comfortable. James keeps his property impeccable.

2019-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The apartment was wonderful. It is professionally cleaned and immaculate. The location was great for going to Keeneland. The neighborhood was very quiet and super safe. Jim also has flood lights and an electronic gate to make you feel even safer.

The bed was incredibly comfortable (why did I sleep better here than at home?!), and we were happy to find a fridge and microwave. All photos were accurate, and there were additional little touches that were meaningful - we especially loved a handwritten book full of hidden gems from previous guests + a guest book of Lexington recommendations from Sherrie. As young women, we felt very safe at all hours here and the neighborhood is very safe. We would definitely stay again and recommend to friends!"

The bed was very comfortable and Sherrie went above and beyond with every little detail from a helpful guest manual to coffee and snacks.

The bedroom, bathroom, and closet were all extremely clean and were well-equipped with a microwave, fridge, Keurig, hair dryer, full-length mirror, and cozy bedding. I appreciated Sherrie taking a few minutes out of her day to chat with me and ask how I was doing whenever we saw each other. She is a very friendly host.

The room is a delight. Sherrie has thought of everything with little ‚Äúextras‚Äù and lovely touches of love and light.
This will be our ‚Äúgo to‚Äù place whenever we are down in Lexington from now on. It‚Äôs everything and more! Thank you, Sherrie for a stress free visit."

Host is very respectful so if you like your privacy, you'll have it.
I wish my stay had been in the summer because of the very nice pool !!
Family friendly/nice neighborhood as well. 10/10 !"

2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was perfect for what I needed - somewhere to sleep while visiting friends. I wasn‚Äôt at the bnb much except to sleep & it was perfect for that! Sherrie was great at communicating, had a nice binder with recommendations, & the place is super adorable!"
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Sherrie‚Äôs place is a little slice of perfection. Everything you could ask for in an Airbnb. Would recommend.

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was a great place to stay in Lexington. Centrally located, clean, cozy, and well decorated. The noise from the speakeasy below was not an issue for us. Worth noting we stayed during the week. We visited the speakeasy as well and it is intimate and not crowded or particularly loud. Earplugs and a sound machine were provided but we did not need them with the AC turned on."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Loved staying at Paige's place! Space was so beautiful and comfortable. HIGHLY recommend visiting the speakeasy downstairs (make a reservation)! So many other great walkable spots. We'll stay here again!
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great location close to downtown. Even though in downtown the urban noise was not noticeable. Highly recommend!

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Clean, charming, delightful - what you want every Airbnb to be!"
2024-04-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"The place itself was great. The only downside was that there is a bar on the first floor that we were not aware of when we booked. On the bright side, the bar closes at midnight (not too late). The bar is not excessively loud either, but slamming doors were a fairly common occurrence. Paige was very responsive and helpful throughout."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"STUNNING.
This space is SO beautiful, fun, well designed and has everything you need to feel right at home.
We loved our stay! The location is awesome, parking right at the front is so handy. We did not get to try the speakeasy BUT it looks so cool from the outside.
You can walk to all the fun spots and can walk up the road to a custom hat making shop (Tony is so friendly and talented!!)
Definitely staying here again!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Overall, this stay was fantastic. The place was one of the nicer AirBnB's I have stayed in. Very well equipped and beautifully decorated. Our host was the best: always messaging, responsive, and even let me come back to find something I left behind.
Couple small watch-outs that didn't bother us. The living room is extremely well lit up and night due to neighbors security lights (with the blinds shut, it still felt a bit like daylight). However, the bedroom was plenty dark. There is a bar on the first floor producing a touch of noise. Nothing that a sound machine (which the host provided) would block out. You have to remember you're in a city, so there's going to be noise. It felt after 11pm the noise was gone each night. Again, didn't bother us.
In summary, I highly recommend this spot! Perfect stay for a quick trip to Keeneland."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Space was perfect. Clean, modern, simple.
Paige was quick to respond. Thank you.
We had a large vehicle and the parking space was big enough to accommodate."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Paige was a fantastic host--she is very responsive and proactive. The loft was exactly as pictured and pristinely clean! I looked forward to returning to the cozy Airbnb to relax after a long day of adventure. The guide Paige has curated has the most amazing recommendations. You can easily recognize the love and attention Paige has put into her beautiful Airbnb.
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Paige‚Äôs place is a true hidden gem. The speakeasy is a little loud, but we used the noise machine provided and never heard anything after going to bed. The place is a true delight and I can‚Äôt wait to stay again. My daughter and I loved, loved staying there. It is quaint, clean and well maintained. We actually requested an additional night because we enjoyed it so much!!! Thank you, Paige!"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,I've stayed here multiple times and will continue to book when available! Great place to stay in Lexington and make sure you check out the speakeasy below!!

2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Overall, the stay was wonderful! My boyfriend and I stayed here since it was a close walk to Rupp Arena! The place looked exactly like the photos and was very nice!
The host Paige was clear with instructions and welcoming and friendly when communicating.
If you are looking for a nice place to stay in downtown Lexington, I highly recommend! Lots of great spots for food and things to go check out and see!
Great experience and I will be back!"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Lovely one bedroom in great Lexington location. Super clean--including refrigerator and drawers, which often harbor crumbs! Lots of great touches, including earplugs (although it wasn't loud when we stayed). Only neutral point is living/kitchen areas are bright at night due to lights outside windows, but this place is definitely a great deal."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We really loved this place! It had such character and the amenities and furnishings were great! Having a speakeasy right downstairs was an absolute bonus!

We come to Lexington quite often and will definitely want to stay here again!
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Such a lovely place to stay in Lex....walk to most everything downtown!!!
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The loft is absolutely beautiful! We enjoyed the air bnb itself as much as we loved walking around in Lexington. Its proximity to great food and drink spots is a huge plus! Everything went super smoothly with booking and check-in, and the owner even reached out to us to offer early check-in, which was great. The address doesn‚Äôt take you right to the location, you have to drive a bit further down the street, but the owner gave us valuable tips and directions to get there as well as provided good photos of the outside of the residence. I highly recommend spending a few nights here the next time you‚Äôre in Lexington. Would definitely stay again!"
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My wife and I have stayed in many AirBnb‚Äôs, immediately she tells me, ‚Äúthis is a top 3‚Äù.
I would have to agree. The location is spot on and it‚Äôs so cozy! Being right above the speakeasy was awesome! If you are in the LEX area this is the ultimate spot! The parking spot you get is perfect and I could just go on!
10/10!!"
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Wonderful stay for first time visit in Lexington. We walked everywhere. Paige‚Äôs communication was clear, helpful and she was always responsive. We didn‚Äôt have any issues to report. We had everything we needed. The sliding door for the bedroom is very easy to open, just be cautious, it can be done using a few fingers. The space is bright and comfortable. Great place for launching the day and winding down in the evening."
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Best place to stay in LEX!!!
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Paige‚Äôs place was incredible! Everything was beautiful inside the unit. She was very responsive if we had issues or questions. We even got to go to the speakeasy downstairs which made the experience that much better. There is slight noise from it but it did not bother us at all. She also provided earplugs and a sound machine. We will definitely be back
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Quaint and cozy! The cottage is within a short distance to some of our favorite restaurants (Carson‚Äôs and Epping‚Äôs). Paige was responsive any time we had questions. We will be returning if ever visiting the Lexington area.
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Very cute hidden gem near downtown Lexington. It‚Äôs walking distance to coffee shops and bars, so it‚Äôs really convenient.

2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Paige's place is even nicer than her description! It really is a ""home"" not a rental. All the furnishings and finishes are very high end. This is a top-notch place. I wish I could mover her place to every city I visit! She was very friendly, responsive and answered all my questions. Her place had everything you could need. I cannot speak highly enough of her home. You will not be disappointed."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"One of the best places to stay in the Downtown area of Lexington, 5 to 10 min walk to everything you want or need!!! The parking spot in front of the entrance sets this place apart from most downtown locations! The unit is clean and very well decorated, the bed is insanely comfortable, if youre a light sleeper, you may hear the occasional city or speakeasy noise but it is nothing ton detract from this beautiful place!! Do yourself a favor and book already!!"

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Really solid location, walkable to the booze and entertainment areas of lexington"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"If you're gonna be visiting downtown Lexington, you owe it to yourself to stay here. Paige was fantastic to work with, clear in her communication, and we love when we get the feeling a host genuinely cares that you have a great trip. Paige does. This was our fourth Airbnb experience and I would never rate a host any higher than i've rated Paige. If she'd have us, we'd absolutely stay again.
With her downtown loft you'll get quick access to much of the downtown, private parking, and a great jumping off point for local adventures. Her place is clean and well appointed. We had no issues while here and would certainly stay again."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,amazing space in a great location!
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We loved our stay in Lexington at this cute little loft. Paige made our trip easy as she is kind, responsive, and helpful!
The place is clean and inviting, and just like the photos!
Most of Lexington‚Äôs treasured downtown spots are within comfortable walking distance. We would definitely stay again!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We loved this place! So much natural light and nice touches in the home. Very comfortable and clean, and we played one of the games provided. Paige had great communication and provided plenty of recommendations. The digital guestbook was great! We had a great time at the speakeasy downstairs where the staff was also very nice. We were able to walk to coffee in the mornings right across the street and had a nice stroll downtown as well. Very convenient to everything we wanted to do including distilleries, wineries, distillery district, etc. Highly recommend this stay, and if we are in Lexington again we will try to book again. Thanks Paige!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The loft was very conveniently located in downtown Lexington. the beautifully decorated apartment is above a speakeasy so there will be some background noise but us not noticeable to most people - I just happen to have more sensitive hearing.
Paige's anticipated everything in loft and was ever so gracious to ask if we needed an early check-in. I would've had to ask in other places.
Two things to be aware of in an urban setting:
1. Soup kitchen at entrance of alley from MLK side vs. on Limestone side.
2. Expect delays getting to unit on weekdays around 3p when school pick up stacking in alley.
These were FTI only and does not take away from our stay."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was somehow better than the pictures. Clean, airy, and so nice my coworkers who tried to talk up their expensive hotel rooms came up short. I was offered a job in procurement booking rooms. It was that good."

2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We stayed at Paige‚Äôs place for two nights and the place was beautiful. I actually manage a cleaning company and the place was in perfect condition and when we got there it looked like no one has ever been inside. We felt right at home it was nice that she provided things we may have forgotten like a toothbrush or ect. Check in and check out was super easy and Paige was super responsive. We loved Lexington and will definitely be back!
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"My stay at Paige's Airbnb was absolutely perfect from start to finish. It is as beautiful in person as it was in photos. It's a serene loft with gorgeous natural light and a decor style throughout that made it a delight to return home to each day. She had thought through every detail - providing laundry pods, dishwasher pods, extra shampoo and conditioner, lotion, spices for cooking, ample pots/pans/storage containers, and the thoughtful touch of fresh flowers! It's location was also prime - directly across from a lovely coffee shop and right beside a delicious brunch cafe. In terms of cleanliness upon arrival, it was spotless! And lastly, Paige's communication throughout was incredibly appreciated. She checked in to ensure my stay was the best it could be on a routine basis. I cannot recommend Paige's Airbnb enough and I hope to return very soon! Thank you, Paige!"

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great place to stay while visiting Lexington!
2024-06-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Dalton's place had many pluses: excellent location, easy access from/to interstate, great restaurants nearby, very good and comfy mattresses, water pressure in showers excellent, washer and dryer very convenient to have, plentiful supply of coffee pods, creamer, tea bags, dishwasher pods, etc. Dalton was very accessible and quick to respond to queries. There was a small plumbing issue and he fixed it very quickly.
The main downside we noted was a general lack of upkeep. It looked as if some details were being neglected. An example that many renters would find impacted their stay : -the hot tub was much too chlorinated and treated (we have a hot tub and home and carry test strips, so we could tell it was off the charts on chemicals). I think the place just needs a bit of an upgrade.
However, we DID enjoy our stay and absolutely found Dalton to be helpful and responsive."

2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"This very comfortable home was one of the nicest AirBNBs we have stayed at. It was a lovely combination of being attractive and clean as well as practical. Everything was easy to use, worked and had things like good lighting, electrical outlets for charging, garage parking. We were there in January so we did not get to enjoy the back yard but we went for walks in the neighborhood to the walking path. This house was a perfect layout for us - 2 private bedrooms each with their own bath. It was close to what we needed and everyone in our party was happy. Dalton was super responsive. We would definitely stay here again."

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We all enjoyed our time in KY at this home. We loved having a fire pit and hot tub to use! We were able to walk to dinner and yet it was extremely quiet that we were able to stay outside all evening. Many things to use in the kitchen for our pregame prior to KY vs Mizzou football game. Our welcome book was also very handy for local hot spots! 5 stars all around!
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My wife and I were recently married and looking for a quick getaway after our wedding. We typically visit Lexington each year as my wife attended UK.

The house was nice, but I felt like it was priced a bit high and could have used some additional housekeeping. Overall it was a good experience, but I think a couple improvements could make it great."

We walked to dinner (Harry‚Äôs)and the ice cream place he suggested. It was fun.
Wish we would not have had reservations at another house because we liked Daltons house better than the one we rented for the remainder our trip. The neighborhood was safe enough that I could go for a long walk in the morning. Pleased with everything."

2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The house was so cozy and the garage was an absolute LIFESAVER through the record breaking snow in Lexington! They even went above and beyond to have the driveway scraped so that I stood a chance of getting to/from work at the hospital safely. Drakes, Malones, and Double Dogs are right in the backyard‚Ä¶the location couldn‚Äôt be better!"
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We really enjoyed our stay in Lexington, KY!!
The property was extremely clean with all the essential amenities. The interior decor was a great touch as well. Also, there's plenty of restaurants and shops nearby. I would definitely books again. 5-stars"
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Awesome place just seconds from dining and shopping. Such a perfect location!!!! Place was super clean and they left great things in the house for guests.
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"5 stars for this rental! We couldn't be happier with our visit. I am actually from Lexington but live out of town. We came in town to visit my parents for the holidays and since we now have a 2-year-old, thought it would be best to get our own space. That was the best decision we could have made. This beautiful house is in the middle of Hamburg and is walking distance to all the shopping your heart can desire. It's located on a very quiet residential street and we felt very safe. With regard to cleanliness, the place was immaculate. I'm a germaphobe by nature but felt very comfortable here and didn't have to worry about unsanitary conditions. The decorations were modern and cute and I loved that the kitchen was very well appointed with everything we could need, including extra trash bags and dishwasher detergent, which you usually have to purchase yourself in other airbnb's. I also loved that we had use of the garage to park our car, which was an extra ""plus."" My only tiny critique is that there wasn't an abundance of seating in the living room. When my parents came over to visit, my dad ended up sitting on the floor because there wasn't enough space for the 4 adults and a baby to sit. Other than that small issue, everything else was absolutely perfect. We are strongly considering staying here every time we come to town, especially since it was very reasonably priced. Thank you for a fantastic stay!"
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Amazing! Would stay here again!
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,definitely would stay there again

Easily accessible location that is relatively close to a variety of Lexington area spaces/venues."

2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Good little place , thank you we enjoy it"
,,,"I had to leave this place because the landlord made me feel very uncomfortable. First when I arrived he told me that he will have access to the basement because the laundry room is in there, I wasn‚Äôt happy about that but I said ok for once a week and he said he‚Äôll come in the morning while I‚Äôm away . I also realized that the description says ‚Äúfull kitchen‚Äù but there were nothing else than a crockpot , microwave and toaster .the next day I bought a cooktop then the landlord asked me why did I bought a coocktop so I asked him why did you come to the basement , did you do your laundry ? He said NO , I was just checking stuffs. It made me feel very uncomfortable but I didn‚Äôt say anything to him again . Then one day , I came back from work and realized again that he came to the basement to check out stuff as I saw he replaced the hand soap in the bathroom. Well , for a single woman who rented a private place I felt that it was very creepy that a man can come as he wish and check my stuff in my bathroom and who else where ... I texted him and told him that I wasn‚Äôt happy and wanted to keep my privacy and he just replied right away : K
I had enough so I called Airbnb, the lady I talked to told me that it was unacceptable that a landlord can have access and comes and go while you renting his place. They reimbursed me then I canceled the rest of my trip at his place."
