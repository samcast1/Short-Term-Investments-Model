2024-06-01,4,Stayed one night,"Great place to stay for visiting Death Valley. Convenient location in Pahrump (10 min from wal mart, restaurants, etc), quiet private location. Instructions clear and very very responsive. The only thing I would say is that the shower head kind of shoots water in every direction, and is definitely a bit intense when you initially turn it on haha. However, it is an easy fix and we were only there for a night so it wasn’t a big deal. Would definitely stay here again if I come back. Would recommend!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Cute little place in the north part of town. Quiet, peaceful and it was a great stay."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,A very convenient place to stay if you’re travelling to DV. Everything was as was detailed in the pictures and description. The bed in the loft was comfy! Would definitely recommend.
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,What we needed after Death Valley
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Great place to stay that’s easily accessible to Death Valley NP. I was able to keep my dogs cool inside while at the park for the day. Super neat little casita set up.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Well located if going to Death Valley and Michael was very responsive
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My brother and I were traveling to see Death Valley National Park and Michael's spot was the perfect spot to stay for visiting. The area was clean and had everything we needed. The location was perfect for getting to the park as well as getting everything we needed down the road. If you're wanting to see Death Valley, Michael's place is the perfect spot!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,We felt very comfortable at Michael's place and it was all clean. The kitchen is very well equipped with everything you need for cooking!
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great communication! Place was exactly as described and the location was great.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Lovely airbnb!
It was so cozy and perfect stay for someone wanting to go to Death valley. hosts were friendly, communicative and accommodating. We had a great time staying here!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We enjoyed to stay at the cozy loft and the location was perfect to visite death valley.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Location is really beautiful, we had great stay here."
2024-03-01,4,Stayed one night,"Nice place to stay! I would say as a dog person that the 3 large dogs were harder to control when entering the gate of the property. There is a small furnace that doesn’t produce much heat which made the loft area pretty cold. The oven didn’t work when I was there which made last minute dinner changes. That said, it was very close to the national park and a secure place."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,Great place to stay not too far outside of Death Valley. Town had cheap gas and the casita was peaceful and quiet.
2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,Clean/cozy tiny home… feels safe being on the owner’s property as well. I arrived late and had no issues getting in (instructions were clear). Fantastic value and better/cheaper than most hotel rooms. All around solid and glad I stayed here for a night’s rest before heading out to Death Valley National Park.
2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,This Casita was so cute and exactly as described. Very comfortable bed.
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Great little place cozy for 2, with our 2 pups. Everything was well thought out. Anything you need to cook to save on eating out. The bathroom was perfect with plenty of linens. Really a great spot if you’re looking to head into Death Valley National Park!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Perfect place to stay while exploring death valley. the fridge came in clutch to stock some foods to eat when we got back from hiking
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This was a great location for us and we enjoyed our stay!
2024-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"Michael's place was perfect for my group of 4. Well located between Vegas and Death Valley, and within close proximity to the town center. The place was exactly as described. Michael and his team was also very responsive and helpful in answering any queries. We dropped something at their place, but his team was very accommodating in arranging for us to collect our item the next day. Highly recommend his place!"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Had everything we needed
2024-01-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Quiet place
2023-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"This spot was perfect. Being able to get to it from death valley no problem and also michaels helpful suggestions of where to eat was spot on. Arriving at the cabin was easy and instructions clear. It was cozy, warm and if you want to rest up after a long day of driving and hiking this spot is great. Check out was very simple and would stay here again."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed one night,Clear and easy instructions to follow. Thank you!
2023-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"Michael’s place is very convenient if you’re visiting Death Valley. There aren’t so many places to stay there, so we were happy to find his loft that was well equipped for what we needed for our 1 night stay."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This place was a great stop just outside Death Valley National Park. For a smaller space, it comfortably fit 4 adults (2 couples) and a small dog. Had all the amenities we needed for a quick stay, would recommend for anyone coming through the area on a road trip or other quick trip!"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed one night,This place was perfect for my quick trip to Death Valley National Park!
2023-12-01,4,Stayed with a pet,"We stayed here during our trip to Death Valley. The location is fantastic for proximity to the park and it was easy to find, however it's a rural area and the neighbors have a rooster that will wake you up around 4am.
If you are planning on using the kitchen please know that it lacks basic necessities that most Airbnbs provide such as a spatula, non-stick cooking spray, aluminum foil, or spices beyond salt and pepper.
During our stay the oven/stove broke, but the host was nice enough to allow us to use the oven in the main house and brought us a hot plate which worked out fine. Some of our vegetables froze solid while in the refrigerator so that was a bummer for dinner. Washing our dishes in the kitchen sink was tricky as the water sometimes took over 5 minutes to get hot.
It's great if you just need a place to crash and don't plan on using the kitchen much. We would stay here again but would go out to eat for every meal."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,Place was nice and well maintained. The amenities were abundant to the price paid.
2023-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"This is my first time staying at this location. It is so cute and very comfy. This was a last-minute booking the host's communication was excellent.
Will stay again."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Highly recommend staying here! Very affordable, close to restaurants and an easy hour drive into Death Valley park! Had everything we needed and the bed was very comfortable!"
2023-12-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"This is a great place to stay for a trip to Death Valley! The reason for 4 stars is because the oven was not functional, which was found out after having already purchased food that required an oven. Michael did offer the alternative of using an oven in a different occupied property on-site, but this felt uncomfortable. I feel this should've been mentioned beforehand. Other than this, the space was clean and the bed was comfortable. Michael was responsive and friendly too."
2023-12-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Micheal has 3 Airbnb’s on his property. The cozy loft and 2 RV trailers. We rented the cozy loft however upon arrival another couple had occupied it. Michael addressed the situation by asking the couple to move to the RV that they had rented. They refused to move. Michael gave us the choice of taking the RV at a discount or getting a full refund . We decided to stay in the RV. The RV was very clean and had everything we needed. It was warm and comfy. Our only concern was that the 2 big dogs on the property charged us twice barking. In the dark it was scary but once we saw them in the daylight they seemed friendly enough.
Overall we had a good stay even though we were disappointed we didn’t get the loft we rented and that human beings can be so rude as to occupy a place they didn’t rent and refuse to move. Hopefully a lesson was learned and this won’t happen to another guest. Michael did the best he could considering the circumstances."
2023-11-01,3,Stayed a few nights,"Great views, clean house, but it can get really cold in winters because the AC was comparatively small for the entire house."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed one night,Great host! Clear instructions and nice house!
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,This place was perfect for us visiting Death Valley!
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,"My wife and I stayed here with our 15 month old after visiting Death Valley National Park. This was a perfect place for us since it was close to town and not too far from the park. The house was very clean and well equipped. The hot water was a little tricky to figure out, but we got it working with no issues. Great place to stay and the dogs are very friendly!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"My son and I and our two dogs stayed at the Casita which fit the bill perfectly for our trip. His instructions were clear and easy to follow. The casita was clean, quiet, well stocked kitchen and very comfortable. Michael was responsive and very accommodating about our dogs and his dogs. Thanks!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Great place to stay and great hosts highly recommend
2023-11-01,3,Stayed a few nights,Reservation was for my wife & I. Our son & his wife dropped us off because we didn’t have our own car. They had their own accommodations across town. Michael wrongly assumed 4 of us were staying and attempted to charge for 4 people without first asking. We feel he could have handled this better instead of him jumping to the wrong conclusion right away. Our 1st experience/interaction with an Airbnb could have been better.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"Michael's place was as depicted. Check-in was easy. The hot tub was a great amenity. Only thing to note was that the shower water temperature was VERY temperamental. I'm sure it has to do with heating up water that's very cold. Not a major issue, just an fyi."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Michael was always responsive, and immediately dealt with issues that came up. I appreciate being moved to a different space in order for me to enjoy my stay while repairs were needed.
The space is private, well kept, and was the perfect sanctuary for my stay. Thanks again."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My fiancé and I stayed here to explore Death Valley. It was a very easy drive to/from and has beautiful views. The hosts are very friendly and we enjoyed spending some time with them and their 3 dogs. They gave us great recommendations via text and in a binder. We used the fire pit which was great and enjoyed the campfire under the stars nightly. There are many places to get firewood around.
My fiancé is terrified of heights but was able to go up the ladder to the loft with some encouragement. There is a futon that converts to a full sized bed as an alternative.
The TV has any network you want to connect to (Netflix, Hulu, Amazon Prime,etc) your personal account. He also supplied us with waters, coffee and other essentials.
The gas station, restaurant and family dollar are nearby but does not negatively affect the views, stay, safety or comfort level. Overall we had a wonderful time and absolutely recommend staying here."
2023-10-01,4,Stayed one night,Place was very beautiful cozy and cute! Love a tiny home so that was great! Only thing that was difficult is trying to see where it was there’s no clear instruction on how to get to the tiny house nor photos of what the outside looked like had to go based off what door looked like and find it myself but other then that we loved our stay!
2023-10-01,5,Stayed over a week,Great place to stay. Has everything you need.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"Very nice stay at Michael’s. We had a little problem with the hot water and he managed to handle it directly and repair the breakdown.
The place is nice, next time we will definitely try the hot tub :-)"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,We stayed at Michael's place for one night. I think he should add pictures of the outside of the building. The shower got cold on my husband a few times but when I showered it was fine. Overall it was a great place to rest our heads for the night. We felt very safe with the security system.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Good place yo conduct a webinar from
2023-09-01,4,Stayed one night,Great communicative hosts! Thank you!

2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great spot if you’re visiting Death Valley or Red Rocks!
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,We really appreciate Michael for letting us rent out his listing & I was able to bring my cats (it was really hard finding places who accept them!). He made us feel very comfortable with our first renting on here! Everything was really nice & peaceful! Would definitely recommend for a small getaway.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Felt right at home. We got in late the first night and I was wrapped in relief when I opened the door. It was so comforting. Everything was nice and clean. Pool was cool and clean. I didn’t want to go back home, to say the least 🩵"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,Beautiful little place. Perfect and cozy!!!
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My husband and I stayed here on the first leg of our honeymoon. Michael’s cabin was the perfect spot between Vegas and Death Valley. We enjoyed the space, amenities, and views! Michael was super helpful and proactive. He gave us great food recommendations for the area. It was a perfect distance to Death Valley and the pool was a great way to cool off from the July temps!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,Convenient location near Death Valley NP and great local restaurant recommendations!
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"It was a wonderful place to stay on our cross country travels. If you’re visiting Death Valley, it’s only 50 or so minutes away, and it is so nice! 10/10 recommend!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The tiny house was very comfortable and clean. The kitchen was well equipped so we could cook all our meals by ourselves.

2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Very cozy cottage with clean, well-equipped kitchen."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This place is so cute. The stay was comfortable, the only suggestion I would say is to stabilize the ladder better and have the BBQ cleaned and ready to go. we had to leave to BBQ at our friend's. Other than that I would recommend staying here again ."
2023-06-01,4,Stayed with a pet,The place was easy to get to and cozy like the description stated.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,We had a wonderful stay. It was very clean and comfortable. We were just too tired to use the hot tub or pool but both looked amazing. Easy drive from Death Valley. Close to town to replenish necessities and gas before heading back to the park. There were plenty of great restaurants close by.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,My cousin and I booked this spot hours before we checked in and Michael was super accommodating!
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"We had a great stay at Mike’s guest house! The little home was very charming and had everything we needed. The decoration and photos were spot on. Mike was super responsive, which was another big plus."

2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"we stayed here before going to death valley. it was a nice drive! we like the Thai restaurant My Thai that Michael recommended. Check it out if you like Thai food!
The stairs to the loft bed are not the most sturdy and it was hot in the loft. This was communicated in advance. No worries, we slept on the futon which pulls out to a full sized bed.
overall pleasant stay and good value."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,My husband and I went for the annual Red Apple firework festival and stayed there for the weekend. The place was nice and spotless! Everything was clean and organized! Also very clear and easy instructions on how to check in! The place was super cute and comfortable! Would definitely stay there again!
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"An excellent, clean space that is perfect to getting into Death Valley, especially if you don’t want to pay more to stay in Beatty and you have dogs."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Michaels stay was perfect for our quick getaway to Death Valley! From the comfy loft bed to the private little fire pit, we felt we had everything we needed, plus a few special touches. If we had been able to stay longer, the kitchen would have really come in handy!"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,Lovely place!
2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,Loved this cozy tiny house! It had a beautiful view of the desert mountains. Sitting in the hot tub and viewing the stars was a great experience.
2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"My fiancé and I stayed at Michael’s place during our trip to Death Valley and had a great time! Michael was very responsive and friendly over messages and even offered several suggestions of things to do in the area. The house itself was very clean, tidy, and very cozy! The location was great too, within an hour of Death Valley and close to restaurants and grocery stores."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"Such a great stay, definitely recommend."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,Exactly as described. Very clean. Perfect location to explore Death Valley National Park.
2023-04-01,4,Stayed one night,We enjoyed our stay at Michael’s! There was a hiccup with the code for the alarm not working but they were on the property and came to help deactivate right away. The inside was clean and had all the essentials for a tiny house. Was a great home base for exploring Death Valley. The only thing we didn’t love was there were a lot of loud barking dogs on the surrounding properties so it felt a bit uncomfortable to sit outside and star gaze as we had hoped to do. The hot tub and pool are shared by Michael and his family and so we got to chat with them while we used the hot tub and they were friendly and welcoming. Would recommend this place for an affordable place while exploring the area.
2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,Very cute tiny house with everything needed for a quick overnight in Pahrump.

2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We had a wonderful stay! This was a great base to explore Death Valley National Park. Highly recommend waking up early and driving to Zabriskie Point for sunrise. The space had everything we needed for a comfortable and cozy stay. It was an easy drive into town to get groceries at Smith's or to eat out. I appreciated the local recommendations Michael provided (Johnny's Tacos was delicious)! Check in was easy and flexible. Would stay again :)
2023-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"My friend and I really enjoyed our stay in this charming space. It was super clean, spacious, comfortable, and very affordable! Michael was a great host and was super responsive. We will definitely be back when/if we come back to explore Death Valley NP again!"

2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Michael’s tiny home in Pahrump was great! It honestly feels bigger on the inside than it looks from the outside! It was the perfect distance between Las Vegas and Death Valley. The soace was spotless and had all the amenities you could need. We even chose to stay in and cook a full dinner on one of the nights, and everything they had was perfect! They gave us some great closeby recommendations and were extremely responsive. 5 stars!"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This airbnb was just as described and extremely clean with super helpful and friendly hosts. An excellent choice for those adventuring to Death Valley or around Parhump! It's in a nice location in a quiet part of Parhump and easy to get anywhere with local amenities nearby. We would definitely stay here again.

2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Incredibly responsive host, clean place. I'm a female solo traveller and I felt extremely at home / safe here. So tiny and cute! I'll come back whenever I want to visit Death Valley."
2023-02-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"A cabin nice and clean in the backyard of Michael's house. A good fit for two persons for a few days stay if your are going to spend some time for example in Death Valley National Park.
The cabin is well equipped with what you need for a short stay. Nice and comfortable bed situated on a loft. Kitchen table with two chairs was a little bit too tight to the ladder leading up to the loft.
However all in all a good choice considering the price and the comfort we got."

2023-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"Immaculate and cozy space. The shower’s temperature control was nice, as well as it becoming hot in no time. With our stay in the winter, the heater was reliable at keeping us comfortable throughout our stay. My partner was also very comfortable from the accommodation(s) made by the host on the bedding, for his skin sensitivity. I highly recommend The Hubb if you want a friendly and humble local’s feel!"
2023-01-01,5,Stayed one night,Quaint and cozy space that was great for one night after a Death Valley day trip
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Wow! What a beautiful home and a great place to stay if you’re visiting Death Valley NP. It was extremely clean, cozy, and the wifi worked perfectly. Absolutely would stay again next time I visit the area.

2022-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Cute spot to stay near Death Valley / Mt Charleston - fenced area for dogs and hot tub. Would recommend!
2022-12-01,5,Stayed one night,It’s a nice place and very convenient for food and gas station!

2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Awesome little private loft perfect for to use as home base to visit Death Valley National Park. Located right off the main road to the park, this spot is 40 minutes from the park and 10 minutes from all of the food and coffee Pahrump has to offer. Also has a gas station only a 2 minute drive away. Those hosts were extremely respensive and helpful, and the hot tub was great to soak in after a long day in the park hiking and exploring."
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place was great! As close as you can be to Death Valley without being in the park, and fantastic mountain/sunset views. Was clean, and the hosts had excellent communication: always responded to my questions quickly and were very helpful."
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place was so great as a hub for a Death Valley NP visit. It was quiet and quaint, sat by the fire every night. Michael and Gustavo were great and responsive hosts, had delicious food recommendations, and the neighbors are so kind as well. The tiny house had all the amenities I needed and was very clean and prepared for travelers. I’d stay here again in a heartbeat!"

2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"A super handy air bnb for exploring nearby Death Valley. Clean, comfortable, and easy. Communication wss good and the restaurant recommendations were all hits."
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place was great, the room we booked had a Jacuzzi inside! And possibly the best bed/bed frame I’ve ever seen (think thick Victorian dark wood pillars).
The hosts were lovely, very accommodating. They explained everything for us when we arrived and made sure we knew where everything was and what we could use (there was a super well stocked kitchen).
Although you would be booking one room in a house in which they are hosting multiple Airbnb guests, it still works really well. The place has a hostel-ish vibe in the common area where you can chat to other guests. I had the good fortune of meeting a very interesting chap and we chatted deep into the evening.
The hosts even helped us with a reservation in another room of their house when we needed a last minute extra night in Pahrump.
10/10 I would definitely stay here again. I’m sure you’ll enjoy it too."

2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Michael’s AirBNB was in fact a unique loft.
Exterior-wise, the loft is surrounded by beautiful mountains & hills creating a beautiful scenery. Additionally, it offers peace and quiet due to its location in relation to Parhump.
Interior-wise, the loft is clean. Its utilities (water, lighting, & AC) all functioned exceptionally and were well appreciated by us especially after a long day of hiking and exploring.
Last but not least, Michael is a great host! He gives great recommendations for nearby restaurants and cafe that were great. Michael responds quickly and provides clear instructions that allowed our trip to go as smoothly as possible. We had even met some neighbors on our way to exploring and they were extremely friendly as well.
Overall this was a great experience that we enjoyed! If you are looking for an affordable place for some peace & convenience when planning to visit Vegas, Death Valley, etc. we highly recommended Michael’s AirBNB!"

2022-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,Loved staying at this tiny home. Super clean and really spacious for a tiny house. Kitchen and bathroom are really big for a tiny house too. Great hosts too. They even had a pool! Will stay there again next time we are in Pahrump.

2022-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"This is a cute tiny home with a loft that is not for the person's with a fear of heights or doesn't have a sense of adventure. All the basics were covered and a nice shower. Plus if you like Thai food make sure to eat at My Thai, Max the owner is a hoot! The food is fabulous!"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Only giving this place two thumbs up because I only have two thumbs up to give! Amazing spot and absolutely beautiful to star watch at night! This place is a steal!
2022-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"Michael is a great host who responds extremely quickly. We really liked the accommodation in Pahrump. It was quiet very private and we could even go into the pool. The kitchen was very well appointed and the bed was comfortable. However, we have a small criticism: we found a lot of animal hair on the floor (partly whole bushes), on the bath rugs and on a blanket that we had taken out of the closet when we were cold on the sofa. For someone with animal hair allergies, it might be difficult. But since we don't have an allergy, it was still okay. We would come back any time because we felt very comfortable and the place was very comfortable."
2022-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Very clean and easy to access. All amenities function perfectly and very scenic views if you like mountains, sunrises and sunsets."

2022-06-01,4,Stayed one night,Very clean and nicely furnished. The bed is a little short for someone of average height and stairs are quite steep so not recommended for who is scared of heights!
2022-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"An amazing gem of an air bnb, massive on the inside and very responsive. 10/10 would stay again."
2022-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great little base before heading to Death Valley. We didn’t know how to use the oven and were assisted super quickly!

It was clean, had all the basic necessities, and Michael was a very kind host (with food local restaurant recommendations as well!)!

2022-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Perfect little place for what we needed! My fiancé and I plus our pupparoo were on our way back to SLC from a trip down the California coastline and needed a place to stop for the night outside of Las Vegas. We intended to visit Death Valley because of the proximity but ended up skipping it. Still, this unique stay was conveniently located, super clean and cute, we actually chose to sleep downstairs on the futon (rather than in the bed up in the loft) and it was comfortable enough! The shower was nice as well. Comfortable temperature and cool enough although it was 100+ degrees outside. We brought firewood to use in the fire pit and we were welcome to use the hot tub as well, but we were too tired after a long day of driving. The view of the stars was incredible, though! Michael had clear instructions and was very communicative."
2022-05-01,5,Stayed with a pet,The unique loft was simple but perfect for us. It is perfectly located between Death Valley NP & Valley of Fire State Park. The neighbors/ other renters were very respectful of each other & the housing was so lovely. We would stay here again!
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Surprisingly spacious for it being a shed. The bed is SUPER soft and comfortable. Amazing view of the mountains, but it’s incredibly dark at night and incredibly hot during the day. Overall it was an amazing Airbnb."
2022-05-01,5,Stayed one night,Cute little home perfect for a short stay. Nice views of the surrounding area and the pool and hot tub was a great addition!

2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Very good experience with this stay. very clean, definitely unique, and close to Pahrump attractions and Death Valley. Michael provided good suggestions on where to go inside the park, where to get souvenirs, and where to eat. He was super responsive to messages. I had no issues checking in or with the stay. I will say that the ladder to the loft is interesting, and may not be the place to stay if you have clumsy proclivities. Overall great experience."
2022-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This place was great. I was able to bring my wife, infant, and two small dogs with us, and we all fit comfortably. It's Less than an hour away from death valley and 10-20 minutes to the main section of Pahrump and the wineries. The best part is we were able to kick back around the fire pit at night and enjoy some cold ones. Michael was very responsive to my inquiries and kept the place very tidy. I would definitely recommend it."
2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Would definitely stay again. Very clean, easy to access and matches description and pictures shown. Thank you!"

Good instructions on how to use all the remotes for the AC, Lights etc. I appreciated how clean the bathroom was! The bed was really comfortable and a great place to sleep after a long day of hiking. Nice amenities and overall would stay here again."
2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We really enjoyed our stay in Pahrump at Michael'splace. Stunning views of the mountains. Very clean! The mattress was also very comfortable. 5 stars for the property manager who went above and beyond to make sure that we had a working bbq and made sure that we were comfortable.
2022-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,Cute place. Has everything it says it does and the host is very responsive and hospitable.
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,A pleasant house where you can feel at home. We enjoyed the quiet area and enjoyed the exteriors of the house.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Overall, we had a great stay, and this place worked well for our day trips to Death Valley. We did attempt to work from home on Friday -- the Internet is not strong enough for this, so we would not recommend staying here if you need to work remotely. One other thing was that the bathroom shower was infested with small red ants, which came back after we tried removing with water. There are a number of bugs in general in the house, which may be unavoidable in this area. Other than those two things, we had a great stay."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Needed a place in Pahrump on short notice and was lucky to find the house available. Family were converging from around the country for a celebration of life. The house was a place of refuge for our family and a wonderful gathering place to reunite with family that hadn’t been seen for a long time.
The home was very well kept, the neighborhood was quiet, and the desert sunrises and sunsets from the back porch could not be beat."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Very nice place, as advertised"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Great place! Had a few questions before arriving and they responded immediately. House was as pictured. Clean, organized, well stocked. Would definitely recommend Alex and Jhemma’s place!"

2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This was the perfect headquarters for our Death Valley adventures. The house was spotless, spacious and serene. It was the perfect size for our family of 4 plus my parents who joined in the fun. It was well stocked with everything you could need including spices, hot chocolate and popcorn! An added unexpected bonus was the beautiful view of the snow covered mountains from the front door where we stepped out to watch the sunrise every morning. My girls loved playing in the backyard and we had wonderful family dinners on the patio. We felt safe and right at home. I would recommend this stay to anyone!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We really enjoyed staying at Alex and Jhemma’s place! It was a beautiful home, clean, roomy, with very comfortable accommodations and they made us feel very welcomed. Easy to communicate with them!
Great location for getting to Death Valley and Red Rock Canyon. We would definitely ask to stay here again if we return!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Coming from a hotel room on the previous two nights, we truly enjoyed the spaciousness of Alex and Jhemma‘s place. We especially liked sitting in the large backyard in the evening. The house was very clean and the kitchen well stocked. Death Valley is about an hour away by car. Pahrump has two grocery stores and some dining."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Nice place to stay. House is comfortable , clean and bright in a quiet neighborhood. The distance to death valley was easy to do but still a little further than expected. Certainly suitable for repetition"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We booked this home in order to visit Death Valley National Park which was only an hour away. We also visited Ash Meadows Wildlife Preserve which is also a must see, only 40 minutes away. Safe neighborhood, quiet. House was great, very clean. The yard was huge, great place to hang out with multiple seating options. Lots of cookware, etc, great kitchen to cook in. Only bummer was microwave did not heat food, but the stove was just fine. Wifi worked well. We would book again for sure!"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,Very nice place with big backyard. Everything nearby
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Awesome, clean, quite, place to stay.
Amenities in the house worked very well. Multiple different kinds of coffee makers were a nice feature.
Kitchen is fully equipped and really nice and clean.
Living room area couches very comfortable.
Bedrooms / beds very comfortable.
All bathrooms were very clean on arrival and we tried to make the cleaning crews job easier by keeping them clean.
Didn’t go in the backyard, but I did see a barbecue grill. The backyard looks spacious.
We added to the consumables (for the next guests) and bought some paper towels, toilet paper, etc., (pay it forward).
Arrived at night and found the house easily!
Next morning the view was spectacular from the front yard (snow covered mountains were an extra treat).
We will definitely be back to take advantage of Alex and Jehmma’s place!
Thank you for being a gracious host.
James"

2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is pretty much the nicest AirBnB we've ever stayed in, and perfect if you're making a visit to Death Valley National Park or any of the nearby refuges/preserves. Pahrump is bigger than I thought, so there were plenty of places to get groceries and supplies. Once you leave Pahrump, there's all of two places to get gas until you get to the Death Valley Visitor's Center...
I would definitely stay here again. The kitchen was well stocked, and it makes for a very comfortable place to come home to every night."
2024-01-01,5,Group trip,Thanks for everything!

2023-12-01,5,Group trip,This was our second time staying here and still love this place. It's the perfect set up for our family with teens. There's also a lovely patio out back. It is hands down the most affordable place out there. We will always look to stay here first when we visit.

2023-09-01,5,Group trip,"Alex and Jhemma's house was very nice. We were in town for my father-in-laws memorial service, so the location was only a mile from my mother-in-laws. Neighborhood was quiet, yard was nice to sit in and enjoy the outdoors. They were accommodating for my whole family."

2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We were looking for a place to stay from which Las Vegas and Death Valley are easily accessible. The location was perfect for that. For us and our three adult sons, the three bedrooms and two bathrooms were great, everything was very spacious in terms of space. I especially liked the ice machine, in the hot temperatures a great thing!! Our son loved the electric piano. It was always nice to return to an air-conditioned and cozy but modern house after our tours. We love cooking together, so we prefer holiday apartments or houses hotels. And again, it was a very good decision. We highly recommend Jemmas and Alex's house."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Alex and Jhemma’s home was everything we imagined and more! It is very clean, homey and nice! Alex was extremely helpful and responsive!! The beds were very comfortable, furniture nice and we loved the back patio seating areas and huge backyard! Highly recommend their home, we definitely will return in our future travels to Pahrump!"

We stayed here to visit Death Valley, which was just over an hour away. The hosts were great and helpful and I would absolutely come back."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Alex and Jhemma’s place was a jewel for our group of 4. Everything looks new. It was the perfect spot as a hub for visiting Death Valley NP and the Ash Meadows Wildlife Refuge. The surrounding snow-capped mountains gave a spectacular and enjoyable view.
The kitchen offered a lot of amenities (many varieties of coffee, hot chocolate, condiments and spices, …). This was very much appreciated.

The kitchen was well stocked for preparing our meals. The place was quiet and a good place to relax on the days that we didn't go exploring. We made day trips to Tecopa Hot Springs, Death Valley, and Las Vegas. My teenaged son especially enjoyed his bike ride through Titus Canyon. I enjoyed reading under the shade in the backyard. We would like to return sometime to visit Ash Meadows."
2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great super clean and well stocked home! Nice yard. Cool, upbeat vibe and great value. Alex and Jhemma made everything nice and easy. Highly recommend."
2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We picked this house because we were visiting Death Valley and houses in a closer location (Beatty, NV) were not available. The drive from Pahrump to Furnace Creek was just about an hour, and was actually quite spectacular and relaxing, and helped establish a context for the area surrounding Death Valley. Pahrump itself had a great may stores (Albertson's, WalMart) that allowed for easy provisioning. There was a high fence around the entire property and a lock on the gate to the driveway, which gave the initial impression that security there might be a problem. However, we found the neighborhood to be very quiet and actually did not see another person unless they were in a passing vehicle (or hot air balloon) and the fence seems to be a protection from animals for the numerous fruit trees (almond, olive, pomegranate?) in the yard. The house was clean and comfortable, and had a great many amenities that made the visit convenient. Cooking meals for the 4 of us was quite easy and eating under the stars on the back patio was delightful. The beds were comfortable and the neighborhood was generally quiet enough to sleep with the windows open - except for the occasional chorus of coyotes! Alex and Jhemma as hosts were quickly responsive to our questions. We would stay here again if the opportunity arose."
2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We had a wonderful stay at Alex and Jhemma's place. It's extremely well maintained and ample supply of both kitchen bathroom needs. It's one of the best in our AirBnb experiences. Thanks !

The house was very clean, the yard and trees are beautiful and it felt very safe. Vegas is a beautiful 1hr drive so we got a show in and didn't have to stay at the strip.

1. The house was clean, the kitchen, the bathroom and the kitchen. Super clean, even cleaner than any five star hotels we’ve ever stayed.
2. There’s EVERYthing you need in the kitchen, yes, everything. Kinds of salt, sugar, sauces, coffee and tea. All kitchen equipments worked well and were extremely clean.
3. The house owner is generous. He prepared tissue paper, napkins, trash bags, … etc more than we need. Although it’s not a big thing but it made our stay easier and convenient.
4. There’s a TV in each room. Kinds of table games were my children’s favorite.
5. The beds were comfortable and the air conditioning works well.
6. The yard is spacious but we spent very little time in the yard (too hot in July in Pahrump 😂😂)
7. The location is good. Very quiet at night. 10 mins to Walmart.
8. Check in and check out is super easy.
If we ever come to Las Vegas or Death Valley again, no doubt, this will be our only choice."

2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I am extremely pleased I selected to invest and stay in a air BNB house instead of a hotel. This was my most positive experience with my stay in an Air BnB. I can not express how safe and welcomed I felt in their house. I felt like I was at home. The place is decorated lovely and feels very inviting. My father and I celebrated his birthday at the home. There is plenty of room in the backyard too.. The AC worked wonderfully during the hot summer days. Alex and Jhemma were available to answer any questions I had too.
I encourage you to stay at their place and you get the whole house at a very reasonable price. It was my joy to water their garden on my own and relax at during my stay. We could even park our car while it was hot during our stay in the garage and due a load of laundry.
I am overly pleased with my investment and I am looking forward to booking my next stay there again. Safe yourself time and stop looking for a place to stay.... YOU FOUND IT RIGHT HERE.
God bless."

2021-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,A lovely home and perfect location for visiting Death Valley NP especially now with no lodging available due to the park being in CA.

It was just my husband and myself so we only used half the house, but it's got great spaces. Very comfortable master bed and walk in closet. Kitchen was well-appointed, perfect red wine glasses🍷☺ , nice living room / media center area in Great Room. Updated baths, televisions in every room. Big yard, garage for the car was also a desirable feature.
Excellent price for a home with these features, would absolutely not hesitate to return and may very well do so. Glad we chose it. Responsive owners."

2020-10-01,5,Group trip,"The house was just what we needed during our visit to Pahrump – clean, quiet surroundings, and felt like a comfortable home away from home.

2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Perfect pick for couples. Good WiFi, Roku TV with 2 available HDMI ports, USB; easy to use screen sharing over WiFi through the Media Player app, to watch your cell phone/camera videos and slideshow your pictures.
Not far from town (but far enough for quiet) and Spring Mountain Resort.
The kitchen was adequately equipped, dishes, cookware, countertop appliances.
The Casita is in good repair, with all features working.
Compact refrigerator/freezer was enough and a 'loaner' ice chest for packing picnic lunch/drinks.
The single car garage is oversized (length & width) and allowed us to back in, then open our car doors on both sides to enter and exit our car. There is also a door into the kitchen space from the garage.
See our 5/21-5/24/24 Guest Book entry for restaurant recs."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Robert’s place is super cozy and he is a very kind man who responds to messages quickly.

2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Robert was always a responsive host with lots of good tips.

To get fuel, groceries, food, etc, you will need to drive into town. I was here to spend time in Death Valley and to visit other local points of interest and I spent 5 nights here. The casita was clean except for the bathroom. The bathtub and sink countertop were not clean, and the sink barely drained. I found multiple long hairs on the countertop. I sent the owner a message about the sink not draining and he resolved it while I was gone that day."

Other than the kitchen not being fully stocked with all the kitchen utensils you need (no chef’s knife, no vegetable peelers, etc.) and there only being a mini fridge, we managed to make what was available work during our stay. Overall, the place was comfortable, clean, and felt private and safe. Having our own garage was nice and the movies and shows available to watch on the TV was such a bonus! If we are ever in Pahrump again, we’ll consider staying here."

2022-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"Robert's place is great, and was perfect for an overnight stay between Tucson and Reno. Robert is very friendly and accommodating, and the private garage was a great bonus! The space is super-clean and comfortable, given the compact size.

2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The casita is exactly as described on line. Note - it is a casita and compact, but very well designed so that you don't feel as if you're in a box. We greatly appreciated things being labeled and instructions in clear language for running the tv. There is a wonderful collection of guide books, as well as the hosts' personal reviews of dining and other activities in the area. Wifi worked great, bed was comfy and the bathroom well equipped. We especially appreciated the ice chest in the garage for guests' use and jumbo ice blocks in the refrigerator/freezer. Our hosts were quick to respond and offer suggestions for improving our travel ideas."
2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Bob and Laura’s casita is just as is listed. Bob’s instructions for checking in made it very easy. The home is clean and very welcoming. Bob has a wonderful guidebook that we used to find a restaurant. We went to the Mountain Falls Grill, which was delicious. It was nice having a stovetop and small refrigerator. We visited Death Valley and it was an easy drive to the park. We did not use the Coleman cooler with freezer packs he makes available or the vacuum for getting the dirt out of your car. I highly recommend this home."

I am not sure if the listing mentions a single car garage as part of the casita, but I was happily surprised to have it!!!

2022-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was an excellent home base for exploring Death Valley. Only an hour or so from the Furnace Creek visitor center and on the outskirts of town so it’s pretty easy to see a clear night sky after a short drive away.

Only 2 tiny things that could have been teeny bit better is they had Keurig and sugar which was awesome but there was no kind of creamers for coffee & I didn’t plan to buy cream or milk for the 1 night stay. Also there was no trash can in the place. Not In The bathroom or under kitchen sink or in bedroom area. I guess it made me take out all my trash lol but other visitors might like a little trash can."

This was a very last minute booking due to a change in plans for us. I think I booked it after 6pm the day of, and Bob was quick with the check in details and had great communication throughout our stay. We really appreciated that! Would definitely stay again."

Everything was very clean and comfortable. I would highly recommend this listing to anyone looking to stay in or around Pahrump."
2024-06-01,5,Group trip,perfect spot to stay while visiting spring mountain raceway. only 15 minutes from track and 10 min from shopping centers
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great
2024-05-01,5,Group trip,"Beautiful is all I can say everything was perfect for the guys staying there. Last minute reservation
and they were very helpful, contacting us immediately with instructions.
Thank you for sharing this home to make my guys that working 12 hour days can enjoy a beautiful home instead of a motel."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"My family and I fell in loveee with this home. We all felt right at home. The entire home was beautiful. They made me and my family’s stay just perfect for us. They were very friendly and helpful. Everything was spotless too. We liked how we were able to control the A/C at all times. In general, we more than enjoyed our stay and wish we can go back. They made our first airbnb experience so memorable and we will for sure get this airbnb when we’re in town again."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We were looking for a remote place, with nice views, and found it here. There was a beautiful orchid across the street. Mountain views, and a petting farm next door. Easy to get in and out of. We had a great time. One down side was we pulled up to over flowing trash bins outside that animals had rummaged through."
2024-04-01,5,Group trip,Amazing
2024-04-01,4,Group trip,"If you are planning a visit to Death Valley this is the place to stay. It's about a 40-minute drive to the park. We started out to see the sunrise at Zabriskie’s Point at 6:22am. We left at 5:30am and got there with plenty of time to walk up to the spot and setup our cameras.
When we got back to the house, we setup the fire pit and sat out here enjoying the stars and some hot chocolate."
2024-04-01,5,Group trip,"The place was in a very scenic area, love the view from the porch and windows."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"My family and I really enjoyed our stay! clean and smelled great! really quiet and about a 8 minute drive to the stores to get groceries and such. The locations we traveled to were all about a hour to hour and a half from this home so it was perfect! We will definitely stay her again or at one of the other homes listed by them. We did stay in another home and that was great as well. Beds are comfortable as well as the couches. The patio had plenty of seats for anyone who wants to sit out side and relax, There was also a back yard with a gri, but the wind was a bit much for us so we didn't get to use it. The water pressure in the master bathroom was great along with a good soak in the jet tub in the second bath room. So much dining space as well. I honestly did not want to leave! I can't wait to go back! The host(s) are fabulous, and quick! we had no issues with our stay! we love it 10 out of 10!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This home was perfect for our large group! The decorations were adorable and the house was very clean. There was room for everyone to be comfortable. The grill out back had been converted from propane to charcoal, but we still figured out how to cook dinner on it. We used this as a home base while exploring Death Valley for a few days, and the drive was very manageable. The neighborhood seemed very quiet and safe! Highly recommend!"
2024-03-01,5,Group trip,"Great stay! The house feels like home. The view in the house is amazing one of the most beautiful blue sky I've seen. I am giving a 5 star rating because our host is very nice and friendly. Close to the stores and the highway going to the park entrance. The house needs a little more supplies. Like extra trash bags/and kitchen supplies. But besides that, the house is perfect.Highly recommend if you wanna go visit Death Valley."
2024-03-01,4,Group trip,"Beautiful, secluded home that was the perfect jump point for Death Valley National Park, Lake Mead, Hoover Dam, and Las Vegas. We appreciated having four rooms so everyone had their own space. The refrigerator was not working when we arrived, something that was missed during a housekeeping visit. After quickly communicating with a rep from Stey, we flipped the breaker, cleaned the leaks, and asked for housekeeping for a cleaning. Still a smell in the fridge, but it was working for the duration of our stay! Short of that, the house was clean and comfortable."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,Centrally located from Vegas to Death Valley.
2024-02-01,4,Group trip,Great space with amazing views from the yard. A couple maintenance issues which the host is addressing promptly! Would stay again!
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Enjoyed the house. Seemed newer or recently remodeled.
2024-01-01,2,Stayed with kids,"The house is nice and has a beautiful view but, the house hadn’t a good clean and the master bathroom doesn’t work well. I took a shower with a lake on my feet. I used the toilet and I had to spent 10 minutes to flush again, again and again.
We arrived between 8:30pm and 9:30. When I noticed that the house doesn’t have a good cleaning, I took pictures and sent to the host. They answered it was “ If you feel uncomfortable, you’re able to check out now and we can issue a full refund.”
I asked “Where can I go with my family right now?” They told me “call to hotels” two nights before New Year how could I find a hotel at that time? That answer was not nice.
I decided to stay because we planned our mini trip. I fix the cleaning problem by myself.
I am writing this review only so that they improve the conditions of their business and do not take advantage of people who want a good vacation"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,Great place for family staycation. If you want to do a trip to death valley this is a perfect place to stay. Great Hospitality and nice well maintained house.

2024-02-01,5,Stayed about a week,Awesome stay in the Sierra Nevada valley. Epic hiking experience

Thank you again for letting me and David stay here. :)"

The home was very clean and close the Pahrump town which has access to grocery stores, food options, gas stations etc…will definitely stay here again if I’m in area."
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I needed desperately to get away from Las Vegas and spend some time with the quiet desert air, and Rachel’s space couldn’t have been more perfect."

2024-01-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"We stayed four nights in the Sunrise Suite. We visited Mt Charlotte one day, Death Valley the next day and Red Rock the day before we flew home.

We would stay there again."
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Perfect place to crash if you're heading to Death Valley NP. Definitely worth the price and has all the essentials. Rachel, the host, was also friendly and responded quickly."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Rachel’s place is a perfect accommodation for someone traveling to/from Death Valley to/from Las Vegas. Plenty of restaurants and other shops are just minutes away from the place. Rachel is a great host, very prompt in communication, and pretty friendly. The only thing that can be improved is the heating system of the unit. Only the bedroom has good enough heating; the living room is equipped with only a tiny space heater which is not adequate. So we had to mostly hang out in the bedroom at the cold winter nights. Another minor issue is the lack of trashcans and trash bags. There is only one trashcan in the toilet with a walmart polybag in it. Having another trashcan in the other rooms would make the trash management easier for the residents. Otherwise, it’s a great stay."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed one night,Rachel's place is great with a wonderful view. She is also responsive. The only problem is she does not have a microwave and fridge and that's why she charges less cleaning fee which is good- please pack some dry food in case you want to eat there.
2023-12-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Great place to stay, Rachel was accommodating except for the few restrictions she already listed."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed one night,Room was clean and host had provided clear directions on check in. Perfect place to stay while on Death Valley trip. I would definitely recommend for stay here.

2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great place to stay, especially for the price! We stayed here for two nights while exploring Death Valley NP. The room was clean and just as described, and Rachel was a friendly and responsive host. Short drive away from stores, gas stations, and restaurants (why we chose to stay in Pahrump)"
2023-12-01,4,Stayed one night,Great place to stay as we were traveling to Death Valley!

2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,Rachel is a fantastic host. Very friendly and proactive. The place was spotless and cosy. The bed was very comfortable and we had a great night's sleep before our journey the following morning. I would recommend this place for anyone looking for a clean and very comfortable place to stay situated only 1h away from Las Vegas.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"We stayed in Rachel’s Sunrise Suite to be in close proximity to Prairie Fire, formerly known as Front Sight shooting range. We appreciated that the location of the suite was close to where we needed to be. We hit a lot of traffic driving in from California and arrived much later than we would have hoped, but Rachel proactively left us very detailed instructions to make checking in completely seamless. The suite was just as described, and we both thought that the bed was comfortable. We also appreciated that we were able to park our car directly in front of the suite. We would happily stay here the next time we come out to Pahrump!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,The most beautiful Airbnb I have ever visited. Beautiful views and very helpful host who goes above and beyond. I highly recommend this place.

2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"Our stay at Rachel's was brief, but very good. We were hosted very well, she

2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,The place was nice and clean and perfect for a 1 night stay. Thanks again Rachel!
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"We found this place quite easily and it was in a good location, about hour from Las Vegas. It was easy drive and surrounding areas were very quiet and peaceful, ideal for a quick stop. Shops and restaurants nearby, cheap petrol and good connection to LA.
It was little outdated inside but we didn’t really mind, host also left there cards and I finally learnt to play chess there. Good value for the money. Clear instructions and communication and host also seemed very pleasant when he bumped into us in front of the accommodation. Would recommend if coming to vegas on a budget."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"Very quiet, clean place to stay. perfect for the travelers who need a quick place to reset on their journey. shower had good pressure and the bedroom was comfortable as there is an ac unit in the bedroom for selecting comfort levels.

2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"This was the 2nd time we stayed here and as always it was awesome. Very clean, cozy, and peaceful. That AC in there kept it so fresh during the hot summer heat so it was perfect. The hosts are very friendly and always responsive and were there to answer any questions we had. Definitely a great place to stay if visit Pahrump or need a place to rest on the way to Vegas!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"Nothing to say, true to photos and description. We only stayed for the night but large outbuilding, separate room.

2023-07-01,4,Stayed one night,Price-performance right.
2023-07-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Great value - not even close for 3 days in Vegas or a hotel and most airbnbs with privacy. I liked it was out of the way and quiet and nice view of stars and desert. Internet good, ac powerful and clean bathroom. Only thing I’d suggest is maybe some new towels - but I’m particular about that and like white hotel towels :) can always bring your own what is supplied is adequate - bedroom could use better privacy or blackout curtains - very bright in the morning ! These are very minor issues - again amazing value nice people. Lack of kitchen not a problem for me."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"A place where you can be at peace and rest, I recommend them to schedule when there is a full moon, you can enjoy the beautiful view from a bench that is in the courtyard. We will definitely be back."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"This was a very nice stop for us on our road trip. We came in late at night but had no problems finding the property or our room. Unfortunately, we were up and out pretty early, so we couldn't explore the area, but the scenery was very beautiful."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Rachel's place is the perfect little get away. It's quiet, out of the way, and peaceful. Rachel was very helpful when I overlooked some details.

Only one hand towel, a bunch of face cloths that looked like rags, but at least there were 4 bath towels for both of us."
2023-05-01,4,Stayed one night,"we had a very nice stay at Rachel's place
we fully recommend it !
Marty and Samy"

2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We loved our stay, highly recommend!"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Rachel’s place was very peaceful and had a great view of the mountains from the front porch. Though it is further out from the main area of Pahrump and about a 1.30hr drive from Death Valley. However, Rachel was a great host, and provided me some tea and a kettle upon request as I was under the weather. Thank you for your hospitality! Overall, I had a great stay at your lovely Airbnb."

2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Loved my stay here! I came here as a peaceful resting spot between my home and Vegas. I love my alone time so I needed something that gave me that peace and quiet before heading out to be around a lot of people and this was perfect!
I love the concept of renting out different portions of one house and I also love that if you want to explore, there is something in each direction at just about an hour drive.
Whenever my hubby and I decide to do Death Valley, we will definitely come stay here and explore all the places you can get to from here and I’d love to try Rachel’s other listings.
This one was the smallest, however, for just me it was exactly right.
I also got to meet Rachel, the host. She was super sweet and even offered to let me hang out in one of the bigger listings as it was unoccupied, though her place is most often fully booked! Her property is also surrounded by crystals and gems which I loved and could totally feel!
Will be back again 🥰"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed one night,Very convenient location to stay a night on your way! Exactly as described. Rachel was very easy to communicate. Highly recommended :)
2023-03-01,5,Stayed one night,I absolutely recommend Rachel’s place for stay.

2023-03-01,3,Stayed one night,"No way to eat something - Karin Teller, no cup - that would be a good addition"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Much thanks and appreciation to Rachel and this space!
I really enjoyed this stay.
It felt very private with its own entrance and parking spot. I was able to self check in and the host was very accommodating. Everything was very clean and had great amenities. I appreciated how close this stay was to Death Valley National Park and that I felt very safe and peaceful. I would recommend this to anyone - as a couple or single traveler. There was easy access to local stores and a few restaurants. The host also had a lot of books and a TV available and a the decor was very nice."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"This place was easy to find, clean, and about as close to Death Valley as you can get without staying in the park. My girlfriend and I had a great time."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great place, I would definitely recommend it!
In fact, the sunrise from the terrace was beautiful!
Thanks again Rachel!"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed one night,Really good deal for the price. Beautiful mountains right outside your window. Instructions were very clear as well. Thanks for the wonderful stay!
2023-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"Cozy place to stay, just as it is presented. There’s no kitchen, just an entrance, a small bathroom and a bedroom. It was perfect for our needs and everything was clean. The location is just outside the city, if you have a car anyway it’s pretty easy to find"
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We really enjoyed our stay. Our place was very clean and the location was quiet. The bed is a very firm memory foam which some people may like. Rachel you as incredibly helpful and very responsive. She had some excellent recommendations on places to visit in Death Valley. We can’t wait to go back next year!
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Rachel’s place had everything we needed and was in close proximity to all that Pahrump has to offer. Furnace Creek in Death Valley is about an hour and a half away but it felt a lot closer. All in all it was a very pleasant stay.
2023-02-01,5,Stayed one night,Rachel was very helpful and welcoming. Watching the lovely sunrise from the deck was a beautiful way to start the day. Would stay here again.
2023-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"My wife and I needed a place to shower and sleep after spending the day at Death Valley National Park. The Sunrise Suite fit the bill! This basic suite included a bedroom, bathroom, and sitting/dining room. No fridge, microwave, coffee maker, etc. This is reflected in the price. Book this suite if you and your +1 just need a clean place to shower and sleep!"
2023-02-01,4,Stayed one night,"totally worth the price! Just be aware there's no kitchen, kitchen sink, central heating, mini fridge etc. this isn't an Airbnb that conducive to preparing your own food/coffee. it's a place to crash, and a good one at that."
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Nice quiet location on the way Death Valley. Thank you for a great place to stay and providing good value for the money!
2023-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"great spot, convenient for Death Valley trip"
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay! Clear check in instructions and good location. I would stay here again!
2023-02-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Rachel’s place is a good base camp for anyone who is passing through Pahrump, or who is doing a lot of exploring during the day and just needs to crash at night! If you’re looking for a spot with more kitchen amenities, she has two other listings on the same property. Note: you will hear your neighbors through the walls since there are more than one unit in the building."
2023-02-01,4,Stayed one night,"Listing was accurate, a little out of the way, but very quiet and felt safe. For the price you can’t beat it! Was clean and efficient! Rachel was always responsive. Great place to stay as we traveled onto Grand Canyon from Death Valley."
2023-01-01,5,Stayed one night,Thanks so much for everything we had great night sleep
2023-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"Rachel is kind, considerate and friendly. Her place is so peaceful, quite and private. It's overall better than it looks - except the wall heater keeps making noise all time (it doesn't bother me at all but a heads-up for someone). It's perfect for one or two who want to have calm stay after visiting Death Valley!"
2023-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"Rachel’s place was great. There was a small mix up with some of the other tenants on the property, but she came out and greeted herself to solve the issue right away. I’m glad i stayed and would be delighted to stay again when i’m in the area. Thanks for the help!"
2023-01-01,5,Stayed one night,This is a good place to stay
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay! Very quiet and I liked the private entrance. Easy to find.
2023-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"This is a basic, clean and comfortable place to stay in Pahrump - close to Death Valley and a good number of bars, restaurants, and casinos in town (check out the Bearded Lady). Hosts are friendly and responsive. I would recommend this property for shorter stays."
2023-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"Quiet home with guest bedrooms just an hour drive from Death Valley NP. My room has its own bathroom. The room, bathroom, and common areas were all well kept and clean. The host was responsibe, but we did not meet. I would return for another stay!"
2023-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"Very glad we stayed here on the way to Death Valley. The safest, most comfortable, and cleanest Airbnb I’ve had in awhile. Thanks, would stay again!"
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We were in town to visit relatives and just needed a place to stay the nights. This worked out perfect for us.
2023-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"We had a pleasant stay at the Airbnb.
If you go out for food, it works. Otherwise, it will be a bit difficult, as there is no cutlery or the like."
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"It is a peaceful and nice place to stay. The den is very nice, I really like it and appreciate the extra space for us. The host Rachel is super responsive and friendly. I saw sun rise in her front yard, that was incredible!"
2023-01-01,5,Stayed one night,Everything was just as stated in the listing and ready when needed. Would definitely stay again if in the area.
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is just the peaceful home away from home you're looking for. Its nestled comfortably outside of the noise of the town but not to far off the beaten path. you're provided with everything you'll need, you'll find yourself wanting for nothing. I would expect to pay twice this amount for private accomodations like these else where."
2022-12-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Very clean and nice place. It is more spacious than it appears in the photos. We really enjoyed staying here!
2022-12-01,4,Stayed a few nights,very nice place! enjoyed my stay :)
2022-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"The place was clean, cozy and just as described. We really appreciated the comfortable bed and the hot shower after a couple of days of hiking and camping in Death Valley. It was a perfect way to end the trip if you have a long drive back home, like we did."
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great location. Rachel was very responsive and we enjoyed our stay very much. No issues in late check-in. Do carry some toiletries. Even if you don’t, there’s a Walmart 5 minutes away."
2022-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"This is a quiet stay with no kitchen or kitchen utensils- arrive well-fed. There are grocery stores, casinos, and fast-food nearby.
It’s got amazing books and games- don’t go there for the tv! I’d recommend this place for a quick stay."
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"A great stay, with privacy and all the features one would expect for the price. I even showed up at 3 am without a hitch. Thank you."

2022-11-01,5,Stayed one night,Great place. Great communication. Highly recommended
2022-11-01,2,Stayed a few nights,"Rachel’s place… good if you want to see Death Valley, but that’s all there is to it. Not good if you want to get some rest. To explain: Because Death Valley is so dry (extremely), static energy builds up so much you will get shocked by anything, even the person you’re sleeping next to. This is not Rachel’s fault, but she could have solved it very easily. She had “salt lamps”, which are helpful but the static being so extreme because of dryness, a humidifier would have been perfect. (We ended up buying one ourselves because it was unbearable).
What bothered us most was the heat. We came during the cold season, the beginning of November. The only heating we had was a wall heater in the room which had no adaptations whatsoever. So when it got got it got extremely hot and when it would stop it would get extremely cold. Everywhere else in the house/apartment/place it was absolutely freezing. When you exited the 73 degree room you would go into the hall/bathroom/living room you would experience 56 degrees. The problem was that I knew the house had central heating, so I asked Rachel to turn it up. She had written in the description and the private welcome message that if we want her to adjust the temperature of the house we should message her. So that’s what we did. She told me all she could do was bring me another blanket or wall heater. Very upsetting.
There is no means of heating of cooling anything. This place is really missing a microwave/fridge (I guess another way of trying to save money). One of the two is truly needed.
Other small things bothered us: no hairdryer anywhere, no blackout blinds (sun rises on that side in your eyes) and a very hard to operate shower head+tube.
I know it could improve so much and is probably better when the weather is hotter. But we did not have a good time getting zapped and being cold.
It was very clean and quiet. Very well located and thoughtfully decorated."
2022-10-01,5,Stayed one night,Great place for a couple.!!
2022-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great location, beautiful sunrise!!! Perfect for an overnight stay before moving out to see the sights."
2022-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"Easy Check-in, cozy rooms."
2022-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"Clean, convenient, and a true value. Easy check in and easy parking. Not much more you could ask for during a quickie one night stay. Bed was a tad firm for us, but we know that’s all a preference thing. Thank you for the lovely stay!"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed one night,Rachel’s place was affordable and comfortable! It was exactly what we needed after a long day of driving. The AC unit in the bedroom was much appreciated and made our stay that much more comfortable.
2022-10-01,5,Stayed one night,Had a nice stay. accommodations exactly as described in description. Clean and so quite you can hear a mouse fart lol.
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Rachel was so kind and allowed me to check in early. The bed is huge and comfy, and the home is super large and was very clean and tidy. I'd definitely stay again. Thank you!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,We had a blast! The place was great for stopping on a roadtrip. Rachel was very communicative as well.
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"That was a great stay, house was spacious and comfy. Would be happy to come here again :) Thank you!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Rachel was very responsive and provided all the necessary info well in advance of our arrival. The house was clean, neat, well equipped, quiet surroundings, great views of the starry sky at night...we would stay again if we were in the area on another visit to Death Valley NP. Thanks for a great experience!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My partner and I stayed at Rachel’s place on out trip to Las Vegas and Death Valley national park. The unit is very spacious, clean and well maintained. It provided us with everything we needed for out trip. Thank you Rachel!"
2024-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was our second time staying here at Rachel’s for the anual firework demo night. And the place was nice and clean, easy to get into. Just how I remembered! Rachel was a great host, fast response and super friendly! Definitely will keep coming back!"
2024-05-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Clean and convenient place to stay. Rachel is super available for all needs. I recommend Pharumph and this place to anyone who wants to visit the Death Valley.
2024-04-01,4,Stayed one night,"Rachel's place was very nice, clean and quiet. The only disappointing thing is that the listing is not correct, the description says the king bed is in the bedroom and the sofa bed is in the living room when, in fact, they are both in the same room, the bedroom, which by the way doesn't have a door. It's perfect for a couple but if you're 3 or 4, you will be sleeping in the same room. I was traveling with my parents and we would have preferred separate rooms. Before reserving it, I messaged the host telling her I was with my parents and she never mentioned the 2 beds were one in front of the other. Besides this, we loved the place."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,we had a very nice stay thank you to Rachel.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,We had a good stay at Rachel’s place. It is near to Death Valley. Around 1 hour drive. The house looks exactly the same as the pictures.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,Such a nice stay. Bed was sooo comfy! I kind of wish I lived here myself!
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"We spent a great night in this AirBnb!
After being hiking in death valley the whole day and watching sunset there we arrived pretty late and were desperate for a shower.
The place was easy to find and we had clear instructions how to check in and Rachel left the light of the porch on for us.
The airbnb is huge (for 2 people) and has its own entrance. The kitchen contained everything you could think of and it would have been possible to cook a complete menu!
The shower was great and we slept very well in the large bed.
Everything was very clean and we felt like home immediately.
Thank you so much Rachel!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Responsive host
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,Really nice and spacious. Highly recommend if you want or enjoy privacy.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What a lovely place to spend our short time in Nevada!! We came to see Death Valley and stayed at Rachel’s place. It was a prime location and so quiet and peaceful. The place itself was so clean and the main living space was so adorable! Loved the openness of it. There were tons of appliances, we felt right at home. Rachel and Lee were so responsive and accommodating. We got to chat with them both throughout the stay and they were so lovely. We would come back here in a heartbeat! Missing it already"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"The place was bright, airy and reminded me of growing up in NH. The hosts were friendly and welcoming. 😊"

les Thomas"
2024-03-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Great place and location, host is friendly and responsive. The only thing that we did not find pleasant is the heating system. The heater dries out the air so badly which affected both of us quite negatively. Also is extremely noisy and located close to bed."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very relaxed. We enjoyed a few beautiful days with a lot of tranquility and nice views
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The place is large and comfortable. Bed was nice and big bedroom. Nice porch. Kitchen was well stocked.
If you are visiting Pahrump, this is a close location to downtown. My goal was to go to DV National Park so it added 10 minutes to the 60 minute drive to the park as it is on opposite side of the road to the park. I did not meet Rachel but yes her husband who is quite passionate about an alternative lifestyle. I would definitely recommend this place."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,Great stay!
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,A very comfortable and welcoming place to stay. I would highly recommend Rachel’s place and hope to return again one day.

The appartment has everything one would need. Good beds, shower, kitchen; all well equiped. Sitting on the porch is a real bonus with a magnificent view. We wish we could have stayed here for a longer period!! Lee and Rachel are very kind hosts living themselves in a modest way close to nature and it was nice to share some thoughts with them about that way of living and future plans. The appartment is luxuous. Recommended to check in the environment is the Red rock canyon (close to Las Vegas) where we did a magnificent 2h hike, with incredible afternoon light and and after going upward to get rewarded with nice view on Las Vegas."

She even informed us a couple of days in advance, that Death Valley had closed due to a flashflood, and gave us some recommandations what we could do otherwise. Ash Meadows was super impressive and definitely worth a visit! The airbnb itself was super clean and had all we could need. It is a very quiet place and the view is amazing.

The place was so quiet and perfect if you want to take a little morning walk or a cup of coffee on the porch. Also great views of hot air balloons at sunrise!
So grateful for our trip. If we come out again I’ll be staying here 💕"

2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,Great value and the place was much larger than expected! Most photos tend to “oversell” the square footage - but not the case here. Close to a commercial area and a jaunt to Death Valley National Park (or Vegas…?) Would certainly recommend.

2023-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"Very nice place and communicative host. We really liked it, won’t be a surprise to find me at this place on another death valley trip. Clean place with everything you need, ample room and convenient location. I especially liked the open area on the other side of the road from the porch. The mountains looked amazing covered in snow along with the frosty bushes and icy spots in that open field. It was a very cool spirited moment for me. Do stay with Rachel."

2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This was an amazing place to stay came for our honeymoon and was sad to leave.
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The place is exactly what it looks like on Airbnb. The bed was much better than the bed in the hotel we stay in previously. Good space and only an hour and 15 mins to visitor center of Death Valley national park and an hour to the Las Vegas air port
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"It's a beautiful house ! This house has everything. The scenery is beautiful, too. And I saw a chubby and fluffy cat in the yard. It was so cute"

2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Wonderful listing for the price. Rachel’s place was spacious. Decor was unique. The space heaters were a little noisy but nothing that can’t be ignored….after all, after a long day exploring Death Valley, you’re probably ready to rest no matter the noise level. The town is just the perfect median between Death Valley and Las Vegas; however, there was not much going on in the town of Pahrump itself. Thanks for hosting!"
2023-01-01,5,Stayed one night,Thanks for the awesome stay.
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a great stay. It was the perfect spot for resting between visits to parks. We went to Valley of Fire, Red Rock, and Death Valley. Great hikes and views.

2022-12-01,5,Stayed one night,This is a great location when we ride our ATV. We are older and driving back to Vegas at night is not so pleasant after riding all day. This place is a Diamond in the rough. Rachel was able to let us check in late. When we pulled up we were so surprised that the lights were on for us for easy entry. The place was spotless and very comfy. We will definitely be returning in the future.

It's the perfect little place to stay at to explore Death Valley and other places only an hour away from Pahrump. Plenty of kitchen space, lovely sitting room to just hang and chill. The bed was comfortable and had plenty of blankets. Wish we'd stayed longer! Will definitely be back to explore more of the area."
2022-12-01,5,Stayed one night,great place to rest after visiting death valley on my road trip south!
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I wanted to be close to the southern end of Death Valley NP without paying the high rates of being in the park lodges. For 3 nights, Rachel's place was perfect. It was near enough to Death Valley so that I didn't spend all day driving (Death Valley is huge), and in the evening as I was coming home I could find good restaurants, groceries, and anything else I needed in the city of Pahrump. Highly recommend staying here!"

2022-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"Such a cool and beautiful place to stay! Very unique and unlike other airbnbs I’ve stayed in. Easy to access, wonderful view of the mountains and desert. Easy to communicate with too!"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"Thanks so much! Spent the day at Death Valley and was on our way to Joshua Tree. This was the perfect stopping spot. One hour and change from our last spot in the park (Dante’s viewpoint). We hit up the smiths grocery store before we went to this air bnb.
Very comfy bed and a great value. Really appreciate that.
Some possible improvements: the coffee pot is painfully slow, would recommend getting a new one. It’s a 10 cup pot so had to make two rounds of coffee (my partner and I drink a lot of coffee lol - need a 12 cup maker 😂)
The frying pans were pretty scratched up and didn’t look that safe to cook in when we went to go cook. Luckily I had my own cast iron in the car that I was able to use. Just bring your own if you can.
TV in the bedroom area is a smart TV which I really appreciated! Was able to watch my own shows - thanks!
All in all a great value, great stay! Rachel was incredibly nice, great at communication and I highly recommend this stop if you are in the area.
Thanks!"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed one night,Our stay in Pahrump was lovely - the house is clean with a beautiful front yard. Check in was very easy and communication with Rachel was great. And an amazing price! Will definitely stay here again.
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We enjoyed our stay at Rachel’s. Home was as advertised and conveniently between Vegas and Death Valley. We really appreciated the host guidebook and recommendations she offered.
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We appreciated a low cost place with a nice bed, shower, and quiet. The location is quite remote/dark - great sky watching. When driving to the location, there are a lot of homes with fencing around their homes/property and beware of dogs signs. I felt a bit apprehensive as that is not seen where I live. However, Rachel had the porch light on, great communications and very welcoming spot. I found it to be a great value. There were other renters in the other half of the building, but they were quiet, so no issues. We had a nice stay."
2022-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"Cute, clean + WAY better than staying in Vegas! Easy check in process, great communication. 12/10 would stay again! The bed is super comfy and the quilts were so soft!! Thank you!"

2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Loved the location in a quiet part of town, but still close enough to enjoy the amenities. It was an easy, scenic drive to Death Valley. The kitchen was well-equipped and the decor was really interesting. Great view of the desert mountains!"
2022-09-01,5,Stayed one night,Rachel’s place is spacious and comfortable. It worked out well for us as a stopover between Tucson and Carson City.
2022-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"very nice place, close to Vegas and also to Death Valley.
we had a wonderful sunrise moment on the porch with the desert view."
2022-09-01,5,Stayed one night,We stayed for one night to be close to Death Valley National Park. The house has great amenities as stated. The bed was really comfy. And the plugs are close enough on one side of the bed to plug in your phone or CPAP machine. The kitchen was well stocked. You also have a great view of the sky at night for stargazing. The only thing is the entry to the shower is kind of tight. So bigger body people or disabled folks may have a harder time getting in and out of the shower. Great experience overall.
2022-08-01,4,Stayed a few nights,It’s a great place to stay and explore Death Valleys 🏜

A little gem in a wild landscape although close to the city.
