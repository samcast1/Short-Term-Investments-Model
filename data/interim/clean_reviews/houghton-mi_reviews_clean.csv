2024-06-01,5,Group trip,"Loved our short stay! Plenty to do at the house to wind-down after long days hiking & ATVing. Comfortable beds & pillows. We loved sitting in the living room in the mornings sipping on some coffee & listening to the birds. The place is right off of an intersection of 2 roads, but we only heard cars a couple of times. Close to Houghton & grocery stores, but far enough away it feels private & secluded."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Our stay here was incredible. The house was spacious, clean, and exactly as expected from the description. Of course everyone loved the sauna, hot tub and games! The location is nice and private and just a short drive to town. The hosts were great and answered any questions very quickly. Would absolutely recommend this home to others and would love to return someday."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This house was ideal for a larger family. It worked so well for my daughters MI Tech graduation. We would have needed multiple hotels rooms and this enabled us to also cook our own meals avoiding the craziness of the restaurants graduation weekend. Also, the game room. Hours of entertainment. It rained most of our stay so with the kiddos and young adults the entertainment was so appreciated! Absolutely perfect."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed over a week,"We stayed at this location for just under 3 weeks and could not have found a more relaxing or comfortable location. There is tons of space for all the guests and lots to do at the house. We all enjoyed the video games, massage chair, disk golf baskets outside, Hot tub, and even the sauna on the lower level of the house. The whole crew felt right at home and really enjoyed or stay after working 10hr days. I would definitely recommend this location to anyone that needs a lot of space for a family vacation with tons to do or just needing a quiet place to get away. This location is well worth the price."
2024-04-01,5,Group trip,Perfectly perfect!!!
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Just the environment our family needed for a few days away. Definitely could fit 3 families or more, but great for our family of 5 too. Loved all the amenities!"

2024-01-01,5,Group trip,"The house was amazing! The layout accommodated our annual guys snowmobile trip perfectly! Plenty of space for trailers, gear, etc.
The basement game room was awesome with everything in perfect working condition. Unfortunately we didn't have the best snow conditions, so the amenities and game room made up for it ten fold! The location and property were perfect, we would definitely stay here again in the summer or winter!"

2024-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,House was everything we hoped it would be. Many great family memories made during our week stay.
2024-01-01,5,Group trip,"Wow, this place was phenomenal! Visiting from near the Twin Cities it wasn’t too far away. This house is massive with plenty of rooms and beds for you and your family or group of friends to get together. I visited over the new years and it was such a blessing to have this space with so many things to do to bring in the new year. Key elements were definitely the Sauna, The Hottub, the 2 racing arcades and massage chair. We would LOVE to make it a tradition to come back next year here.
Cheers!"
2023-12-01,5,Group trip,This place was everything the description said and MORE! The home is immaculate and equipped with absolutely EVERYTHING! It actually looks better than the pictures and the host left nothing to chance! I am in town as a travel nurse and missed my family so they came to spend Christmas with me here and I couldn’t have chosen a better location! There aren’t enough stars to rate this home! Perfect place in every way! Customer service was exceptional! My gratitude is infinite for this home away from home!

2023-11-01,5,Group trip,"Kari’s Houghton House was stunning. I’ve paid more to stay at hotels that were not nearly as nice. There were a few times I had to communicate with Kari and she was very prompt with her responses.

2023-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,The house was exactly as listed! The living room was nice and bright. The bedrooms were large and clean. We enjoyed spending the evenings in the hot tub and the game room. We ventured out to a nearby beach and found Yooperlites! The location was convenient while attending support pack weekend for our Michigan Tech student. The house was fully stocked with essential kitchen items and amenities. We hope to stay again when visiting the Houghton area in the future.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Our family group of 6 adults and 3 children loved being here! We could have easily been comfortable with a larger group. This home and property are spacious, comfortable and roomy, providing fabulous options for group activities and individual enjoyment.
The sizable yard contains a hot tub, disc golf course, fire pit for a bonfire, and patio areas with lots of seating.
Inside the home on the lower level are arcade quality games, a big TV to watch a game or movie together, and a sauna!
The main level offers a beautifully furnished living area with lovely views, dining area, a large kitchen, and master suite. There is a large well equipped laundry room too!
Over the attached garage is a good sized room with three queen sized beds. Inside the house, upstairs are three different sleeping areas.
We were also pleased with our hosts who were excellent in every way! A great experience."

2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,What an amazing place to stay! It was close to Houghton and places to golf and disc golf. Loved waking up and drinking coffee on the deck and throwing discs in the yard. This stay had everything we could ever want and more. Will be coming back next year!
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,After having our original booking cancel on us at the last minute we were lucky enough to find this beautiful property. This home has everything you could need for a fantastic getaway! The hosts are extremely accommodating and make sure you have everything you need! We would definitely want to come back and stay again!
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"the home was even more beautiful in person! very modern and clean, yet cozy and comfy! They had all the little things you could need that you'd never think of (zip locks, cooking spray, etc). The basement was described as ""epic"" by my 3 kids. the sauna and hot tub were amazing adult amenities. beds were comfortable, towels were high quality...we will definitely be staying there next time we come up to visit family!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We have stayed at many rental properties and this is far and away our favorite. It was in a great location, had fantastic amenities (Sauna, Hot Tub and arcade) and was very clean. The thing that really stood out was all the “little things” that were thought of throughout the property. Highlight was being able to star gaze at night in a perfectly dark back yard and see more stars than we could ever hope to. Will definitely look forward to staying here again the next time we come UP North."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,Beautiful home very close to attractions and centrally located to find all the waterfalls. Great beaches for rock hunting! Had family vacation with 13 of us was more than enough room the hot tub and sauna was great at night and the game room took us all back to our youth!! House sits closer to road than thought very busy road but still private with the landscaping. Thank you so much we will be back!
2023-08-01,5,Group trip,"Beautiful surroundings with tons of things to do in and outside at the house; game room, disc golf, hot tub, etc. The house was superclean and very well cared for with everything you could need available. We had a great time and will choose Kari's place again any time we're up this way. Know that there are many steps to get to the upstairs bedrooms."

2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,We had a great time and the place was perfect for our family get away!
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"A beautiful house located amidst the lakes worth the stay.
The house looks exactly like the pictures shown. The game room was an instant hit with the kids as well as adults. The bath tub was great and even sauna too. Had plenty of Utensils to cook and lots of things to do nearby. We stayed for four days but felt that was not enough. Overall we had a great time and will surely recommend this place if you are a big family or going in with friends.
Note: the maps shows the address on the opp side as in if it’s says left then the house is actually right"
2023-05-01,5,Group trip,This place was perfect for our group of 14. The house is very nice and the game room was an added bonus for evening fun! Kari and Daniel responded quickly if we had any questions. Great place to stay for visiting the peninsula.
2023-04-01,5,Group trip,Kari's home was amazing. We were up for the graduation of our MTU grad. Drive was 10 minutes to campus. The games in the basement kept the high schoolers with us busy. Thank you of having plenty of towels fire the shorts and hot tub. There was 9 off is and everyone's had plenty of space and a bed. It rained the whole weekend so we didn't get too enjoy the beautiful yard. If we return to the Keweenaw we hope this home is available. Thank you Kari and Daniel!
2023-03-01,5,Group trip,Absolutely great people to rent from. Place is nice and hosts are super friendly. Very responsive and helpful. Go out of their way to make things perfect. If i could leave 100 stars i would. We will be back. Beautiful house and beautiful property. Thanks

2023-02-01,5,Group trip,"We were in the area for a snowmobile trip with 6 guys. The place we normally stay was no longer available, so we were lucky enough to find this rental. It fit our needs perfectly, tons of room for parking both trucks with twenty foot trailers. Property is huge and private, very peaceful. The house has a unique layout, but it worked perfect for our group. Very clean and well stocked kitchen. Only complaint was the previous guests used all the firewood for the fireplace! Will definitely stay here again!"

2023-01-01,5,Group trip,Awesome place to stay for a snowmobile trip. Kari was very responsive and went the extra step to pick up a few groceries for us since we were driving up on snowmobiles. Hot tub was awesome after a day on the sled. Beds very comfortable and the entire place was very clean.
2023-01-01,5,Group trip,"LOCATION! If you’re looking for peaceful, spacious and relaxing, look no further! We were planning for 6 of us to be there and ended up with 5. PLENTY of space to accommodate our group and lots of things to do right at the property, including snow shouting, hot tubbing, gaming or relaxing in the massage chair. We also ventured over to Houghton/Hancock and found it charming. We travelled up to Tamarack just because and hiked some great areas. A wonderful way to celebrate the New Year with the fam. Highly recommend!"
2022-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Lots to do! Kids loved the games in the basement, the massage chair was lovely, and the hot tub was thoroughly enjoyed! We also spent some time outside snowshoeing on the trails. Would love to come back in the summer sometime, so much space on the yard for volleyball, disc golf, etc. Dan and Kari were quick to respond, and very accommodating. Book your stay here, you won’t regret it!"

2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This house is beautiful. The pictures in this listing just begin to touch on how welcoming the owners/house make you feel. We were pleasantly pleased with everything. The house was extremely clean, the bed very comfortable and the accommodations were perfect. It’s a great place for small or large gatherings and was so close to Houghton and the Keweenaw Peninsula. After a day of touring around it was great to enjoy their hot tub. The game room was awesome.

2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great Location 2 miles from MTU campus Close to Nara Nature center with hiking and nordic skiing
Cabin was clean had everything we needed, recommendations for restaurants, and JoLynn was great to communicate with. Comfy clean beds. We have stayed here 2x and plan to return again"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We had an excellent stay for our snowboarding trip. JoLynn was super nice and accommodating
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,JoLynn is a great host and cabin was as described. We were snowmobilers and I will give a word of caution if you want to ride out of location north toward Houghton bridge make sure snow conditions are good as you will be riding on a lot of bare pavement and parking lots through the college. Riding south would be much better.
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Everything we expect, and more very comfortable place to stay, and will recommend to our friends and family"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,JoLynns place was perfect for our weekend trip to the UP. Easy check in and amazing accommodations and wonderful design. We hope to stay again!
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Wonderful place to stay for MTU family weekend! Close to University and still far enough away to be peaceful. Jo Lynn was an amazing host! I would definitely recommend her cabins and hope to return!
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We loved our stay here! Location was beautiful and close to town!
Beds and linens were all clean and clean comfortable. They even had alternative comforters for the down comforters on the beds which is great because my husband was allergic.
There are several cabins on the property and we would absolutely consider this again for a solo or group trip!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place. wouldn't hesitate to use it again.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Wonderful upgrades even since the last time we stayed here. Internet service was great and we could work when needed, along with cell service. The beds are so comfortable, like no other house rental we’ve gone to. She was even sweet enough to have a kids high chair and selection of toys waiting for us."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We had a great visit to Houghton.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We have stayed here multiple times and every time is amazing! JoLynn is the best host and the place is just lovely….feels like home!
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"If anything, JoLynn under-sold this place. Yes, it is just as described, but so much more. From a fridge with all the incidentals (mayo, soy sauce, butter) to marshmallows ready for the firepits, to extra towels without asking, this was just an A+ experience. Thumbs up!!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,What a gem of a place! Perfect location at a 5 minute drive to MTU. Clean and private with great amenities. Was a lovely spot to touchdown after bringing our son to start his freshman year. Would love to stay again when we are back in town. Cannot say enough about this amazing cabin and our gracious host.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We had a wonderful stay at JoLynn's cabin (Cabin 1) and would highly recommend her cabins . She is very attentive to every detail from cleanliness, supplies (she even had toy cars for our five year old) and decor. I promise you will not regret your decision to book a stay at her cabins."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This was our second stay at the cabin, but the first time with our daughter. JoLynn had a small box of toys that were a blessing to have available for her to play with while at the cabin. She was in touch throughout the week we were there making sure we had everything we needed. It was clean and well stocked with amenities for our home away from home. We will definitely seek out this property when we return to the area in the future."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,A great place to stay. I enjoyed the overall decor of the house. It was close to several things we wanted to visit in the area.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,such a cute spot in a great area! The place instantly felt like home and had everything we needed for our stay. JoLynn also had some great local recommendations in the welcome binder.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This was exactly what our family of 4 needed during our visit to MTU with enough space and amenities for everyone to enjoy the stay. JoLynn was very responsive and accommodating and the cabin was excellent. We look forward to returning here sometime soon!

2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The location was perfect. We were not far from all the activities we had planned, but far enough away from the city to enjoy peace. The place exceeded out expectations. We look forward to coming again. We could only imagine what it’s like when the fall colors set in!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The first thing I noticed when arriving at JoLynn's cabin was that it was spotlessly clean. The cabin had great wifi and a very accommodating living space. I could tell care was taken in the selection of everything. The furnishings were very comfortable and the kitchen has everything someone would need. The cabin also had very good literature detailing the surrounding area and the host's personal recommendations.
The location is within 5-10 minutes of downtown Houghton making it a great choice if you're planning on exploring Keweenaw Peninsula and surrounding Lake Superior coastline, which is what we did.
I would recommend staying here to anyone and if I returned to the area I would love to stay again."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We had a great stay at JoLynn’s place! The cabin was clean and comfortable. It was a great place to spend a little downtime. We will be back!

Thank you so much, JoLynn!!"

The communication with the host is spectacular.
What a wonderful experience all around. We will be back!"

2022-09-01,5,Stayed over a week,My extended stay was awesome. This was a first time experience and I brought many supplies which I found unnecessary as JoLynn had thought of everything.

2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was my and my boyfriends second time staying at the cabins. We stayed in 1 & 2 so far! Very clean, comfortable, and in a great location close to downtown houghton. JoLynn is very nice and easy to reach if you need anything."
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We stayed in Cabin #1 and found it to be very inviting, clean and comfortable. It is in a great location just a couple of minutes from the MTU campus and downtown Houghton. This was our home base for MTU graduation and packing my son's apartment to move him home and was so much nicer than staying in a hotel. Our only regret is that we couldn't have stayed an additional day or two. JoLynn was a great host and we were even able to access the unit a couple hours before the official check in time."
2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Good overall
2022-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great cabin! Very clean head all the amenities you could need! We will be back!

2022-02-01,5,Stayed about a week,"This cabin is so cute in person, and has everything that you could need. We definitely will be staying there again. It's also close enough to downtown/MTU without being on top of it, perfect location!"

2022-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great location and great house! Highly recommended!
2022-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Cabin #1 is super comfortable. It’s advertised as being just off the highway, but don’t let that worry you the noise level is not bad. The location is only 3 miles away from the bridge, so for snowmobiling it’s easy access into the peninsula and entertainment is a quick drive or ride away. We will be back for a summertime visit. Thanks!"
2022-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The cabin was tidy, and had a bunch of little extras that made us feel welcome & at home. JoLynn is very good at communicating as well. Will definitely stay again!"
2022-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The cabin is great!
2021-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We stayed here in cabin 1 for a couple days, and it was absolutely lovely. I love the outside porch with a front row view of Portage Lake — we watched a beautiful sunrise light up the snowy winter wonderland that is the U.P. on Christmas morning. It’s clean, very cute, has coffee… and fun details all over. I’ve stayed in the summer & winter now — highly recommend! I love all three cabins for their own unique reasons :) JoLynn is wonderful. Thank you!"
2021-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This place is amazing! It is cozy, clean, and convenient. JoLynn knows what she’s doing and is great at it! Even though I was worried about the noise from the highway we barely even heard it. Also, she’s thought of everything, my husband has to sleep with a fan on and we forgot ours at home but much to our delight there was one in both bedrooms! She even had a sound machine in case you needed it. Highly recommend you check it out if you’re looking for a great place to stay!!"
2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The cabin is cozy and comfortable. You will have everything you need to cook for your family, even toys for the kids. Its literally the perfect place."
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was a great place for our MTU visit. JoLynn was great to work with from start to finish, communication was wonderful. Any future visits to MTU will be done from here. Perfect weekend!! Thank you."

2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"JoLynn's cabins are very charming and full of little extras thàt you don't expect. I used to have my own home cleaning business and am very fussy, so was quite pleased that our cabin was immaculate and comfortable. I will definitely stay here again."
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay and explore the area around Houghton. Close to Michigan Tech and downtown Houghton
2021-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,We (family of four) had a great stay here for 5 nights. The cabin was cute and clean and conveniently located close to hiking and biking trails. Great place to explore the area. JoLynn had a list of things to do in the area on the fridge - we tried out a new beach on the list we had never been to which was nice.
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Nice clean well appointed cabin. Perfect spot for exploring the UP.

2021-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,A great cabin near the lake that has had a lot of modern and thoughtful updates inside. Very well decorated and comfortable. It included a lot of little things you may have forgotten and even a white noise machine (you don't usually see that in an AirBNB and always bring ours). Location was nice. Just a little outside of town but close to get anywhere you want. We would stay here again if in the area.
2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We loved our stay here! JoLynn is a wonderful host, and we felt so at home in Cabin 1. The decor is so welcoming, and the area is absolutely beautiful. Downtown Houghton has lots of great options for restaurants, and there are many beautiful hikes, beaches, and parks nearby. Highly recommend!"
2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Comfortable, quiet, convenient, and cozy. The perfect base from which to explore the Keweenaw, or just curl up with a good book. Very comfortable beds and a well equipped kitchen. Jolynn is an excellent host and the communication before, during, and after the stay were perfect. An excellent place to stay while in Houghton!"
2021-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Highly recommend these cabins, JoLynn has thought of every detail. This was my third time staying here and will definitely be back again. These cabins are so convenient if you are visiting Michigan Tech or exploring the Keweenaw area."
2021-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"After spending a busy day checking out Houghton, this place is a gem to come home to. The memory-foam bed was a relaxing treat after walking the town. Nice and toasty gas heater in the family room.
It's a really great place to stay!"

2021-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is my second time renting from JoLynn, this time I stayed in a different cabin than the first time. Now I can't decide which one is my favorite because they both are outstanding. The cabin is decorated adorably and has tons of personal touches. The cabin provided the perfect warm, relaxing space after a long day at Winter Carnival. I highly recommend renting from JoLynn and I've already booked my third stay with her."
2021-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Felt like a home away from home. Perfect!
2021-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,What a lovely place to getaway! The cabins are amazing. Location is great...just outside of Houghton. Everything you need is right here! From the coffee grinder and whole bean coffee to the white noise machines to the flannel sheets on the bed. Every attention to detail! Such an amazing place to stay!!
2021-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Amazing Airbnb

2021-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"JoLynn's Cabin was such a great find! The entire place was spotless and so cute! I appreciated the comfy memory foam beds with cozy bedding: we all slept great. The kitchen was clean and fully stocked with all the dishes, pots and pans we needed. JoLynn was very responsive and answered my questions promptly."
2020-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The little cabin was a delight to stay in. The open floor plan between the kitchen, dining area, and living room make it feel larger than it is and much larger than it looks from the outside. The beds were comfortable, everything was very clean, and the kitchen was well equipped. The location was 5 minutes from MTU. We were delighted to see a bit of Portage Lake from the front porch."
2020-11-01,5,Stayed over a week,Awesome trip! Great time! Can’t wait to go back. Thank you JoLynn!

2020-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Very clean and well stocked!
Small cottage, perfect for a family of 4 adults. JoLynn responded quickly and decorated the cottage well. Mints on the beds, cold water in the fridge, many normally used condiments, fans, and many other thoughtful touches. Soaps, shampoo, cleaners are all available. Cabin #1 is closest to the road, and you will hear drivers running over the rumble strips and general road noise. We were so tired from our road trips all over, we didn't have trouble sleeping. Great location...2.5 miles from Tech."
2020-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Well cared for property. Thoughtful touches. Responsive to messages. I would not hesitate to return.
2020-08-01,5,Stayed over a week,"We enjoyed our stay at Cabin by the Course. It was just as described, very clean and well stocked with all supplies & nice amenities. JoLynn is a wonderful host, quick to respond, and just a really nice person. The cabin is in a great location to explore all that the Keweenaw has to offer and the waterfront trail is right across the street!"
2020-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This place is a gem! Our hostess was so thoughtful and the space was decorated beautifully and suited our family of four perfectly.
2020-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had an A+ experience at JoLynne's cabin! We were lucky to have a two night stay here in July 2020 and used the cabin as our home base to explore the Keweenaw Peninsula. The location was perfect for us. There was a golf course next door and a lovely shaded trail across the road for running/walking/biking. We were close to town but the property was so quiet and private. Even though there are three other cabins here we didn't see any other guests. JoLynn has great style and her cabin is decorated beautifully. We had so much space for the three of us and it was sparkling clean. There were so many nice little touches - extra hand sanitizer and wipes, popcorn and coffee, mints on top of our towels that were displayed nicely on the beds. The master bedroom mattress was very comfortable and the duvet was nicer than mine at home. We were all sad when our time at the cottage came to an end. JoLynn is a very considerate host and responds to questions and concerns very quickly. I would recommend her cottages highly and hope to stay here again soon!"
2020-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a great stay at this comfortable, well appointed and very clean cabin-would definitely return! A great place to stay when exploring the Keweenaw Peninsula!"
2020-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"A well decorated space with many thoughtful touches. This super host has earned her stripes! Everything you could possibly need is provided, from BBQ to fire pit to shower! A very comfortable little cabin. A bit noisy from the highway, which I didn't notice in the description so I can't possibly complain. Cabins farther back are quieter and this compound is an excellent choice for groups."
2020-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay in Houghton!
2020-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was my second stay with JoLynn - as expected, everything was great. The location is 2 miles from MTU. I enjoyed being able to ride my mountain bike to the Tech Trails (trailhead at Nara Nature Park) every morning to start my day. We did a lot of exploring (hiking, biking, kayaking) in the Keewenaw - there is so much to see and do!"
2020-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,This was a good way to get away during the pandemic. Everything we needed for a relaxing and enjoyable trip was provided.

2020-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The cabins were amazing and so was Jolynn, quick to respond to questions an absolute pleasure to deal with through the whole process. The cabin is fully stocked with everything you need from spices to cook wear. We stayed 5 days, 3 people and never once did it feel crowded. Thanks for an amazing week"
2019-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This cabin was perfect for our stay! We wanted to be close to Houghton for the nightlife but not too far away from Mount Bohemia and other local attractions. JoLynn was quick to respond and extremely helpful. We will be booking next time we come to Houghton!

2019-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The cabin was spotlessly clean and very spacious. There is a really nice path across the highway that runs along Portage lake.

2019-07-01,4,Stayed with kids,"This cabin was great, newly remodeled, tons of amenities, close to town, clean and adorable. The only down side was the location- I wasn’t prepared for how busy/noisy the highway was. It may be hard for people who are sensitive to noise."

2019-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My husband and I spent several. Nights in Cabin 1. We had a lovely time.

Plenty of space for two people to fully unpack and feel at home, plus I loved having a porch for sitting outside at night. JoLynn was easy to communicate with and so sweet about checking in to see if we needed anything. If you're planning a trip to Houghton, I'd absolutely recommend staying in one of JoLynn's cabins."

The place was also well maintained and clean. We had an amazing time and memorable stay at this place. The place also had some indoor card and board games to play. 100% recommended place to stay!
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great place to stay downtown Houghton. Lexi did a wonderful job updating the space. Was super clean.

2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The apartment was clean and comfortable. Access was straightforward with Lexie's instructions. She was very communicative. Location is right in downtown area with restaurants and shops, with a short (approximately 1 mile) walk to the MTU campus. Great stay!"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The entire experience was wonderful! We enjoyed our time and the view of the Portage Bridge.

Lexie was friendly and responsive. It was a 5-star experience, and I look forward to staying here again."
2024-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,"For the last 6-7 years my family (wife, 12 year old, 9 year old, and myself) have been coming up for a long weekend/New Years getaway. This is by far our favorite spot we have stayed in. Walking distance to all of our favorites (KBC, Joey's, Suomi, and shops) with the added bonus of having a view of the bridge. We loved it.
The apartment itself is great. Nicely decorated, big bathroom, very nice kitchen, and a living room big enough for the 4 of us. The only downside, if there was one, was that the bedrooms are a little small and there are only two beds. Not a problem since the 12 year old opted for the couch, but something to consider if traveling with kids. I was a little worried about the apartment being loud since it is right off the main street, but with the bedrooms on the back side it wasn't an issue at all. Wife and daughter loved the boutique downstairs too."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Loved our stay at Lexie’s place! Conveniently located in the beautiful downtown area. Clean, modern, and comfy!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We enjoyed a very relaxing stay at Lexie’s beautiful suite! Just walking in was a sheer delight!

We loved the comfortable beds, as well!
The bathroom was such a nice space with laundry available! Also, a great location for walking to dinner! Wonderful accommodations! Thank you! 🌞"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Lexies place looked even better than the pictures. Amazing view of the portage out the large street facing windows. Great location right downtown houghton. Quick walk to all shops, bars, and restaurants."

Right across from 2 of my favorite places to eat and drink in the Copper Country, easy walk to several others, and the canal and bridge views were great! Neat, immaculately clean and maintained, very nicely renovated with many upgrades... and that bathroom shower was amazing! Lexie was a great host and very responsive and friendly!
Thanks, Lexie!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I’d like to live there. 😀
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I have stayed here a number of times. I can't think of anything I do not love about it. Lexie is just the best host. And the place is lovely & convenient.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great location with an upscale feel. Lexie’s Suite B is very well appointed with everything you need to enjoy a stay in downtown Houghton within a few minutes walk to great dining options, shopping, and the waterfront. The patio is also a nice option in the Summer."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The photos don’t do it justice! We were visiting our Tech student for the weekend and this was the perfect home base. Walkable to restaurants, close to campus, and a beautiful view. It was just a little more than local hotels and we got so much more for the money. Not only will we be back, but I am about to book us for a year worth of visits."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed about a week,Great place located around many amenities and central. Place matched description and it was very nice. Overall will stay again in the future.
2023-03-01,5,Stayed one night,Chose to stay because of location and look of the place. The only negative was the price after cleaning fee was not worth the noise from bar goers walking around until 2:30am or watching the drug deal go down on the street in front of the Downtowner Motel. For the money we could have had the best hotel rooms around.
2023-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"Better then any hotel in a hundred mile radius. Beautiful place to stay with a perfect kitchen, great views, and comfortable sleeping area. Spacious bathroom with a great shower. 100% will stay again."
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Lexie was a phenomenal host! She messaged us to make sure everything was okay with the Air Bnb and was quick to reply when we messaged her. The Air Bnb was very accurate to the description and photos but even more stunning in person! It felt very homey and comfortable. The location was right in town walking distance from lots of restaurants, bars, shops, etc."
2023-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We absolutely loved our stay- everything was super clean, beds were comfy we had everything we needed for a weekend visit."
2023-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,This was by far the best Airbnb we have ever stayed at. Extremely clean and updated. It really did feel like a vacation home. Great location in the heart of downtown with private parking. Can't wait to come back.
2023-01-01,5,Stayed one night,Lexie was a great host and was also very responsive. Her home was clean and had upgrades that met our needs. I would definitely stay again if I was in the area. 😀
2023-01-01,5,Stayed about a week,"We were a group of competitive skiers staying in Houghton for the US National Cross Country Ski Championships. We actually rented both Unit B and C which are right next door and this allowed for a really unique shared but also private experience. The units are incredible. A beautiful urban revitalization project of a historic downtown building. As an architect, I really appreciated the work that went into the quality finishes and amenities of the space.
The location is perfect. Close to everything for us. 5 mins from the ski trails. Walkable to restaurants, shops, and entertainment. And ample parking! A rarity for a downtown location. It's fun to watch the snow fall outside the big storefront windows.
You couldn't ask for a better airbnb! I sincerely hope we have an excuse to come back and stay again!"
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Lexie's place was very clean, nicely appointed, fully stocked kitchen, cozy blankets, comfortable beds, great view of the bridge, Lake Portage, in the heart of Houghton, within a short walk to many shops and restaurants. We were welcomed with a gift bag on the counter. A great home away from home. We have been to the Houghton area many times, this by far was THE BEST place we have ever stayed. We look forward to staying here again the next time our travels bring us to Houghton."
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Lexie’s place is modern, clean and beautiful! It far exceeded our expectations! It is convenient to shops, restaurants and the Keweenaw! The high ceilings and huge windows add to the beauty of the space! We plan to book again! Highly recommend!"

2023-03-01,5,Stayed about a week,So nice I stayed there twice!
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I found the place that I will always stay at when I come up here. Clean, cozy, comfortable and inviting. It has a gorgeous yard, everything I needed inside. The sauna was clean, spacious and made my days that much better. The hosts were suprisingly quick to respond, polite, very helpful and had gone above and beyond to be accommodating during an unforseen emergency. Even before that happened, I knew I was going to come back here again when they offered to bring out a cot for our third sleeper.
The spiral staircase and the indoor fireplace are nice touche as well and this region of the U.P. is beaming with incredible naturescapes and fun things to do"
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Worked great for winter carnival weekend at Tech. Close to downtown and campus so it was easy to meet/pick-up/drop off our son attending Tech. Would stay again.
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"One of the nicest places I've stayed. Exactly as described. Great instructions. Was open and honest about hearing his family early in the mornings. No big deal to us. We had asked for a cot for our 14 year old to sleep on, and were pleasantly surprised to find a bed made up on the floor of the bedroom. I will absolutely stay here again when in the area."
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Excellent place to stay. Clean, warm and comfortable. Place to park my car and trailer. Close to snowmobile trail. Excellent place to stay."
2023-01-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Overall happy with our stay. Location was fine for snowmobiling. The Sauna was awesome but definitely won’t fit more than 1-2 people. All amenities were there as expected. Our only issue was we couldn’t find the TV remote so we were unable to use the TV but I’m sure that’ll be fixed for future guests. I would definitely recommend.

2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great location, 1 mile walk from downtown (on a hill however, but great views!) Place was very clean and had local coffee for guest use which I appreciate. I love the sauna and make use of it whenever I stay. This is my second stay at this location and I would definitely stay again. Spiral staircase to the main kitchen and bath area which may be intimidating to anyone with mobility issues, but it is kind of fun. 😊"

2022-09-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Great place and location close to downtown and MTU. Very comfortable and clean. The sauna is a plus! Although the rental is attached to the house, we only saw the family in passing and could hear them slightly once in a while. Will stay here again in the future!"
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We have stayed with Alan several times. Always a great stay.
2022-08-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Better than the pictures, plenty of space for our family of 4. The basement is a little bit dark but the upstairs is very cozy and peaceful. Quiet spot on a pretty street, close to downtown. We enjoyed our stay!"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We spent 2 months of summer at Alan's place and it was quite possibly the best summer I have spent at Houghton. The location could not have been better for a long stay at Houghton!! The house is really spacious, it was more than sufficient for 2 kids and 3 adults !!"
2022-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Best possible location if you plan on spending time around the Tech campus while having easy access to Tech trails, shopping areas and the beaches on Portage. The place is huge, the pics dont do it justice. There were 5 of us and we never once felt cramped for space. There is plenty of area outside for kids to explore and explore they did. Most importantly Erin and Alan live on the same property so they were always around when we needed something. We spent a month here and are about to spend another month after a brief visit to LA. Felt like we came back home!!"
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great location near Michigan Tech. Wonderful, comfortable place. I highly recommend."
2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Lovely space with cozy yet open-feel. The split level, with TV on a separate floor, contributes to the peaceful feeling of main space. Very comfortable beds and sofas."
2022-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Listing just as pictured with some extra touches to make for an even better stay! Alan and I chatted before our stay about the snow and he was thoughtful enough to leave a sled out for the girls to play in their backyard. Sauna was appreciated on a cold, snowy, April weekend in the UP!"
2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great location and price. I really enjoyed my stay. I would recommend this listing for anyone wanting to visit the area.
2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great location to MI Tech. Clean and comfy. Sauna is awesome.

2022-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Cute spot close to downtown Houghton. Great for families. It is spacious and the sauna adds a nice touch. The unit is primarily in a finished basement, so there is some noise transfer between floors which wasn't an issue for us."
2022-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay. Perfect for a parent visit for MTU students. Very comfortable accommodations.
2022-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Perfect location when visiting MTU. Very spacious and comfortable. Great sauna too!
2022-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Alan provides a fantastic place to stay when visiting Michigan Technological University or the Houghton/Hancock area in general. Everything was perfect - the location, the rooms, the parking, the kitchen, and all the little things that help to make us comfortable."
2022-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great stay in the Houghton area, especially if you're visiting the MTech and nature attractions. The sauna was a nice perk. We were able to use the WiFi to study a bit as well. Clean, comfortable beds, and Alan was a great communicator. Thank you for the stay."
2022-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Seamless and relaxing sums up my stay. Tastefully decorated - Alan describes the apartment very accurately. I very much enjoyed the sauna after skiing. The beds were very comfy! I will definitely stay again.

2021-12-01,4,Stayed a few nights,We had a wonderful stay. The Home was beautifully decorated and located close to downtown and MTU. I would recommend this place.
2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Clean and comfy… excellent quality linens. Perfect for MTU visit. Thank you
2021-10-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"We were in town to tour MI Tech and picked this Airbnb in large part due to it’s proximity to campus.
It was close and convenient but not really walking distance given the large hill up from campus into the surrounding residential area.
The couches and blankets were both super comfy and cozy. The scenery out the window in the upper room was lovely. The bedroom is large.
The sauna was a neat perk and the whole place was very clean and well supplied with the basics.
You will definitely hear the kiddos when they are home.
We did have a bit of trouble staying connected to the WiFi.
The spiral staircase being the only way to access the main part (bathroom/bedroom/kitchen) is a bit inconvenient when hauling bags but is a bit of fun and not unmanageable by any means.
And the rest of the place made up for it.
Would definitely recommend it to friends and/or go back again."
2021-10-01,4,Stayed a few nights,The view out the back window was gorgeous with the fall colors. Close to the MTU football field.
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,My fiancé and I stayed here and absolutely loved the place. Super clean and quiet with some nice woodsy views too. The sauna worked perfectly and there was plenty of space for us. Would gladly stay here again. 😁
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great location, comfortable beds and very clean. You will enjoy your time here!"
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,very clean
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"A huge & clean place that worth the price, it is extremely tranquil during the night and the sauna house is a surprise. Def considering living at the same place if visiting Houghton again in the future!"
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great location and unique space - was clean!
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Cute little place near to Michigan Tech campus and Houghton/Keweenaw Peninsula activities. Very clean and quiet. I would highly recommend.
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place was great. Perfect for what we needed. Clean, spacious and a great location."
2021-08-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"You will definitely hear the kids between 7 am and 8:30 pm. Also the stairway downstairs is a circular stairway. Cool to look at but hard to carry luggage down. Also, if you have an issue with walking at all, you will not be able to get down the stairs. The decor was cute."
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Alan is a great host! The place was exactly as described. Comfortable and a great location.

2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"One of the best stays with AirBnb - great work Alan!
Everything just as described, clean sheets and towels!
We (2 couples) felt home after a long day and this stay was very near to Isle royale seaplane (Yes! we visited Isle royale)."
2021-07-01,5,Stayed about a week,Great stay. Nice hosts. Super convenient to downtown. Would definitely stay here again for future trips.
2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"As the host said up front, you can definitely head the kiddos during the waking hours but that did not bother us in the least! Some folks may not appreciate that so maybe another location would be better for them. We had a GREAT stay!"
2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay. Excellent location and accommodations! Very comfortable.
2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This Airbnb is just as advertised. We didn’t watch the tv. But, we used the sauna, fabulous. The living are is nicely laid out and the kitchen is fully supplied with pots, pans, dishes and utensils. Alan put out the Murphy bed, so the two of us were well taken care of."
2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Exactly as pictured! We were very pleased and will be booking again in the future! Plenty of room and quiet, relaxing location. It’s clean and well cared for. Alan and Erin are great hosts and have provided you with all you will need."
2021-05-01,5,Stayed about a week,Great place to stay! Will definitely stay again the next time I’m in town. Very clean and friendly.
2021-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,"A nice, modern and comfortable place to stay near downtown Houghton. It is a quiet, out of the way location, that serves as a great home away from home. The hospitality was awesome!"
2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,i highly recommend staying here. The accommodations far exceeded what I was expecting. Beautifully decorated. The smallest detail is taken care of. A quiet location. Close to the Michigan Tech campus and downtown Houghton. n excellent host.
2021-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is a great, cozy place with spaces to relax, eat, sleep or sauna and conveniently located. The kitchenette is handy for cooking in and the beds are comfy. Alan is very responsive and available if you have questions or need anything. I would stay again if back in Houghton."
2021-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Fantastic stay! The bed was extremely comfortable, as were the couches. The sauna was the perfect way to unwind after a long day of hiking and exploring. Would love to stay here again!"
2021-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very clean and great location.
2021-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a great time, especially loved the sauna!"
2021-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Comfortable accommodations
2021-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great value for all of the space and having a sauna. Nice touches like quality bedding and towels and local roast whole bean coffee made it even better. And super clean.
Do note that it is a kitchenette, so not the place for those that plan on doing a lot of cooking. And the stairs are a somewhat steep spiral, which were fine for us but maybe not for everyone."
2021-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Place was very clean, updated, bright and cheery! I would definitely recommend to stay here.
Sauna was great too! I have to put one in our place!!"
2021-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,It is the perfect location for us to visit the Michigan Tech Campus. The rooms were very comfortable and spacious. It was perfect for our short visit. We definitely would stay here again.
2021-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"A wonderful place to stay in Houghton. Very comfortable, nice kitchen and a sauna! In town, with a woods feel, close to XC trails."
2021-03-01,4,Stayed over a week,"This is a cozy basement apartment, with an upstairs entry / sitting area, located on the edge of Houghton near ski and forest trails, and within close range of the university. Amenities are set-up especially well for weekend travellers, but Alan is open to longer-term stays and very amenable to helping facilitate them, such as I experienced. With space for an automobile, the location can be used by airbnb stays that are more ""drop-in"" while touring around the area, but it is also completely possible to use it more as a temporary residence, as well as to get along without a car, so long as one can walk up and down the steeper topography of the Houghton area.
Probably you will find it fun to order some take-out food for some of the evenings, but the kitchen is fully equipped with a full fridge and freezer, eating ware, and the basics for simple cooking upon a plug-in induction stove. Fancy meals are not recommended, but why cook like that when away from home, anyway?
The decorations are ""homey,"" ""northwoods,"" and representative of local artists. The space is very large, with sufficient room for a couple people to stay in a fold-down bed in the living room space with separation from another two people possible to share the bedroom area. Bring slippers as it is a basement, but rugs keep the feet warm, too. Smile as you hear the cat running along the ceiling and the laughter of a few kids, and feel yourself welcomed to Houghton, it's family-friendly atmosphere, and the close surroundings of the forests."
2021-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Our stay was great. Little touches like great towels and sheets impressed us. The sauna was a pleasant surprise.
2021-02-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Great base location for visiting our son at MTU. It is located at almost top of a hill so be sure your vehicle has all wheel drive or you might not get there in winter! Also note small kids live there so can be noisy when they are home. Overall very clean, all amenities we needed and sauna was a plus!"
2021-02-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Alan is very easy to work with and it is the best bang for your buck!
2021-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is one my favorite AirBnb places for a xc ski vacation. Spacious, conveniently located to Houghton/Hancock. 2 minutes to Mi Tech trails. We used the Sauna everyday! The new convection burner provided a bunch more cooking options than last time we stayed. They even let us borrow their waxroom to prep our skis!"
2021-01-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Came up for a guys snowmobile weekend and the location was great! Very spacious apartment and plenty of parking for a couple tow rigs! Took us 5 minutes to get to the trail head. Not sure if you could actually ride to the trail head or not. Sauna was great after some hard miles of riding. We did experience some unexpected noise from the family in the early hours of the morning, which didn’t allow us to get the greatest sleep. The apartment is connected to the host house, so keep this in mind when booking. Overall, good experience and served its purpose for a great snowmobiling weekend."
2020-12-01,4,Stayed a few nights,
2020-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,Very Clean. Easy Check-in. Great communication. Loved the sauna!
2020-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We thoroughly enjoyed our stay. Loved the sauna and other amenities. The bed was super comfortable with high quality linens. Great location at a great price!
2020-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great Location
2020-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great host and the space was perfect for my needs. I enjoyed the sauna and the local coffee provided. The location was perfect for the trails and the college where I was teaching over the weekend.
2020-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Very nice, clean. The sauna was really great. Nice, large kitchenette with microwave and fridge. There is not a stove or oven. The rooms are connected to a family home with a separate entrance."
2020-10-01,5,Stayed over a week,"The space was bigger than I expected and had very comfortable couches and beds. Check in was super easy, and Alan was very quick with communication. The quiet neighborhood and easy access made my long term stay quite convenient."
2020-09-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Great location, loved the sauna."
2020-09-01,5,Stayed about a week,"We enjoyed a great week in the Keweenaw Peninsula with this apartment as our home base. Great location, clean and comfortable, with everything we needed. The description is truthful and accurate. There is so much to see and do in the area!"
2020-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Lovely space with special touches. Comfy beds. Close to everything we needed in Houghton.
2020-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Alan’s place was clean, convenient, and as described. Note that Houghton is a hilly town and one of the streets to get here is VERY steep. We had a great stay and would definitely recommend! The sauna was especially nice after a long day of hiking."
2020-08-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Great location, very easy check-in/checkout process"
2020-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My husband and I booked Alan's place the day before we took a motorcycle trip to visit to the Keweenaw. (We kinda had to do it last second since we had to understand what the weather would be like.) Anyways, Alan very graciously accommodated our late request and the home was positioned PERFECTLY for us to jump off to Copper Harbor, Calumet, and everywhere else. I can't recommend this location enough if you're looking to establish a ""base camp"" for a Copper Country visit. Houghton itself is a fabulous town with some pretty good eats going on - I am from Esky originally but have since become pretty ""city-fied"" down in Chicago, so I'm all picky and junk when it comes to food, and these places stand up to city-level fare. Note that Houghton is HILLY so bring your legs. Wait, I should be reviewing the accommodations not the town... suffice it to say Alan's place was perfect. There was privacy and all the amenities we needed (and a SAUNA, which made every Swedish cell in my body leap with joy) and a real comfortable ""homey"" feeling about the place. The whole set up is quite clever and thoughtful. If we head back up that way again we will most certainly look Alan's abode up."
2020-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,Very clean and cozy. Close to downtown. Would recommend to friends and family.
2020-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We loved Alan's place. From the deer that wandered through the back yard one morning to the comfy bed, it was better than we hoped. It was very clean and we felt very comfortable there. It's location was perfect for us as we explored the area. Alan was quick to reply and available if we needed help. He offered good advice on where to eat or get things. The sauna was very nice. We would certainly stay here again."
2020-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Alan's place was fantastic. We were in town for a short visit with family, and we found the apartment very comfortable, spacious and clean. Our kids loved it, too. We would definitely stay there again. Highly recommended!"
2020-07-01,5,Stayed one night,Alan and Erin were outstanding hosts with a lovely home. We loved the walk to the nature trails and downtown. The space was very accommodating and comfortable. We especially liked the sauna! This was our first time in Houghton and we definitely will be back!
2020-07-01,5,Stayed about a week,Great place! Comfortable space for two couples. Excellent host
2020-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Alan was the greatest Airbnb host I’ve sver had. His communication was outstanding! He listed a plethora of places to visit for food, drinks, hiking, and much more. The apartment itself was well furnished and comfortable plus we had the option to use the propane grill on the porch. Lastly, you are only 1 mile from downtown Houghton so walking was the optimal mode of transportation. Can’t wait to stay again!"
2020-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,Listing perfectly describes the place! We were in town visiting family and it was great to have a place to relax and sleep for the night! The girls loved the little stuffed animals and the coffee was much appreciated!

2020-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,The space was very clean and neat. The beds were very comfortable with nice bedding and a lot of pillows. The kids loved the spiral staircase and the special little stuffed animals the host left on their bed. The sauna topped off the entire UP experience!
2020-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Central location. 5 minutes from campus. 3 minutes to trailhead. Spacious. Comfortable. Sauna. Honored to be their first AirBnb guest.
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This space was exactly what we needed. Very walkable and such an amazing space. We will be back!
2024-06-01,5,Stayed about a week,"The location was great. Looking forward to returning in the fall. I got very sick and had to check out early, she was caring. Unbelievable the apartment was great for even a sick old lady.! Love staying in the heart of ‘Hancock! Great host Talia!"

2023-12-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Excellent location for all we were looking for! Absolutely beautiful and unique place!
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Can’t beat the location, easy walk to any of downtown Houghton’s restaurants, bars, shops, and the waterfront. Cozy space!"
2023-12-01,3,Stayed a few nights,Towel heater is aesthetic
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"such a cute little place for our short vacay! amazing location for getting food and drinks. there was free parking directly across the street which was super convenient (even though Talia left a parking pass for us for somewhere else). it’s also not far from many of the abandoned mines or cool lookout/hiking spots in the area. Talia was easy to contact and very helpful from the start! the only thing i would note is that the fire detectors are sensitive (we learned the hard way while cooking :p) so maybe open a window just in case! i loved how extra towels, sheets, and pillows were provided. also want to add the shower is amazing!! some airbnbs lack in that area so wanted to shout it out. cute decor and vibe for entire apartment. great place to come back and relax at after being out all day :) would definitely come back!!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This property is in a great location. Very walkable and easy access to MTU.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What a great spot at river level, on Lakeside within a short walk to the bridge! Talia was a gracious host, and this cozy, contemporary space was perfect for a single occupant in town for work. Very thoughtfully finished throughout with all-modern appliances. Wireless that was faster than my work-at-home office. Parking right outside. The Houghton Waterfront Trail is practically right outside the door and downtown and the Shelden Ave. Historic District is one block uphill. Enough food choices for an extended stay. I'm involved in urban planning and design, and this was a great point from which to explore everything that Houghton and MTU have done or are doing to transform the town.
The hosts have done a great job finishing the interior of this converted space and I couldn't have been happier with my stay. Will be looking to return if we have more work in the area (and even if we don't!)."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My husband and I are 80, I have mobility issues so the home was very comfortable and safe for me. It is near the bridge and the heart of Houghton/Hancock area where I feel very close to family on both sides of Portage. We enjoyed the location for that reason and it was quiet on the backside of main street. The host Talia was very helpful, which made our stay wonderful! We are looking forward to seeing the finished Bridgeview park walk. We will looking forward to our next visit."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I was in Houghton to play a concert with the Keweenaw Symphony Orchestra. This location was great - I was just downhill from the main Houghton drag, and within walking distance of Roy's Pasties (always a plus point). The apartment had most everything I needed (except a tea kettle, but it was easy enough to boil water) and was quite clean. I had trouble logging in to wi-fi and Talia immediately assisted me over the phone. Overall a very nice stay. Highly recommended."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Best Airbnb ever! I have finally found the best experience. The location and parking was amazing, even though there was construction it still worked out! The place was so modern and chic. The living area was perfect for night time relaxing and watching my tv shows. Kitchen was perfect for my morning coffee and breakfast. Bathroom great size for getting ready. Bed room was great size for my husband and I and the bed was so comfortably! It was hard to wake up in the morning and get out of bed. Talia was great at communication and appreciated how fast she was at replying back! Defiantly a 10/10!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This was just the place for Copper Country getaway. The old parking deck is gone and the location is going to be beautiful. There’s even a view of Hancock and Mount Ripley! Talia’s place has everything you need and it’s so close to everything you might want to do!
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Responsive, clearly a renovated space but was also clearly done in a professional way (caulking / painting over all construction was meticulously done). Really made you feel like you were in an upscale area but with a great price. Furnishings all very clean and new. A lot of thought went into this Air BnB and it shows."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Everything was as described. Very clean & comfortable. Great location… so close to downtown shops, bars and restaurants."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place to center your visit the beautiful Keweenaw peninsula!
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Nice place. Super clean.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We loved our stay in downtown Houghton! It doesn’t get much better than this location! Right downtown, but off of the main road to avoid loud late night college students. The only thing I’d recommend is to be aware of the size of your luggage. My husband and j shared one large suitcase and there wasn’t really a great place to have it open on the luggage rack! Highly recommend Talia’s place though. We will be back next time we are home visiting family!"
2023-08-01,4,Stayed with kids,"The apartment was as described, looked just like the photos. The location was perfect, walking distance to everything in downtown.
During our stay the city was working outside and this made getting to the location tricky as well as included a 7 am wake-up call from construction equipment 10 feet from the window. This wasn’t desirable but out of the hosts hands. The host did refund some money for the inconvenience. Only complaint we had was the sleeper couch in the living room was extremely uncomfortable. Will stay here again in coming trips to Houghton! Thank you for your hospitality!"
2023-08-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Very comfortable unit in heart of Houghton. Easy walk to shops and restaurants. Easy access to roads and parking.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This was a wonderful place the lay your head in the beautiful city of Houghton. Talia was an amazing host and was immensely attentive throughout our stay to any inquires. I will most definitely look for this listing for any future visits.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We had a great stay in Houghton! Talia was a great host!
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Talias place was very nice and clean. She was upfront with us about the construction going on nearby. We also loved the location!
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My wife and I stayed for 2 nights. The rental was perfect for just us. The décor of the rental is great, and I took some of the ideas back home with me. You can walk to all of the restaurants and/or shops on your side of the canal. If you don't mind a longer walk, then you can also walk to all the restaurants and/or shops on the other side of the canal as well.
It would be an excellent stay for visiting the University, Canals, or Copper Harbor."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The location is amazing but I will say the photo in the listing is a little misleading. The unit is completely under a parking garage so you have to walk 250-500 feet or so until you actually get to the riverfront walkway. You can’t access it directly from in front of the rental unit. The place was impeccably clean and the host was super responsive. There was garage construction going on in the parking garage and so she gave us a discount on the stay for the inconvenience. Highly recommend this space if you’re looking to be right in downtown Houghton near everything. Due to the fact that the space is in a parking garage, the views from the two windows in the space is not great, but again, we booked it for the location and it didn’t disappoint! Highly recommend!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We travel to Houghton several times a year and this was our first time staying at this apartment. It was a beautifully decorated and comfortable space. I loved that it was right downtown, too!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Perfect spot right on the water and walking distance from everything.
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Apartment was great! Very clean with great accommodations.
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great location with walkable access to MTU and restaurants. The inside space is beautifully renovated, crisp and clean. Talia’s communication and instructions made the whole process easy."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The location just cannot be beat - walking distance to so many restaurants, coffee shops, stores, and of course the waterway! The apartment was clean and well-equipped, and very brightly lit (the dimmer switches are a great feature). No problems at all for us!"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I stayed here by myself. Very comfortable and as described. Industrial remodel but very clean and felt comfortable. Would and will stay here Agian. They paid attention to detail and you can tell they care. Overall great stay.
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Our second visit was as enjoyable as the first. There are so many wonderful things about this space but it's location simply reins supreme.
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Awesome place to stay, and decorated so cute!"
2023-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Extremely clean and updated unit. Absolutely great location. I've been to Houghton several times, it was really great to be walking distance to everything downtown."
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a terrific stay at Talia's place. We were visiting Michigan Tech with our son, and the property was so close to both the campus as well as lots of shops and restaurants. Talia was easy to communicate with and the place was clean, cute, and cozy. I would high recommend!"
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"As a host, Talia was wonderful. Super helpful and flexible. I left my Bluetooth speaker and coordinating getting it back was easy. The apartment is very nice. It’s well set up, well lit, and comfortable. The location is amazing. It’s like 400 feet from Keweenaw brewing company and close to all other downtown type things."
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Nice location and very well furnished. Comfortable apartment. Worth what we paid for it. Was hoping there would be a better view of the canal, but the location is perfect for visiting Houghton/MTU and It was very neat, clean, and had everything you would want on a short or long visit. Host was very responsive and helpful."
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The place is downtown which made it very convenient to walk for all of our errands. It snowed while we visited and the covered parking area was just like having a garage. We would stay at Talia's place again.
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great location if you want to be downtown.
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great stay and as advertised. Would highly recommend any one stay here if you are looking for a 2-4 person place in the area.
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great location!! Very convenient! And we loved our stay here!!
2022-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We had a great stay with our 6-month old. Impressively clean and close to everything. Easy parking, access, and check-in."
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We use Talia’s place from October 12-15 during our trip to the UP. Her apartment location is unbeatable, just steps from Downtown and all the shops, bars and restaurants in Houghton.
The apartment is so cozy, well decorated and charm, that invites to enjoy time there and in town. By far this apartment shines above a other listings we have seen in the area.
From her place the visits to Copper Harbor, Keweenaw Peninsula and the Porcupine Mountines are a short drive, and makes Her apartment a perfect central location.
We were also lucky to enjoy fall season (just slightly pass peak) and drive through some of the best scenic routes we have seen in Michigan.
Love Talia’s place and how easy all the process was to get in and out."
2022-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We loved our stay, pictures were accurate and space was super clean! The bedroom is right next to a road that travels through the parking ramp so it was a little noisy at times, if your a light sleeper like me just bring some ear plugs. I wrote some and slept great- bed is also super comfy! Highly recommend."
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Perfect location. Very clean and convenient. I will be back!
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This apartment was awesome! The location is perfect--convenient to everything in town. Everything is so clean and modern, lots of space, and awesome to have a full kitchen and laundry. This is my first choice for future trips to Houghton!!"
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful place, great location, and great host. The only downside is I think this place will become very popular and I won't get to stay in the future, but it will definitely be the first place I look at for future trips."
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Absolutely wonderful, comfortable place to stay. Great communication!"
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We really enjoyed our stay. This location was centrally located to all of the places we wanted to visit. Talia, thank you for adding the AC, we think the apt would have been a little stuffy or hot without it.
We were up here for a 40th-year class reunion at MTU and when compared to the room at the Vault Hotel where our friends stayed we felt this was a much better choice. One suggestion for improving the apt would be to add a foldup luggage rack or dresser to the closet or bedroom area."
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Perfect location, price and accommodations! Very efficient (but still so warm) use of space, colors and decor. Used the washer/dryer, so that was appreciated mid-vacation. No suggestions for improvements. 5-star all the way!"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great clean apartment in an amazing location. Would highly recommend.
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Absolutely loved it. Clean, cozy and so close to everything downtown. We visit the UP often and it was a breath of fresh air staying there. We will be returning!"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great space in a really convenient location!
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This is a beautiful place to stay in Houghton! It’s a modern style apartment that’s honestly nicer than mine back home. My fiancé and I had a lovely stay and enjoyed how close it was to downtown restaurants and shops. He is a student at MTU so it was a treat to get out of the dorms and into a comfortable residential setting with a “real bed.” I wish I could have stayed longer and highly recommend this residence for rental.
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Talia and Brian’s place is super cool. Great soft contemporary vibe. Everything is new and well thought out. There are lights in every kitchen cabinet and drawer! The location is perfect to explore downtown Houghton with a view of Hancock. The real library and The Library (bar) are just a few steps away. Stroll down the walkway along the Pilgrim River to grab a sweet or pasty at Roy’s and sit at one of the many picnic tables to enjoy. I can’t wait to come back to stay and have shared news of Talia and Brian’s treasure with many friends already.
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Absolutely darling space in the most convenient location! This suite has every luxury someone could ask for... kitchen, bathroom and living amenities abound. Clean, comfortable and worth every penny."
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Talia was an incredible host who was very attentive to my questions prior to, and during my stay. The space is very clean and offers an excellent location the best restaurants and bars in Houghton. I would absolutely recommend this place to anyone visiting Houghton."
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Talia’s suite was absolutely perfect! Great location close to downtown and walking distance to many restaurants. Inside the suite was clean and modern. The bed was very comfortable. I would definitely book this suite when visiting Houghton again.
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Wonderful place and convenient location in town! With all new furnishings you can really tell they took time to design and update the apartment with care. This is a great Airbnb!
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"It was a very nice, quick stay. Great location and was very secluded."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great location, very quiet and private. Easy access to town."
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We loved everything about our stay. Furniture was very comfortable, rooms tastefully decorated, bedding and linens beautiful and super comfortable. Kitchen had everything you needed for cooking, and making coffee. The whole place had everything we needed to feel at home. Wish I could move in permanently :)"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I almost hate to tell everyone how great this place is, it'll make it harder to get an opening. We have stayed in these wonderful cabins before and already have another stay booked. The cabins are clean, comfortable and conveniently located to everything. It's close to town, Michigan Tech, skiing and all the other fun things the area has to offer. JoLynn is a great host and highly recommend."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We so enjoyed your cabin. It was quaint but so comfortable with everything we needed. I have shared your listing with my family, my grandson attends Tech so we will be making additional trips."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The space was fabulous !
JoLyn provided everything you could think of to make it feel like home.
Loved all the kitchen and bathing amenities. Much better than other places. Well stocked.
The notebook explaining everything as well as a COMPLETE list of places and spaces was above and beyond. So helpful.
The place was easy to find via JoLyn’s instructions. All the instructions for use of electronics and appliances was super clear.
I would recommend the space to anyone visiting the Keweenau Peninsula. It is an ideal central location.
JoLyn was a great host!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We will definitely be staying there again. Everything you want or need in an AirB&B. Full kitchen, good towels, clean bathroom, comfortable beds and plenty of room. We had a great stay"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Awesome stay! One of the cleanest airbnbs I’ve stayed in. Perfect place to stay. Very peaceful. Would stay again!

2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Perfect location. Very close to town but it felt more like you were in the north woods. A doe was even there to greet us when we arrived. The cabin was comfortable and had a lot of amenities.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great host, cabin, and location. Everything was very clean and cozy. JoLynn was very friendly and responsive. We look forward to staying here during our next trip to the UP!"

2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Thank you for a great stay! Always my first choice when I’m in Houghton Area. The cabin was immaculate just like the last time we came a few years ago. JoLynn ‘s cabins are the best of places I enjoy staying at when in Copper Country :) thank you JoLynn!
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We had such a fantastic time staying at JoLynn's cabin! She is a great host and the cabin was spotless. We will for sure be back for another weekend getaway!

2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Perfect location, cozy and clean. Wonderful host."
2023-01-01,5,Stayed about a week,The cabin was clean and cozy . We were there between Christmas and New Years and JoLynn had put a Christmas tree up. The kitchen had everything needed to prepare a meal and there was a nice variety of spice and seasonings available. The bed was very comfortable. It is nothing fancy but had the perfect look for a UP cabin. The individual room radiators worked perfectly to keep the cabin warm. There are some books and toys available to entertain yourself. I imagine the view in the summer would be great next to the golf course. We had neighbors during our stay but did not hear a sound. The cabins are spaced for privacy. I would be happy to stay there again.
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This was a great find Convenient to the surrounding area not too far from anything but far enough away that you feel like you’re in a relaxing place Definitely consider staying here again
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"JoLynn’s cabin was very accommodating, clean, comfortable and cozy. It was the perfect stay just outside of Houghton yet close to everything including trails and boardwalk across the street!"

2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This was our second stay at Jolynn's. We had a very relaxing time in this cozy cabin.

Will stay here again!
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We had a wonderful stay at JoLynn’s cabin. It was very well stocked and we were very comfortable. JoLynn is very quick to communicate and will answer all of your questions. We hope to be able to stay here again some time in the future!

2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"She was VERY attentive to our arrival, snow clearing and if we had/needed anything. BEAUTIFUL home and in a great location to MTU, which was the reason for my visit. I have favorited this to my list and will now be the place I stay when visiting my daughter and nephew at MTU! The price was also amazingly affordable. Not many are like that these days and a single mom of 3 with 2 in college…..it was a relief to know I wasn’t deciding on what limbs I had to sell."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We really enjoyed our stay. The floor heating worked wonderfully to keep the house cozy. We appreciated how clean everything was. The furniture was super comfortable. A well stocked kitchen with nice appliances made it easy to fix meals at the house. We were close to Michigan Tech, but the setting was peaceful. We would love to stay again on a future visit."

2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"A great location, close to campus while still being private."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is an excellent place. It is not really walkable to campus or downtown Houghton but definitely bikeable. I had my own bike so I did not need them but she provides bikes as an add on rental!
The place is incredibly maintained and cleaned. It is excellant for 3 people. Really a couple more could be comfortable if needed.
Great place and host."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Irina’s house provides convenient access to Lake Superior and the Keweenaw Peninsula of Upper MI. The house was easy to find, based on directions that she provided. We found it to be clean, comfortable, and quiet. Compared to costs of other short term options, including hotels, her house was an excellent value. We will certainly consider it again, if/when we plan another trip to the Houghton area."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Peaceful surroundings close to MTU campus! Irina was very quick to respond with any questions via text and phone conversations.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,Irina’s place was fantastic! It was by far one of the most well appointed Airbnb’s that we’ve stayed at. Beautiful home…everything was brand new! Top notch washer and dryer and she even had laundry detergent and dryer sheets. We had to do an unexpected load of laundry so this was a lifesaver. Her place is about 6 minutes from Michigan Tech’s campus so great location if you are traveling to visit the school. Very clean and Irina was very responsive. Will defiantly stay here again. Thanks Irina!
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Our Airbnb experience with Irina and her rental was a great experience. The home met our needs for our stay, Irina was incredibly responsive, the location was a quick drive to downtown, the surroundings had lush wildflowers, deers, and other wildlife. The home is new construction, so everything was in great shape. The furniture was comfortable, and we felt home. I absolutely recommend staying here."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,This was a wonderful home and a great host. Irina was always responsive to any questions and helpful any time I reached out. Super friendly and couldn't ask for a better host. We would definitely stay again! She and the house made for a wonderful respite after 16 hours on the road and a great family reunion. Thank you for having us!

2023-05-01,5,Stayed over a week,This place is great. I recommend it to everyone as it is easy access to everywhere. This place is clean comfortable and surrounded by trees. This is my second time to stay here and I hope to come stay again in the near future.
2023-04-01,5,Stayed over a week,"This Airbnb is so clean and setup to walk into and stay for as long or as short as you want. I stayed from January 2, 2023 until April 26, 2023. The only thing I asked for was a ring doorbell. This was for me, due to me being alone for me to feel safe if someone came to the door: just in case you’re wondering why there is one (place very safe no one came). The point is they did whatever I needed with me being alone: needed or not. I plan on coming back next month for a couple of weeks. I will only stay here from now on as you cannot beat the hospitality."

2023-09-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"The house was great and was right off the highway, which made travel up to Copper Harbor and down to the Porcupine Mountains super easy!

2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Our stay was wonderful! The house is SO clean, so comfortable, and homey! The location is great! 10-15 to Houghton, just about an hour to Copper Harbor. It’s a wonderful spot if you are looking for a good central spot for a stay on the Keweenaw. We would absolutely stay at this property again! Loved the “clean” products that are provided, as well as the use of laundry! Such a lifesaver traveling with young kiddos.
Thanks for a wonderful first UP stay!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We loved staying here. Everything was in just the right place, so it felt like home. Very clean, comfortable, and spacious. The hosts were super friendly and proactive in their communication."

2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Melanie was a wonderful host, answered all questions, and communicated before, during, and after our stay.

2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,Great place-cozy and peaceful environment!
2023-07-01,5,Stayed about a week,"This was our second stay here! We come to visit family and appreciate having a place to ourselves after a long day. There’s a firm, medium, and soft bed. WiFi is easy to access and the home is comfy. The area is quiet- mornings are filled with birds chirping and the occasional rooster crowing or truck driving by. All of the laundry detergent is unscented which is a big bonus for my mom who is very smell-sensitive! The home is modern and functional while still having some old charm."
2023-07-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Very clean and well equipped house! Location is good too! Only suggestion is to add screens to windows for bedrooms so guests could enjoy the fresh breeze during the nights.
2023-06-01,4,Stayed with kids,This place is a great central location to travel up the peninsula or around to other activities. The price point was well worth it!

2023-03-01,4,Stayed with kids,"We stayed here for snowmobiling. It was late season so although it was only 2 blocks from the trail the pavement was bare. Parking for trucks and trailers is very tight. We loaded the sleds at night for lack of room. Any time other than winter parking shouldn't be an issue.
The house is very nice and clean with the price making it a good deal. As with most Airbnb read the cancellation policy. It is costly if you have to cancel."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place and close to where we were working in down town Houghton

Kitchen was minimally equipped and stocked compared to other homes we've stayed. Expiration dates should be checked on kitchen products left onsite.
Some concern about air quality, given standing stagnant water in the basement."

2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The house was updated and the decor was really nice. We went with another couple so it was great to have us upstairs with a restroom and they were on the main floor with a half bath. South Range has a nice place to eat, Houghton and Hancock are very close. I’m very grateful we got to stay at this Airbnb. Mostly because of its location, but also because it is a very comfortable, updated home . I thank Melanie for her quick responses and hospitality she gave us with all the amenities. 🥰"

2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is a great stay if you are visiting Michigan Tech or even just want to explore that area. There isn't much in South Range but it's easy to get to a lot of other places. The house was really clean, enjoyed the Aveda products and Mrs Myers soaps. Good space with 3 bedrooms that all had Queen beds, 2 were not as soft so if you like a firm bed those are good. Great communications. One minor issue is really light water pressure in the shower."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Melanie was very attentive and addressed our needs quickly. The house was very clean and suited our needs.

Kitchen is stocked with essentials for cooking. Backyard grill and fire ring means the fun never has to stop! We were so close to everything we wanted to do! 10 minutes from Michigan Tech. Even closer to downtown Houghton and Hancock. Less than an hour to Copper Harbor. We hiked, kayaked and explored our way around the area. We were close to everything and had a good house to come “home” to rest on comfortable beds."

We only entered through the front, but there is a back door which enters by the kitchen which would've been smart for all our ski / Snowboard boots. 1 hr 10 min from Porkies, 1 hour from Boho and less than half hour from Swedetown. Plenty of bath towels. Not a lot of kitchen towels but we washed with our laundry. Vacuum was accessible which is good for a long stay. Grocery stores less than 10 min away."

The place was very clean and decorated nicely. The apartment had nice space and lots of natural light. We didn’t cook but seemed like it would have been well suited. Owner was response and friendly. I would recommend this to anyone staying in the area. It is on the second floor and has a bit of stairs if that’s an issue for anyone. Very pleased with our stay. Way better than any local hotel :)"

2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Melissa’s place was a wonderful spacious apartment. Loved the retro touches along with some original features too. Walkable with a few restaurants and shops nearby, as well as an easy stroll to the walkway by the river. The apartment was clean and had everything as described.

Would definitely stay again!!"

2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,Beautiful space in a prime location. The unit was more than I expected. Small details of hospitality were noticed everywhere in the unit.

2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Mellisa was a wonderful host. Would definitely stay there again. Always something going on in park. Was nice to watch every night.
2023-07-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Melissa's place is very pleasant and conveniently located for getting to Houghton or to go explore the Keweenaw peninsula. The only down side is that it is located on the main road through town and there is no air conditioning. That was not a problem in terms of temperature but we slept with the windows open to get a breeze. So noise on the street is easily heard. I was awakened one morning before 6:00 by motorcycles headed up the road.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,Really enjoyed the place.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"Melissa's place is truly wonderful. It is super cozy, and it is the living definition of hygge :)) Great location downtown, close to everything, walkable, clean, and well stocked with absolutely everything you could need."

2024-06-01,5,Group trip,"A family group with 5 adults had a great 2 day stay at Angela's beautiful spot in picturesque Houghton!

2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great space and location for a quick weekend visit (2 adults and 2 high school aged kids). The ~4 block walk back from downtown is all uphill. Would love to stay again on my next visit to Houghton!
2024-03-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Nice little two bedroom apartment in a small apartment building. Nothing too fancy, but simple and as described. Well located only a walk from downtown and a quick drive to campus. A bit outdated of a building and apartment - two physical keys instead of keyless for instance - but otherwise very nice and would definitely stay there again!"
2024-03-01,4,Stayed one night,"The home itself was great. Very clean, no funny smells and comfortable. Angela was always very responsive.
The upstairs tenants were extremely loud from 9:30 to 12:30. Stomping around, speaking loud enough to always hear them. Made it very difficult to sleep. The book states to contact Angela if we have any issues but who knew it would go on for hours…."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place !
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The apartment was very clean and well appointed. We had everything we needed, plus thoughtful extras like coffee pods for the Kerig. Angela was responsive and accommodating."

2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We enjoyed our stay here during Labor Day Weekend! An easy walk to downtown Houghton and a great view of Hancock across the Portage!
2023-08-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"The place was as described and nicely decorated. The couch was comfy. The beds were only ok. Angela was easy to work with and communicated early with details. She was very friendly throughout. The parking was close to the unit and the first floor was very convenient.
The place ended up being challenging for us, we think because it didn’t have air circulation so it felt stuffy and flared allergy symptoms. Because of that I won’t be able to use this place again even though it was spacious and cute. Also, there were no recycling bins and we like to recycle. The walls were pretty thin in the building. I could hear the neighbors talking and their phone vibrating on their table from my bedroom- so not a private place."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,We had a great stay! Definitely will be back with our family!
2023-08-01,5,Group trip,We stayed one night before leaving on the ferry to Isle Royale. Worked well as a place to assemble and only a short drive to the ferry terminal.

2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,There was plenty of space. Everything was nice and clean
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was a great little apartment. It was the perfect “home base” while we moved our student into Michigan Tech.
The only slightly negative thing was that it’s located on a corner. There was traffic noise that our family isn’t used to. If you already live in town, this is probably a non- issue for you. Overall, we were pleased!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We enjoy staying here every time we visit our student at MTU. Very convenient.

2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"When visiting Houghton, we often stay in these apartments. It works well for a family to stay in and gives easy access to campus and the rest of the area."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Clean, modest, lower-floor apartment. Comfy bed, and super-comfy couch. Host was very accommodating when I asked if I could check out late (plane wasn't leaving till 7pm).
A bit hard to get around without wheels. There's a small grocery store a little ways away that's walkable. The town is just down the hill. (Pro-tip: save your morning shower until you walk back up the hill to the apartment. Then you'll want the shower!).
Kitchen had almost no condiments etc, so bring all your food in. Needed more creamers supplied, and better quality coffee (better than Dunkin Donuts).
Sometimes loud vehicles drive up the hill next to the apartment, but that wasn't a problem. When the upstairs neighbor is home and walking around, it's stompy and loud, and sounds like they're in the apartment with you. But they don't stay up late or anything, or play music.
Comfy place. Host was pretty responsive."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,Angela’s was perfect for us. It was within walking distance of the main restaurant area os Houghton. It was ver confortable and clean.

We were so happy with the appartment that during our time in town, we made sure to bring as many friends as possible to show them the appartment for their future needs. I strongly recommend and I hope to stay there on our next trips to Houghton.
Thank you Angela!"

The house was very clean and the size of the house was very comfortable for the 5 of us. The Roku stick was nice. The kitchen was well stocked. We had what we needed for the meals we made at the house. my only suggestion is that maybe the bathroom wash clothes need to be bleached. They were a bit dingy and had some stains. Nothing major.

2022-10-01,5,Group trip,"Absolutely wonderful house. Immaculately clean.
They have every amenity you could want. The house is full of nice little touches, Including extra toothbrush and toothpaste in the bathroom! They have gone above and beyond what I have learned to expect in an Airbnb.
The information booklet that they made for the house has great.
We’d definitely stay again!"

2022-09-01,5,Group trip,Beautiful place!!
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Absolutely beautiful and new inside. The central location was perfect, with easy access to the main highway. The home was well stocked for us to prepare our meals. They were very responsive when we had questions. We look forward to our next visit."

2022-08-01,5,Group trip,"Clean, comfortable, modern place to stay."
2022-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Our stay At the Accent House at Beach View, was, as Mary Poppins would say.. ""Practically Perfect in Every Way"". The house was clean and bright, the layout of the house was very conducive to having children and/or more than one family. The master bedroom had it's own bathroom as well as a great closet area that included a Pack-and-Play 'room' that could easily be made dark and quiet for an infant to sleep well. The other two bedrooms had roomy dressers and closets with an ample number of hangers and shared the other bathroom. The kitchen was well stocked with tableware, cooking pans and useful appliances. Laundry facilities too! The location was awesome! Walking distance to the Hancock Beach for swimming, picnics, swings, playgrounds and paddleboarding or kayaking! All this AND a secure garage, which is wonderful if you bring paddleboards, bikes or other 'toys' that you want secured overnight. If we ran out of anything, our hosts were very responsive in making sure we got a supply quickly. If we had questions about anything, they were also very quick in getting back to us to let us know the information we needed. All in all, this was an amazing place to stay. Very highly recommend."
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful Airbnb!! Has everything you need for your stay and more. Plenty of room, lots of closet space and living space. Check-in was an easy process & the hosts are very responsive. We couldn’t ask for a better Airbnb experience!"
2022-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,Had a great stay. Clean. Had everything we needed.
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Andrew & Christina are wonderful hosts. They were very responsive and assisted us with all our requests and questions. The place is very clean, roomy, and comfortable. The large living area provides ample space and the bedrooms are a good size. The beds, pillows and couch were just right. The very close proximity to the park, beach, picnic area were an added bonus. We will definitely stay here again if we are in the area."
2022-08-01,5,Group trip,Great place to stay to explore the area. Andrew and Christina were excellent with getting back to me and answering any question I had.
2022-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Lots of space. Very clean. The kitchen is lovely. We enjoyed the proximity to the beach/park (truly walking distance… on a road with 50 mph speed limit, but not super busy). Great location. Easy drive to McLain State Park, KC Bonkers, and Chutes & Ladders Park for those traveling with children. Hosts were very responsive and kind."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Wonderful experience! Perfect for a family of 6 who needs more room than a hotel room. Close location to water, Houghton, McClain State Park, MTU, etc. Well stocked kitchen enabled us to eat in for meals for convenience. Detached garage parking with use of a garage door opener. Wonderful communication with owners. We would definately stay at this location again!"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We sure enjoyed our stay in this comfortable, neat, clean house. It is walking distance to Hancock Beach which was nice for us and the children. We definitely would stay here again."
2022-06-01,5,Group trip,It’s perfect. Canal view new construction. The host has everything that you can expect in an airbnb. We stayed cause we visited Michigan Tech and that’s 5min away. The bridge doesn’t have tolls. Highly recommend staying here over even hotels in the area. You even have a covered oversized car garage.
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Great little space for two people. Cozy and close enough to MIchigan Tech
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Jenn & Jason thought of everything to make guests feel comfortable. We regret that we did not spend more time enjoying the quiet of their beautiful property. Definitely a destination to recharge.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Cozy stay with all the necessities
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This Airbnb had everything we needed for a quiet weekend getaway. Jenn and Jason went above and beyond by providing a clean comfortable space with hot morning coffee and cinnamon rolls. The space was super cozy- cottage core and slightly eclectic vibe while being clean.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Beautiful spot. Cozy air bnb. The vibes were very high here. Would definitely recommend!
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Jenn & Jason are friendly and quick to communicate!
The bed was so comfy, the shower was wonderful (nice touch with the eucalyptus), and the proximity to the nearby beach and other areas of the Keweenaw Peninsula we wanted to explore was convenient. And of course, the animals were absolute gems. Waking up to sheep directly out the door is the best.
Stay here if you want peace & comfort in the beautiful UP. We’d love to stay again!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Granny's place is amazing -- cozy, charming, clean. Jenn and Jason were the nicest of hosts and we enjoyed mingling with the farm animals. The delicious coffee and cinnamon rolls provided each morning were a welcome treat. Can't wait to try their Camp site next!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We really enjoyed our stay. It was very peaceful and quiet, while not being too far from town. Jenn and Jason were very friendly while also respecting our space and schedule. There was a nice fenced in space for our dog and the cinnamon rolls were delicious and very convenient to get us going in the morning!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Granny's Place was *perfect* for a 5-day getaway with my small dog. Jenn was very quick to text and helped with questions. The area was very peaceful and it was great to see the animals and be out of the city but within an easy drive distance to stores and sites to see. If you're visiting the area I highly recommend!!
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,cozy place at a farm. the sheep and chickens add to the experience which calms the mind and soothes the soul. jenn and jason provided homemade cinnamon rolls and farm roasted coffee in the morning which added to the experience.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,So beautiful and relaxing !!
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Sweet little apartment on a well-kept and obviously well loved small farm. Sheep were a very cool backdrop and the dog run area was a definite plus while traveling. What an Airbnb should be- a creative and private extension of someone’s home space. We spent most of our time exploring the Keewenaw but it was a v comfortable spot for my son dog and I to come home to. Would definitely visit again!
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,EXCELLENT HOSTS! Very personable. Granny's Place is tiny but has everything we needed for a peaceful stay!
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I really enjoyed my stay. I felt right at home in their cozy and beautifully decorated space. It is close to Breakers Beach and not far from downtown. I loved the cinnamon rolls and also bought some of Jenn’s handmade soap. Their place is a gem🙂.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"What a sweet place! Yes, it’s a tiny space, but it’s also on a peaceful farm, not too far from Houghton and very close to Lake Superior. There are more amenities than described, and we really felt welcomed! Lux towels, super soft sheets, eucalyptus in the shower 💜, large bottles of products, and games and books everywhere. I’m so glad we found this spot!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place was a perfect spot to enjoy Houghton and make a day trip to the Porcupine Mountains! We thoroughly enjoyed interacting with the animals (the dogs included), and it was a perfect spot to relax after exploring the area. Jenn & Jason went above and beyond to make sure we were comfortable or and the cinnamon rolls are so good. We would definitely stay here again!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"beautiful, peaceful, away from people and traffic. i loved it here! jenn helped with recommendations of places to check out too. i’ll be back for a solo trip next summer. ❤️"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was a beautiful place and was so relaxing! They were wonderful hosts and made sure we were taken care of! The dogs, sheep, and chickens are so cute and friendly. The cinnamon rolls every morning was so yummy! I would recommend the place to anyone!! We hope to be back soon!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We had the best time at Jenn & Jason’s! The studio we stayed in felt like it was our own home, it was so comfortable and had everything we needed. (I had to work a bit and the internet was perfect.)
Their property is so beautiful & peaceful. Each morning we stopped at their little farm stand for fresh coffee (roasted on site!) & the BEST homemade cinnamon rolls. We then walked around the farm saying good morning to each of their animals with our pup- who also loved it. Then we would bring him to run in their gated dog run area. It was a dream. And their farm stand is my favorite feature of any air bnb. :)
Most importantly, Jenn & Jason are amazing hosts and have created the most thoughtful and welcoming space for visitors to experience. Jason even gave us a coffee roasting class which was the best! Our time with them was as special as the rest of our experience.
We didn’t want to leave!
PS- take a look at Jenn’s local guide book for great suggestions on what to do in the area!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed about a week,Such a quaint place to stay in Houghton.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed about a week,Such an amazing little place to stay. The hosts were great! Cannot wait to go back
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Cute, small yet functional space in a beautiful area with farm animals and wildlife all around. Our dogs loved the fenced in area to run. Quick drive to the local beach for sunrise/sunset."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,Very lovingly equipped accommodation. It's all as described. We felt comfortable Especially the view into the garden is great.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place was so peaceful and lovely. What a beautiful view of nature, and the sheep were so fun!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Jenn & Jason were absolutely wonderful from the first moment we booked the stay, and were nothing but throughout. We loved our time there. Thank you so much for everything."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The moment I arrived at Jenn & Jason's Airbnb, I booked one more night. Had such a peaceful time working remotely from their quiet, picturesque farm. The hosts were super responsive to my messages. Lots of thoughtful touches throughout. I hope I get to go there again one day!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I will keep this review short. My girlfriend and I were looking for a place to escape for the weekend and we came across this airbnb located perfectly between open land and city. Upon driving into the driveway you are greeted with chickens and to the left by the little cabin you have sheep. The land is very spacious, you have dedicated parking and the entrance is on the opposite end of the shared home. Jen is very friendly, responsive, and very welcoming. They have a small store front where you can buy small essential things for grilling along with coffee, drinks, snacks and every morning free cinnamon buns for guest which we appreciated. The cabin is very cozy and is a mix between old and updated which gives off a homey vibe. The room was clean and has nice decor. They offer kayaks for 20$ a person and the drive to the river is 2 minutes which was an amazing experience. Overall it was a nice experience and will recommend to couples for an escape."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was one of our favorite stays we’ve had through Airbnb. The farm and granny’s place are even more beautiful and comfortable than the pictures. We had plenty of privacy and Jenn & Jason were so friendly and proactive in helping us get settled & answering our questions, but they also gave us plenty of space to ourselves. Homemade cinnamon rolls available every day was a special treat. Wifi was excellent, bed was very very comfortable. Fewer bugs than we anticipated in the area overall. They’re also near a great beach with a lighthouse. Perfect for 2 people (and a dog). Would love to stay again!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful, peaceful place"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We loved every minute at Jenn and Jason’s place! Granny’s place was so cute, cozy, and clean! We immediately felt right at home! It was so much fun to be able to interact with all the animals. Jenn was so responsive with the questions we had and even willing to grab us a fire starter kit.
This truly was the perfect place to rewind and relax. So peaceful! I’d recommend this spot to anyone!"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"Granny’s place is my favorite Airbnb. It was the perfect place for my boyfriend and I to escape to after a day of chasing Michigan waterfalls. The location is excellent. Close to town to grab a bite to eat, and a breakers beach was a perfect spot to relax and watch the sunset and sunrise.
I loved the animal experience too. The cats and sheep were the icing on the cake for us. ❤️"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Highly recommend Jenn and Jason’s place. They go above and beyond for their guests! We wish we could have stayed longer.
2022-10-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We enjoyed our stay. The description was 100% accurate, the kindness and patience demonstrated by Jenn & Jason and their animals completely exceeded our expectations. Our stay was relaxing, comfortable and enjoyable. Jenn and Jason were very friendly and personable. They checked in to make sure we had everything we needed including easy to follow directions to local areas of interest. We will be back.
Also, Jenn was an incredibly helpful and patient navigator. She immediately returned my late evening phone call and guided me to their home with detailed descriptions of what I would drive past on each road and easily identifiable landmarks when my navigation system went down."
2022-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"Super clean, quaint, and wonderful. Appreciated all the thoughtful, little touches - made for a lovely refuge after a long drive. Loved seeing the sheep outside - therapeutic in many ways - used to have Icelandic sheep a couple years back. Definite keeper on the AirBnB list!"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"beautiful place! hosts are very kind and responsive! animals were so cute and friendly, would happily stay again!"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"If you're looking to just get away, disconnect, and reset, THIS is a great place to do all of it. It was really quiet and away from everything. I have a stressful job and needed to relax for a few days - and this place was perfect. I was able to bring my dog (lab mix) and everything was pet friendly, including Jenn and Jason. My dog and their dog became buddies and played during much of our stay. It's also a great home base for exploring the Keweenaw peninsula. Affordable, clean, well stocked with everything you'd need... It was perfect for my getaway and would be for yours!"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed one night,Great place. Excellent communication. Very clean. Highly recommend.
2022-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"Jen & Jason are great hosts! They get back to you fast.
The cute studio was perfect. Loved being on a farm & feeding the chickens.
I will definitely come back.
Thank you🙂"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed about a week,Wonderful stay! I went on a little solo vacation and I’m so glad I was able to stay here. Jenn and Jason’s hospitality made my trip so much more worthwhile! I’ll be coming back in the future.
2022-09-01,5,Stayed one night,My boyfriend and I stayed here for one night and is was wonderful! It was exactly as shown and it was so cozy. Only downside was that my boyfriend and I are on the taller side so our feet were hanging off the bed at night… but it was a very comfy mattress! Would highly recommend this place and would definitely return if in the area.
2022-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"We had an amazing time staying at Granny's Place. The room was very clean, and all the animals made it by far the best Airbnb experience we've ever had! They also provided some of their home-roasted coffee which was delicious."
2022-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"Such a cute stay! Very easy to get to and get in. We were greeted by deer & chickens and there were sheep in the yard that you can feed and interact with if you want. Very, very clean inside with a comfy bed and nice bathroom. Only 15 minutes from Houghton. Would definitely stay here again and recommend to anyone!"
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"If I’m visiting houghton, I’ll be back to this place. Cozy inside and with beautiful surrounding and friendly animals. Love how they decorated the place. Very close to breakers. Saw the sunset every night.
I wish I could have stayed longer
I had issues with my backpack and they were very generous to offer me one while I stayed there.
Thanks again! It was a pleasure to stay at your place"
2022-09-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Staying up here was great! the space is very cute and comfortable, and was exactly what we needed on our quick trip through the Keweenaw Peninsula. We'd absolutely stay here again."
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My boyfriend and I had such a great time. We will definitely be returning again. The place has new little quirks since the last time we stayed that made the stay all the more charming.
We loved the eggs! They were so fresh"
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Jenn & Jason’s Airbnb is fantastic. Perfect distance from town, very clean and homey. The animals are so friendly and they give corn to feed them with! I have/would recommend this Airbnb to anyone staying in Houghton area! I am from the area, and i loved it because it felt so different from what I’ve seen! 10 stars!!!"
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What a special spot. Granny’s place was so lovely, comfy, cozy and serene with thoughtful touches throughout-plenty of books to read, fresh mint water from the garden, fresh cut flowers, and apples from the backyard. Jenn was very accommodating, and easy to communicate with, making sure I had everything I needed for my stay. I only had one full day to visit Houghton and it was honestly difficult to pry myself away from the serenity of this little place to see the surrounding area. Would definitely love to come back and stay for longer!"
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,My mom and I had a lovely time walking in the gardens and feeding the animals. Attention to detail and communication was great. An overall amazing stay.
2022-09-01,5,Stayed with a pet,We loved our stay at Jenn & Jason’s! The location was perfect and the property is so quiet and beautiful. It was the perfect set-up for our stay and had everything we needed. Their place is very clean and cutely decorated! Would absolutely recommend staying here.

2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What a cozy little place! We had everything we needed in a compact space, with sheep and chickens to entertain us. Jenn greeted us at the car. There's a black sand beach where you can watch the sunsets just a few miles down the road."
2022-08-01,5,Stayed one night,This was a great place to stay secluded from the city light but not too far away from everything. We had a wonderful stay! We loved getting to see all the game animals as well. Would highly recommend!
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Jenn & Jason were exceptional hosts and provided the perfect place to unwind for the weekend. We actually enjoyed the short drive a little ways out of town where all was quiet except for the bugs singing their songs and an owl catching a meal. The space was super cozy. The variety of flowers around the property were beautiful. The animals were a hoot and we were excited that Jenn and Jason provided some crack corn to feed them. We also enjoyed an evening out back with a warm fire as we watched the Milky Way and several shooting stars. Make sure to look up at night y’all if it’s not cloudy!
Thank you Jenn & Jason, you made us miss living in the Yoop in the summer."
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I highly recommend Granny’s Place. Great location away from the city … beautiful drive only 7 miles from Houghton, 1 mile from the public Breakers on Lake Superior and convenient to see all the sights in the area. Very easy to find and checkin was so easy.
The cottage is attached to the house with a separate entrance. Felt very safe and it’s really quiet.
The place is super clean and organized. They have thought of everything, super fast WiFi, big shower, super comfy bed and couch, functional kitchen. Black out curtains to sleep in. The fans kept the temp comfortable, I didn’t miss AC.
The host is very friendly and really prompt in communication. I will definitely stay here again on my next trip here."
2022-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"Granny's Cottage is such a sweet little place the perfect distance out of town and private. Jenn & Jason are superb hosts and their little farm is charming. The cottage is attached to their home but super private, bright, and airy. Garden is full of flowers and it kind of feels like there is no one else out there in the best way. The beach is walking distance and overall it's a sweet place to stay!"
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My husband and I loved Granny’s Place and highly recommend it for a nice getaway. We loved the drive out to the country away from the hustle and bustle and that it was about a mile from a beach on Lake Superior. It was easy to make day trips as well. Jenn and Jason were super nice when we saw them out with their dog and were very helpful with messages about places to see, etc. perfect stay!"
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We recommend staying here. Everything is very clean. The shower is great. We really enjoyed brewing a cup of coffee in the morning before taking off for a day of exploring. It also was really fun to feed the sheep and chickens with the corn.
2022-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"Beautiful place!
Our dogs were able to run and it was so peaceful. Very cleanly"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We had a great time staying at Granny’s Place! The farm is a peaceful place and we enjoyed mingling with the animals. The room was quaint and cozy with all the necessary amenities - a great getaway destination, just minutes to north canal township park with beach and waterfront access. Overall wonderful stay!"
2022-07-01,4,Stayed one night,Great location and cute studio near farm animals and a nice beach. It was a nice surprise to see they provided some tasty mint water and cherries for us to enjoy. Fans helped cool things off enough. I think the space could use a few more curtains but other than that it was perfect. Lovely Airbnb.
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Amazing stay!
2022-07-01,5,Stayed one night,This little studio is tucked into the back garden - it's adorable and very functional. The bed was so soft and comfy and shower nice and spacious considering the small footprint of the rest of the space. This is not a place to do any cooking - the kitchenette is very basic. the cherries were ripe and the hosts left a note letting me know I could use the stepladder they left out to pick some - a delicious treat! My only complaint is really out of their control: on a 90 degree day it got quite warm!
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Very pleasant stay. Amazing host with few very nice touches, prompt communication and great hospitality. We could not imagine better utilization of the sq footage of the studio and found it very charming and with nice character not common in BNBs.
Super helpful area guide. We loved the refreshing mint. Even though we are outside the Kitchenette would have allowed us make a simple meal had we wanted to.
Nearby beach is great for sunset. We stayed 2 nights and wish we had more time but there is so much to explore. We can heartedly recommend it & would readily return."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed one night,This was a nice and comfortable place to stay. Everything was as described and pictured. Communication was also great. Thanks!
2022-07-01,4,Stayed one night,Cozy space for one or two people. Lots of light and sweet touches.
2022-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"This is little place is absolutely charming, perfect for me and my dog. Very clean and well organized. It is a few miles from town but the drive is easy and pretty. I wish I could have explored the farm a little more, this trip simply required a place to crash and sleep but it was perfect for my situation and I hope to be back when I can slow down and appreciate it. Quiet and private. Beautiful stargazing!"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed one night,My wife and I only stayed here one brief night during our honeymoon but we absolutely loved it and wished we could have fit an extra night at this cozy spot! My wife was in love with all the animals around the property and was so excited that our hosts had even provided us with a jar of corn to feed the goats and birds if we wanted - which we did! The room had everything we needed and the property itself was beautiful and very welcoming. Would highly recommend if you're looking for a place to stay in the area!
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Mine and my fiancés stay was absolutely perfect. We loved the cute and cozy space Jenn and Jason created for their guests. It had everything we needed, and they were both super friendly and accommodating. They were even able to make some suggestions on things to do/places to go! Their property is serene and its location in the UP is great for traveling all around different areas. If you like a peaceful, quiet secluded location, this is a perfect place if you are looking for somewhere to unwind & unplug (though they have wifi!). Or if you just need a comfy place to lay your head for the night while you are out adventuring in the UP. I highly recommend booking here with Jenn and Jason!"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed one night,Super cute place. Nice location. Very clean. Perfect for two people.
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Granny's Place is a fun and unique place to stay on your visit to Keweenaw and Lake Superior. Jenn and Jason are friendly hosts who are willing to chat with you, if you chose, but also who give you space and privacy, if that is your preference. The apartment is a comfortable space to stay on a hobby farm with sheep, chickens, turkeys, and ducks who we had fun feeding a snack of corn provided by our hosts. Our visit occurred in late June 2022 when the weather was very mild and wildflowers were in bloom and abundant.
The apartment is attached to the back of the hosts' house with its own separate entrance in the side yard. We used it simply as a place to stay at night. It provides amenities similar to a hotel mini-suite with a bathroom with stand-up shower, comfortable bed in the sleeping area, and small ""living room/kitchen"" with a sofa, chair, and small TV connected to an internet type content provider. The kitchen area has a sink, mini-fridge, microwave and hot plate provided. This mini-kitchen is convenient for preparing simple meals or snacks, but would not be appropriate for baking or cooking a big meal.
Located about 8 miles north of Houghton on Canal Road, this sweet and rustic retreat is off the beaten path, a short distance from a small county/township owned beach on Lake Superior, and was a place that my wife and I really enjoyed on our four day vacation exploring the Keweenaw Peninsula.
We used Granny's Place as our base camp, while we explored the small towns and villages of the area, toured the Eagle Harbor lighthouse (a wonderfully scenic and historic place to visit), walked Michigan Tech's campus and visited its outstanding mineral museum, studied the history of copper mining in the area, and enjoyed the vistas of waterfalls, tall trees, and many miles of inspiring Lake Superior shoreline.
The area is a great place to visit for people who like love nature's beauty in an uncrowded setting while having the amenities of a college town near by. Having Jenn and Jason as our hosts at their rustic, comfortable, and unique place was the icing on the cake."
2022-06-01,3,Stayed a few nights,"The place was quiet and clean. It does only have a full size bed. Overall, the place is nice."
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Super cute place! The chickens, turkeys and ducks were my favorites, they were so fun! The little beach nearby is great too"
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"It’s a beautiful place, loved it!"
2022-01-01,5,Stayed one night,Was a great stay!
2022-01-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Nice cozy place. Thank you
2021-12-01,4,Stayed with a pet,"The rental is cozy & makes good use of limited space.
Check-in was very easy and we had a designated parking spot with an easy walk to the apartment.
The space was very clean & the furniture was comfortable. We didn’t see much of the grounds, as we arrived at night, during late December, and had to hit the road early to outpace the brunt of a winter storm; but what we saw was very nice- it’s a lovely hobby farm, worth checking out.
The hosts were very responsive to our questions and were very accommodating."
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,My husband and I loved our stay here. It was private and quiet. Everything was clean and comfortable. Having a few friendly sheep greet us was enjoyable!
2021-10-01,4,Stayed one night,"jenn and jason were amazing hosts. they had thorough and easy communication. if you enjoy the countryside, this is where you need to be. it reminded me of home away from home. they are located just far enough outside of houghton and just close enough to it too for exploration, relaxation, and a place to rest your head.
our only qualm was the sheer curtains. though it provides a sense of privacy, it was not enough for us for the daytime and nighttime. understandably they are in a more secluded area; however, in spite of that, we wished we had more coverage for privacy."
2021-10-01,5,Stayed one night,A great place and nice host
2021-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at the Granny's Place. It was quiet, clean, cosy and comfortable, just perfect for the two of us. Appreciate the great communication provided by hosts on directions and contactless check-in. One of the highlights of the stay was being able to interact and feed the sheep just outside our doorstep when we wake up in the morning, they are so gentle and friendly. Would love to stay again when there is the opportunity!"
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We loved staying here! It was the perfect place to stay for our weekend get away.
2021-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"I was just here for one night to shower and sleep before my early flight. It was cozy and charming. I didn’t read the description closely enough to realize that there is no internet and the cell service is spotty, so just be aware that you’ll need to head into town for those amenities. Otherwise, it is close to a nice beach and the animals are friendly. Recommend for a cozy getaway."
2021-10-01,3,Stayed one night,This little place was very nicely done and decorated. The bed was very comfortable and everything was spotless. Adequate space for two people.
2021-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"Looking for a taste of a tiny home in the Upper Peninsula’s Copper Country? This is it. Owners have transformed a back porch into a simple, cozy and tasteful living space just a few miles away from downtown Houghton, Michigan Tech, Keweenaw National Historical Park, Suomi Restaurant (try the Finnish Pannu kakku, a mix of an oven-baked pancake and flan) and other spots in this historic area. It’s also near the Houghton Shipping Canal. Very quiet. Feed the ducks, chickens and sheep. If you have Verizon you may have internet here, otherwise you may not. So download a book like we did or movie, etc., or simply disconnect after visiting the sites nearby, or driving up to Copper Harbor, always a treat, especially in fall when U.S. 41 turns into a tunnel of spectacular colorful leaves."
2021-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"Perfect place to rest your body and mind after a full day of adventure. The room is clean, cozy, and well equipped. Jenn is an awesome host!"
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great communication by host. Secluded and quiet area perfect for two people. A must if you love farm animals and nature. Highly recommended.
2021-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"my only regret is that i didn’t arrive earlier to enjoy this place more. an easy and pretty drive from houghton, and so close to an excellent black sand beach. a real gem!"
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,My boyfriend and I stayed there for two nights and it was everything we could of asked for. All the animals were super friendly. The granny house was super cozy in any type of weather. Jennifer was very friendly and very easy to communicate with over message. The beach down street was beautiful especially during sunset. We will definitely be back!
2021-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Comfortable bed, fun selection of movies, books, and games. We enjoyed seeing the sheep right outside the window in the morning. We peeked at the tent and sauna set up too, it looks like a fun place to stay!"
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Perfectly peaceful little farm! The space is clean and fresh and had everything we needed for our stay. Jenn and Jason were awesome hosts and their animals were so sweet! Being located on the outskirts of Houghton was dark enough to see the stars at night, gave us easy access the Keweenaw and Copper Harbor as day trips but still let us be close to town. Highly recommended for anyone looking to escape the city … but still like to stay in touch with civilization."
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Expect a cozy stay, complete with board games, hard candy, and beautiful scenery!"
2021-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"Exceeded my expectations. If you’re in the Houghton area, this is such a sweet place to spend some time. The space itself is beautifully done and the animals are unforgettable ♥️"
2021-09-01,5,Stayed one night,Wonderful place! I cannot wait to go back again!
2021-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"What a great little spot! Close to town, clean, great communication and comfy bed. Highly recommend!"
2021-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"This is the perfect spot for a calm and relaxing vacation. Beautiful place, wish we could have stayed longer"
2021-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"This space is quaint and cozy, and Jennifer was very accommodating and friendly! Plus, the animals are so adorable!"
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Excellent little place to stay. The studio is very comfortable and private. The farm is beautiful and makes for a unique experience. Everything was exceptionally clean and quiet.
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,What a wonderful and peaceful place to use as a home base to enjoy the Keweenaw. The cottage was cozy and beautifully adorned. We loved that the sheep were right out our door. The portage canal and Lake Superior are just an easy mile down the road. Jennifer was a friendly host. We will likely stay here again.
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Jenn, what a cute place you have! Thank you for hosting us! The sheep and chickens were so fun! We enjoyed feeding the animals! The Airbnb was so cute and just as described! Your food recommendations were AMAZING! I loved the decorations and plants you had inside 🙂 Thank you again!"
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Amazing amazing amazing! Jennifer was so sweet and communicative ! we had the best stay here
2021-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"A lovely, quiet getaway that is perfect for recharging!"
2021-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"Nice, relaxing getaway. Attached to another house, but blocked off so you have entire “granny’s” place. Very clean, great map to locate. Jennifer was so kind via messages."
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Granny's Place is an awesome place to stay . We stayed two night and wished we could have booked for more days but we have to head back to work. This place is very convenient; not far at all from downtown Houghton and across the water to Hancock. Very comfortable place and super welcoming. I highly recommend!
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful little spot!
2021-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"This was a fantastic stay; so relaxing and a really comfortable bed! The room was really comfortable, and we enjoyed feeding the sheep and seeing the chickens. This place is off the beaten path, and we enjoyed it immensely, but something to be taken into account depending on your plans. I would recommend it to anyone traveling to the area."
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This Airbnb is in an exquisite and private rural setting, replete with berries, orchards, flower gardens and gentle farm creatures. Jennifer has created a sunlit, cosy retreat, and she is a warm and welcoming hostess. There is also a wonderful community beach less then a mile away. I cannot wait to return."
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"So clean, so fresh, and so well decorated! A lot of effort was put into this small space that packs a punch! I enjoyed the country atmosphere with roosters announcing the day and the cheerful goats calling to each other. Jennifer is a very gracious host! A lot of value for the price and a nice break from life on the grid!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,It's a good place to stay for a couple of nights. Walking distance to Michigan tech campus and a few restaurants and a grocery store. Adam communicated clearly and friendly!
2024-06-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Very cute little place with a lot provided to make things comfortable. The hosts were very communicative and we didn't feel disturbed by the semi-apartment privacy at all. The bathroom was a little tight, but still pretty good for the cost."
2024-04-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Adam was very helpful and flexible with our hurried graduation schedule allowing an earlier check in. It was smaller than expected to the point of being cramped. Basically, this is a room off of the garage that has a basement feel to it. They were out of town but the dogs were upstairs and frequently barked for extended periods late at night. The room was clean and bed was comfortable. Parking was a perk if you don’t have a truck. You are required to park in the garage which is nice but very tight fit for a truck. The entrance from the garage did not lock which was fine because you could shut the overhead door but was still not comforting."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The place was absolutely wonderful! It was clean, cozy, and conveniently located. Our stay was fantastic, and I highly recommend this property to anyone visiting the area."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Had an awesome time staying here and would highly recommend for anyone staying in the area! Adam and Jana were very nice and made the stay feel very inviting.
2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"We were in town one night for my son to tour the campus. He wanted to stay close to campus so he could walk around and explore a but. Was the perfect location, something different, and a cozy place to rest after a very long day of travel! Hosts are active musicians and upon learning of my son’s interests invited him to sit in on rehearsals which was extra special! Wish we could have stayed longer!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,An absolutely beautiful hideaway with lovely decor and a perfect location! Within walking distance from the greatest parts of Houghton and within reasonable driving distance from nearby waterfalls and beaches! Definitely a hidden gem and worth the price!
2024-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"This place was a nice, cozy, well put together, little downstairs apartment. My daughter and I loved it. Highly recommend. The owners live upstairs and seemed to be gone most of the time we were there, but we could hear the dog walking around a couple times. Other than that it was the perfect quiet little place for us to rest out heads after a day of snowboarding."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great location near downtown Houghton, A clean, functional, inexpensive space, nicely decorated, very adequate for one or two persons! The garage space was an added bonus! I loved the aqua Keurig Single cup coffee maker and the pods provided."
2024-02-01,4,Stayed a few nights,We think the place was ok. A little too much light as the curtains were not blackout.
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Such cool, classic decor and amenities. Comfy bed and great space for 2 people. Sounds of a lovely, musical family above and dog “had some serious moments of FOMO” per Jana. Bring your white noise app if you are a light sleeper. Impressive, delightful concert one day by Adam! If icy, could be a more challenging drive or walk to and from campus or town. Thank you so much for the wonderful couple day stay! Simply amazing city! With gratitude, Nikki Bailey n sons"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Easy to find and very local to things. Just don’t bring a big truck because it won’t fit in the garage. Adam and Jana were helpful and have all that is needed for a vacation in the UP
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We loved our stay here! Perfect amount of space for a couple and close to all the downtown activities.
2024-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"Adam’s place was a great spot to stay in Houghton. Great decor, and cosy space. We’d recommend staying here!"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great place to stay! I appreciate the hassle free process and indoor parking especially after the 8 hour drive to get there. Clean, convenient and excellent host!"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Nice, clean place. Great communication from the host. I'd stay here again."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great stay! Unusual to have a garage to park in. Their bed was super comfortable and very quiet at night. Supplied everything we needed. Location is very central to grocery store, restaurants and university."
2023-11-01,4,Stayed one night,"Minimalist place with retro decor. Great location with easy access to downtown Houghton. If you’re a homeowner like me, it was a little bit noisy for me. However, if you’re an apartment dweller you’ll likely be used to the noise from above."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Cute and convenient, good location. It was nice having use of the garage. We would stay here again."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The location is walkable to the University and - if you don't mind a slightly longer walk - the city. The location was easy to find.
The pictures show what the inside looks like, but they don't share how comfortable the bed was!
It was great for my couple of nights in the Keewenaw!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,Super clean and cozy. Perfect for one or two people. Great location if doing anything at MTU or in Houghton in general. Bed was so comfortable and loved the touch of slippers to keep your feet warm if needed.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,Perfect for us for visiting our daughter at MI Tech. We will definitely we staying here again!
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Adam's place is cute, clean, comfortable, and quiet. The neighborhood is nice. Parking in the garage is super convenient; you can just walk in the door straight from your car. I would gladly stay again if I was in the area."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,Conveniently close to MTU campus. Perfect and very comfortable for out short stay!
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great proximity to MTU campus, and a cozy and well-appointed space. Loved my stay here!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great location- perfect for us to walk around downtown and explore the peninsula!
2023-09-01,4,Stayed one night,"Great location, the use of the garage is nice as well. There are thoughtful touches in the kitchen area. The shower/bathroom could have been a little cleaner but overall I would stay here again for a short stay."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great place, everything we needed for overnight stay. We were traveling with a full dress motorcycle so arriving at night was difficult as the house was not lit up. Street was very steep. And, very steep incline to get up to garage. This should be known to others. Having garage space was wonderful."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a great stay at the Retro Roost, and enjoyed the convenient location that made it easy for us to explore Houghton and the surrounding areas. It was nice having the garage to park in, and Adam was very responsive with quick answers to any questions we had. The place was cute and suited our needs for the two of us just fine. Comfortable bed, too!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great location close to MTU campus. Mostly everything there for us that we needed. Good basic supplies available that we used towels, plates, glasses, silverware, extra blankets available and even slippers so your feet aren’t cold on the floors :) Remember to bring shampoo, body wash, & conditioner. The shower didn’t always run a consistent temperature sometimes would give you cold spells in the hot :p & the driveway to get in is at a slightly weird angle, but that’s how a lot of them are in the steeper hills of the U.P. :) Nice stay would recommend to others."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,I enjoyed my overnight here. The place was easy to find and conveniently located near Tech and the downtown area. Very clean and cozy place. I would stay here again.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great place to stay in Houghton, especially for how close it is to campus"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,It was a good stay for us
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Loved the location of this space! Walkable to restaurants, coffee shops, etc. comfy bed, great water pressure in the shower and fully stocked kitchen."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at the Retro Roost. Perfect for seeing our student off to MTU. Lovely neighborhood and close to campus. Loved the private entry and secluded space. We look forward to the opportunity to stay again!
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,great location and very clean!
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The Retro Roost was exactly what we needed for our stay in Houghton. Loved that we were able to park in the garage and the space has everything we needed. Hosts were amazing and super responsive! Would highly recommend staying here and will definitely be using them for our next trip!
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"Enjoyed our stay. Clean, comfortable bed and just what we needed for the start of our road trip."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,Adam’s place was a perfect launch pad for everything surrounding Houghton. It’s very close to everything in town and the unit has everything you might need while you are resting up!
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I was in town for a friends wedding and this was a wonderful space to come back to recharge after the days adventure. Great hospitality and felt very at home here. Would definitely stay again!
2023-08-01,4,Stayed one night,"Very convenient for us, as we were allowed to use the garage, which directly adjoins the property."
2023-08-01,4,Stayed one night,"We needed an affordable place to sleep while exploring Houghton and Adam’s place was just that. Check in was easy and the space was tidy and clean. I do feel inclined to mention, since I didn’t see it in any other reviews, you can hear footsteps and barking from upstairs. You may also hear the hot water heater running, as it is in the kitchenette area. Although, Adam was very clear that he and his family live in the space above. If these are things you are used to, I don’t think it will be bothersome. All in all, it was a pleasant Airbnb experience."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Stay was great and communication was fine. The listing has a backyard included- but I'd actually recommend going across the street to the park to hang out. There are picnic tables and it is nice and open.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Very close to campus and within a walkable distance to downtown. It was nice to park inside a garage every night. The space had everything I needed, and would recommend."
2023-07-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"If you don't like to read a lot, ""would I stay here again""? Yes. This is a basement apartment, and is comfortable, clean, but not fancy. It does have some nice little touches to make the stay more comfortable. USB ports on both night stands, provided coffee, and condiments in the refrigerator. There is a kitchen to cook if you would like too. The bedroom and kitchen have windows, so there is natural light. TV and sitting area are between the bedroom and kitchen. It is about 3/4 of a mile to walk to the historic downtown area, and only the first few blocks are down/up, going/coming from town, the rest is flat. Great place to base camp, and explore the Keweenaw Peninsula."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"It had a ton of character, clean, comfortable and met our expectations. Love how quiet the neighborhood is and how close to downtown we were."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,Adored staying at the Retro Roost! It is quaint and cozy inside and we got a kick out of all the chicken drawings in the guest book. I love when I get a chance to go back to Houghton and I'll definitely be keeping this place in mind as a regular stay opportunity :)
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The Retro Roost was perfect for me! Adam was a great host and was very helpful. The location is great! I felt right at home and every detail was thought of in advance. the bed was comfortable and the location was very quiet. Everything you would ever need is provided for you. Five stars! I would definitely go back to Adam's place again! 🙂
2023-06-01,4,Stayed one night,Nice place…convenient location.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,The room was extremely clean and the overall property was very cute and inviting. Adam communicated very well and I appreciate the clear hard work he put into our stay.

2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great location! Cozy, good space for one or twin people."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The Retro Roost is a great place to stay. It’s close to everything (MTU and local businesses) yet tucked in a quiet neighborhood. The garage parking is a plus! I would recommend choosing the Retro Roost if you’re looking for a cozy place to stay while adventuring around the area.
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Very accommodating😊
Quaint and comfy.
Private garage and entrance.

Adam was A great host with a neat little place to stay."
2023-02-01,5,Stayed one night,The place was very cozy and cute! Adam responded quickly and was helpful when I left an item behind! Great location.
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great location for getting to MTU or downtown Houghton via walking. It was very clean and matched the description. It is fairly small but attempts to get all the amenities. It is below a house but there was barely any noise. Overall nice place, just a bit cramped for space."
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The ""Retro Roost"" was a great place to stay for a college admissions visit at Michigan Tech. We had everything we needed for a comfortable, extended stay, and we appreciated being very close to campus, downtown restaurants, and a surprisingly well-stocked grocery store. Adam was very responsive and provided some much appreciated local recommendations, and we will definitely visit again."
