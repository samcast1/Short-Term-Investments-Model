2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place!
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Rita and i were nicely surprised with the beautiful room. The tile in the kitchen, the beautiful floor, and the nicely painted wall. Very clean, we felt right at home upon opening the door to our room. We found the kitchen very user-friendly. We really felt very comfortable in our room. One item that the hosts may consider is a full-length mirror. Since we were going out for the evening, it would have been nice to glance
into a mirror to check out how we looked. Great job Lou and family. We met Lou's daughter and she told us
that working on that room was a family affair. Thumbs up from The Badgers."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"My husband and I needed a place to stay for our daughters wedding. The apartment is very clean and updated. The views of the river are beautiful. Overall had a pleasant stay.
If we were to have needed anything I felt that Lou would have been very responsive."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,It‚Äôs easy to get a good review when everything goes as planned but earning a good review when unexpected things come up is harder. Lou and her husband earned this review. During my extended stay a couple of things came up that were completely out of the owners control. Everyone was quick to find solutions and very effectively communicated. I would absolutely recommend and stay here again.
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very accommodating and helpful. Loved the style and cleanliness of the unit. Would stay there again.
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Thank you for being so accommodating and adjusting to the circumstances. Your place is amazing and very clean I hope next time around I can stop in the shop and check out the area a bit more.
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very nice would highly recommend
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was my second stay with Lou. Same building, different apartment. Except for the squeaky hallway, the place was just right for my stay. I‚Äôll be back."
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"This was a nice place to stay while studying after class for my profession. Quiet, clean and comfortable! I was able to relax and get good rest each night. The kitchen had plenty of culinary tools to cook with if you like to save money while traveling. Overall the best AirBnB I‚Äôve ever stayed in. 10/10. Thanks again Mike n Lou!"
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This was one of my best experiences! Stayed here for a week and it had a beautiful view of the bridge and outside. It's a very cozy and clean little place for 2 and has plenty to do around the town it's in. I would definitely stay here again! 10/10 Would recommend!
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,I had a wonderful stay at Lou's place. The view was beautiful and the area was quiet.
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Can not say enough good things about Lou‚Äôs! Just a great home away from home! Very very nice! Best place to stay in Clinton hands down! It is the only place I will ever stay in Clinton!

2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great location. Could see the river from windows.
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I had a thoroughly enjoyable experience staying here. One of the nicest Air B n B properties I have visited! It is immaculately clean and bright. Tastefully decorated and the expansive view of the Mississippi River and the bridge into Illinois is wonderful to wake up to. The apartment was totally comfortable, and I am looking forward to another stay. Lou's communication is so instant, I was impressed. Thank You, Lou."
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"If you are around Clinton, Lou‚Äôs place is great! This apartment is beautifully decorated, with a lot of the items coming from Lou‚Äôs shop downstairs. I was in town working, so I had to come and go at all hours. I never felt unsafe leaving at 3am, and felt assured with the cameras that Lou has out. I had plenty of room to spread out. One bonus that I really appreciated, the laundry facility is right across the hall."
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Don‚Äôt judge the book by the cover. The unit I rented was so new, clean, cute and comfortable I will be back next time I‚Äôm in town visiting."
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Excellent place to stay! Very clean and great view of the river. Host was very accommodating for us and offered some good ideas on restaurants and things to do in town. Will definitely go back ‚ù§Ô∏è
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very clean and exactly as advertised. The most comfortable bed I've ever slept on in a Airbnb. Host was friendly&attentive. Will be going back and definitely recommend
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Lou‚Äôs place was absolutely beautiful and spotlessly clean. The location in downtown Clinton is great. We enjoyed short walks to restaurants and a lovely view of the Mississippi River. We are repeat visitors and will return again!
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,Lovely apartment overlooking the river! Lou was a fabulous hostess.
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Beautiful cabin that is super clean with modern amenities. Host thought of every detail of guest‚Äôs needs. Everything is brand spanking new. Convenient to state parks and fun activities. Felt right at home. Great place for a getaway!!
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We stayed at Justin‚Äôs AirBnb for our wedding night! Wish we had stayed longer, it was such cozy place to stay. Gorgeous place inside and out, you can see the water through the trees and it‚Äôs very well taken care of. Very quiet and serene as well. Justin was also very good at communicating with us and respectful. Enjoy your stay!"
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I‚Äôve stayed with Cody many times. He is quick to respond, polite and professional."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very clean and cozy. Quick response
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Beautiful house in an old Beautiful town! Awesome stay!
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great stay. Easy in and out. Responsive and friendly host. Just a few steps away from the river. Would definitely stay there again.
Thanks, Denae!"
2024-06-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Enjoyed the time here. Close to everything we needed.
Sawmill museum is close as are some restaurants. The farmers market is a block away.
Yes there are trains that go by but it didn‚Äôt bother us."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Spent a great couple of days at Denae‚Äôs place. It was a great location for us and the accommodations were just as pictured. Would definitely recommend‚Ä¶there were trains, but they didn‚Äôt really bother us. I couldn‚Äôt find a corkscrew to open my bottle of wine and it was at our door within ten minutes! I would say Denae‚Äôs communication skills are outstanding!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is our second time with Denae, and it was another great stay! Great host and wonderful location!"
2024-06-01,4.0,Stayed one night,Denae‚Äôs place is nicely updated and was very clean. It was a great size for our family of 4! It was a nice touch to have coffee and bottled water available! I would stay at Denae‚Äôs place again!
2024-05-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Location great, unless trains bother you. Not constant but frequent, but they didn‚Äôt bother us. Close to the river and downtown. Great spot to explore Clinton."
2024-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Our crew was very happy with their stay and said they‚Äôd be happy to stay there again! Great hosts!
2024-04-01,4.0,Stayed over a week,"The only reason I gave it a 4 in one area was because the house is less than a city block from a train track where at least 4 trains pass from 10 pm to 5am‚Äîprobably more during the day, but we weren‚Äôt there during the day or wouldn‚Äôt have cared. We would have brought earplugs if we had known. We stayed 10 nights or so and got used to it, but laughed it was a little like the running joke in the movie ‚ÄúMy Cousin Vinnie.‚Äù
The river walk was near by as was the Lumber Museum. Several terrific restaurants: Rastrelli‚Äôs, Great Revival Brewery, Candlelight, plus 392 Coffee Cafe, and Homers. Oh, and just 10 minutes across the river in Fulton was not to be missed Krumpets Bakery and Cafe. We ate well.
A great find in Clinton. I‚Äôd go back. And having excellent laundry facilities was a plus. Danae anticipated guests needs. Thank you so much!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Denae was a great host who responded quickly and checked up often on things! House was a nice open concept that gave everybody in our group their own space while visiting!
2024-03-01,4.0,Stayed over a week,Great place for the price! Very close to neighbors' houses and a nearby railroad so can be noisy. Limited cookware but manageable.
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Very nice updated home! Can tell it was recently renovated! Looks great! Beds were comfortable!
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Her place was exactly what we were looking for. It was clean, comfortable, private and a great location. BEAUTIFUL sunsets too! Julia did a great job in providing everything needed and being available, and respecting privacy. THANKS JULIA!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"What an amazing view. On the inside, it was clean, comfortable and cozy. I would love to come back when I have a couple of days."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Homey cabin with a truly fantastic view! Comfy mattress, easy parking. We would come back!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Loved the view of the Mississippi River. Very peaceful and safe place.
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This cottage is well suited as a writer/artist retreat. I liked the simplicity of it, the excellent view of the water from the deck as well as from inside."
2024-05-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Great stay would stay again.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Absolutely beautiful and peaceful cabin - the window and deck overlooks the Mississippi and a wildlife sanctuary. We spent our evenings watching the birds, and it was so lovely."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,This was the cutest house on the water!! Loved it!!
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"My parents and I our 2 dogs, stayed here.
The place was as described.
Small studio with 2 places to sleep, beautiful scenery, with deck and that had a table and chairs to sit at.
We‚Äôll rent it again if it‚Äôs available the next time we‚Äôre in the area."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Our 6th stay here and we just booked another stay in a couple months. You cannot beat the price ($40-50 less than local hotels) and the view is outstanding. We love sitting on the deck watching the ducks, geese, eagles, hawks, pelicans and more. The house is perfect for my husband, myself and our pup. Our favorite little getaway!"
2024-03-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,The place was very very nice if you love nature and fishing. I was visiting a loved one so it fitted my need.
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Amazing experience! The house was a little smaller than the photos might seem, but these don't do the place justice.
A wonderful place, the house spotless and perfect for two people. Everything was totally clean, and it had everything you could possibly need: towels, blankets, sheets, kitchen stuff, TV, even coffee and shampoo if you forget. It was just all complete, even a vacuum just in case. The ad said it didn't include hot water, but it does. The fact of not having wifi just made it an even better getaway.
The super quiet area, the views are something we will never forget. In the area you could walk 10 minutes to one of the best restaurants we have ever been.
The spotless place, the awesome house, and no problems at all. There was not much communication with the owners, but it was all windy and questions about the app answered them in a reasonable time.
We will definitely be back!"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Great little cabin! Very cozy and with a beautiful view of the Mississippi River. We‚Äôll definitely love to stay here again and take advantage of the porch and fire pit area.
2024-03-01,4.0,Stayed one night,A solid 4
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,It was a super nice retreat for 1 person. I felt very comfortable and it was very relaxing.
2024-03-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Location, location, location. The western wall of this one room, one bath home is floor to ceiling windows looking out on the backwater of the Mississippi. Geese, seagulls, fresh water pelicans, doves, chipmunks, squirrels and the daily (but brief) flyby of an eagle drew us back to this gem. The hot water is abundant and the stocked kitchen make it easy to make up for the limited restaurants for dinner. The bedding, however, may prevent us from returning. (What's the benefit of this serene setting if you are too uncomfortable at night to sleep?) There is one full size mattress that is too soft, and one futon that is too firm (I felt the slats in the frame).
We bring our own water out of habit. We brought our own lighting source for a fire, which we learned the next day there was a warning against fires the night before... so check the Internet before having a bonfire.
While the home does not have Wi-Fi, a plus for us urbanites who wanted to unplug, we had ample Verizon reception."
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Amazing place! Loved it!
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great quiet getaway for a real river experience
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Julia's place was perfect for us and our 2 dogs. the view from the cabin and the yard was amazing. She was very quick to respond and had no issues during our stay. We will definitely be back!
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Easy host to work with
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place was exactly what I needed for a few days of peace with a great view, including a couple bald eagles soaring past along the riverfront, and beautiful sunsets. It had everything I needed for comfort and rest. The place was clean and un-cluttered. Only one minor issue that did not affect me, the pictures of the living area need updating, the furniture is not exactly as in the photos. There are not two couches, it's a comfy chair (facing river) and a couch/bed along north wall. Not a big deal for me but if you're planning to take 4 people, there are not 4 comfortable places to sit."
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,We loved our stay at Julia‚Äôs cabin. The view of the river was incredible. We look forward to coming through Thomson again.
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"You are surrounded by windows that face the Mississippi. You do not see the neighboring properties, it‚Äôs very quiet and private. Perfect observatory for viewing wildlife. We will visit here again as the seasons transition."
2024-01-01,2.0,Stayed with a pet,Great location dusty mouse droppings in drawers where blankets were stored
2024-01-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"Our stay here was great. Beautiful view,lots of glass. Double bed just sucks for a couple. Not the places fault. We tried but I wound up on the couch and it was all good. Really liked the fact that we were right on the river. Could really use a new coffee pot. Nice place,we hope to stay again soon."
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Loved the Cabin! Great small place with everything I needed.
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Awesome we would come back
2023-12-01,4.0,Stayed one night,Very nice place with amazing views only the owner is very unsociable and without answering my questions much.
2023-12-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great place, my friends and Inreally enjoyed the peaceful surroundings"
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Julia was a kind and responsive host. We didnt actually get to meet them as we arrived at 1am and left the next morning, but all around safe and peaceful area and cozy warm home."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Perfect for a quick overnight. Cute little cabin right on the river.
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a GREAT stay!!!
Beautiful, peaceful, cozy place!!
Amazing view of the river, we were able to sit and watch wildlife right from the room!!
We had an amazing escape weekend!!"
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,A great place to stay right on the Mississippi. Lots of options to walk our dog. Loved the views.
2023-11-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful scenery
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We stayed overnight here for a short getaway with our dog. Great place! It was a bit cooler the night we went, but I would love to come back in the summer months. Exactly as pictured/described."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was our second visit, and we enjoyed ourselves on each occasion."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Nice little place, with a beautiful view. It was a brief interval from the city‚Äôs busy life."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Awesome little cabin with an amazing view of the Mississippi! We'd definitely go back.
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Julia‚Äôs little house was so cute and the view was spectacular! It was a nice getaway from the city. So peaceful!
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,A great little place. Hope to get to return. Used to live in the area and is a good location to visit various places of interest for me.
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We have stayed at Julia's place several times. It is a perfect little getaway for my husband and I - only 60 miles from home but feels like a different world. The cottage has everything we need with an amazing view at an amazing price. Looking forward to our next visit!
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Only had one night available in the area so it was great Julia accepted a single night reservation. The view was beautiful! We would definitely stay there again. My aunt and uncle used to have a place in Riverview. It was lovely to be on that street again. ‚ù§Ô∏è
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,The cabin is cozy and cute but pretty spaciouspacious a for what it is. The view is AMAZING! It is right on the river and lots of windows looking out at the water. The host was more than accommodating by accepting a reservation less than 24 hours in advance. We were here for only a night but we definitely want to make a longer trip here again!
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Really I enjoyed would definitely come back
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We just loved Julia‚Äôs place. The cabin was clean and the view was spectacular. We felt very comfortable and everything exceeded our speciations. If we are ever in the area again we would love to stay there. We have also recommended it to our friends. Thank you Julia!!!
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Julia‚Äôs cozy cottage was the perfect peaceful getaway along the Mississippi River. Would definitely stay again!
2023-09-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was my second stay at the Cabin. It‚Äôs always such a great escape for a few days. Would definitely recommend mosquito repellent. We did not get to enjoy morning coffee or evening outside due to the bugs. Great restaurant down the street. Galena is not too far either.
Would recommend bringing your own blanket and pillows! Overall, a wonderful stay! Will definitely come back in the future again."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,wonderful stay
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was our second time staying at the cozy cabin on the river. So relaxing and peaceful. The views are absolutely fantastic. The neighbors are friendly. The cabin was clean and functional. This is the perfect spot. Bring bug spray or citronella candles‚Ä¶if you enjoy the deck you‚Äôll need those. I absolutely love that we can bring our family dog. She loves it there too. :)
Note: Before arriving we ordered groceries from HyVee in Clinton IA they delivered right to the door. For one of the nights- Manny‚Äôs Pizza in Savanna delivered pizza and tacos.
Thank you! We will definitely be back again."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had so much fun, it was so cozy perfect for a couples get away. There was a grill and a fire pit with wood that we could use plus the most beautiful sunsets, truly a sight. Not too much near by but the place itself was amazing!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Julia‚Äôs cabin on the river was the perfect peaceful stop along our cross country road trip. We sat outside and watched white pelicans fly over as we sipped morning coffee. Great place to ‚Äúrecharge‚Äù and hit the road again.
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The cabin was cute and cozy, very quiet and peaceful area. Beautiful location to watch the sunset. There was a meteor shower and it was beautiful to sit and watch next to the small campfire. We did walk down to the dock to sit and watch it as well. The deck, morning coffee, and wildlife was perfect. The only heads up I would give to other folks is the dock is a shared dock which means folks may come through to use it. I can see where they have done their best to mark a path for other folks to come through, but it was different to have someone walk through unexpected. The other people were friendly and polite so it was a non issue, just unexpected. I would recommend this location with 10 stars if I could. I cannot express enough the breath taking views. Thank you for a great stay."
2023-08-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"First let me say that in this day of star inflation I reserve 5‚Äôs for the very best, but the cozy cabin was cozy and cute. On the plus side it was very bright with a wall of windows looking out on a beautiful view of the river, sunsets, and waterfowl. It could use some touch up paint but was clean and mostly quiet (a few loud boats and fireworks?), and smaller than the photos looked‚Ä¶ like a studio apartment."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Been to this property 3 times now. Always a perfect view, clean house and an awesome escape from reality for a bit!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Our third time staying in their cozy cabin, while the other two we also enjoyed a lot as well and were in the dead of winter. Our first time now in summer, and the hottest days so far this year, but the cabin kept us cool, with the most spectacular views of river life in season. Bird watchers paradise all year! Egrets, sandpipers, Canadian geese, and even a snowey owl flew by for this summer little getaway. We had regular American white pelicans keep us company the entire time too. Literally hung out in the water right in front of the house. We named them Pete and Polly. If you‚Äôre staying there soon, make sure and watch for them! And bring your binocs for added viewing. If you‚Äôre looking for a place to just chill and observe the water and wildlife out the windowed front of the cozy little house, this is the place. It‚Äôs just peace and calm. As always Julia, thank you for opening up your cabin, and sharing the beauty that surrounds it with those of us who wouldn‚Äôt have that, otherwise."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Met our needs for a peaceful getaway, location on river was what we were looking for, 2nd time staying and had a pleasant stay."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Julia's place is a small, one room house with a bathroom. There's enough room though for what you need, you're noot tripping over anything. We enjoyed our stay very much! The deck was a wonderful place for a cup of coffee in the morning, there was so much wildlife to view! Galena was close by and so was Apple River Canyon. We went fishing and just truly enjoyed the peace and quiet. If you want a place to get away whete you can relax, this is it."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Cute small cottage for a quick one night stay for my husband and me. Peaceful & beautiful view of the river and sunset. Wonderful breeze on the cottage deck. Julia was responsive and friendly. Great value for the price. Would stay again.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Perfect for a peaceful, relaxing little getaway!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We really enjoyed our stay. A beautiful spot overlooking the Mississippi River. Great bird-watching from the cabin. A public boat ramp is just down the street for easy access to the river. There are nearby bike trails, wildlife refuge access, and Mississippi Palisades State Park for hiking."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Perfect
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,very nice surrounding great deck very relaxing
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,This is the 2nd time I have stayed here. Absolutely happy üíØ thank to my hosts you are wonderful.
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Very ""dog friendly"" and suitable. The ''must'is the patio overlooking the Mississippi, a dock is also available to access it. Remote but reasonable location from several villages with all amenities. The neighborhood is nice and quiet. Small cottage ideal for several days."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Cute little cabin. Neighborhood was quiet and peaceful. Great views of the river.
2023-06-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,Great little cabin on river with beautiful scenery. Good place to get away and decompress.
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,The area was beautiful and the property was clean and cosy!
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This cabin is a great place to slow down and listen to nature. Host responds quickly. It's a small and intimate space, set up like a studio with the kitchen, living room and bedroom in common, but it works. we brought food with us so we didn't go looking for restaurants in the area."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Quiet, clean, quick access to the Mississippi."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The place was a bit smaller than I expected but it was still a nice place to relax and stay for the weekend. It was a little dusty but other than that I felt it was pretty clean and I wasn‚Äôt concerned about anything while staying there. It was a very quiet little neighborhood and if I‚Äôm ever in the area again I wouldn't hesitate to book this place a second time. it‚Äôs a nice little spot for a weekend get away if you‚Äôre not far from the area.
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful setting, calm and restful, super-easy check in/out and great communication. Will stay again for sure!"
2023-06-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"I stayed in this cabin for 3 nights, the location makes up for a lot. The views are stunning. The cabin is clean and has everything you need for a short trip, though furnishings could use an update. I unfortunately found the bed quite uncomfortable and small (I am 5'1'', so I don't think tall people will have a great time, especially if there are two of them). I decided to sleep on the couch, which was more comfortable. Price is totally fair for 2+ people. I didn't spend much time in the cabin otherwise and did not use the kitchen.
Check-in was flexible and uncomplicated."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great value ! Very clean
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,What a great place. Can‚Äôt wait to go back. The view was amazing! Wildlife was awesome! Had my binoculars with me all the time so many birds to see. The home was so comfortable with an amazing view.
2023-05-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"Idyllic location right in the river. All available as described, sometimes a bit older furnishings, but absolutely worth the price!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Julia was great to work with. Her place was very clean. It was just what we needed as far as space for 2 adults and a dog. Really appreciated that it was pet friendly! Beautiful view of the Mississippi.
2023-05-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,"A very nice stay if you‚Äôre looking for something inexpensive on the water. It was a little dirty (dust buildup and spiderwebs on the lights) but if you‚Äôre a country person at heart and for the price you pay it isn‚Äôt a bother. Beautiful view, and a great place to have a campfire."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Perfect piece of heaven along the Mississippi. Cute tiny home that felt spacious. Perfect place to watch the sunset with your own porch and fire pit. We definitely will be back. Julia is very quick to respond to messages. Easy to follow directions.

2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,I stayed here two separate weekends with my small senior pup. I was toasty warm during my early March stay. April provided warm weather allowing for walks along the Great River Bike Trail and at the Mississippi Palisades State Park. I enjoyed beginning and ending the days watching the activity on the river. So peaceful. I felt like Thoreau on Walden's pond.

2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Booked Julia‚Äôs place for a Valentine‚Äôs Day weekend getaway with my girlfriend. The house was cozy and clean. I appreciated how the driveway was lit up at night. But the best part was the front porch with expansive views of the Mississippi River. Every day, we saw eagles soar by. There was some drama, too! A couple young squirrels were scampering up and down trees near where an eagle had perched. I thought for sure one of those little squirrels was a goner. The previous day we had seen a hawk just as it scooped up a bunny. Circle of Life on full display here! The squirrels seemed to have escaped the attention of the eagle. Or maybe the eagle was already full. There‚Äôs a spot nearby - on the Iowa side of the bridge in the photos - where we saw dozens of eagles. That was very cool."
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Clean, Quiet, Natural surroundings. While the host doesn't provide WiFi, our phones had service (Verizon network). The Roku TV has an outdoor antenna that provided dozens of digital channels - which allowed us to watch the Superbowl.
Shortly after arriving, a bald eagle flew by.
It was a nice getaway for my husband and I. We ate in some (Sullivan's grocery store was a 20 minute drive) and we ate out some."
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"This place was spotless,no smells,no stains, everything you need is provided and very clean. I Stayed 3 days and it was absolutely wonderful!

Everything was clean and I would absolutely stay here again. Thank you Julia for such a great day."
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Wonderful, clean, and well stocked cabin. My fianc√© stayed at Julia‚Äôs place for a short evening on our way through IL on a road trip. It was the perfect spot to grab some sleep. And pet friendly so our dogs could relax too. Would love to stay again!"

We were surprised how much wildlife was active on the mostly frozen river -- we watched the sunset from inside both nights.
The house is very close to a 7 mile bike trail that we walked into Savanna, it's not easy to spot on maps but it's there."
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Where to start.... river view location, super clean, all basic amenities to enjoy a weekend (or longer) stay, rustic ambiance, and walking distance to bar/ restaurant. Beautiful sunsets... didn't have to leave for wildlife viewing- EAGLES, crows, geese, woodpeckers etc lazily enjoyed from comfy couch or recliner. We would have been on the large deck or yard area with fire pit, but weather was not ideal. 18 degrees and windy! Floor to ceiling windows were amazing! Hope to book again soon!"
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Just like so many other reviews, beautiful and peaceful! Hope to come back when it‚Äôs warmer!!!"

Wish we could've stayed longer."
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Julia‚Äôs place is warm and inviting! The views of the Mississippi River is gorgeous. The fire pit is large with plenty of wood to use. The space was very clean including the bathroom and kitchens. No issues contacting the owner. Would recommend staying here

2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The property was larger then we expected which was great. The Master Bedroom on the 2nd floor was larger than we expected along with the master bathroom. The master bath shower did not have as much water pressure as we would have liked but it is a cabin. Internet was good and fast. The view of the Mississippi River was amazing and great to watch it flow by as we drank a cup of coffee. Check out was simple and quick. It was nice to not have TVs in any of the bedrooms. The master bedroom mattress was very firm and we slept well. Would like to use this property in the future to bring some of our adult children and spouses with us. Great place to stay. Would definitely recommend to others.

River views, beautiful sunsets, lovely quiet area, wonderful safe walks with our dog, perfect getaway from our busy lives. Stores and restaurants are 15-25 minutes away but not necessary since there is a fully equipped kitchen and honestly the river views from the dining room are better than any restaurant. This cozy home is exactly as described in the listing and spotlessly clean. Very very enjoyable and relaxing stay and very good value for the price."

It‚Äôs fully (+some) equipped and the extra touches of fresh flowers and soap/shampoo made the space even better than imagined. Cecilia was incredibly responsive, kind, and even though I didn‚Äôt need anything - I‚Äôm confident she would have quickly replied. Will definitely stay here again."
2024-06-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,"Beautiful location ... winery just minutes away . Dog friendly and very spacious . Bbq available which was great . We were able to park in the garage and had access to the laundry room .
Balcony overlooking the Mississippi River was so tranquil .
Our host was very accommodating with checking in early .
We travel from Niagara Falls Ontario. Canada .
I highly recommend this location ."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We enjoyed our stay and the winery! We will be back, great location, house and people. We had a birthday gathering at the winery and they could not have been more accommodating."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,The property was as advertised and described. We rented the property to have Christmas with the family and it accommodated all of our needs. Being close the the winery is very nice.
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Always my first choice for a place to stay in Clinton. Beautiful, walkable. Spacious interior, classically decorated. Very well equipped kitchen. Highly recommend staying at this vineyard airbnb"
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Thank you for the stay
This was a special Thanksgiving trip"
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Amazing stay! Very spacious, clean and bright! Perfect home for a girls weekend with the winery just up the road! We enjoyed our complementary bottle of wine on the deck and also the complementary wine tasting at the winery.
Beautiful view on the deck overlooking the Mississippi River! We were fortunate to have great weather in November, and sat out on the deck for a while, enjoying some wine and music. We even saw a deer outside the back door while fixing breakfast one morning!
A couple tidbits. If you go during the winter months, be sure to bring a four-wheel-drive vehicle just in case there is snow. You are in a country setting. There will be some small bugs in the fall months‚Ä¶as again you are in the country and in a wooded setting. Its to be expected. I am from the country, so I completely understand how it is!
Overall amazing experience and comfortable place to stay! Highly recommend! ‚ù§Ô∏è"
2023-11-01,3.0,Stayed with kids,"The house was fine. Just not worth the cost. It isn't super fancy or up to date. Dishwasher is old and loud. Lots of boxelder bugs on the outside of the house and some were in. Was nice having 2 bathrooms, place was clean, dishes, plates and silverware were all in a closet in the kitchen we over looked the first day. We thought they would be in the kitchen cabinets or pull out drawers so at first I didn't think they had any. Our mistake not theirs but I just didn't see those doors to look in the first night. The driveway is VERY steep and the road leading to the place looks more like a driveway then a road but it was not hard to get to. I have stayed at nicer places for a lot cheaper. Was not a bad place to stay in my opinion just way over priced for what you get."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Wonderful, spacious housing with several beautiful outdoor seating areas, all overlooking the Mississippi River. Winery within walking distance. Peaceful. Would highly recommend staying here. Is first on my list of housing options whenever in Clinton."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Wonderful host, great location, perfect stay!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"This Airbnb is so fun! Just down the hill from the winery (you can walk there) and beautiful views of the Mississippi River. The house has multiple seating options inside and outside. So plenty of options for reading, relaxing, and drinking wine. Off the kitchen is an awesome space with a table and lots of sun. We did puzzles in there and went onto the deck from there. A great find and a really relaxing getaway. Wine is very good too!
One note, the driveway is steep and the airbnb is technically on the second floor (first floor is garage). Just want those with mobility needs to be aware. You‚Äôll need to climb stairs up to airbnb from garage or go up stairs outside to the side of the house. Once inside main floor, no stairs."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Fantastic views of the Mississippi along with great wine to share with family!! Squeaky clean throughout with all the amenities. Future guests must head up to the winery for great wine, views, snacks, service and great company. Activate place but not crazy busy. Great places! We will be back to River Lodge and Wide River Winery. Thanks Cecilia!!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Spacious living area, comfortable beds, gorgeous views. Private, peaceful, just right with a primary master with ensuite shower, room with queen, room with two twins, and a sleeper sofa and a second bathroom with shower tub.
Kitchen full size fridge, gas stove and oven, Crock pot, Blender, charcoal grill and utensils, basic seasonings, all the basics for cooking and baking are in hand.
Host is gracious, responsive, and unobtrusive. A total pleasure."
2023-09-01,5.0,Group trip,Very peaceful. Everything you need is provided. Lots of parking. It is right next to train tracks but there‚Äôs only a few a day and they‚Äôre super quick going by!
2023-09-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,"Beautiful and clean place. The check in was very easy. Spotless clean.
Too bad we weren‚Äôt aware of the garage being air conditioned apparently, which info wasn‚Äôt included in the house rules. Therefore we were lectured by the owner in the condescending manner, that we are cooling the entire neighborhood."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Peaceful and beautiful. Ideal getaway on the Mississippi. Loved the winery and thoughtful extras. Will be back!
2023-08-01,5.0,Group trip,"The river lodge was so relaxing. Hanging out on the patio watching the river was amazing. The neighborhood was quiet with little traffic. The lodge was so clean, well stocked, and perfect for our family. The chilled bottle of wine was a welcomed surprise. Cecilia was attentive to our inquiries from booking through our stay. She is a pleasure. An added treat was the tasting room just up the hill. We enjoyed the ladies there and their welcoming spirit.
She even had fresh flowers for us from the yard. They were so welcoming and beautiful"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We had a wonderful girls trip that included my dog at the last minute. Very accommodating in adding her and she thoroughly enjoyed herself too, especially meeting the welcoming committee of LuLu, the dog, and the tabby cat. We had a very relaxed start each morning on the deck with a cup of coffee and then had a home away from home when returning from our adventures!!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We were very happy with our stay at Cecilia‚Äôs home. While it was just myself, my husband and our dog, there is plenty of room for a larger family, and two bathrooms is a huge plus. The main bedroom was much larger than it appears in the photos. It had two closets with plenty of room to hang clothing and store luggage out of the way. There is also a dresser which is a convenient space to lay jewelry, toiletries, and other smaller items. Bathrooms are updated, and were very clean.
Our trip was in July, and the weather was very steamy, so we didn‚Äôt spend too much time outside at the house, but the view of the river is awesome, and the grassy backyard is great for taking out your pets.
After asking, we were allowed to park in the garage, which was much appreciated and made loading our vehicle much easier.
Cecelia asked for our preference in wine, and left a complimentary bottle in the fridge. This extra touch was so nice. We would definitely stay again, but bring more family next time!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"We spent a week here while visiting our Son, Daughter in law and Grandson in Clinton. We had a wonderful time. It was so very quiet and peaceful looking out at the Mississippi River from the deck, while playing scrabble and uno with our family. We also had a nice time grilling out a couple of times. Cecilia was always very responsive and helpful anytime we reached out to her. We even met a new friend in Killian the cat who came to visit us from time to time. I would highly recommend the place."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful and immaculate home on the river. Cecilia is a wonderful host. Winery is beautifully set for a relaxing glass of wine with loved ones. Would love to stay here again. Thank you Cecelia. Also thanks to the woman at the winery who was a such a joy. We really enjoyed our time there.
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"This house is located in a beautiful setting right next to the Mississippi. The bathrooms are nicely updated, and the bedrooms are just as described/pictured. The TV is a smart TV. The internet isn't super fast, but my husband was able to have a couple of Zoom calls, and we were able to stream several shows on the TV. We found the kitchen to be fairly well stocked. A few notes: 1) There is a train track between the house and the river. If you have the windows open, the engines are somewhat loud. Other than that, the trains are mostly background noise. 2) The winery is up the hill from the house, so there is sporadic traffic going by in front of the house. 3) The property owner has a dog that may stop by. She's very friendly, but she's high energy, so she might be a bit much at first. We only saw her once in four days. 4) The living area is all on the top level, so be prepared to cart all of your stuff up a flight of steps. 5) You are on a river, so be prepared for bugs."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,I always enjoy staying here. Everything is perfect.
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,My wife and I enjoyed our stay and Cecilia worked with us at the last min. Will definitely be coming back!!!

2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We enjoyed our stay at the River Lodge. The house had everything you needed - blankets, pillows, soap, hair dryer, etc. It was one of the best Airbnb‚Äôs we stayed at so far! Beautiful views of the river and an added bonus for us was that we were able to bring our dog. The beds were comfortable and provided a great nights rest which we needed after driving all the way from Pennsylvania! We will be back!"
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Beautiful place with a great yard and a great deck with a view of the river!! We really enjoyed our time there. The winery was so cute and the wines were delicious. The beds were also extremely comfortable! We had an amazing time.

2022-05-01,5.0,Group trip,"A great, mostly secluded property with wonderful views to the great Mississippi river. The house was comfortable and well appointed for guests to enjoy. Instructions were clear and easy to understand for check in and check out. Not mention winery up the road! Great trip!"

I highly recommend it!"
2022-05-01,5.0,Group trip,"The River Lodge was exactly what our family needed as we were in town dealing with the death of our mother. If you are looking for peace and quiet with nature all around, this is the place for you. The Lodge had everything that we needed. Due to the crazy weather (cold when we arrived and then hot and humid), we had to use both the Heat and AC and both worked well. Kitchen is great as well as the sun room with deck. The views of the river are fantastic. The winery is just up the hill and there was something that everyone enjoyed. The host was easy to contact and provided clear instructions and answered any questions."
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We very much enjoyed this place. Lovely quiet spot with great river views‚Ä¶and lots of wildlife to enjoy‚Ä¶.deer, bald eagles,etc. very tucked away, yet SO close to town

2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Lovely setting by the river with a deck, nice kitchen stocked with dishes and a variety of cooking pans, utensils, crockpot, toaster, microwave, etc, made meal prep easy. A small dining area w/assess to a patially shaded deck. Living room could use additional comfortable chairs. Love the big sunroom with lots of natural light; perfect for art projects, playing cards/games, nice view of the river, and doors to the deck that overlooks the river. And the winery is just above the inn on the bluff."
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Loves staying at this place. Clean and with a gorgeous view. The whole house as cozy with everything we needed to enjoy a weekend of grilling and relaxing. Also the wine is fantastic!
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This home is wonderful for a girls group or crafting weekend to enjoy the nearly winery & solitude. It was close enough to Clinton to shop (not open much open on Sunday).
It was a wonderful stay and the gift of welcome wine was great!"
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,What a great getaway!! I wanted a peaceful place for my wife that our dog could enjoy too. This was the exact place I was looking for. I would definitely recommend this peaceful place to anyone looking to get away from the hustle and bustle!
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We highly recommend Cecilia and the River Lodge for a peaceful time on the river.
2021-08-01,5.0,Group trip,Absolutely breathtaking view! Our group of 5 girls absolutely loved our weekend here! And the winery at the top of the hill is A BONUS!! ‚ù§Ô∏è
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful and private, tucked back in the woods alongside the Mississippi River at its widest point in Iowa! The magnificent views from the elevated deck were stunning and hours spent in the serene and quiet surroundings hiking and just hanging out! We loved it!"
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Spacious, comfortable and clean. Nice big bonus room that was great for board games and family time. Enjoyed the Mississippi River view, and loved meeting the world's friendliest neighbor's cat. Of course, thanks so much for the yummy First Degree wine. Friendly staff at the winery as well.

2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a great weekend stay! The view of the river was beautiful and the house is located in a nice quiet area. The house was spacious and comfortable for the four of us, and our dogs had plenty of room to roam outside and enjoyed exploring outdoors. Our friends really enjoyed the wine Cecilia left for us and we also highly recommend the local ice cream shop just down the road. If you are planing on being in the Clinton area make sure to check this place out!"
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Great house, great views of the river. Peaceful. Everything you need."
2021-07-01,5.0,Group trip,"This spot was worth every penny! Overlooking the Mississippi, and a quick minute drive to the winery where we had the most excellent service. Highly recommend this place!"
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We enjoyed our stay here-it was perfect for a quick weekend and there was more than enough room to spread out. The kitchen was fully stocked so we were able to cook meals and the sunroom was great-us adults could be in there at night to play games while the kiddos slept. We would definitely stay here again!
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,All the little extras were great at Cecilia‚Äôs place on the river! What a view! Excellent retreat. We will certainly be back when visiting Iowa in the future.
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,A perfect house/location to get away from it all. Really enjoyed the nearby city/state parks on both sides of the river. Traffic on the river and bird activity were treats as well.
2021-06-01,5.0,Group trip,This place is absolutely amazing and I could not recommend it more :)
2021-06-01,5.0,Group trip,Stayed here with my groomsmen before my wedding. Awesome space to hangout and great views of the river. Would highly recommend.
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Our family had an amazing stay at the River Lodge. It was the perfect, relaxing location for our busy family. That front deck opens up to the beautiful Mississippi River. And that sunrise in the morning is absolutely breathtaking!!!! The back deck offered our family a shaded area next to the backyard and woods to enjoy as well! Loved the house; being perfectly furnished and supplied with all that our family needed."
2021-06-01,5.0,Group trip,"My family has stayed at the River Lodge two years in a row now. We book for three days and usually have 6-8 people. We find the lodge spacious, very clean, and with spaces indoors and out to gather. Reliable and strong Wifi signal. In the morning, we prefer the west patio, away from the sun, but then moving to the river side by mid afternoon when the sun begins to descend in the western sky. I love sitting on the deck and watching barge traffic on the Mississippi. We always spend one afternoon at the winery which makes the lodge perfect for us. We also like to cook out one night and our hosts had charcoal, lighter fluid etc waiting for us. We have tried other BnBs in the area but we are sold on this one. Book early, though, because I find that the best dates go fast!!"
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We love the location, the view and the wonderful deck. Very comfortable stay!"
2021-05-01,5.0,Group trip,Everything was clean! We had a great experience. Perfect place for a group of 5 people. Riverview was amazing. We enjoyed having breakfast in the Riverview side. I recommend this place! üòä

2021-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Very relaxing stay here! The yard is a nice size for the dogs to explore and the house has all the comforts of home. The walk to the winery is not far but is up a very steep gravel drive and the winery is fantastic!
2021-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,A really amazing location and a great getaway.
2021-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Wonderful getaway in nature. Dog and family friendly. Great communication from Cecilia. We will definitely be back!

2021-02-01,5.0,Group trip,Cecelia was a great host. She was flexible with last minute changes in guests and her communication was amazing! When we arrived there was complimentary wine in the fridge and we walked up to the winery-both nights. It was definitely a great stay and just what the kids and adults needed.
2021-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Beautiful view of the river
2021-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Cecilia‚Äôs place was a perfect getaway. Super impressed by the cleanliness and enjoyed grilling out for dinner with all the kitchen supplies! Loved our walk up to the winery- staff was very generous. Loved that we could bring our pups & would love to come visit again in the summer to experience the Mississippi without snow. Thank you for a wonderful and spot on experience!
2021-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Nice space, comfy beds, clean, and in a beautiful location overlooking the Mississippi! We got there too late to check out the winery but plan to go back."
2020-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The lodge is a fantastic hideaway on the banks of the Mississippi just a short ways from lock n damn 13. The water flows past the front of the property as does the occasional freight train, flocks of birds soar about, and the winery property and local parks are fantastic for walking and enjoying nature and some spectacular views. There‚Äôs a back yard area - not fenced but great for playing with the dogs who were welcome to join us at the house . The kitchen and laundry are like home and there‚Äôs a giant game family room as well as a dining area and living room! The beds were all comfy and fresh and clean. We visited from CO and my daughter drove in from Chicago for a fall family celebration. The Wide River Winery was a delightful daily stop and a walk up the hill. For the kids to escape the city and relax this was truly a gem!"
2020-11-01,5.0,Group trip,nice quiet place in the middle of nowhere. Very peaceful.
2020-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"What an amazing place for a group vacation! We had a small family reunion because we've been unable to see each other for about a year due to Covid and it was just perfect. Gorgeous view (try to catch at least one sunrise), great amenities (I'm in love with the stove), high-speed internet and a friendly cat, what more do you need? If your answer to that was ""a great winery with welcoming employees and tasty food"", then you're in luck; a short 1/2 mile walk/drive up the hill and you'll find exactly that.
My only negative the entire weekend was having to leave, we all agreed that we wished we had scheduled more time."
2020-10-01,5.0,Group trip,Cecilia was a gracious host and very timely with her responses. My whole family was amazed with the view of the Mississippi. Looking forward to our return!
2020-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Cecilia's place has great ambiance with good indoor space and gorgeous outdoor space as well. I love the stocked kitchen and gas stove. There is a great front deck sitting area looking out over the giant river. There is also a private backyard sitting area. Eagle Point Park is five minutes away and has a fantastic playground and one of the most unique and beautiful dog parks that we've seen. There are some nice walking trails there too. Don't forget to visit the winery during your stay at Cecilias. They even have delicious root beer and cream soda for the kids.
2020-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Absolutely AMAZING. Pictures do not do this place justice! Everything was perfection and Cecilia was so helpful along the way. I can't say enough great things about this home! You wake up to the most beautiful sunrise overlooking the mighty Mississippi, basically no surrounding neighbors and the best thing about the place you may ask? It's only a short walk to the winery! We can't wait to come again! If you are looking for a clean home for a quite getaway, this is your place!"
2020-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Was a great place to stay
2020-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Excellent hospitality and beautiful view of the Mississippi River! We were very impressed by how hospitable the host was. The winery up the dirt road is beautiful, the wine was really good and overall it was a really great experience! We will be back thank you Cecilia!"
2020-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,This place is perfection. The host is so gracious and generous. The view of the river is so peaceful and lovely. We hope to return here soon! Don‚Äôt overlook this place!
2020-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The property was beautiful and the host was very responsive and helpful. There was access to a large yard right on the river and also a nice Weber grill.
2020-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Cecilia‚Äôs home is a little slice of heaven. Located off the beaten path, the views are beautiful. She gave us wine to take on our journey since we were not able to go to the tasting room. Very hospitable and easy to communicate with."
2020-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,The home was perfect. It was very clean. The location was exactly where we expected. Cecilia was the perfect host. She had everything we needed there and answered all our questions. We would definitely go back.
2020-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The view and location here can't be beat. The front view of the Mississippi River paints a beautiful sunrise - but the backdoor leading to a private wooded area was an unexpected treat. Slept like a rock here, pet friendly, very clean, friendly + cute neighborhood cat and the owner is a fantastic, responsive and helpful AirBnB host. I hope to return again one day!"
2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We stayed here for our 10th wedding anniversary. Check in was easy and the place was very clean. Unfortunately the WiFi was out the entire time we stayed there, due to an outage in the area. And there is very little cell signal at the lodge. But it turned out to be good, it forced us to unplug for the weekend. To make up for the inconvenience we got extra wine from the winery. Which is a big win in my book. The winery was charming, and the wait staff was attentive and helpful. It's very dark at night and we looked at the stars. It's quiet and secluded and romantic. I wish we'd booked a longer stay. But we'll be back again next time we want to get away."
2020-08-01,5.0,Group trip,"This was a nice relaxing place to stay! It was quiet, calm and has an absolute amazing view of the river!"
2020-08-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"The stay at Cecilia‚Äôs place was just wonderful. She has everything you would possibly need - enough space to spread out, items needed to prepare food, & a lovely view of the full moon. It was a much needed escape. The winery was tranquil & a very short (but a bit rugged) walk away. Sarah who helped us through tastings was just great. She even called Cecilia to help get a message to me about forgetting my hat at the winery. We will hopefully make it back for another relaxing time soon."
2020-08-01,5.0,Group trip,"If you are looking for a scenic locale that offers access to one of Iowa‚Äôs best wineries, you have found it here. The hosts are thoughtful and gracious. The price is right and the amenities many. If you stay, take advantage of the complimentary wine at Wide River. We are eager to return."
2020-07-01,5.0,Group trip,"Cecilia‚Äôs place is great, very clean and with an amazing view. Would definitely try to book again in the future or recommend this place to others"
2020-07-01,5.0,Group trip,River Lodge was great! The place was super clean and even had cooking supplies! We went to the store and bought food to cook! Two great places to relax on the deck in the backyard or the front overlooking the Mississippi River. The winery is just up the road! I do recommend driving since it‚Äôs a straight up hill walk unless you want to get exercise. Easy check in and out and Cecilia was very responsive with messages! Highly recommend and would like to come back!
2020-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The river lodge is incredible- beautiful evenings spent on the patio, great vino from the winery, and wonderful views of the Mississippi River. Cecilia was a generous, thoughtful, and welcoming host- we were particularly fond of the neighbor‚Äôs cat who patrolled the yard! We would love to come back again!"
2020-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The location is off on it's own with one nearby neighbor. The view of the river is gorgeous! The Wide River Winery being so nearby was really nice! Cecilia was very responsive to any of our questions about the property or area. We rode our bikes on the gravel road and hiked a bit as well!
2020-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Great family trip! Loved being in walking distance to the winery and we enjoyed the community pool in Newton. We also enjoyed the chicken George from the Candlelight Inn.
The house was well equipped. The views from the deck were the best part!"
2020-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Cecilias hospitality is second to none! I was traveling from Ohio and got jammed up in traffic and made it to the cabin at 6. The taste testing room was already closed and rather than not getting my complimentary bottle Cecilia not only delivered our wine to our door but also gave us 2 bottles just because my drive was tough!! Her words not mine lol such an amazing place with amazing views and the hospitality is parallel to none I can‚Äôt say it enough. Wish I could‚Äôve stayed longer. And fur children are welcome. You just can not beat it.

2020-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This home is the perfect spot for couples, friends, or families looking to get away and enjoy the outdoors and sounds of silence. My boyfriend and our dog stayed here for the weekend and it just wasn't long enough. The place felt just like home - it was very clean and Cecilia did a great job of making sure we had everything we needed - cleaning and cooking supplies, bug spray, lighter fluid, sunscreen, extra shampoo/body wash. This spot overlooks the Mississippi River and there was plenty of land for our dog to run around in. The winery up the hill was lovely, especially the complimentary bottle of wine that Cecilia included with our stay :) I would recommend this home to anyone looking for some peace and quiet. We are already planning our next trip back."
2020-05-01,5.0,Group trip,It was the best airbnb experience I have ever had before. This place is much better than what you see in the pics. I don‚Äôt understand why the rating is only 4.77. It should be more than 5 star.. it was AMAZING!! Definitely visit again.

2020-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Cecilia‚Äôs place was better than the posting even does justice. It was so relaxing for a winter weekend getaway. The house was large and had all the comforts of home plus an incredible view, nice walking trail, and you could walk uphill to a cute winery. It‚Äôs private enough for you to feel secluded but a short drive to local grocery stores, shops, and anything else you would need. We will be back!"
2020-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,I loved my stay and especially loved being able to have my two dogs with me. They enjoyed the walks in the woods and relaxing in the evening while I cooked dinner. On my last day I was able to get amazing pictures of the sunrise on the Mississippi.

2019-07-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"Close to the Wide River Winery with great views of the Mississippi River. We spent the weekend drinking wine, exploring Clinton City Parks and antiquing. It was a wonderful girl‚Äôs weekend.
The living room is large. The bathrooms were clean and well appointed. There was a grill with charcoal, lighter and lighter fluid included.
Cecelia welcomed us to the tasting room and gave us a bottle of red wine. They had frozen wine slushies, which was a blessing on such a hot day. It was nice not to think about driving home!
I would recommend the lodge for a quick weekend getaway."

This old house feels like home and is decorated really tastefully. It is clean and has everything you‚Äôll need and then some! It‚Äôs stocked really well. I have zero complaints about this listing and will look forward to staying here again next time we are in Clinton. Thanks, Sarah!"

2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Sara's Cottage is a beautiful, historic home nestled near the Mississippi River. The home was perfect for our short weekend trip where we celebrated a family wedding. The beds were comfortable & it's not often that a home offers two King-sized beds! Our hosts left snacks and recommendations for restaurants in town. There was a separate office room off of the kitchen that was perfect for our son's pack'n'play and gave us some extra privacy. This would be an excellent home for someone staying several days, as the location is close to all that the area has to offer, parking is on-site, and the kitchen is huge!

2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"This is a clean and comfortable place to stay. It is about 2 blocks from the hospital and five minutes from the nearest clinic. The home is probably 5-10 minutes from eagle point park and 5-10 minutes from the bridges taking you to the other side of the Mississippi. It is 2 blocks from the train that goes by 3-4 times in the evening. The noise did not bother me at all but if you are super sensitive it is something to consider. The house is old but it is clean and well taken care of. They have upgraded where they need to (kitchen and bathroom) and left alone those things that are still great, so it allows you to enjoy some of the traditional style and beauty of the home. I visited when it was cold but there is a table and chairs outside with hanging lights as well as a large porch with comfortable seating if you are visiting in good weather."

But Sara has obviously renovated the home with today's families in mind. There are plenty of electrical outlets all around the house, and the kitchen is a cook's delight with deluxe appliances. The home is located in a quiet residential area that is fun to walk, with many old homes of architectural interest. The front porch has comfy seating, ideal for relaxing with a good book and a favorite beverage.
Sara is a generous host and was responsive to our needs. We would definitely stay there again."

2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,The pictures don't do it justice! This is an amazing home and so very comfortable in every way. This is the one!
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very nice home. Very clean. I felt very welcome.
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Gorgeous cottage with lots of cozy touches and super comfortable bed.
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Sara is a great host and the house was beyond our expectations. Had a wonderful stay in Clinton.
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"It was the perfect spot- even better than expected! I would come back to Clinton, IA to relax at Sara's beautiful home. The pictures do little justice... The best airbnb I have stayed at!"
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The cottage was so cozy, clean, and welcoming. Sara was extremely communicative about everything. If you're staying in Clinton I can't imagine a good reason you'd want to stay anywhere else!"
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Sara‚Äôs cottage is beautiful and very comfortable.
The beds and couch are amazing.
We definitely recommend it to anyone going to Clinton.
We will be returning."
2021-08-01,5.0,Group trip,Cannot recommend this place enough! It was so perfect and homey for our stay in Clinton. The space is thoughtful and cozy. Thank you so much!
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Wonderful place. Great location near the river walk and great restaurants. We had a wonderful time.
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Sara‚Äôs place is great! Really nice and comfortable and clean. Everything is provided including snacks, which made my daughter so happy. (Less so me.) She has left info of her favorite local places which was awesome.
The only thing to note is that there is a train that runs until about 10:30 or so nearby and it blows its horn when passing through town. We didn‚Äôt hear it at night and not even early in the morning (I heard it once but not repeatedly.) but you DO hear it when it is running and you‚Äôre there. If you‚Äôre sensitive to this, it‚Äôs worth nothing."
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay. The porch is perfect for quiet reflection in the morning or unwinding in the evening with a drink. It is an older home so expect squeaky floors and not all the outlets work the same. Also note there is a train crossing nearby so if you are audio sensitive sleep with the windows closed. Overall though a well stocked and charming home. I‚Äôm not the only one that thinks so. When we were on the porch a car stopped to tell us that ‚Äúour‚Äù home was lovely and they think so every time they drive by. Walking distance to a grocery store and lots of great places to eat.
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Absolutely gorgeous home. Impeccably clean, welcoming and downright comfortable. The location is every bit as attractive as it seems, though this place is so lovely that you‚Äôll be hard-pressed to want to go any farther than the front porch."
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,This was possibly the prettiest Airbnb home we‚Äôve stayed at (and there have been many!). We enjoyed every minute of hanging out on the porch. This home is a joy to be in.
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This was the perfect stop during our road trip. There were a lot of little touches that made it feel like a home away from home.
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Perfect house for a long weekend. The decorating is beautiful. The front porch has super comfy chairs great for coffee or other drinks. The bed was spacious and the couch is very comfortable. 10/10 would recommend to anyone stay again.
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This is a great place to stay!! You are in for a treat when you stay at this beautiful home in Clinton! Very clean, comfortable and truly felt like you were going to stay with family! The host provided many thoughtful amenities like water in the fridge, breakfast items/ snacks!! We all enjoyed our stay and recommend this beautiful house to other travelers!"
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great space very nice! Hosts are great at reaching out with information.
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Beautiful home that was thoughtfully decorated. Kitchen and bathroom were well stocked with anything that you could possibly need. It was a convenient stop on our road trip. If we ever find ourselves in Clinton, Iowa again we will certainly stay at Sara's home again."
2024-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"What a great place to stay in Clinton! It was very clean and comfortable, and Deanna was very communicative."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The stay was wonderful, clean, inviting and homey. Positive, calm vibes. Linens and furniture were cushy and comfortable. Thanks for the little welcoming ‚Äúextras‚Äù on the table and having toiletries available. Perfect size and secure. If and when I come back to the area, this is where I would want to stay again!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Deanna was a gracious host! She was very responsive and even offered suggestions on other ways our crew could benefit from more of the area!
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We had a very pleasant stay, we would come back any time."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,it was very nice. we got what we expected.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,This was a comfortable space to call home for a few days while visiting my mom. My daughters loved it. The drive thru coffee downstairs was an added bonus. I‚Äôd seek out this place again.
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The Java Loft was perfect. It was clean, cozy and comfortable. Check in was super easy and the area is a great location. The loft is decorated beautifully and made for an enjoyable stay while in town. The earplugs and cute snack basket were an unexpected and certainly appreciated extra thought. When in the area again, we‚Äôd definitely stay here again."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The space was lovely, Deanna was very proactive and responsive, and they even left little snacks and toiletries throughout the place that makes things very easy for an out-of-town guest. Highly recommend and would stay again!"
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The Java Loft is a great place to stay. How wonderful for the community to have a locally owned space that is clean and safe to stay at instead of a hotel. The loft is spacious with two bedrooms, a large bathroom with a separate place to get ready in, a full kitchen and the most comfortable living room. I will definitely stay here again!"
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Easy to get in and out. Comfortable and clean. Close to our family in town.
There are trains that are a little noisy as they come through, but earplugs are provided if that would bother your sleep."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,As a returning client that has stayed here before it is a clean and comfortable place. We will always stay with Lou every time we visit the area!!
2024-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great location, beautiful studio apartment, bonus store on the ground floor!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great host and great location! Loved the host's store below the Airbnb. Found several great items to take home!! I also enjoyed being by the Mississippi River with easy access to a nice walkway. Very peaceful.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"Lou's place was a great place to stay!
It was clean and just a few steps to the river walk. Lou's shop was adorable.
We will definitely be back!"
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,Here for work. Couldn't ask for better accomodations.
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We‚Äôll be back!
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Everything was as advertised and zero complaints. The host was open, honest and communicative. Would stay here again without hesitation."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,I will stay here again! I come to the area to play music often - and I am so glad I found a great place to rest my head at night! Lou was exceptional and really did an outstanding job with hosting.
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,everything was good we will go back until one of us can't do the stairs.
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Very well maintained considering the age of this building. The stairs are a hike, so be ready for that. On the bright side, they helped with my daily step count!
Lou was very friendly and helpful the whole stay. She helped me book an extra night at the last minute so that I wouldn‚Äôt have to leave my comfy spot and check into a hotel. Very much appreciated!
Her shop on the first floor has a lot of good finds and is fun to browse through, a must do during your stay!
I will definitely consider this place every time I come back to Clinton!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Perfect place to stay for me and my hubby for weekend while visiting his dad. SO very clean and quiet. Super comfy bed and slept like a rock. Location is central and enjoyed shopping in Lou's consignment store downstairs. Will definitely return. (Note: there are quite a few stairs. Not a problem for us, and not sure there is an elevator available for large luggage or disabled individuals.)"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The ONLY little thing was that we were not expecting so many stairs to get there. My friend had a fall last week, making it a little tricky for her to access the place. But the building itself was enchanting, very nice, and cozy. I thought that the AC ""limitation"" would be a problem, but setting it at 74 was perfect. My friend is a germaphobe, so she inspected EVERYTHING. She was so very pleasantly surprised. It was ridiculously clean! Even the windowsills were immaculate, the cabinets, and the bathroom. We were very happy with our stay. The hostess included some oatmeal bars and water bottles as a welcome gift. It was very sweet :) And the TV had like 1000 channels!
We would happily recommend this apartment to anybody."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Outstanding stay at Lou's place. Beautiful unit. Clean, comfortable, in the heart of Clinton's downtown and short distance of the Mississippi River walk. Lou is friendly and caring. Clinton is very beautiful. Nice people. I highly recommend to visit this awesome city and stay at Lou's place. My husband and I will return in the near future. A+"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Lou's place was an extremely excellent stay that I will choose anytime in the area. Her place was close to the riverfront which I was able to walk every morning, and close to a great Mexican restaurant right across the street.
The place was roomy and very clean and stocked as stated in the description. I would definitely recommend Lou's place to anyone looking in the area."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Conveniently located and a quiet location. Lou was excellent at communicating and made instructions for check-in and check-out very clear. I would certainly stay with her again and would recommend staying there too if you are looking for a spot in Clinton.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Stay was better than we could have hoped for! Unit was convenient, super comfortable responsive and pristine! If we are in Clinton again we will definitely be staying! Thank you Lou and Michael!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"If you're staying in Clinton, this place is right downtown. The building is old, and the floors are a little creeky, but the apartments are clean and in great shape."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,For what we paid to stay here this place was perfect. Very clean and in a great location for we wanted to do.
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We were surprised to find so much more than we expected in our stay in clinton. We were visiting to see a performance at the Showboat Theater and we were not aware of all of the bike trails and restaurants in the area. Lou had a guide for us illustrating everything that was available and we found time to get to most of during our four day stay. Lou's Place is in the middle of so many outdoor activities and we really look forward to going back.
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I can see why Lou has earned the title of Super Host! The apartment was very clean and quiet. All instructions were easy to understand. Two family members were working remotely and the Internet easily handled both of them online together. As a bonus, I was able to find a birthday gift in her shop below the apartment. Absolutely no complaints."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,It‚Äôs a very nice place close to the river. The hosts responded very quickly whenever I need something. Definitely recommend!
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,I loved my stay. The apartment was a great price. There are stairs to walk up. Not a problem for me. She provided earplugs which i did not need. But it was nice. Everything was easy with check in and check out! Thanks for the stay!!
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Lou‚Äôs place was perfect for my business trip; easy to find and get to, in a cute and convenient location. It was quiet and private and clean, would definitely stay again!"
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,I stayed here while I was in the area for work. It was perfect for what I needed.
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"Great place to stay, very cozy"
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Clean, comfortable, and easy to get to with a simple check in. Lou was great at responding to messages right away and had the place set up nicely. Bed was comfortable as well. Will definitely be staying here every time I come to town from now on."
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great location downtown. Walking/biking trail across the street. Room was equipped with everything we needed for cooking & being comfortable. Lou is great!!

2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Clean and great location. Lou is very responsive. This was a perfect writing retreat getaway. I‚Äôd stay again. Jenny‚Äôs Diner a short drive away has the best breakfast too!!
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Loved this place, wonderful location, hosts checked to see if everything was okay. Great stay for the money."
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Quaint town to stop in. Very quiet though. Not much activity in the downtown area. Lovely biking trails.
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Nice and clean accomodation in a downtown historical building. Highly recommended.
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Highly recommended! Great location across from riverside park and path. Several restaurants within walking distance and grocery etc nearby. Very clean and comfortable, well equipped with everything we needed. Owners are extremely pleasant and ensured a pleasant stay"
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Cute! The building was neat and it‚Äôs a great location. The whole process was very smooth
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place in the center of Clinton. Would stay again.
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Fun town to explore! Simple, nice, convenient place to stay."
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Awesome spot! The area is really cool. it is on a main drag with a lot to do. The apartment is well furnished and clean. Parking is right at the building so you don't have to carry all your stuff super far. The best part is they provide a fan. Each room has a fan. We rode our motorcycles so we i couldn't fit a box fan on the back.
2022-06-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Great location close to downtown clinton and riverfront. Easy check in/check out process and great communication response time with host.
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great place to stay! It was very convenient for us visiting family in the area. Close to the river front and the train tracks. Host is kind enough to provide earplugs but we didn't need them. Also, there is another room with a twin bed which was nice to have that option if needed. We will definitely stay again!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We enjoyed our girls weekend at Lynda‚Äôs place. It was beautiful and especially the kitchen was fully stocked of anything you might need. We enjoyed all the outdoor space. It is nice and private but still close to places to get things or go out to eat. She does mentioned the train and it did come by more often and was louder than we expected. It wasn‚Äôt a huge deal but my toddler wasn‚Äôt a fan and it did wake her up a few times. So if you have littles that are easily woken up this might not be the place for you. Other than that we enjoyed our stay here and would consider it for a kid free trip in the future!
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,We enjoyed our stay.
2024-04-01,5.0,Group trip,"Lynda was an amazing host! She answered all of our questions before we even had to ask! The house was fully stocked with everything you could need, along with super clean. We would 100% stay again."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Feels like HOME! Lynda provided excellent instructions and was very responsive. The home provides everything you need and is absolutely gorgeous Excellent outdoor area to relax in also We enjoyed sitting on the deck and watching the trains go by.
Real gem!!!!!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Very clean, private home. Excellent outdoor area to relax in. Great location with shopping, restaurants, and entertainment a short drive away."
2024-03-01,5.0,Group trip,"Lynda is an amazing host! She was very responsive with any questions or needs we had while at her home. The home itself is absolutely beautiful, and has all the amenities and whatever else you could think of to need. The kitchen open living room concept was great for watching the March Madness games, and there was never any disconnect between our group staying at this location. Everything that was listed with the house was there, and Lynda has all the necessities needed to make her place like home for however long you are staying there. Absolutely no problems whatsoever while staying there, Lynda made sure we were comfortable and had everything we needed at all times, will recommend to anybody and would love to stay here again!"
2024-03-01,5.0,Group trip,"""If you're looking for a peaceful, relaxing, and lovely place to stay, this is it! Lynda provided excellent instructions and was very responsive. The home is absolutely gorgeous with attention paid to every detail. We enjoyed sitting on the deck and watching the trains go by. We would definitely come back!"""
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Lynda‚Äôs place was just what we needed to relax and recharge for a couple of days!
2024-02-01,5.0,Group trip,A real gem in this area!
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"I planned a weekend getaway for my family & I - It was perfect in every way! It was a private property with so much space inside and outside. Lynda was super responsive, we will definitely book again!"
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Lynda was a wonderful host. There was everything and more. Lynda goes above and beyond, making sure guest have everything they need. The train was not a bother to us. The couches are comfy and also the beds. The kitchen had everything for the cooks in our group. Overall, it's one of THE best places all of us have stayed. The bubble lights in the bathroom were my favorite! I will be recommending and would stay again."
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"This is a great, private cabin in which to getaway. Our family of four, plus 2 dogs, was comfortable and cozy throughout our 3-night stay. As Lynda clearly states, the home is situated between a dirt road and train tracks. The dirt road is very rarely traveled, and there wasn't much traffic from the railway, either. Trains went by probably 5-8 times a day. Truly not an issue at all, and we knew to expect that.
Lynda has equipped the home really nicely and with great thoughtfulness. It was a perfect home away from home and we had a lovely time playing games, playing in the grass areas, eating, and resting. Would recommend."
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Lynda‚Äôs place is very well done. She has curated a lovely aesthetic. Its location worked extremely well for us on our visit to family and friends in the area. I would like to comment specifically about Lynda‚Äôs responsiveness. She never made me feel like a bother with my multiple messages to her; including my left behind items which she is kindly helping me get returned I would stay here again.
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Lynda‚Äôs place was the best airbnb i rented so far! I can tell that Lynda put alot of time and effort to build her dream home. The whole cabin was very clean and well thought out. Although the cabin was small, the space was utilized efficiently. Thanks, Lynda!"
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We really enjoyed our stay! I loved the design and personal touches. It‚Äôs peaceful and absolutely beautiful.
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Nicely decorated home and responsive host
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great little getaway.. host is friendly and quick to respond. The house is adorable, it‚Äôs peaceful and had everything we needed to relax. It‚Äôs very close to town so if you need anything it‚Äôs only. 5 minutes down the road."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Wonderful little cabin. Enjoyed the solitude and peacefulness of the area.
Cabin had everything we needed and felt like home.
Lynda was very responsive and very welcoming.
Would recommend and stay here again."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Lynda‚Äôs cabin is absolutely stunning! Nestled in a small town but still in close proximity to larger areas as well. There‚Äôs a gas station and Dollar General right down the road. The cabin is really easy to find, even at night. Parking is easy. We‚Äôre so happy with our stay, we are already planning our next trip!"
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Awesome stay for our wedding night!
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"The place was great! Only thing I would mention in the write-up for the place is that it is right beside the train track, so it was very noisy. Also, the beds could really use a pillow top cover- they are hard. Otherwise, we loved the place and would love to come back in the summer!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Group trip,"Lynda's cabin was beautiful and extremely cozy. We were able to spend time in the nature preserve and at night have a fire. Her cabin is the perfect place to get away from the weekend and focus on peace, quality time, and relaxation. You can really tell the love and care Lynda put into her cabin and that it is truly something special!
Princeton has a great local restaurant called Three 33 which is delicious if you do not feel like cooking."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We booked this beautiful cabin for a long weekend away. Lynda was communicative and helpful before we even left home. She was able to get us an earlier check-in time, and was also very flexible on check-out. The cabin itself is lovely. Everything is as pictured, and our two pups felt right at home. The best part about the stay was how quiet and calm the area is - exactly what we needed.
The space is beautifully decorated, with all the modern conveniences you need. My girlfriend had a great time making use of the fully-appointed kitchen, and I had fun using the electric grill outside. The beds are on the firmer side, if that matters to you. Trains go by fairly regularly, but you barely notice them by the end of your stay. All in all, this is a lovely, pet-friendly, quiet, relaxing option for a local stay along the Mississippi!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Lynda's cabin was the perfect location for our stay. As a trio of college buddies who wanted to play and sing some acoustic music, pitch washers (an outdoor game) tell stories and catch up, the location was ideal.
The little town of Princeton had a nice bar/restaurant called Go Fish, and LeClaire (six miles away) had a brewery, distillery, restaurants and shops. It was nice to spend a few hours in town. But, mostly we just enjoyed the beautifully equipped cabin, the yard and the porch nestled between the RR tracks and farmland.
One small mention of the trains...They do run semi-regularly adjacent to the property, so if you are a light sleeper, the horn and train noise may wake you early in the morning. It did not bother us at all.
Lynda was an attentive and totally transparent host."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Great location out of town but not so far out it was a problem. House was nicely furnished and comfortable. Outdoor lounging was nice and pleasant, especially liked the deck. House was modern and appealing. Would stay there again"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Lynda‚Äôs place is one of the most beautiful homes I have ever stayed at. An architectural gem with peaceful surroundings. The wildlife refuge is within walking distance and an ideal place for walking in the mornings or evening. Lynda was always responsive and welcoming. Highly recommended.
2023-08-01,5.0,Group trip,Very clean and updated place. Wonderful location with still a good amount of privacy
2023-07-01,5.0,Group trip,"My family and I (6 adults, 2 dogs) stayed at Lynda's place for a long weekend. Everything was modern, as described and the Kitchen had everything you could think of. We experienced some extreme weather while we were there but the house stayed cool and we always felt safe. Its a short walk to the river and there is plenty of space for outdoor activities. For six of us, we realized one bathroom wasn't quite enough, but for a smaller get together, I could see us using this space again."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,We had a great time. The cabin is exactly as described. This is an excellent place to stay away from the cities while still only a short drive to anywhere you'd want to go in the area.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great retreat that offered a very relaxing environment
2023-06-01,5.0,Group trip,Very nice place with a nice host. Would recommend.

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This house is one of the most peaceful houses we have ever stayed in. The story behind it house is phenomenal and Bailee was a completely amazing host. We plan on making this stay a yearly tradition.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Stop looking and start booking! One of the best places we have stayed. Meticulously thought out and so clean. Nicely labeled for ease of use and so cute. Great location -close to everything. She checked in on us multiple times and was so friendly. This is my favorite air bnb I‚Äôve stayed in to date. I look for cleanliness, safety, location and value and this checked all the boxes. It was so cozy and comfy too. Will stay again when we come back. Thanks!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Bailee was such a an amazing host, from proactive communication preparing for my arrival to recommendations and checking in throughout my stay. The home is beautiful, comfy, and the story behind it is beautiful... definitely take time to read up on it while staying. Would definitely stay again and HIGHLY recommend!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Bailee was a joy throughout the entire booking and stay.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"Nice, clean and well decorated. Felt right at home and many small details see thought out as well as the big ones. Great experience overall"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We had a wonderful stay. It‚Äôs a great place with so many thoughtful, extra touches. The host's pride and love for the space is obvious. The host, Bailee, was also very responsive and proactive in her communication and was such a sweet person. I would definitely stay here again when we come back to town. Thank you!"
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The was our second stay here. Peaceful. Clean. Great communication.
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My stay was wonderful. The location and everything in the house turned out perfectly! I would absolutely rent anything Bailee owns/manages again.
I had a coupe of things come up during my stay. I reached out to Bailee and she responded immediately with great solutions. It's easy to give/get a great review when everything goes well. It's much harder to give/get a great review when things may not go as planned. Bailee did a fantastic job in both areas!
I look forward to a return trip to the area and renting this home again soon.
Well done!...Lori"
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"I almost didn‚Äôt write this review because I want this gem all too myself but it‚Äôs too good to not share! We booked because there were so many review from return customers and I can see why. We‚Äôll definitely be staying here every time we visit our family.

The bedrooms were comfortable and the air conditioning was not overwhelming. Ceiling fans were an option. The window treatments also allowed for black out if we wanted.
The laundry facilities were an added benefit and the front porch was used often.

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This was our second stay at Carol‚Äôs rental and it was just as wonderful as we remembered. Her place offers all the amenities we could want or need - fenced yard, separate bedrooms, large dining room, eat-in kitchen, deep tub, plenty of seating in the living room and a very comfortable and welcoming front porch and back yard, both with seating and small tables. Carol‚Äôs place is clean and homey, with just the right touches ‚Ä¶ nothing too precious or breakable, which is perfect for our family (5 yo twins). The bedrooms are cozy and dark at night, very little ambient light coming through the blinds. Kitchen is stocked with useful small appliances - coffee maker, blender, toaster - plus Tupperware, mixing bowls, pots/pans and utensils. I can‚Äôt think of a better place: price is a steal and location is close to everything. Carol is a gracious, attentive host. We will use her fire pit & gas grill on our next visit - didn‚Äôt have time this trip, even with her thoughtful offer of s‚Äômores! A+++++"

2023-06-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Don't be deceived by the exterior because the interior has been renovated & tastefully decorated. And, it is so well stocked you literally don't need to bring anything except your toothbrush, clothes & medications. Loved Carol's well written instructions & notes all over the place. Liked her story about why she named it Glenn's Place. The central location is perfect and the garage a great asset.
All-in-all it was the most comfortable place we stayed on our trip to & from AZ."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Carols place was a great little home away from home. We only were there for a short while and it was only two of us. However, if you were to bring more you‚Äôd have enough space. Carol provides a ton of things for you. She is very informative & has great hospitality. She offered to drive me and my boyfriend to and from the concert we were attending just because she informed us of a wrong gate. Which I thought was so sweet of her. She also recommended local spots to eat and local things to see. The story of why Carol purchased the home is great too. Also one of the cleanest homes I‚Äôve ever stayed in. I also seen in the garage she had tons of outdoor activities for you to use too. I would definitely go back if I were ever in Iowa again. Carol is one of the friendliest people I‚Äôve met. The locals are also amazing here! This wasn‚Äôt a downfall for us but maybe for others that Carol lives next door. But I promise you she never once bothered us or overstepped she was nothing but amazing!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We stayed at Carol's while in the area to attend the ""Cemetery Sunday"" service at Immaculate Conception church right across the river in Fulton, Illinois.

It was only me, however the place was spacious and more than enough for a few people to stay comfortably. The neighborhood was peaceful and cute and there was plenty of parking. The most important part - the shower was hot and had amazing pressure. Perfect place to stay."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,This was such an amazing place! Super cute and functional for what we needed! Lots of notes around for instructions and Carol was helpful! 10/10 recommend!

2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Carol was amazing! She checked in all the time to see if we needed anything. She answered all of my questions quickly.

I‚Äôve been in houses before where I couldn‚Äôt find the right switch for the kitchen but I didn‚Äôt need to try every light switch here! I know it‚Äôs a little thing but that‚Äôs why I love this house‚Äîall the little things are taken care of."

Carol was a wonderful host and makes sure you have everything you could want -- and then some! The kitchen was the best equipped of any of the Air BnBs I've ever stayed in. The towels are lush. There's streaming on the big tv if you want to watch a movie. The little porch is a great spot for morning coffee. And there were two spots in the garage for our cars. The neighborhood isn't fancy, but was convenient to everything. Loved the Arboretum and Eagle Point Park and having dinner on the patio of the marina above the Mississippi, watching herons and pelicans. We'd also recommend the winery in LeClaire not far away, and Crumpets in Fulton just across the river is a super lunch spot."

Having two floors was nice for anyone to sleep a little later without being disturbed by guests/noise downstairs. The kitchen is stocked with dishes, pans, cutlery, casserole dishes ... enough to make preparing meals at home easy. Beds are very comfortable: sheets are soft, pillows have various degrees of firmness so you can change around, and there are ample throw blankets. Our kids enjoyed watching a movie in the game room; the chairs made it feel like their own movie theater. The LR is very comfortable. We loved the location: two blocks to a HyVee & Walgreens, a block to a playground, a block to a park, and about a block 1/2 to The Discovery Place, an excellent play/creativity center for kids. The WIFI is strong. Dan was immediately responsive by message and quickly came over to look a minor issue with the microwave; he was also super during booking - always helpful and quick."

2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"What a wonderful place to stay! This house is beautiful and really thoughtfully furnished and maintained. The high ceilings are quite grand, but it does mean that anyone sleeping there will need to navigate the gorgeous, but tall, staircase to the second floor. Since there is a full bathroom on both floors, that was not an obstacle for the less mobile members of our family who were joining us to eat, play games and hang out. There are only a few stairs to the front and back entrances. All of us enjoyed the comfort of the kitchen, dining room, living room and sitting room on the first (ground) floor, and appreciated the artwork, which made us feel at home and part of the community. Really delighted by the bulging folder with local information and ideas for entertainments and excursions! Our stay was already busy (Mom's 90th Birthday!!), but we are hoping to return again soon to enjoy ""our Clinton home""."

It could definitely use a deep cleaning."
2023-10-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,"This was a fine house to stay in. Location was very interesting, nicely decorated and very responsive owners. The house was not well laid out and was clumsy to live in - walking through one bedroom to get to another was more of a drawback than I imagined. The kitchen had bare bones dishes for 4 of us and the light in the kitchen did not work correctly (it was a fluorescent light that flashed constantly). We just left it off but made for a dark kitchen. Also, the smoke detector seems to go off every time we turned on the oven due to the heat that came out when you opened the oven door. Overall a fine stay with cool things to do in Clinton and Fulton. Great memories! LOVED the record player and porch."

2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"The view of the Mississippi River alone is enough to merit a 5-star review. Maybe even 6 stars! The cottage is simple and sweet, The farm surroundings are soothing, nights are quiet, and the neighbors are nice.
Take advantage of the terrific outdoor patio for an afternoon barbeque. It's the best seat in the house. And peruse Quinn's collection of vintage music to play on the gorgeous record player to set a great mood.
Nearby Fulton, ""downtown"" Albany and Morrison have everything you'd need to shop for plus decent restaurants. And be sure to visit the antiques store in Albany, especially if you're in the market for a great clock.
Quinn was quick to respond to any questions. We'd book this spot again anytime!"

The space was amazing, more than enough room for my family indoor and outdoor. The most accommodating place I stayed with my husband and kids while traveling To my hometown. Many trendy details I also loved. Will make this our go to destination now!"
2024-04-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,There are 2 flights of stairs to this unit. The first is 2 banks of 12 stairs and the next is 16 steep steps. I'm in good shape but it was a big workout. The floors in this unit are soft and feel like they will fall through and they squeak very bad. The beds are poor quality and super uncomfortable. The thermostat can't be set below 74 and it's a 3rd floor unit so beware in the warm months. The price was low and check in was easy but overall we wouldn't stay again.
2024-04-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"The place was nice. The only issues i had were that the bed was a bit too stiff for me. The other is that i am 6'6"" and the shower head is way to low for me. The rest of the accommodations were very good."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,Great place. Worked perfectly with my schedule. In town for work and it fit my needs.
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The space was exactly the home I needed while in town to honor my wife‚Äôs memory with her family. The healing process was made very very with Lou‚Äôs beautiful home. Thank you so very much!

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Lou's place was extremely comfortable, quiet and very cost effective for my needs. Lou was very helpful during check in and pleasant to speak with.
I really appreciated the motif of the apartment. Being so close to the river, had a nautical theme and was very well done. Grocery store near by so you can stock up for your stay.
During my stay, there was a weekly event on the street where the road is closed down to allow a small car show, live band and food trucks to set up. Lots of local folks setting up chairs and enjoying the evening... Super fun!
Should I find myself in the area again I would definitely stay at Lou's."
2023-07-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Nice place .. stairs definitely a work out but great place..
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Lou‚Äôs place is close to the river and bike path for an early morning walk. It had all of the amenities I needed. It is an older building so expect the uniqueness of creaking floors. I was on the third floor but the stairs are wide and have hand rails. I would stay here again.
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Lou was very helpful! I was visiting for a festival that was in walking distance from the place. Lou met me in person to ensure I was able to get in alright and was very accommodating! There was lots to explore downtown and I had some wonderful food.

2022-08-01,4.0,Stayed over a week,"Lou was very easy to work with and provided a place for our company interns to stay for the summer when there truly were no rental options available. She was very easy to communicate with. Although I did not stay at the apartment, I booked the reservation on behalf of our company, and Lou included me in texts to the interns for any concerns. The value of the listing was very good. And the location is outstanding -- right downtown and a block from the Mississippi!"
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"Nice little apartment, several good places to eat‚Ä¶the Mexican food place across the street was really good. Had to give a shout out to them. Good communication with host. Place was just as described. Parking was good with cameras watching the cars which I really like. It was mostly cold while we were there but there is a nice bike/walk path along the river close as well. Would definitely stay again if I was in the area."
2021-12-01,4.0,Stayed over a week,"Lou was so great. She is very accommodating and her responses are very prompt. The only downside I had was the multiple flights of stairs. I would have liked to know about that before I booked at this location. Other than that, it was a wonderful experience."
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Stay here! Lou is very accomodating and the place is at the center of things going on in Clinton. I love the fact it's an older building and the setup is perfect for a single person or group. Comfortable stay.
2021-01-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,I would stay at Lou's again!
2020-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Lou and Mike are awesome hosts! The apartment is located on the 3 rd floor of a century old building, up 2 flights of stairs, with 2 bedrooms, 1 bath, living room and a kitchen! One of the bedrooms has no windows, but we got used to it. There are many places to walk along the nearby Mississippi River, or drive to other little towns that are nearby, lots of historic landmarks, small shops and many consignment stores, including one on the first floor of the building, Deja Vu Furniture, which is owned by the owners. Lots to do in the rest of the City, a few good restaurants, and the usual stores in town. Overall, we had a great experience at this Air BnB! Would probably stay here again!"
2020-11-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"Definitely a great place to stay,clean,and great location!"
2020-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Lou‚Äôs place is a cozy place in a great location to be close to the river and old town Clinton. The communication and ease of access to the apartment made this weekend getaway low stress!

2020-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This is a great spot in Clinton! It‚Äôs very close to the river and other restaurants and shops are within walking distance. The apartment itself is very nice despite being in an older building which could use some new decoration. The apartment is near some train tracks which was a bit of a shock one night but they provided ear buds which worked great.
2020-09-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Great place ! Will definitely stay again!
2020-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Enjoyed a long weekend in the Clinton area. Pop's place was perfect for checking out the area.

2020-06-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is the perfect place to stay if you‚Äôre looking for an affordable place for a get away. The only thing I wasn‚Äôt a fan of was that the AC was not allowed to be below 74 degrees. Overall, a nice stay, great recommendations, kind people."

2020-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Lou's place was fantastic - very clean, well located, and with a very easy check-in process. The pots/pans were a little limited for cooking, but we nonetheless were able to prepare some wonderful meals in the kitchen. One thing to note is that one of the bedrooms doesn't have windows. This was fine for us because it made for a quiet/dark place to sleep, but just something to note. Overall a great stay, and we'd definitely come back if we ever find ourselves in Clinton again."

2019-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Lou and Michael proved genial hosts, and were quick to respond to my queries. The spaces they offer are old but clean, welcoming and well-furnished with eclectic pieces, perhaps a reflection of their second-hand store below the apartments. Makeup removal wipes, earplugs (I never needed them), closet space, hot water and thick, fluffy towels were plentiful."
2019-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great place. Easy and comfy. Not much around for nightlife, but easy access to town and central."

Cannot recommend booking through Mike & Colleen enough!"

From the kitchen and living room, to the comfy adjustable bed and walk-in shower. It was an absolute pleasure to stay here. NO complaints! (check out Isle of Rhodes for pizza... a block away, Original Taco... 50ft. away, and Forest Inn... 7 min. away if your hungry) üëç"

2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I chose this place because the location is close to my older brother and sister who live in Morrison. I would have been happy with a small room with a corner kitchenette, about what I would expect in most places for the price.
Instead I found myself in a beautiful full loft home. It was open, light, and welcoming. I used the full sized oven to prepare my part of Thanksgiving dinner. The kitchen was well equipped, the living room comfortable and spacious, and the bedroom quiet. I will stay there again and again."

2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I stumbled upon this listing when the Airbnb I typically book was reserved, and I am glad I did - I can not say enough great things about Mike's place! I think it will be my go-to from here on out. They have really taken the time to think of every single detail - the comfort, design, and all amenities that someone could ever need. The photos do not really do it justice just how cool the layout of this space is. It is exceptionally clean and organized and feels very private despite being centrally located. I have already recommended it to others and will definitely be back. Thanks again for a great experience!"
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This space is amazing and suited our needs quite well. Mike was very responsive and answered questions very quickly. Will stay again!
,,,Host is sneaky and not communicative about rules. Host gave me 2 hours notice to get out after my CC temp issued fraud alert after I was there and renewing every two weeks with no prior conflict.
