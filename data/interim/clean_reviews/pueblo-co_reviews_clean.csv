2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Maria and Steve were amazing. The place was perfect. a few hiccups with the heat yhe first night. They had just installed a new furnace. I woke up the 5 space heaters while the tech worked on it. the space heaters were perfect. It made me a big hit amongst my freemason brothers and even the Grand Master stooped by for some pool. They have 2 other units nearby, and if they will have us, we will rent them all when we are back in August. It's worth every penny."
2022-10-01,5.0,Group trip,"After traveling 18+ hours from Kentucky and Michigan to get here for my uncle’s 85th surprise birthday party, it was a relief to get to Maria’s property. The house was very spacious and clean! Maria called after we arrived to make sure we were okay and again upon our exit to see how our stay was and wish us safe travels. There were plenty of the essentials (ie…rags, towels, linen, cooking utensils, tv’s in every room, etc). The listing does nothing for the property as there is so much more! The location was great (less than 10 minutes from the mall, grocery store, gas station, and plenty of food places). There was plenty of space for everyone to have their own privacy and also to gather when necessary. I would definitely stay here again the next time I travel to Colorado. Thanks again Maria for making our trip go so smooth!"

2024-06-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"The main level of the home was very nice with plush carpet. The listing did not indicate that the third bedroom is in the basement, although it is a legal bedroom.

The first and only thing Hannah had to say to us was that she is allergic to the smell of smoke and make my wife take her only jacket off and seal it in a plastic trash bag.

The kitchen was very functional. My wife would like me to note that the only thing missing in the bathroom was an outlet, but the hair curler was happy enough in the nearby kitchen. :)
It was VERY quiet overnight, and the blackout curtains in the bedroom were fantastic. We were running behind after a long day adventuring with friends in the foothills so we really didn't find time/have energy for dinner. Michael's little stash of ramen noodles paired with an egg and a slice of toast made for a just right snack before retiring for the day."

The neighborhood was quiet and the house was very clean and well maintained. Michael has taken every step to make sure you feel at home when you are here. The kitchen is set up and ready to go and we enjoyed making breakfast and dinner during our stay. From the coffee set up to the restroom all ready with soap and shampoo, everything you may need or forgotten at home is here for you. The shower has great pressure and the bed had the perfect firmness to keep me asleep all night. I even had to call and he responded immediately, courteously, and solved my self caused tv issue like the patient professional he is. I can't wait to come back and stay soon... I only wish I had brought him a gift to show how pleased we were with our stay. Next time!"

Really made the BnB feel like home. Originally we planned on doing a lot of sightseeing outside of Pueblo, but due to gas prices, we stayed closer to home.

2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I should state up-front that Michael and I have known each other for several years. As my realtor, Michael recently concluded the sale of my property, a process that I could not have done without his professional dedication, wisdom and expertise. While I only spent two days in his AirBnB unit, it is evident that he brings these same characteristics to the construction and maintenance of his roomy and cleverly designed duplex apartment. In doing so, Michael has anticipated every need of his tenants, from the super comfortable bed, to a kitchen containing everything one might possibly use for cooking including lots of pots and pans, utensils, and an array of herbs and spices. The many food gifts were a very welcome touch as well. Moreover, the whole place is kept immaculately clean. Seis estrellas por 'La Casa de Contentamiento'!"
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Our stay here was so nice. Everything was clean, access to washer and dryer downstairs (always nice with a toddler), and location was next to everything.

Angelos Pizza is unreal as well if you need a good 10,000 calorie meal."
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Michael provides many “special touches” that enhance the experience of staying at his property. Extremely clean, fresh-smelling towels and bedding, organic personal and cleaning products, warm, fuzzy blankets on the couch, and so much more. Thank you, Michael 😊"

This home is modest on the outside but inside it has been completely refurbished. Comfortable couch, easy to navigate tv remotes and movie channels. Bath is brand new and sparkling!
Michael provided us with a dozen eggs, a loaf of wheat bread and butter. Had two breakfasts that probably saved us $60.
Plenty of coffee too.

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Christy is amazing, she’s very helpful. Super clean house! We will stay again!"
2024-05-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Nice updated home with enough space for a small family. Peaceful and quiet. It was perfect for our needs. A few things would have improved the stay. Ex: there's a coffee maker but no coffee in the house. Would have been nice to have access to a usable yard but it's a very affordable price point so I think the savings overrule some more premium touches. Overall very clean and nice and Christy was responsive, friendly, and helpful. I would stay again if in the area. Beautiful views outside too."
2024-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Nice, quiet stay for an overnight work trip. A few hiccups but Christy was very responsive and resolved everything. Would stay again when I’m in town next."

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The Cozy Casa is our favorite place to stay! We’ve returned numerous times and will continue to book with Heather & Benji on future stays. Convenient, easy, clean, comfortable and ‘right at home.’ It really does have everything we ever need for our stays. Heather is ALWAYS responsive, friendly and helpful. The only thing I would say about the location is for those who are easily annoyed by traffic sounds, it may not be as enjoyable as it is in a busier section - but, truly not too bad. We LOVE the Cozy Casa!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Heather’s place was just as described. Great private backyard and off street parking. It is within walking distance of everything downtown. It was clean and comfortable.

My Dad was a patient at Parkview and uncertainty of the dates and length of stay, Heather was accommodating to our needs. She even cheer us on and had so much compassion.

2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Heather was an amazing host! Thank you so much for having me and for being so flexible with the time and dates requested! Will definitely be booking again!
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Heather was a quick and thorough communicator. The house is well located to access the Parkview medical facilities.
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,This place is one of the coolest places I have stayed in ..
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The Cozy Pueblo Casa is the perfect place if you are staying in Pueblo, CO. 2 private bedrooms, large kitchen and dining room, washer & dryer, large family room with couch and comfy chairs, and clean newly tiled bathroom. All new appliances throughout. Bricked patio in the back with a grill. Awesome local suggestions. I was with my sister & mom in town to see my nephew play a Colorado State Pueblo football game and this was the perfect spot for a great family weekend. We definitely would book again.
-Matt"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This home is amazing. I could truly see myself living there, and may even steal some design ideas for my home. All that we wanted to do- River walk, Zoo, and Chile Festival was no more than 2 miles away and easy to navigate. Our only issue was coming from a secluded mountain stay to a big city. There was typical city noises like traffic and occasional sirens."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Being Located right next to the highway was ideal. Cute backyard area. The house was near restaurants, a park and a hospital. I would definitely book again."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is the second air bnb of Heather’s that we stayed in on this trip, and we were never disappointed. The Cozy Casa was the perfect spot to come back to after long days of traveling to the surrounding areas. Everything was so clean and easy to use! We can’t wait to come back, this place felt like home ❤️
Also TOTALLY take the recommendations that are left on the board! Love Mug might be the best coffee shop I have ever been to!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I highly recommend Heather’s place in Pueblo. The pictures don’t do justice to space. Very well appointed, squeaky clean, quite neighborhood, within walking distance to the Riverwalk.
Heather has equipped the house with all you might need to prep a meal, the beds are comfy and the living room is inviting, with cute decorations. The backyard patio is beautiful and inviting too."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great little house in Pueblo. Private, clean and very cool A/C! Very close to nice park."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Heathers home was just as shown in the pictures and was the perfect place for me and my friends to stay. Heather was an extremely helpful host and gave us local recommendations for food, attractions, and other local activities. Super convenient entry as she has the code to the door set specifically for you. Definitely will need to stay again!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Loved our stay here! The house is very clean and cute and just like the pictures inside. There were lots of little touches around the house that made it seem very well managed and made the stay more enjoyable. Each room even has a fan, suitcase stand, and humidifier in the closet. Kitchen was fully stocked with everything we needed including coffee maker and grounds.
One thing to note is the front of the house is right on a busy street. The location is a few blocks away from downtown and felt a little run down. However, there is a great driveway next to the house that fits 2 cars, where you can also privately enter the back gate and enter the house from the back door. This felt very safe and was great for unloading! The backyard is also super private with tall fences and has a patio set and a grill.
The hosts were also very responsive throughout and made it a great experience!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This is a fabulous place to stay in Pueblo! Located close to the Riverwalk and Parkview Medical Center. Very clean with comfortable beds, laundry facilities, and a dishwasher. Had everything we could have possibly needed. The backyard and patio were well kept and private. Off street parking was a must for us with a newborn baby."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great experience staying at Heather’s cozy casa! We felt very much at home. Everything was so clean and neat. The beds were amazingly comfortable. It’s a cute home away from home! Will definitely come back in the future!
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My second stay at Heather's was just as great as my first stay there.
The house is really clean and comfortable with everything that I needed for my stay in Pueblo. I was so impressed with how kept up and immaculate the house is.
Heather is always very responsive and accommodating."

2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,I cannot say enough about my experience! It was cut short but Heather was super flexible and even more responsive and helpful. I will be making a return trip to cozy casa….top notch!!
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Cozy Casa was as described and convenient location to activities. Everything within Heather's control was a 5 star. We didn't around neighborhood.
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This home was phenomenal! So clean, so fresh. and so accommodating. The small touches like the fav breakfast places on the chalkboard were the icing on the cake. Yes, there is traffic noise, but that really is at the cast majority of the nice homes in the downtown area. We have stayed at numerous homes in Pueblo over the last few months and this one ranks up at the very top! Host was extremely helpful and communicative. Thanks for a true home away from home!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had such an amazing time! The space was beautiful, clean, great location, and had everything you may need. 10/10 would definitely stay again!!!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Another wonderful stay! This is our ‘go to’ place when coming back to CO to visit family. Great accommodations - cute, cozy, clean. Has everything needed. Location is easy and convenient. Though, this time much more than last, we noticed the many emergency vehicles passing by on their way to the nearby hospital in the middle of the night. Wonderful coffee shop, Black Box, 600 feet walking from the house - highly recommend. Hosts are wonderful! Always very responsive, friendly and helpful. I feel ‘at home’ when we stay. We’ll be back again."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Place was very well put together and peaceful even in Pueblo!
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Heather's place was exactly like the pictures. I have been to airbnbs around the world and there's a specific reason individuals earn super host status. I was able to utilize the home as if I was home. She went above and beyond with her welcome book, and she checked on us throughout the stay. I wouldn't hesitate to stay again."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We loved the Cozy Casa! It was perfect for our visit to family in Pueblo. Walking distance to cafes and downtown, but also an easy few minutes drive to the heart of downtown if you don't feel like walking.
The house is a cute older house, but has been renovated with modern conveniences, and was spotlessly clean. The kitchen had everything we needed, and there is a fenced backyard with grill (a bit too chilly when we were there, but maybe next time). There is some street noise, but we didn't find it was an issue. Loved the basket of little toys and books when our grandson came over for a visit.
Host Heather was great, and sent us all the info we needed. We'll definitely be back!"
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,What a fun little casa.
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a great stay at Heather's place! The kitchen is nice and worked well for us. Comfortable living room and off-street driveway parking were welcome. It's a very short drive to downtown/river walk. It seemed just out of walking range at a bit over a mile but might have done that in warmer weather.
Note that the street can be noisy but the bedrooms are at the back of the house so it wasn't an issue for sleeping.
I wouldn't hesitate to stay here again!"
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great place to stay close to everything. The house was on point , just as described. Excellent place to stay. Awesome communication."
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,This was my second time at cozy casa. Really one of the more solid options in the area.

2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,What a lovely place to stay! Ample space to spread out and even cook a large meal if needed. Being able to do a load of laundry at the end of a long trip was perfect. Heather was very communicative and helpful!
2023-01-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,"Inside of the house had a very cool ambiance. The cactus 🌵 theme was prominent. Host is a great communicator and plenty of information made available about the sites of Pueblo.
Unfortunately, house was on a very busy street. We woke up to emergency vehicles during the night and the traffic first thing in the morning. The windows let in a great amount of light but easy for passersby to see inside. So, blinds mainly kept closed.
Most of the house seemed clean except for bathroom and kitchen stove. I could barely see my reflection in the mirror due to the build up of toothpaste remnants. The toilet bowl needed a cleaning… won’t say more! And towels were left behind the bathroom door. Supplies were available to clean with after the last tenant. But I was left with that “yucky” feeling of not knowing if the sheets were changed… I let Heather know and she was apologetic and explained it was the hired help. It was an okay stay."
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Gorgeous house. Decorated beautifully. Felt right at home as soon as we got there. We loved the bedrooms - the beds were super comfortable and the rooms were very colorful and nice. The bathroom is so cute especially the sink. Heather is very friendly and attentive and she responds very fast when any questions arise. This has been the BEST place I have ever stayed in while visiting Pueblo. We hope to be able to stay here again in the future. We absolutely loved our stay and felt safe in the area we were in. This house is definitely worth checking out if you are staying in Pueblo.
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We visited family in Pueblo over Christmas weekend and it was the perfect location and accommodation for us. Heather’s house is clean, comfortable (the beds are super cozy! Nice mattresses and linens so they felt like hotel beds - even better!) and close to downtown and the highway. Heather was responsive to a couple of questions we had, which we were extra appreciative of over the holiday. We would definitely stay again when in town!"

2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Our Pueblo Casita was perfecto! First, the house is super impressive. There was great care out into every inch of this house. Not only does it have everything you’re looking for (new appliances, streaming services, strong Wi-Fi, cozy backyard with a grill, and super comfy beds), it has a ton of craftsman cottage charm. The street and neighbors were quiet and we felt totally safe and secure in the neighborhood. Thanks again, Michelle for your prompt communication and superb accommodations."

2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"WOW, just like if I lived there. I'm so glad I opted for this house rather than a hotel! In town for a conference with 80 year old folks joining me. I was just looking for someplace decent and I really lucked out. It was better than a hotel and unbelievably CLEAN. 4 minutes from the conference center and every night of my 3 nights I was able to return to this cute little house and relax. Don't get a hotel. Stay here!"

Excellent Airbnb experience! 5 stars!"
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We had a wonderful stay! The house was centrally located and was as described. It was very clean and the hostess was quick to respond to all of our questions. I would definitely recommend and we will most certainly be back for another visit.

Beautiful home, lots of natural light, convenient location, clean, organized, comfortable beds, everything in kitchen looked new. Listing is completely accurate but pictures don't do it justice. The best AirBNB in my experience. Host communicated throughout the trip. She does her best to provide you the best experience and it shows. Can't recommend it enough!"

The little things (chalk board with places to see and eat, wifi password handy, thermostat instructions, map with pins of the places people came from, etc.) were just the tip of the iceberg! Fully stocked and a ton of awesome extra touches; I can’t say enough nice things about Heather and the house!!! You won’t be sorry staying here! :-)"
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,My son and I had a great 2 night stay. The casa is right in the center of town making everything pretty close!

2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"Beautiful recently renovated space, centrally located, and with all the amenities one could need."
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This house had everything we needed for parents and a toddler. They had lots of extra personal touches like a safety gate, assorted essential oils with a diffuser, teas, etc. Very comfortable, clean, and offered everything we could need for a few nights plus a small backyard and patio. The hosts were very attentive to our needs and went the extra mile. The location itself wasn't necessarily the greatest and there was some traffic noise etc, but at the same time it wasn't a big problem. This may have been the best AirBnB I've personally been to. Thanks for a great stay!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"very nice place, very clean and quite.
great communication would stay here again without question."

Fire pit was nice
Clean"

2024-04-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"Clean, quiet - appreciated the hot tub - would have liked better communication and guidance about adjusting the heat in the private space."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Highly recommend! Ellyn is super communicative. She has outdoors… spa, 2 fire pits, grill, outdoor games, lights, bikes better than we can hope for.. inside a big tv, kitchen, games, lots of linens and comfortable beds. It was perfect. We stayed here instead of camping due to the weather and for me it was perfect! Great rate and a great time!! I highly recommend and we would come back!
Thank you for being an amazing host!"
2024-03-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"This stay was stunning. Ellyn was so lovely and accommodating. The fireplace is something we don’t have in Texas, so that was a wonderful addition. We did have a couple of issues with cleanliness and temperature, but they were minor and cleaning supplies are kept under the sink, so we just took care of it. There was also an old Alabama record with a confederate flag that was questionable, and the “library” is 95% biblical literature. There were also quite a few religious quotes and paraphernalia that I wish I would have been aware of prior to choosing this stay. It would benefit any host to stay politically and theologically neutral and ambiguous as to not make guests uncomfortable. The robes kept in the bedroom are so soft and perfect for throwing over a swimsuit to get the hot tub ready. There is no smoking marijuana allowed on property, so we had to leave anytime we wanted to indulge, and the driveway wasn’t the easiest to get in and out of. A nice experience, but some issues."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Very nice place, had lost to games and beautiful view. thank you so much for hosting!"
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Ellyn’s place is great for a stay in Pueblo. The space was very clean, has everything you need and a hot tub is always a bonus. She was very communicative and I would recommend her place to anyone!"

2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,An amazing oasis away from home. Everything about this was amazing from the host hospitality to the above and beyond amenities she provided wow!! Definitely a must stay
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The views from the hot tub make up absolutely any other possible criticisms. They hot tub is one of the hottest, most private given the shared setup, and most accessible I've had on Airbnb (often they're set low or in a windy spot or there's certain times you can use it, etc) and the views from the tub are simply incredible -- I cannot recommend enough a soak in the sunrise if you find the bed too hard for your liking, or even if you don't. This is a very private mother-in-law basement, although you can hear above a little. They offered a fan and a space heater in the bed room and the rest of the place was well-equipped as well. I really enjoyed our stay here and would recommend it to others."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This place was a perfect spot to stay for the night

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I loved this walk-out basement setup: comfy, spacious, and clean, with west-facing windows that let you see the Rockies. Huge TV. I biked several miles to Lake Pueblo and took the paved trail all the way to downtown Pueblo. Tranquil exurban neighborhood, a couple of miles from restaurants, etc. Ellyn was very responsive & helpful. Private hot tub with a view was a special evening treat! Would stay again in a heartbeat."

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"very comfortable, clean. would stay again."
2023-07-01,4.0,Stayed one night,hot tub and main bed were great. The host was proactive about letting us know about a hail caused delay and apologized for not having pull out sofa fixed up. sofa was comfortable enough without the pull out part (which we couldn't open ourselves) but wished we'd had it available. couches were soft and TV was huge! do note the shower stall is small enough that you can't bend down to get to feet without opening the door if you are tall lol! kitchen stuff as described.

It’s a short drive to restaurants and grocery store; nothing within walking distance. We highly recommend staying here!"
2023-06-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,it's a little ought to find fairly and comfortable
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Really enjoyed our relaxing stay at Ellyn’s home! Loved the location, private entrance, and anoutdoor space with a beautiful view.

A big Texas thank you, Ellyn!!"

2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,A perfect location for us to visit family nearby. Ellyn was great in meeting our needs and very responsive.

Really just little things and we will be back to stay when we're in town to visit family!!

Thank you Ellyn! ✨🙏🏽"
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,I couldn't be happier with the place and owner. A wonderful balance of 'out of the way' but still close and accessible from Royal Gorge to Colorado Springs. We only used half the amenities in this very well equipped basement apartment as we were out doing things. I would love to come back and chill on the back patio some more.
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Ellyn is very accommodating and goes above and beyond to make sure you have a great stay.
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My fiance and I had a lovely time at Ellyn's place! It's clean and comfortable and had everything we needed. The neighborhood is very quiet and removed, so you may need to plan to drive into town for restaurants or entertainment (no big deal, only about a 15min drive from Pueblo proper). The hot tub was a great touch- Simple to use and had great views.
Ellyn was able to accommodate us on very short notice so we are very thankful for that. Would definitely recommend staying here!"

2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This Airbnb is hands down one of the best we've ever stayed in. The space is enormous for the cost and everything is very cozy and convenient. In particular, the kitchenette and washer and dryer were very convenient after a few weeks on the road for us. We also LOVED the hot tub - can't even begin to describe how great that felt after weeks on the road to just relax and let everything melt away in the water. The neighborhood was also very quiet, new, and safe. Ellyn was very responsive in answering the few questions we had while we stayed.
We'd happily stay here again if we're ever back in the area and would highly recommend anyone staying in the area to do the same!"
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Very happy to have spent the week here. Everything we needed was available, including the hot tub and beautiful views of the mountains. This is a no-brainer for a visit to the Pueblo area."

Definitely recommend!"
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Ellen’s space was the perfect oasis between 12 hour days of driving. The hot tub was perfect, and the Mountain Views from the hot tub and patio were astounding. We soaked both morning and evening during our stay. We loved all the thoughtful touches and provisions throughout our stay. I found either couch to be comfortable both for lounging or sleeping, and my girlfriend said the bed was really comfortable."
2022-03-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"Clean and comfortable with very easy access from the interstate. The outdoor area with the hot tub and fire pit is wonderful with a gorgeous view of the mountains. It's close to grocery stores, a Walgreens, a high end liquor store, and a dispensary. The neighborhood is quiet."
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"A great place to stay, ample room, well stocked... Comfortable. and relaxing. I was there only briefly but she made sure whatever I needed was available. She communicates well and therefore there were no surprises. I especially liked the tie into Pueblo's history and the western world. Tastefully thought out. A great place to relax while exploring the area. I can recommend this to both families and explorers."
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Ellyn was great at communicating the process and made the check-in easy. The house was perfect for us. Would highly recommend!

2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This place was very nice and we really enjoyed our stay. Beautiful inside and out! It had a fire pit, grill, hot tub, lights, and more! Ellyn was gracious enough to ensure the hot tub was warmed up before our check in time. 10/10 would recommend. Thanks again!"

We will definitely stay here again and recommend this place to anyone coming to Pueblo
We only had to communicate with the owners one time and our question was answered immediately
If this location is available stop searching now and book your reservation you won’t be sorry"

2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"You'll thank yourself for booking this, so if it's available, book it! Private and secluded enough to be quiet it's still just a short trip to anything you need in Pueblo West or Pueblo. The Lake Pueblo State park is around the corner and the Royal Gorge is a short ride down the road, as well. Not that you'll want to leave much. The suite is beautiful and large, yet cozy and comfy. With thoughtful and tasteful décor in a functional and large space, you'll feel like you're at your own mountain cabin. A microwave, toaster oven, fridge/freezer, and full complement of dinnerware are some of the little details that make it easy to just stay in and relax, if that's what you want. Luckily, the hot tub is right outside your private entrance. That makes it an easy trip from the private, outdoor tub to one of the two leather sofas inside in front of the large screen LED TV. If you do want to explore, you can easily get to Co Springs, Trinidad, the Royal Gorge, or Canon City. If you want a longer day-trip, check out the Great Sand Dunes or the South Park Brewery. We absolutely loved our stay and we'll be back."

2021-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Perfect place! Was very clean and spacious! I really wish I got the chance to use to hot tub but I was too tired from a long day of fishing. Great location as it is close to Lake Pueblo. I highly recommend it!
2021-04-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"Overall we had a nice stay at the place: it was clean, stylish, and it had everything you need. The only downside was the noise from upstairs in the middle of the night. We woke up twice due to the noise. Otherwise, pleasant experience!"

2021-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"R-E-S-P-C-T find out what it means to me, and to me it means the thoughtful touches that made my stay at Ellyn's home a lovely one.
She provided everything that we needed to make our one night stay in Pueblo perfect. Chief among them, an immaculately maintained hot tub that we needed to recover after a long weekend of high-altitude training in nearby Great Sand Dunes National Park.
Her and her husband's comfortable and budget-friendly private suite in their quiet neighborhood was the perfect base camp for this group of outdoor enthusiasts re-acclimating to life ""on-the-grid"""
2021-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Perfect and safe which was just what we needed for a quick trip!
2021-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Ellyn’s home is beautiful and she offers so much to her guests! It’s also a great location! I would definitely stay there again!

Ellyn was also a great host — responsive, accommodating, and super friendly during check-in!"
2021-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"A wonderful escape at Ellyns oasis. The view from the patio and even dining room table were a thankful change for a night. She was very responsive, had information at the ready, and many amenities to make us feel spoiled!"
2021-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is my second stay at Ellyn’s place. Very comfortable, large and clean space with everything we needed. It was cold and snowy and it was wonderful to have a warm and inviting place to relax at after spending time in the area. I would highly recommend. Ellyn is very responsive and the area is beautiful."
2021-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very nice stay. Hot tub is great!

2021-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Absolutely gorgeous place and Ellyn thought of everything to make our stay extra special.
2021-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"It was a well-equipped roomy, relaxing, well-decorated and comfortable 1-floor suite and we wish we could have stayed longer to enjoy the grill / large hot tub / outdoor gears / board games / exercise machines / library made available by Ellyn and her husband.
There was a minor issue with the Roku but it was fixed within a few minutes with her help so don’t worry if you just feel like a couch potato at the end of the day!
She had some useful activity suggestions for the area and since her place is close to the Pueblo Reservoir, I recommend enjoying at least catching a great sunset view from Liberty Point Memorial."
2021-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Would recommend, great experience."
2020-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This is a great airbnb basement apartment with walk out to a peaceful patio looking toward the mountains. We greatly enjoyed relaxing in the hot tub!

2020-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Awesome spot to relax! Loved the privacy and how clean everything was left for us. The hot tub was the best part! Definetly recommend this place to anyone.
2020-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We loved staying at Ellyn's place. We decided to cook breakfast in the morning, and were surprised that she had a hot plate, pans, and everything we needed, all in the basement. The hot tub was very nice too. We both said we felt like we were staying in a fun aunt's basement for the night. <3 Thank you for your accommodations, Ellyn!!"
2020-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Ellyn’s place is amazing. Warm and spacious with beautiful view of the mountains. I arrived early and Ellyn was very accommodating. Perfect place to relax while enjoying Pueblo and Pueblo West. I will definitely come back.
2020-11-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"My husband and I were in town to see the Royal Gorge and this was the perfect location right outside of Canon City. The space was large and accurate to the listing and photos, the kitchenette and coffee/snacks provided was a nice special touch that we really enjoyed. The hot tub is right outside the front door which may have been my favorite part! We didn't venture out much for food as the city had shut down due to COVID-19, but if you have the chance try Donut Oven -- awesome breakfast and super sweet staff. Note that this stay is in the lower level of a house (as we knew) so you are able to hear things upstairs such as TV, water, and people walking. I'm a light sleeper so it may not be an issue for others. Overall, great place and Ellyn was very accommodating and quick to respond with any questions we had throughout our stay."
2020-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We only stayed one night while we were driving through Colorado on our way to Montana, but we were so amazed at the thought put into Ellyn’s home! It had everything you could ask for. We are sad we only stayed one night and hope to be back soon!"
2020-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great place to stay in Pueblo West! Ellyn is a wonderful host. Comfy beds and nice space. The hot tub, twinkly lights, nice lawn & great mountain/ sunset views are a huge plus!"

2020-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Ellyn’s home was exactly what we needed- a quiet neighborhood close to Lake Pueblo just to relax and get away. The space is cozy and clean with warm and inviting decor. Relaxing in the hot tub with a view of the mountains during the day and millions of bright stars at night was a great bonus! Ellyn was easy to communicate with and promptly responded to the couple of questions we had. She graciously allowed us to leave our canoe on the property so we didn’t have to tow it around town. The snacks and coffee selection were also a nice touch. Our one regret is that we couldn’t stay longer!

2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Ellyn's suite was clean, spacious, private, and comfortable, with a lovely view onto her well kept back yard. I watched two birds frolic in a fountain on the back patio while eating breakfast. Loved it. :) I like staying on the edge of cities rather than in the thick of things, and her space suited me well in that way."
2020-08-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Comfortable stay! We loved sitting out on the back patio, watching the sunset and taking in the mountain view! Very relaxing listening to the rustling of the Aspen tree with the breeze and listening to the water trickle of the fountain. The hot tub was relaxing also. On a cooler night, the gas fire pit is nice."

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We were in town for my brothers funeral and needed a place close to family. The location was great for us and the use of two ovens was what really sold us. Especially since I was in charge of preparations for the reception following my brother’s memorial service. The pics don’t do it justice, it’s so much cuter in person. With a patio out back and a cute porch up front we loved enjoying the weather in the morning and evenings. Even met a friendly neighbor. The house is older as is everything in Pueblo but it was well maintained and very quaint. Only had to contact the host for check in instructions but otherwise we were good to go. Location is close to the freeway access which was convenient since we had to be everywhere. Every place including hotels have little things that you dislike but this stay was nothing too major. We would definitely stay again and are grateful to have found this place when we needed it."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The house was great. Beds were comfortable. Back deck was nice to sit and relax on in the evening.

It is also unique with its Coca Cola theme and there are plenty of things to do in the area. Btw, when Steve makes a restaurant suggestion, you should listen. He knows what he’s talking about. Overall, I highly recommend and will stay again if I’m in the area."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"The house was comfortable from the bedrooms to the outside. The pillows and mattress were very enjoyable. The outside was calming, small, but well manicured. There was plenty of hot water and water pressure was great. Thanks for the wonderful stay😀."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Steve’s place was great! It was very spacious especially the basement. Steve was very responsive to any questions we had about the place & was very proactive when we needed something.
2023-05-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Everything was great, very clean. Kitchen was well stocked with almost everything you might need for cooking meals at home, except the ingredients of course. The only thing missing were 2 dining chairs. The place is listed to fit 6 people but there were only 4 dining chairs, I’m sure that if we had been 6 guests Steve would have brought us 2 more chairs."
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Steve was a great host! Home was comfortable and clean. Neighborhood was quiet. Even though we did not have kiddos I found it extremely kind and homey that there was a pack-n-play, high chair, and quite a few board games in the house. Thanks Steve!"
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Coming to Pueblo? Definitely stay here!! Steve(The owner) is a phenomenal SUPER host, the epitome of kind, responsive, and committed to making your stay one to remember. We found ourselves in a family emergency and Steve went above and beyond to make sure our family was comfortable and had a place to stay. When it came to extending as needed he was extremely flexible and super responsive (immediate call/text)
The house is lovely, very comforting and feels like home. Not only was it clean, it smelled good, it also has EVERYTHING you might need in your home away from home. From Kitchen Utensils, to board games and everything in between. The house is centrally located with easy access to the highway (I-25) It is in a quite neighborhood, within a 5 min drive from Supermarkets/Restaurants and a min from the nearest hospital. It's also walkable to the nearby lake Minnequa, which offers a nice 2,5mile loop for a nice walk/run.
Stay Here!

Steve was very detail-oriented and make it a point to provide baby items and a pack and play/high chair for our one year old! There were also toys and plenty for the kids to do. The home was well cleaned, well stocked with linens and towels, fast WiFi, and the basement was a nice place to hang out after the kids went to bed. The neighborhood was quiet and peaceful as well.

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Cecily's was peaceful, good vibes and very comfortable. I've lived in Pueblo, so I can tell you, the water pressure was great for downtown Pueblo! I enjoyed taking showers here. For a historical building the house was pretty quite. The neighbor is actually pretty quiet at night, and I hardly ever heard any sirens that normally go on in town. This area was perfectly located. I highly recommend staying here!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Cecily was a great host always responded within minutes of my messages. Super cute little pad definitely has a quirky, funky, vintage vibe, which I love.
I could FEEL the history in that building…. once upon a time, long ago a handsome, hard-working steel worker and he’s cute young bride probably lived there. I could picture her with her hair curled in a polka dot apron, making a simple dinner for him when he came home from working at the steel mill. 🥰 very charming little spot & Cecily did a great job, decorating it in a way that keeps that cool retro vintage feel.
Lots of great sunlight, felt private even though it’s right in town.. having coffee on the back deck was lovely. If I come to Pueblo again, I will definitely book here!"

2023-09-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Upon arriving the place was spotless. Everything seemed to be in order. the A/C is the only thing i felt was under powered as i perspired thru the night even though i had the A/C thermostat turned way down to 68. It only cooled the bedroom so the rest of the place was warm. The bed was comfortable. I ended up only sleeping there as most of my time was spent with family. Very nice hosts.

2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"219 1/2 A worked out great for us. It is as advertised, very quaint with an older feel. Definitely a bit of nostalgia for me. Location was good, not great. Only say that because, like many parts of Pueblo there are some unsavory people wandering around. But other than that it was a relatively short walk to the Riverwalk. There are a few small stores, shops, and eateries nearby.
Cecily was a great host. Very responsive and friendly. Thank you.

2022-05-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,"We appreciated the clean space and cute decor- check in was easy, and the location is close to downtown.
We used this as a resting place between Denver and the Sand Dunes.
We had challenges sleeping as the neighbors are separated by a door right next to the bedroom and the sounds from them and from the AC unit kept us up all night.
If you’re a heavy sleeper and not bothered by noise, this would be an okay stop for you."

2022-04-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"Cecily had great follow up and communication. I noticed a problem and she attempted to fix it immediately. I did think the price was a little high for the size of the apartment as it was a kitchen and bedroom, no living room. But location was good and bed was comfortable."
2022-04-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Door was a little stuck upon check in but we got it. Also there is only one unit in the whole building so pray they don't have the heat on because the window AC only does so much! Other than that, no complaints."

There is a quaint coffee shop within walking distance! We slept in the front bedroom, and the bed and sheets were very comfortable. We were grateful to stay somewhere with laundry machine! He supplied laundry detergent which was great! The space is very tastefully decorated, and the house was very tidy & clutter free. The AC unit worked well. Staying in Pueblo during a Colorado trip gave us pretty easy access to Canon City (Royal Gorge Park), Great Sand Dunes National Park (2 hour drive), and Denver. Check-in was super easy."

2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great place to explore Pueblo from. Very historic neighborhood and nice historic home. The only thing I would point out is that there is only one small tv in a bedroom, none in living area. Also, the kitchen is minimally stocked (no condiments, spices, etc - so pack in what you need if you want to cook). Parking is adequate on the street because it is a very wide street, so there is no worry about cars trying to squeeze through near your car! The bathroom is adequate with a really nice shower, but again, be sure to pack in what you will need. The soap, shampoo, towels are provided, but it’s limited. There are no “extras” like cotton swabs or lotion etc. Overall, it was a nice place to stay and walkable to coffee shops and bike rental if you want to explore the river trail. For some reason, at the time of my stay, the few nice hotels in Pueblo were running very high in price, so this home was priced well due to that."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Wonderful host. Very nice place and surroundings. A+++++ place to stay. Definitely on our list to come back to.
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"I really enjoyed my stay with my family. Loved of kid friendly the home was: we spent a good amount of time in the backyard playing. Beds were clean and there was 1 soft, 1 firm, and a comfy futon - so something for everyone. It was easy to cook, eat, and relax in this home. We were also really close to our family we were visiting and about 15 minutes from the big shopping mall."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Michael’s place was just as in the photos. It was very clean and comfortable (one bed is very firm just as he states in the listing). The area is very nice with beautiful historic homes very close by, but the main road at the corner does have quite a bit of traffic for a residential area. Everything was just as he described except there is no central AC. There is one mini-split, which does a great job, but you have to leave the bedroom doors open if you want those rooms to be cool. Michael was attentive and responded very quickly to our concerns."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Quaint and comfortable home in a beautiful, historic neighborhood. Location very convenient and lovely. Host was incredibly responsive and friendly."

2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great place, clean and cozy. The kitchen was stocked with essentials, which was really appreciated."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"An appealing place in a nice neighborhood; big trees, unique home architecture, and mature. And it was close to Riverwalk, the cultural hub of Pueblo. I really appreciated the interior finish (textured paint, etc.) complimenting the arched doorways and windows. The refinished bathroom was top-shelf. They don't make 'em like they used to and these folks brought out this classic brick home's best!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We had a major plumbing problem at my house so this was a last minute decision and Michael was very helpful and responsive. We were close to home in a wonderful environment.
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Michael was pro-active during our entire stay. He made sure we had what we needed and was always quick to respond to an inquiry. He lives next door and was friendly and helpful ... even offering us 2 bicycles. We would stay in this location again should we return to Puebo.
2023-01-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Loved the charm of this older home! Like many older homes this one has a Jeffrey Dahmer basement where the washer and dryer are set up. (We made it out alive.) The host was super friendly and helpful. Keep in mind there’s only one TV located in the bedroom. The newly renovated bathroom could use a full set of towels. Space out your showers, if you like them hot."
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Charming bungalow in Pueblo's historic Mesa Junction district. Tastefully restored, with well-equipped kitchen and updated bath. Parking is on-street: however, I had no concerns as the street is broad, well-lit and in a good neighborhood. Cleaning and service fees were higher than I've typically encountered, but overall I felt it was a good value. Michael was a gracious and responsive host."
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"What a beautiful home to bring in the New Year. Michaels listing is nestled in a beautifully historic district in Pueblo, located extremely close to the river walk and in walking distance to many restaurants and shops. We were 2 miles from a dog park next to the Pueblo zoo. The area can’t be beat. The house itself has great character and charm, along with some modern amenities Michael added. The back yard was more than sufficient for my two dogs to play catch, and the bed was absolutely comfortable. Michael was a great host, gave us plenty of privacy and puts great effort into the property and everything in it. Would love to stay again if ever in the area."

2021-11-01,3.0,Stayed about a week,No cleaning was done not sure why they charge you for this when they don't use the money for this. The sheets had blonde hair and dog hair everywhere. Not vacuumed either.
