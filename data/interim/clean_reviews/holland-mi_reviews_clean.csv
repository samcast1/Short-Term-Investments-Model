2024-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Although our stay was short, we truly enjoyed our time at Lynelle’s place.
The house is very cozy and clean. The location is great and we were able to visit all our destinations easily. She’s walking distance to a beautiful restaurant and park by Lake Macatawa. We enjoyed a great view of a parade and fireworks from the end of the driveway during tulip time festival.
She has lots of recommendations in her binder and was very proactive and friendly."

Highly recommend!!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Lynelle put a ton of effort to make this house feel like home. I have stayed at a ton of airbnb locations over the years and you can tell when a host really thinks through how to make a home comfortable and easy to follow instructions. I loved that she put notes in almost every room with information or instructions. It was nice to find sharp knives in the utensil drawer since we bring our groceries with us when we travel. The beds were comfortable which makes a huge difference when traveling. You can practically walk to the downtown area with lots of small business shops so that was fun! It was also beautiful because the tulips were blooming everywhere! I would absolutely stay here again!
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,House was clean and comfortable. Near the water. In a calmer part of town.
2024-04-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Great proximity to the waterfront and downtown and extremely clean. Lynelle was very welcoming as well! We enjoyed the nice touches such as a welcome message board and local snacks. Might have been the time of year, but the view out front was mostly of some very high gravel piles across the street. The traffic on the road might be an issue for light sleepers."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Shipwright’s Cottage was a wonderful relaxing home away from home. Despite the inclement weather, we walked to downtown and restaurants. Lynelle’s communication was top-notched and the home was furnished with everything we needed and then some. We will be back!"

2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"From start to finish Lynelle was extremely helpful and responsive to everything we needed. We were in town for a swim meet at the aquatic center, and this home was just the peace and quiet we needed away from the noise. Lynelle made sure she went above and beyond to make sure we were satisfied with our stay including a flexible check out. I wish I would have found her place years ago when we traveled for meets :-)!"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Lynelle was always responsive with questions I had. Everything was so nice. The upstairs bed is so incredibly comfortable. We hope to come back again!
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"5+ star rating⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️!!
Lynelle has being an Airbnb host nailed! The home was SPOTLESS and it had EVERYTHING we needed during our stay. The home was the perfect size, water pressure was strong, the location was great and the beds were very comfortable. I even was able to enjoy the outside space for my morning coffee at 30 degrees🥶. Lynelle goes way out of her way to make your stay perfect. The almond windmill cookies and local olive oil she left for us was great! Such a nice little touch 😊 We will definitely stay here again when we visit Holland in the future!"

The beds and pillows were very good, with plenty of good blankets.
Appliances were all relatively new and in very good working condition.

Only con is the noise across the street with bulldozer transporting rock material starting very early in the morning. I know Lynelle has no ability to control this, but i do think a sound machine is helpful to pack along for blocking the noise for light sleepers."
2021-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This adorable house is located in the perfect location - a short walk downtown, to Lake Macatawa, and to several fun parks. If you have young children, a complimentary pack-n-play, booster seat, toys, books, and games await your arrival, which our small family greatly appreciated. Our host courteously met us upon arrival and provided a rundown on all of the popular shops and restaurants. Holland State Park is only a short drive away and has the best sunrise and sunsets.

If you're planning on mostly eating out, there is no need to bring anything other than your favorite beverage or snacks; basic condiments, coffee add-ins, etc. have been graciously provided. The house was clean, well-decorated, and comfortable - beds, towels, and sitting room furniture were all well done. I will be coming back and staying here; I look forward to showing and sharing the cottage with my wife at the next opportunity..."
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is such a lovely place to stay. First of all, it is immaculate! From the moment we stepped in the door, it's obvious Lynelle has taken every effort to make it clean and comfortable. Furnishings and kitchen/bathroom supplies are MORE than expected, the beds are soooo comfortable, and Lynelle is awesome at responding. We LOVE the location - handy to downtown, to Kollen Park, to the bike trails, and nearly everything we needed. Loved having a washer/drier available and bikes (in a storage shed) available. This has become our favorite ""home away from home"" when we're in Holland!"
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was the perfect place. Lots of space and a very comfortable stay. The location was perfect! Walking distance into town, a short drive to the beach… we will definitely keep it in mind for our future stays in Holland."
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Lynelle is the best! She made everything so easy. We stayed the night before our wedding and the night of our wedding. It was magical.

And they have the most comfortable beds that I’ve ever slept on. 10/10"

2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"A perfect Airbnb for the Holland area! Short walk into busy downtown, quiet at night. Comfy bed, not too soft. Lovely back yard. Very clean! Lynelle went above and beyond as a host."

I highly recommend staying!"
2021-08-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"This little place was a great spot for our anniversary getaway. Everything was super clean, well-thought out, great location — just a short walk from downtown, Kollen park, and Boatwerks. The aesthetic of this little place was just beautiful. The bed upstairs was very comfortable. My only suggestion is to bring ear plugs or a noisemaker to help blockout the trucks, bulldozers, and small train across the street. It wasn’t bothersome during the day, but it did wake us up earlier than we would have preferred. However, everything else was so perfect that it wasn’t a dealbreaker! Lynelle is super communicative and thinks of everything to make the stay wonderful! All-in-all it was a wonderful stay and we will be back!"
2021-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Beautiful, clean, comfortable cottage that was well-stocked with essentials to make our stay easy. The host responded to messages promptly and contacted us upon arrival to make sure we were settled and knew the ropes. We will definitely stay here again in the future!"

2021-07-01,5,Stayed about a week,"This is such a gem!! Lynelle is a fabulous host and the Shipwright's Cottage is a WONDERFUL place to stay. It was immaculate (it smelled so clean when we walked in) and Lynelle has provided everything you could possibly need or want! The space is generous, the appliances are all full size and new, and the beds are soooo comfortable. We loved being able to store our bikes in the little shed, we took advantage of the patio and enjoyed morning coffee there, and then relaxed in the comfortable big chairs in the living room in the evening. Loved Lynelle's visit to get acquainted on our first day! We LOVED being so close to bike trails and downtown, the not-to-be-missed Farmer's Market (Wednesdays and Saturdays) is just a couple blocks away, Kollen Park is just around the corner, Boatwerks Restaurant is across the street. Honestly, this is the best place ever!!"
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great location.
Very clean."
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Hands down the cleanest and nicest home we have ever rented. We have stayed at numerous rentals over the years. When I say clean, I mean not one spec of dust, the place looked brand new. Every single item in the house was 5 stars; the linens, the appliances, the beds, the décor, literally EVERYTHING. The place is spotless and beautiful. HIGHLY recommend!"

2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We had an amazing stay at Lynelle’s Holland rental. The location was perfect - we walked to downtown each day we were there and also enjoyed walking along the lakeside park.

Thank you - we would love to stay again!

The location is right across from a great park and a short walk from all of the shops and restaurants downtown."

2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We stayed at Lynelle's place in early June. The location can't be beat -- we walked to downtown, the Farmer's Market, and Kollen Park nearly every day of our stay. We had our 10 month old with us and really appreciated how baby proofed the space was. The kitchen was well-stocked with cookware, pots and pans, and utensils, and Lynelle even had some spices, cooking oil, and coffee which is always a very nice touch. My husband and I did have a little trouble with how warm the upstairs room was at night, even with the AC working hard downstairs. We had a little thermometer we brought from home which showed the upstairs as 8 degrees warmer than the downstairs. Lynelle did provide fans which helped a little. Of course it was June in Michigan with the weather in the upper 80s when we were there, so this likely won't be a problem for everyone. Overall we loved our stay and would definitely return."

Good location as we were close to everything we wanted to see & explore. A plus during our stay was the Holland's Farmer's Market - one of the best we've been to. We would definitely stay here again."
2023-09-01,5,Group trip,Harriet’s house was very comfortable and homey. Bike path was right at end of the street. Easy access. Beach was only 4 miles away. Fun area to visit. She had a binder of recommendations for food and attractions. We felt at home in the nice quiet neighborhood.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,Our stay was great…enjoyed the outside deck and grill. Would stay here again if we’re in the area!
2023-09-01,5,Group trip,"Harriet's place was great, and we would definitely stay there again if back in Holland. It was very spacious, we were there two nights and had 7 women. The listing says max 6, but that was due to our own comfort. One bed was huge and easily fit two women, the other two beds also fit two women comfortably. There was plenty of space for an air mattress. Both bathrooms were very nice. And, while a small thing, this house had the nicest and most plentiful toilet paper I've ever seen at an AirB&B. No joke."

2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,Very comfortable home.
2023-07-01,5,Group trip,"Loved the location of this house! It sits in a quiet development with little traffic. You get a small view of the lake from the deck but you can see it. It's ideally located halfway between downtown Holland and the Holland State Park beach - each is about 6 minutes away.
The house was perfect for 3 couples. It has two bedrooms downstairs that share a bathroom and one upstairs with a second bath. We didn't do a lot of cooking with all of the great restaurants nearby but the kitchen and dining areas were fine. We did enjoy the deck. It was a great place for a morning cup of coffee. The furniture was comfortable and with the addition of a dining room chair, there was enough seating for all of us.
I would definitely recommend this place to anyone visiting the Holland area!"
2023-06-01,5,Group trip,One of the cleanest places I've ever stayed--and my wife and I are clean freaks.

2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Loved the location. Quiet neighborhood, close to the beach and a fun hiking area only one-half mile away (Stu Visser trails). Comfortable furniture and beds! Secure fenced backyard that the children enjoyed and has a backyard fire ring that was perfect for roasting marshmallows in the evening. Only disappointment was that it was minimally stocked (soap, trash bags, towels, etc). Other than that it was a great place to stay and we hope be back next year."

2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"It was an extremely relaxing location. Between the birds chattering and the serene view of the lake, we felt at peace. It would have been wonderful to walk around the neighborhood but ran out of time. The interior design was extremely pleasing. After the fact, discovered it would be easier to manage luggage for the lower bedrooms via the side walk and through the lower patio door. Had a wonderful vacation and a good piece of it was due to being able to comfortable socialize with girlfriends in this home."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We loved the house with a nice view of the lake and enjoyed the fire pit. It was beautifully furnished, comfortable atmosphere, and close to many attractions.

2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"A private, beautiful place to get away from it all! They offered amenities like OJ, a s’mores kit, bath robes and toothbrushes - meaning we didn’t have to worry about a singe thing. It was a cozy place to stay on several cold and rainy autumn nights. The colors were gorgeous and there were plenty of blankets. The hot tub was frequented every day, and was perfect even in the rain! We absolutely loved snuggling up in the screened in patio, a fire at our feet and a movie playing on the TV. If you’re city folk like us - don’t worry about the outdoor shower, the water never ran cold and it was more than private. It was peaceful and comfortable to shower even well into a dark evening. I echo my husbands words as we packed up - “This is the first Airbnb that I’m not ready to leave!”"

It is definitely a place I want to stay at again and well worth the price!"

2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"If you like hot-tubbing in the woods you will love this airbnb! My daughter and I seek out unique places to stay on our annual mother daughter trip and this hit the mark A++ We loved the outdoor glamping experience so much! Everything from the airconditioned bedroom with comfy bed to the perfectly relaxing hot tub to the campfire with provided smores was perfect. The cozy screened-in porch provided more space since the bedroom area is quite small. I can't say enough about being able to chill in the hot tub with the campfire blazing a few feet away. We used it at night and in the morning both days. The outhouse wasn't the greatest though it is cute but the outdoor shower was adorable and it was super awesome to be able to shower in nature! It felt private, the water pressure was just right we loved that little area. The pond fountain was cool and necessary to turn on to drown out the highway noise. It's a perfect setting, close to everything. Did I mention the hot tub is amazing? :)"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,really clean and fun! private and quiet! loved it.

2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,I couldn’t have asked for a cooler first air bnb experience. gorgeous location and great recommendations :)
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"This was one of the best stays we have had using Airbnb. It was exactly as described and pictured. It was less than 10 minutes to get to all the shopping and restaurants in Saugatuck. 3 miles from Saugatuck Dunes State Park. The cabin was very private and secluded. Rhonda thought of everything to make you feel at home… there were a few drinks in the refrigerator, snacks, s’mores, towels, and robes and toothbrushes, body wash and shampoo/conditioner all provided. Hot tub was amazing and so clean. The bed was very comfortable.
We have Verizon cell service and did not have service most of the time when at the cabin and the signal wasn’t picking up the house WiFi (which isn’t anyone’s fault). Just an FYI for people who depend on it.
Will definitely stay here again when in the area!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We LOVED our stay here, we were sad to leave but we are definitely looking forward to coming back. The privacy, being surrounded by nature the Jacuzzi, the little boat on the pond. The thoughtfulness that went into all the little things that were provided for us like make up remover wipes and beach towels, beverages in the mini fridge was all really appreciated. The host was really friendly and quick to respond. The place was really clean and we felt comfortable. when we arrived there was a little binder on the bed that we recommend you read as soon as you get there because you will answer all of your questions you may have. Thanks Rhonda ! :-) 💖"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was the perfect spot for a weekend getaway in southwest Michigan! It’s close to both Holland and Saugatuck. The house was clean, comfortable and cozy! The outhouse was well maintained and the hot tub area was perfect.
We will be back!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"The purpose of my stay was to step into the solitude so I could do some reflecting and goal setting. Perfect location for that - I sat and watched the fish jump, read by the gas fire, sat in the hot tub, explored Holland, and slept like a baby! I am eager to return next month with my daughter before she leaves for her second year of college. It will be our little retreat! Everything is taken care of - the attention to detail is amazing, and as a woman traveling solo, I appreciated the peace of mind that I wasn’t alone."

We would love to be back again :)"

2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I cannot recommend staying here enough, it’s absolutely magical!

2022-10-01,5,Stayed one night,Great unique place to stay! Can’t wait to come back!
2022-10-01,4,Stayed one night,"Hot tub was very foamy and sandy on the bottom, and the outhouse was full of spiders/quite smelly (as are most), but the owner was made aware of the sand issue, etc before we left and she was very polite and helpful! One suggestion we gave would be to maybe have a microwave or small grill near the fire pit to make meals or Maybe install a working restroom? Not a huge deal breaker for us though!
Otherwise, it was so beautiful and so relaxing! The little cabin was incredibly cozy, it was an amazing getaway! We plan to come stay again in the future!"

The bed is INCREDIBLE, hot tub serene, outdoor shower is magical, fire pit was lovely, screened-in porch is a dream.

I really couldn't have asked for more from a peaceful retreat at the end of a long road trip! Want to return and will be sending all my friends."

It was such a wonderful stay and felt very private even though we were on Rhonda & Don's property, it felt like we had plenty of privacy once we crossed the bridge to the tiny house! Rhonda thought of every little detail, we had snacks, drinks, wine, DVDs, games, robes, logs and newspaper to start a fire, bug spray and even a smores kit! It was in a great location close to Saugatuck & Holland. We really enjoyed exploring both towns but really loved being able to really RELAX when we made it back to the AirBnB to get away from it all after the stressful wedding planning process! The hot tub was just perfect for 2 people and smores really hit the spot. We can't wait to come back!"

You won’t regret booking a stay at Rhonda’s."
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place has to be one of the cutest little Airbnb’s I’ve ever stayed at! Nice and secluded, but very close to downtown Saugatuck and Holland. The hot tub was an amazing way to relax. I highly recommend staying here if you’re in the area."
2022-09-01,5,Stayed one night,Wonderful spot - hope to be back!

2022-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"One of the best airbnbs I've stayed in! This was a one night stop on a road trip leaving a camping trip, so it was really a relief to have a lovely clean spot to stay in. Really appreciated having things like multiple clean towels, shower shoes, robes, etc. The outdoor shower and hot tub were amazing. You really do have total privacy, and Rhonda is communicative and attentive to any needs."
2022-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"What a little slice of heaven. Rhonda is wonderful, helpful, and full of hospitality. Don’t miss a stay in the little cabins behind her house. You park at the garage and walk behind it, there’s a mini bridge that takes you to your habitation. The bed is the comfiest ever, the hot tub beautiful and clean, the outdoor shower feels like a long sigh after a hard days work. In short, it’s a perfect simple getaway near beautiful Lake Michigan and Holland"

The accommodations are well designed and beautifully crafted. The private hot tub and outdoor shower invite you to get naked without inhibition. Highly recommended!!"
2022-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"This place is such a lovely escape from reality. I booked Rhonda’s place as a birthday surprise for my boyfriend and he loved it. The private hot tub with towels included, the outside shower with towels and soaps, the fire pit with plenty of wood plus a s’mores kit, and such a comfortable bed! There are also tvs with plenty of channels as well as many dvds. I highly recommend this stay."
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Best nature stay you will ever find. If you've never showered outside before there will be new adventures for you! The house was so cute and decorated very nicely. She provided some snacks for the stay along with a few drinks! That won me over in itself. The outside covered patio was great for coffee in the morning or movies at night. The bed was very comfy! Take time to enjoy nature and the privacy you get here. Don't let the houe in the front bother you because once you cross the bridge you feel like you are completely alone on a small resort. Truly best vacation we have had!

2022-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"The photos don't do it justice.
It's unbelievable. The bed was so comfortable. No detail was left behind. They even had smores for us to make.
Close to restaurants and attractions.
The hot tub was a great end to the night.
We took the peddle boat for a spin in the am.
We can't wait to return.
Thank you Rhonda & Don"

Best place ever!"
2022-07-01,4,Stayed one night,"There's a lot to really like about their place: very clean & well decorated bedroom & three season room; and we loved having a hot tub and gas fireplace! They have a lot of thoughtful things too, like a loft for 1-2 kids, snacks and a s'more kit for the additional outdoor fire pit. Nice setting, and actually no mosquitoes despite being surrounded by trees! If you don't mind the outdoor shower & outhouse it's a great stay! Thanks Rhonda for the nice place and service!"

Despite road construction going on, the home was set back far enough that it was still very quiet. John and Ami were great hosts and checked in regular to make sure everything was going well and so that we were aware of any construction that would effect our ability to exit the property. We would definitely consider this space for a future visit!"

Would highly recommend this listing!"
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What a great little place to stay! This place is so cozy and comfortable that you’ll enjoy coming back to it after a day out sightseeing. The hosts have thought of everything from snacks and drinks to bathroom toiletries if you’ve forgotten anything when packing. Even though we didn’t do much food preparation we noticed how well stocked the kitchen was with equipment. As noted by others and also the host, they are working on major reconstruction of the street so you will have to drive through part of it to get to the apartment but John let’s you know how to best approach his place in the easiest way. As an added token of that inconvenience he even provided a free car wash. This place is a great find so don’t hesitate to book it."
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"John & Ami's place was adorable, clean, and only a few minute drive from downtown Holland. It was perfect for a weekend get away.

We definitely enjoyed the cozy and inviting feel of the cottage. John and Ami put in the time and effort to offer up thoughtful recommendations and the notes and directions as far as their expectations for checking out were very much appreciated!

John and Ami have thought of everything to make a stay comfortable and easy - down to an available tube of toothpaste, shower gel and shampoo; fruit, water and beverages in the 'fridge, and snacks in the cupboard. They have an amazing gift of knowing when to be available and neighborly and when to offer privacy. Being in a neighborhood was lovely! It's quiet and great for taking walks - and yet commercial areas are just a quick drive away. We loved being able to put our bikes in the little sunroom to keep them safe and out of the weather. And seeing the wild turkeys feeding in the neighbor's yard next door one morning was fun!! The space is small - but sparkling clean and the bed was very comfortable!! It made our stay in Holland a real treat!"

2019-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My husband and I stayed 2 nights at this cute and comfortable, easy to find place during the Tulip Time festival for our anniversary. The rental was just right as far as space for 2 and being positioned relatively close to festivities.
As a designer of sorts, I appreciated the simple, stylish decor provided. There was also functional furnishings like front entrance hooks for coats, purses and keys and a multilevel coffee table in the living room for our phones, tablets, tea and snacks. In the bedroom, inviting pillows dressed the bed, small lamp lighting gave the space moodiness and floating shelves optimized the space well.
We also personally utilized the comfy couch one night to watch some shows, stove and fridge for heating up water and storing a few picnic items as well as the bathroom shower in the morning. Water was hot, towels were fresh and fluffy.
John and Ami were flexible and stayed in good communication leading up to and through our visit. Would recommend to others :)"
2019-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My husband and I stayed in this beautiful cottage during the Tulip Time festival. This is a PERFECT location, just a quick 7 minute drive to downtown.

Awesome place that is incredibly clean and quiet. 10/10 would stay again without hesitation."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Came to the area for Tulip Festival. Before arriving, Todd and Mary sent a heads up on what to expect in town which was appreciated.

The accommodations very clean, comfortable and inviting with much attention given to the amenities. They knew our visit this time was focused on helping our granddaughter load up belongings for summer and return with her to our home after our overnight visit. Todd and Mary were available if we needed anything but let us come and go quickly without any interruptions. With the start of the Tulip Festival beginning the day we left, we really appreciated their accommodating our need for that one weeknight night."
2024-05-01,4,Stayed one night,Everything that we read in reviews were accurate. The only problem we had is that it was a lower unit in the home and we could hear all the walking around in the evening and in the morning.

There were quite a few brochures about things to see and places to eat in the area. There were pictures of the family and evidence of family interests. There was workout equipment available.

The place is exactly as pictured in the listing, with helpful instructions on how to use all of the equipment and appliances. The weather was a bit cold, windy, and dreary - perfect for curling up on the couch by the fireplace and reading a book from their extensive reading collection and watching some good ol' Monty Python videos (Don't worry if British humor isn't your thing - they have a large and varied collection of other movies and TV shows on DVD and VHS). The hosts were friendly and responsive to communication. I would recommend Todd and Mary's place to anyone visiting the area."

Since it was our first time in Holland, we really appreciated that. The apartment has all of the amenities they listed, but once you see the place, it’s even better than expected. It was very clean, the shower is larger than what you’d expect, and the little extras were plentiful, down to the chocolates on the nightstand. (And thank you for the water bottles in the fridge!). If you come to Holland with a full itinerary, you’ll love coming back each night to a welcoming home. If you’re just escaping the daily grind, there are plenty of movies and books to sit and chill with. Todd and Mary have taken all the precautions for this COVID era, and we felt very safe in our stay. If you’re still thinking about whether or not to stay, take my advice and go visit Todd and Mary’s place. You will not be disappointed."
2020-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Todd and Mary’s place was great! They had excellent safety precautions for Covid and everything was super clean.

2020-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Todd and Mary were delightful hosts. They communicated well in advance and were super responsive - and their space was comfortable and felt like home. They even left us a tray of chocolate chip zucchini bread to welcome us!
I especially liked their extensive book collection and their VHS/DVD collection. For an 80’s kid like me, it brought back a wave of nostalgia having to rewind to be kind. Would highly recommend this place to others looking to visit Holland!"

A basket with fruit and homemade zucchini bread,(delicious!) chocolates on the bedroom side tables, coffee available to be made in the morning, information with local restaurants and entertainment ideas, etc. Todd provided my husband I with a map and detailed directions to Ottawa Beach. I met Mary in the morning who asked right away if we enjoyed our stay. Mary and Todd were both so friendly. You can tell how much they enjoy being able to share their home.

As this is my first time using Airbnb, she’s over exceeded my assumption on what booking an Airbnb was going to be like.

2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Kathy is friendly and accommodating. She had snacks and breakfast goodies and cookies in the room. It was comfy and we felt like we were at home instead of in a lonely hotel. The gardens in back are exquisite, so be sure to plan time to relax outside. It was a lovely neighborhood.

2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My husband and I came for a slightly delayed mini-moon a month after our wedding as we both love Holland. We felt right at home and felt we had ample privacy in the basement suite. The entire family was so kind and personable; 2/3 left for the week shortly after we arrived and we wish we could have visited with them more because they were so hospitable. There were snacks, a fridge and sink in the basement space as well as coffee and needed table wear. Very clean. The neighborhood was very peaceful, but did require a short drive to downtown. Thank you Kathy and co for a great visit!"

2023-05-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Jim, Kathy and Jodi are wonderful people, and hosts. They are very warm and welcoming - a delight! The entire lower level is very clean and more than adequate to stay comfortably for several days. They also added several nice personal touches - my favorites were that they provided coffee and Windmill Cookies!!
Only 4 stars since adding some sort of soundproofing, and maybe a foam topper to the air mattress would make the stay 5+ stars across the board...felt it was a great value, and a great stay!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,"From the moment we walked into the door, it felt like we were at “grandmas house.” We were greeted warmly by Kathy and introduced to her husband and daughter. She helped us carry luggage downstairs and showed us around. She had pulled out a pack ‘n play for our 18mo old and even showed us some toys both our young kids could play with. The kitchenette had cereal, yogurt, milk, juice, cookies, and and kind of dishes we needed. I wish we had a longer “weekend” we could stay with them. There’s really nothing about our stay I didn’t like."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We were very lucky to find Kathy’s place on our trip to the Tulip Festival in Holland. Kathy and her family were amazing and so kind. We sat with all of them in their lovely backyard one evening. The place was clean and provided everything you’d need and hope for when you’re away. There were so many nice personal touches she did for us. We had 2 jars of cookies, milk, orange juice, yogurts, coffee, tea, sugar, a variety of cereals and the best homemade granola you will ever taste. Our stay was amazing and we would highly recommend Kathy’s Airbnb. You won’t fine nicer people in a very safe neighbourhood."

2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Thank you for hosting our family. We had a second great stay. Kathy, Jim, Jodi are friendly and kind. We appreciated the cookies, yogurt, water, juice. It was a bitterly cold weekend in Holland. The basement apartment was warm and cozy. We will be back. Please see our previous review for more details on the unit."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We were greeted at the door upon arrival with such friendly faces. Everyone was so kind asked how our drive was etc. Upon going downstairs to the basement we noticed it was beyond cleaned. Kathy makes the best homemade cookies. She also provided us with Milk, Juice and Yogurt in the fridge. Cereal was provided along with dishes etc. Shower water was always hot even after all my kids showered. The main bedroom bed was firm but not to firm. Slept great. All around a great stay..Plan on using Kathys place again when we come back up this summer. I would completely five over 5 stars if I could!"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The most gracious and friendly hosts I’ve ever had on Airbnb. Kathy and her husband Jim were extremely welcoming and friendly. The space is spotless and I felt right at home.
They left us so many snacks, cereal, and juices. 10/10 would highly recommend."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"Kathy and Jim’s place was perfect for our extra guests to stay at! Convenient for us and our family, clean, comfortable and easy communication and check in!

The space was as described and it was clean. They went the extramile by providing some simple breakfast items, including milk, juice and cereal. There were also TWO cookie jars! YUMMY! The location was perfect for me, very close to where I was visiting family. A very nice part of Holland on a quiet tree-lined street."
2022-12-01,5,Stayed one night,Comfy Cozy Peaceful...PERFECT for my need
2022-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"Lovely, lovely, lovely, lovely!
Such a bright, clean, and well appointed space…. So many thoughtful details, even homemade cookies!
I have never dared to book a basement space… but I completely forgot it was a basement space as it feels like a homey but complete hotel studio space. Of course, there is some noise from upstairs, but the bedroom is very quiet.
The hosts keep the house and space cozy, but space heaters are available and the shower is warm and great… man a warm shower that has great water pressure cannot be undervalued!!
Proximity to Lake Michigan, the beaches, the dunes, the lighthouses, SNOW, rivers, trails, and even Chicago is brilliant… soo many things to do in every direction. I was able to join an exhilarating winter hike on the beach, just 15 minutes or so away.
Such a lovely host couple who warmly communicated throughout my stay!
Thank you, and look forward to next visit!!"
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was a quick stay in Holland, but I truly enjoyed the comfort of the area. Kathy was so friendly after my long drive and in the crazy weather. It was nice to get warm and cozy. The location was close to my event and to downtown, I was able to find things to do. Kathy's homemade granola and chocolate chip cookies were amazing.
I was concerned about not having a private entrance, but this was easy, and I appreciated the hospitality and friendliness of Kathy her family. I hope to visit again."

2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Kathy's place in Holland is a perfect example of why we prefer airbnb to hotels. It's a beautiful house in a very nice neighborhood - great for walks and a short drive to restaurants and other businesses.
The lodging is a very spacious basement suite - one of us could be working in the living room without disturbing the other in the bedroom. There is not a private entrance, but Jim and Kathy and Jodi are happy to deal with who you are (sociable or not :-)).
We were very impressed with their generosity - we arrived to homemade cookies, milk and juice, bottled water, and a selection of cereals. Holland's water is also perfectly good for drinking.
We'd definitely want to stay at Kathy's place again!"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed one night,We loved our stay with Kathy and her husband. They were gracious hosts and their accommodations are as spacious and clean as the pictures show.

2022-09-01,5,Stayed one night,Kathy’s place was great! Very easy to get to and very welcoming. A few of us booked it as a place to get a good nights sleep before running a half marathon the next morning. We arrived about 1030pm and were welcomed by Jodi. Everything was set up for us downstairs and we all felt very well rested the following morning. I highly recommend Kathy’s place for a stay in Holland.

2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Kathy, Jim, and Jodi are wonderful hosts. They will greet you as you arrive and show you around. If you need anything, they will do what they can to get it for you. They stock the refrigerator with yogurt, milk, and oj. There’s also homemade cookies and granola. We spent a lot of time enjoying their garden and just visiting with them. At the end, we felt like we had been friends for years.
The basement is perfectly appointed with comfy furniture, a kitchenette, and a nice size bedroom. I highly recommend this Airbnb!!!"

2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,A fantastic stay at a beautiful property. So much more than we expected in this basement level living area. Clean and bright with wonderful amenities. Definitely worth the short drive to the city. 5 Stars!
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I loved my stay at Kathy’s place. She and her husband Jim and daughter Jody made me feel like a million bucks! I had as much privacy as I wanted and if I felt like doing something more social with the three of them we did. They truly made me feel like family and I am grateful. The backyard is a show piece and your accommodations are an entire spacious lower level with everything you need. There is plenty of parking in front of the house and the neighborhood is beautifully manicured and very quiet. It is a short drive to Saugutuck or downtown Holland. I loved it! You will too. Thank you again, Kathy, Jody, and Jim."
2022-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Kathy and Jim are gracious hosts, the suite is cozy and homey, and it was comfortable even during August. Their garden is lovely and Kathy provided so many sweet touches like homemade cookies, Legos to entertain my little guy, and breakfast essentials. We would absolutely stay here again!"
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,My first ever AirBnB experience. Previous reviews say it better than me. 5 star.
2022-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"What a treasure! I harness AirBnB regularly but it’s less often that I will opt for a “private room” and only do so after reading the reviews. I’m so glad I stayed at Kathy’s! While I was only booked for one night, Kathy and her family made sure that I had everything that I needed (and more!) and honored my scheduling/communication needs. She generously left me cookies, milk, OJ, and a selection of yogurts. This listing is for a basement apartment which includes a living room with a couch, coffee and end tables, three arm chairs, a work desk, and a small dining table with two chairs. There is a kitchenette with a nice sink, small countertop fridge and microwave. The bathroom has a sink, toilet, corner shower (hot water!) and ample places to hang wet towels. The bedroom has a queen bed with a metal coil mattress, and extra pillows in the closet where there is also a fan and space heater if needed. There was also a window in the bedroom, and a light on each side of the bed with a small place to set something. Entrance to this unit is from inside their home, either front door or from inside the garage. This is unit is in a partially finished basement with doors to a finished storage area, and keep in mind that West Michigan is humid as it’s close to those gorgeous white sandy beaches! During the day I could hear piano lessons etc, but it was very quiet at night, other than the crickets singing outside. Be sure to plan some time to relax and enjoy their green thumbs because what a garden they have made! I look forward to sitting and enjoying the garden, which backs up to the tree line, the next time I come. Thanks Kathy!"
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"A lovely option for a stay in West Michigan -- a respite from the crowds, and a peaceful haven with a beautiful garden and walkway through a small woods in the backyard. The lower level was good for sleeping, impeccably clean and orderly with all kinds of personal touches to make it feel like home. Best of all was the kindness, graciousness and compassion of the three hosts: Kathy, Jim and Jodi."
2022-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"This is a gem! Wonderfully private oasis in a beautiful home with the most beautiful, welcoming garden. I was just passing through town for one night but wished I could have stayed longer!"

2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Kathy, Jim, and Jodi are lovely hosts. Kathy was prompt with communication, flexible, and friendly. The unit was close to everything downtown Holland has to offer. We especially enjoyed the farmers market and Bowerman's Cafe on 8th. We were in town for a three-day event in Holland. Kathy gave us a quick tour upon arrival and then gave our family privacy to unpack. The basement unit was clean and generous in size, and the beds were comfortable. The kitchenette was set up like a hotel with a small table. Plan to meal prep, bring microwaveable meals or eat out. It was good value and much less than area hotels for the same weekend. The best part of our stay was Kathy and Jim's stunning backyard. A true gardener's delight with pebble paths and stunning flowers. June was the perfect time to visit! Per previous reviews, we brought a cozy sweatshirt and an extra blanket as the basement runs a bit cool. It was a good temperature for sleeping. We truly enjoyed our weekend and will book again in the future."

We highly recommend this place."
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Check in was a breeze. Replies in timely manner. No issues with parking. Nice surprise with the treats on the table and the fridge. Very clean. They even let us enjoy the porch/patio. Was a bit cold since it’s a basement so I would suggest bringing a sweater or slippers to keep your feet warm but they had portable heater and plenty of extra blankets in the closet. The comforter/bed sheets alone were enough to keep us warm while sleeping though. A wonderful place to relax after walking around the city!
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Kathy and Jim were lovely hosts. We visited for Tulip Time Festivities. The space was clean and Kathy's extra treats were kind and thoughtful.

We had an opportunity to sit out on the patio while enjoying a cool drink. The birds sang to us and squirrels entertained us! The lush garden was beautiful!
Remember this is the place you want to stay!"
2022-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Nice location that was easy to get into downtown Holland. We took my mother for Morhe’rs Day and the tulip festival. Had my 21 month old daughter with us and they had some toys for kids… including a baby doll and baby doll cradle which she was obsessed with! Nice touch for families with small children to not have to pack toys :)
Kathy and Jim were exceptionally nice as well!! Would stay again if we go to the tulip festival again next year!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Rob's place was fantastic! If you are on the fence, I highly recommend giving this a try. The place was much bigger than we expected and felt like we were in a historic bed and breakfast downtown. Much better feel than a hotel. The location was PERFECT to shopping, restaurants, farmers market, etc. It was a quick 4 minute Uber to the wedding we attended. He was able to accommodate an early check-in which was very helpful when getting ready for the wedding. The king bed in the main room was very comfy. 5 stars all around!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"The top floor artist’s loft was very spacious and cozy. The bed in the main bedroom was extremely comfortable and there were plenty of extra blankets, pillows, and towels already up there for you if needed. Rob was very accommodating and allowed us to have an early check in. The space felt very private and the front porch swing was a great addition. Rob and Mallory are great hosts and you won’t regret staying here!"

2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,Rob was very nice and the instructions getting inside were the most detailed I’ve seen! Beautiful area and right across the park where we were able to walk to everything. We only stayed overnight so didn’t use the kitchen but it was very clean and looks like it had plenty to make meals at home.
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We had a wonderful stay with Rob during the Tulip Time Festival. He went above and beyond to accommodate us during our stay. We would happily stay here again.

2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great place to stay. My wife and I had a kid free weekend in which to attend a funeral and a wedding back to back over the weekend. We were extremely grateful for the space and all that it offered—very close proximity to downtown for walking, next to the park etc. Great space. Lots of room for an attic apartment and the kitchen was a really nice thing to have access to. It’s an old house so lots of character and quirks, but everything worked really well, was very clean, and felt pretty private. It does have maybe the squeakiest floor I’ve ever experienced, and the stairwell up into the attic is very tight and pretty steep (both very common of old houses). Overall, I’d say it was a great stay."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,Just as described. Friendly & helpful hosts. They provided a baby-gate and toys which were a big help. They understood when my son made a mess right before we checked out and were happy to clean it up. I only noticed the dog bark one time in the morning.
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,This place was great! Very cool vibe and an awesome old house. A quick walk to lots of good restaurants and shops. Rob messaged to ask if we needed extra bedding and promptly dropped it off. Would highly recommend staying here.

2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Rob is a great host. His instructions are detailed and clear. The unit is walkable to Hope College and downtown Holland.

2023-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great old house, lots of space. Just a few minute walk to downtown - right on campus. Beds were comfortable, third one is a pullout. Communication was good. You are on the top-most floor so make sure you can climb steps - but this property is one that you will not regret staying in."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Second time we stayed. Will stay again.
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We thoroughly enjoyed Holland and this was a perfect place for walking to downtown.

Check-in and check-out were very easy, and we were grateful that there was not a list of things to do on our way out. The four of us had plenty of room and really enjoyed our visit. We would stay there again, and would definitely recommend."
2023-09-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Home is a 10 to 15 minute easy walk to all downtown businesses. Lots of room in the apartment and our stay was comfortable. The house has a lot of original features that make it charming but you need to be comfortable staying in an old home. The attic stairs to the apartment are steep, have a narrow tread, and they require care to navigate."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We enjoyed staying in this clean, spacious apartment . It was on the third floor of a great old house with steep stairs as Rob accurately described.
The beds were so comfortable and the fans and air conditioning units made for great sleeping.
There’s an equipped kitchen and a large bathroom. Loads of living space. I wish I could live there!!!
Rob was very gracious in helping me change my reservation dates at the last minute.
We look forward to staying here again.
Don’t forget to peek into the card catalog. We left a little surprise. !!
Walking distance to the lovely town of Holland. Across the street from Hope College."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"This top floor apartment has rustic charm. It is VERY spacious and provided nice privacy for two adult couples. Quiet and peaceful and you can not beat the price so close to downtown. Not luxury, if that is what you are looking for, but super clean and very quaint. Our entry and ability to come and go was seamless. Thanks and we would definitely stay again if we need a place in Holland."

2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"The place is very old but very well managed. I really enjoyed the small apartment in this building that has so much character. It was very spacious, has all the amenities you need for a long stay. It was also very clean. One thing to note, it has the narrowest and tallest staircase up into your unit that you've ever seen. So, bringing huge bags and loads of luggage will be inconvenient. It was walking distance to the main part of town and across the street from the beautiful park. Would definitely recommend!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Rob’s place was great to explore Holland. We could walk to downtown, ride bicycles and a short drive to the beach. He was attentive and let us store our bicycles during our stay and even offered a charger for the car."

Rob was incredibly responsive and accommodating to us, even able to check us in early to make it to our evening event. We certainly appreciate the hospitality and hope to return here next time we stay in Holland!"

Terrific location near beautiful Hope College and a short walk to town to enjoy coffee shops and restaurants.
Very Spacious (and comfortably fit 4 adults). Charming, clean space on 3rd floor of an historic in-town Victorian home.
Beautiful artwork and wonderful photography books.
Rob (the Host) was very quick to respond to questions / requests…. And was very accommodating for our request for a late check-out on a long holiday weekend. Thank you Rob!
Steep stairs to 3rd floor... which was not an issue for us.
It's an older building so please have patience with the shower water pressure.
We will absolutely stay again!"

There were lots of charming vintage details in the furniture, decor, and apartment itself; truly the perfect blend of vintage charm and modern amenities.
The apartment is well-stocked with anything you could need during your stay, and Rob was available to lend us a stockpot within a few minutes when we needed one for dinner on our last night.
The apartment/house is nice and quiet all day and the WiFi was speedy, making it easy for me to work remotely a few days during our stay.
The historic neighborhood + downtown Holland was delightful to explore, lots of yummy eats and cute shops truly just a few minutes on foot away.
Cannot recommend this enough; we’ll absolutely stay again if we’re ever back in Holland!"

Sometimes a little too warm, steep stairs.
Will definitely stay again."
2022-12-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Rob's place was exactly as described: a lovely artist's apartment that's just a short walk from downtown Holland and Hope College. Rob was an excellent host as well, very kind and accommodating. Holland is fortunate to have Airbnb's like this one!"

2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great location, perfect for what we needed. Wonderful old house. The apartment was very clean and easy to check-in/out. Great kitchen and overall way more spacious than expected.
I did worry about how loud we were for the folks below us since the floors are so squeaky, but from our perspective in the apartment the house was nice and peaceful.
Definitely not mobility friendly since the stairs are super steep and narrow."
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The host was super clear and easy to communicate with. The location is perfect for anything in downtown or at the college.
2022-10-01,5,Stayed one night,Great location and a nice attic suite in an old house. Good to have a lot of space - lounge and dining area. Nice small kitchen with better than average equipment. Countertop hot plate stove.

2022-09-01,5,Stayed over a week,"This is a quaint and convenient location with lots of charm. Cleanliness was on point, and the host was extremely responsive. I stayed for a month, so I had plenty of time to form an opinion. Kitchen is charming and decently equipped, Studio has plenty of room, and beds were amazing! I slept peacefully every night without fail. I would suggest one improvement: Most of the windows did not have screens, and of the three that did, only one was completely intact. Visiting in late August and early September would have been a lovely time to have my windows open, but I could not for fear of visiting insects. The unit does have two window air conditioning units that kept me perfectly comfortable. But if you prefer fresh air, this will be an issue."
2022-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"Directions to park and access the loft were clear and easy to follow.
Nice, clean space with interesting, old charm.
Fully functional kitchen, solid ac in bedrooms. Very clean bathroom and beds. Well kept!

Great access to stroll centennial park.
Loved the furnishings to boot!"
2022-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Rob's place is great, guys. PLUS! He doesn't do any of that ridiculous, ""Oh, here's a huge cleaning fee AND you have to clean your own dishes, vacuum, take out the trash, etc. etc."" The check out instructions told us not to worry about anything that wasn't staining something and that he'd take care of the rest. The place itself was awesome. We loved it and will be staying again. Location is really, really good. Just a block or two from downtown main street."
2022-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,We loved our stay!
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We really enjoyed our stay. Great neighborhood with a beautiful park so close by. Huge front porch with a porch swing. The apartment was quiet and much bigger than expected. Very clean and comfortable. Would definitely stay again.

2022-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Absolutely fantastic place. We didn’t get to meet our host but from how everything was set-up and provided ahead of time, it all reflected a very attentive and kind person. He set out baby toys and a gate for our little one (who also loved the space) and everything needed for a our short stay was readily accessible and visible. Thanks Rob, we hope to stay another time at one of your places!"

2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Rob’s place is in a great location close to downtown Holland! We were pleasantly surprised at how big the space was. The beds were comfortable and place had everything we needed for our short stay. The only thing that’s important to note is that it’s a 3rd floor apartment and it’s a bit of a hike to get up there and the stairs are steep. This wasn’t an issue for us, but just something to be mindful of if you are traveling with anyone with limitations."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,My friends and I loved our stay here. The building is charming and historic. The kitchen had the necessary appliances for basic meals like pasta and scrambled eggs. Parking was always available and we were a close walking distance to the downtown area and caddy-corner from a lovely park as well as Hope campus. Ron was attentive without being overbearing. I can’t recommend staying here enough!
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great location — central but quiet. The apartment is comfortable, clean, and bigger than we expected."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The apartment was clean, comfortable and in a great location. Rob was a very accommodating and responsive host. We brought our bikes and he made room for us to lock them in the garage."

2021-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Robs place was a gorgeous old Victorian house with loads of character- a space I always look for when I’m traveling! I always appreciate a non-cookie cutter experience and this is exactly what you’ll get. Robs place, while older (Victorian house as I said!) is impeccably clean and has lots of newer amenities. We really enjoyed our stay and will make sure to look up this place again for when we go back to Holland!"

2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place and close to where you want to go. We originally wanted to stay in Saugatuck but it was too expensive. This place is close by and gives the advantage of Holland in he back yard. We loved the food at the Boat Works and made it to the Farmers Market for coffee and pastries.What a cool town!

2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I had a great time. The location of the house was awesome and we felt safe throughout our stay. We went for early morning walks and it was a beautiful neighborhood. The host was extremely friendly and responded very quickly to all my questions. We had a hard time with the stairs (steep and narrow) but we were fairly warned. I worked in the evenings and the floor creaked quite a bit when I walked around the house. I hope the downstairs neighbors didn’t mind! I was a bit cold in the evening, so it’s best to bring something warm to sleep in. Overall, it was a great trip! Thank you!!"
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Rob's place is in the perfect location for enjoying the Holland experience. My friend and I were able to walk easily to so many destinations while also having off street parking available for our vehicles.
The air b n b was adorable and perfect for our needs. Both bed rooms were nice sized and the gigantic TV was fun to watch! It was hooked up to all the roku options too! The kitchen was stocked with everything one could need, a thoughtful touch. We never had a moment where we had to run and get something from the store. The bathtub is incredibly deep which allows for a most elegant soak, much needed as a parent, finally without children, on a long needed get away, during a pandemic. 😆 We had an absolutely lovely stay here. 10 out of 10 would recommend and stay again!"
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great location and a cool historic house from Holland's historic district

2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Central location. Roomy.
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Gotta say this place really was sparkling clean. Honestly I want to know his secret for how he keeps his hadwood floors so clean. Didn’t see a speck of dirt anywhere or dust in the corners!
My husband and I absolutely loved the quiet and the privacy the loft provided us. The location really is spot on and we pretty much walked everywhere our entire vacation. It was convenient to have a mini fridge to store our leftovers. Though there were other people living below us, we never once heard a peep out of them after quiet hours, so getting a good night’s sleep was a non issue. Rob was available all the time in case we needed anything. The loft was the perfect place for us to stay and if we stop in Holland again in the future we will definitely be back!"
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Hands down the coolest BnB we’ve stayed in. The location was hard to beat as well- made our birthday vacation that much more enjoyable. 10/10 would visit again.
2021-08-01,4,Stayed one night,"This is a cozy attic apartment. It's not the newest, nicest place; there's window AC units and the second bedroom gets very warm, but you can't beat the location. For space, convenience, and just a unique location, this is definitely the spot. My husband and I were only there for one night, but we both agreed we would have loved to stay more.
Oh, but as the description of the room says, those attic stairs up are quite steep!"
2021-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"Such a cozy, interesting, clean and unbelievably well-located historic home! We had so much fun staying in the cool quirky home in Holland!!"
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Rob's attic apartment is perfectly located in a historic house on a leafy block just a 1/2 block to the main city park and steps to downtown. It felt like I was walking into a storybook walking up onto the wrap-around porch and into the house up to the attic. The steps up to the 2nd floor are standard and the steps to the attic are just a little steeper than your standard steps. Not a problem for our family, but just to note. The apartment is lofty, bright, and airy. It feels like an artists loft with a kitchen, open living space (great for gathering), and 2 bedrooms. Clean, well-appointed, and perfect location make this a great option in Holland. Rob was just a great host and was quick to respond to any questions. The charm and feeling like a character in a book was a bonus!"

2021-08-01,5,Stayed one night,The location was perfect! Within walking distance to shops and restaurants. The unit is clean and comfortable. The stairs to the unit is steep and narrow so one must be careful going up and down. Easy check-in and check-out.
2021-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,Great place and great location!
2021-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This apartment is fantastic! Love the old house and the modern upgrades. The hosts communicate well and are easy to reach if need be. We stayed in the summer and even though we were (literally) in the attic it wasn’t uncomfortable or hot at all.
We walked to downtown and the lakefront with no problem from the apartment. It’s a really sweet historic neighborhood, and we felt really safe walking(even at night). The final flight of stairs into the attic are narrow, we were glad to have brought duffles as opposed to big suitcases. The fridge is a small “dorm size” so don’t plan on bringing excessive refrigerator/freezer goods. We brought an 11mo old and the hosts provided a baby get for the top of the stairs and toys. We didn’t feel like her crawling or fussing was an inconvenience to anyone else in the house, it wasn’t an “echoing old home”.
We would do it all again!"
2021-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"Being able to stay in a historic home near downtown was a dream come true. The home is conveniently located, walking distance to downtown and adjacent from a beautiful park. We stayed in the third-floor space and it met all of our needs perfectly.

2021-06-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Cute and spacious attic apartment in the perfect location, walking distance to all restaurants and retail in charming downtown Holland. The home is a grand lady that a is bit rough around the edges, but unit is clean and well cared for, owner is very attentive and prompt to requests and questions."
2021-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Rob's space is very unique - the attic accessed via a steep staircase in an old house next to the Hope College campus. The upstairs is extremely spacious and bigger than our NYC apartment of the past. He even managed to fit in a small kitchen with a portable induction burner in the space, along with a (playable!) acoustic guitar :) Downtown (8th street) is about a 5-10 minute walk. We had stayed at Holland before and this is much more convenient than the last place we stayed at. Rob is also very accessible and checked in on us via message during our 3-day stay. We enjoyed the stay greatly and had everything we needed. Thanks!"
2021-06-01,5,Stayed one night,The apartment has authentic charm! And the neighborhood has a sweet small town vibe.
2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This was a wonderful place to stay. SO close to downtown that I rarely used my vehicle at all. The place was just as Rob said and he was incredibly responsive. I would highly recommend this place to anyone wanting to visit Holland!

2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Holland, MI is a lovely small town and Rob’s place puts you right in the heart of things.

2021-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This is a welcoming and stylish (in an artist's sort of way) attic apartment that's really quite big. Artwork on the walls, interesting books on the shelves, and very clean. There's a guitar hanging up that you can play, too, which is really cool. Highly recommended."
