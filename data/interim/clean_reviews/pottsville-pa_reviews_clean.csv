2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"The house is very nicely remodeled with a well appointed kitchen. We were very happy with the nice towels, linens, and comfortable beds. Our 3 kids put the wifi to a test with all of their devices, & it worked flawlessly. There's a quiet space to sit outside in the back of the house to enjoy the evening. This is shared with the neighbor. She was very friendly and made us feel welcome. We would all love to come back. The purpose of our trip was to spend a day at Knoebel's, a 30 minute drive. This was the perfect place for us to stay."

The unit itself is in good shape and is well-stocked. Good kitchen supplies and adequate bathroom supplies. Washer and dryer did a good job. Internet/WiFi worked well for what we needed.
Thanks for the excellent stay!"

The owners thoughtfully provided top quality amenities and useful information. I highly recommend this property and look forward to returning when I have more time to explore the region."
2024-03-01,5.0,Group trip,We truly enjoyed our stay at Sam and Mike's. It was perfect for our family gathering. Walking distance within restaurants and bars. Only a few miles from Pottsville and the Yuengling Brewery. Street Parking is always an issue in the small towns. However there was always a spot in front of our airbnb with more parking available at the park. It does have a lot of stairs and no bathroom on the first floor. This wasn't an issue for our family but may be an inconvenience for older people.
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very clean and a homey atmosphere.
2023-11-01,5.0,Group trip,"Our stay was great, very clean and up to dste. Would have helped if there was a 1/2 bath on the main floor as we were older. Every thing else was perfect."

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Cute place, great location. We’ll stocked, comfortable. Easy street parking. Only downside is there are LOTS of stairs. Steep stairs. It’s a mountain town so unavoidable but my older MIL wasn’t quite prepared for it."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"The house was exactly what it looked like in the photos and very clean! We were traveling for a family members funeral service and did not have much time to explore the area but were pleasantly surprised that there was an awesome park a few houses down that we walked our children to in the vending and early morning. There was a really cute Shutterfly book with local recommendations and the house had plenty of space. For anyone traveling with anyone that has a hard time using stairs, note that the bathrooms are on the second and third floors (not that this affected our stay but I have found tips like this helpful in reviews).Thanks for a great stay, if we return to the area we will definitely book here again!!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We had a great stay and really enjoyed the house. Kids loved playing at the park when we were there. The house had everything we needed and we could see there was a lot of thought out into the details. Thank you for a wonderful stay.

We would absolutely stay here again. Thanks so much for your hospitality- we had a great stay.
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,Very nice and cozy
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Sam and Mike were friendly and helpful. the house is beautiful and well stocked. The neighbors were friendly. Just be aware there are a lit of stairs to get into the house and to move between the bedrooms. Also, the internet is slow. However that is not an issue specific to this house. I have done a lot of work in this area and that has been my experience with all of the airbnb, hotels, and training sites I've been to. Just something to think about if you are here for work."
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Great stay; gracious hosts. Exactly what we wanted.
2022-11-01,5.0,Group trip,"Better than advertised. Remodeled recently and it’s done right. I have a construction background and this place was not a paint over. Very clean, very comfortable. Fantastic value. And the Main St. Sandwich Shop around the corner is world class."
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We loved everything about this house and the host!
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Everything went well. The house design and condition was welcoming, comfortable and fitted all of our needs. It was clean, with everything we needed, and then some.

2022-10-01,5.0,Group trip,Great House and very clean. Highly recommend this house.
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,This townhouse was absolutely perfect for our family and our needs! We were in town for a family wedding in Orwigsburg and this was a convenient distance away with the right space for the six of us who stayed here. It was wonderfully renovated and equipped nicely for our weekend. There were toys and games for our young kids to play with and the playground a few houses down was very convenient. We had multiple cars and didn’t have any issues with parking. We will definitely be staying here again the next time we’re in town.
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Sam and Mike have a beautifully redone house in a quiet neighborhood. I would definitely stay again.
2022-09-01,5.0,Group trip,The house was very nice and worked out great for my family.

Sam and Mike thought of everything you could ever need.
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Great communication and wonderful clean house. Felt like home the minute we walked in. Everything you would need at a home they had. Would recommend to everyone we know!
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This townhouse in Minersville is beautiful. It's in a great location to visit the Pottsville area and visit the Yuengling brewery or attend a family reunion in the area like we did. The townhouse was renovated and the results are spectacular! Very clean. Very modern. Brand new EVERYTHING! Loved it!
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Stayed with Sam and Mike again like it was the first time, 5 stars, we love everything! Me and my family feel like at home. They're a nice and kind host and what I can say about their place is that we cannot wait to come back again. we recommend it ."
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We visited here for a father's day trip to the Yuengling brewery and this place was beautiful, clean and very spacious for our family.

2021-11-01,5.0,Group trip,"By far our favorite Airbnb we have stayed in, fit our needs perfectly and we wouldn’t suggest any changes. Definitely recommend staying here!"
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,My family and I were in the area for a family wedding. Our hosts were very accomodating as we asked for an early check in. They were great at communicating with us. The house was very clean and updated. I love a hot shower and the hot water didn’t disappoint. The bed was a little firm for my liking but I had no problem sleeping. Lots of stairs but that is made known in the listing. Just worth mentioning that there is only basic cable in the house. We were able to use our Netflix with no problem and weren’t home much to watch tv anyway…just wanted to mention. Home is close to lots of things. Cute little town as well. We would recommend this house.
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,10 out of 10 would recommend! House is amazing great location nice host!
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We had a great time in the house. The remodel is beautiful and the house is very comfortable. Thanks!
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This was one of the nicest stays we’ve had on Airbnb. Mike and Sam thoughtfully prepared the home with all the essentials and some extra touches to make it feel so inviting and special. The entire place was immaculate and we felt very safe. We loved it and were happy to have this option when visiting family. Thank you we can’t wait to stay again!
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"The residence is very comfortable and has everything you need in a home and is in optimal condition, super clean and well organized and the place where it is located is super quiet, we loved it.
100% recommended 🥰"

2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Great place and fantastic renters! We will stay there again for sure.
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Nicely renovated townhome with lots of special touches. Even before we walked in, we felt so welcome. The front door light was on and the patio accent lights greeted us when we checked the back door. There were toys for the kids, spices in the kitchen, extra towels and washcloths. Bedrooms were nice sized to large, beds comfortable. We had plenty of hot water and were comfortably cool while sleeping on warm summer nights. We didn’t have time to take advantage of the outdoor patio with grill, but it was inviting. We probably won’t be in that area again, but if we are, we will check to see if this property is available."
2021-08-01,5.0,Group trip,Beautiful home! My family and I were very happy about our vacation and about the house. Everything was very near specially when we needed to get some groceries to make food at home. Everything we needed was provided and couldn’t have asked for better. Really easy to check in and check out and the host was very helpful and reliable. Would recommend coming here with your family.
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Sam and Mike's place is great! We were so excited to have such a nice place to stay when visiting family in the Minersville - Pottsville area. The house has been beautifully remodeled and the results are incredible - so spacious and comfortable on each floor. The kitchen has everything you would need to stay in and cook - we did that! The house is immaculate in terms of cleanliness and we especially valued the abundance of good towels in the bathrooms. This is a great find for anyone visiting the area. We look forward to renting Sam and Mike's place again on our next visit to the region.
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We enjoyed our stay @ this beautiful property. We have family local to the area and can’t wait to stay again.
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This is a great place to stay. We visited Knoebels, Pioneer coal mine and train, and May's restaurant. This was a great home base. We didn't have a chance to get to the pool but wow! it looked amazing.
It is on street parking but their was always a spot right out front for you. The master suite is beautiful.
The only downside to this stay is that there are quite a few steps since it is 3 floors and you walk up to get to the front door (which is disclosed very well in the listing) that might create an issue for some but for our 2 teenagers and 4 adults was not problem.
The small town is very quaint and you hear no noise at all.
Sam and Mike responded very fast for all questions and have thought of so many small touches to make the stay perfect. Highly recommend staying here.
Wonderful!!"
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Very clean. Desk in the main bedroom for doing work. Park and pool literally next door.
2021-07-01,5.0,Group trip,Great place to stay for multiple people and very clean. Modern and comfy and they were very kind. Thank you!
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Sam and Mike’s place is adorable. Great updates and renovation, especially compared to the area. Everything is as pictured or nicer. The place was sparkling clean. We have 2 small boys and they loved the toys and the park & pool steps away.
The kitchen and closets are well stacked with everything you could need."
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Sam and Mike's house is an amazing and quiet place to stay at. You can find anything you need and feel like you are in your own house. They're great hosts. Me and my family have had an amazing experience in the area, and I would recommend it. We can't wait to come back again"
2021-07-01,5.0,Group trip,"Sam & Mike's place was fantastic. Very clean and stylish place with everything you needed. In a great location near a community pool, park & little league baseball field.  Sam & Mike were very accommodating and helpful letting us drop our bags off early and checking in on us regularly to make sure we had everything we needed. Would definitely stay here again!"
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We LOVED this house. Very newly renovated with excellent decor and furniture for the space. Toys for young children were a huge plus. Steps away from a nice playground, walking trail and huge public pool. Sam and Mike were very accommodating and quick to respond if we had any questions. We would definitely recommend staying here!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Amazing historic place :). Amber is super friendly and responsive host. Also, the place is almost next to the yuellngling museum which we loved."
2024-06-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place is so interesting and thoughtfully styled! It was a perfect base of operations while we hiked around nearby Hawk Mountain. I was constantly taking notes for which of Amber's design choices would work in our (similar age, similar style) house. The only drawbacks are that there weren't great hang out spaces -- the couches downstairs look great but aren't super comfortable. And the upstairs seating area doesn't face the TV, so it's a little awkward to spend any length of time there. We also had issues with the wi-fi: we could watch something streaming on the TV or we could use the internet on our devices. Doing both meant whatever was streaming on the TV would grind to a halt. This was a great place for a vacation, but I'm glad neither of us had to do internet-dependent work while we were here.
That said -- we loved staying here, loved the house and its history. Would recommend to anyone else looking for something close to Hawk Mountain."
2024-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Awesome place to stay and learn something too! I’m now searching for podcasts to learn more! Amber is quick to respond and the house is clean and welcoming. Would stay again for sure.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great historic place to stay in Pottsville! Surpassed our expectations.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,I’m hesitant to share that this is secretly the best spot for Pottsville’s Yuengling Lager Jogger- hope we can get it again next year! Just steps from the start/finish line and a couple blocks to the brewery. This home had everything we needed and was a fun spot to relax afterward. Thanks to Amber for sharing this antique treasure!
2023-09-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place is very fun for our annual stay in Pottsville, Pennsylvania. There was plenty of room to spread out. I really appreciated the ample supply of towels. I often find rental locations tend to skimp in this area. The kitchen was my favorite aspect. I struggled with the stove a bit, but the other mother traveling with me did not. I appreciated the coffee press provided, but I think a keurig/single-serve coffee maker might be a bit more efficient for guests as well as some sugar and possibly cream. I am a coffee nut, so it is the one amenity I really look for! Really gorgeous old home and they have done a great job of creating a cool place to stay if you are visiting this area."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Amber's stay was just like in the pictures! We had a great time in her lovely home & she was super friendly & quick to respond when we had questions. Would definitely recommend staying here for a romantic getaway!
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Definitely stay here if you find yourself in Potsville! Amazingly beautiful house with fascinating history. Every room unique and different. Very walkable to brewery or downtown restaurants. Lots of street parking. Really felt like I was staying in a piece of history - but with modern conveniences. 😃
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Fantastic place to stay! Fun, old house with fascinating books, art, and furniture. Tons of space. A little challenging if narrow steps aren’t your thing, but we loved it. Amber is great as well. We will be back!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"A little treausure nestled just steps away from the Yuengling Brewery. Charming historic home, lovingly decorated with lots of charm and warmth.
I would highly recommend staying in Amber's beautiful home! <3"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Staying at Laura's moon lake cottage was like coming to a friend's house. It was inviting and peaceful. It was everything our family needed.
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"It was amazing, we'll definitely come back in the future. Very great for short trips to Knoebel's or Hershey's."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We enjoyed our stay, the house was very clean(which is very,very important to me)nicely decorated love the deck overlooking the lake. lots of added small touches to make you feel comfortable. And lots of added extras in case you forgot anything .You can tell Laura takes a lot of pride in her home. I would highly recommend this home. We will be returning.🙂"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"My family and I went up to visit Jim Thorpe and Knoebles…he place was a great center location. Loved her cottage, and felt so at home. We really needed to decompress, and her spot was perfect"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Nice, clean cottage on a lake. Would recommend"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,came here to celeb rate my husbands birthday and to have a nice weekend getaway away from our kids. was able to relax by the lake and enjoy some sleep and quiet time
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,First time staying at the cottage; we loved it. So quiet and peaceful. We slept great. Even though the weather wasn’t great the first two days we still really enjoyed our stay. We will be back again!
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We stayed here for a small birthday celebration and a much needed get away. This place was exactly what we needed! The view of the lake is phenomenal. The cottage itself was beautifully decorated, very clean, and had everything we needed. The beds were quite comfortable, which isn’t always the case with rentals.
Laura responded very quickly to any questions we had, and offered us early check in and a late check out (likely due to it being the off-season, but we were grateful!).
We visited in late March, so it wasn’t warm enough to enjoy the lake, other than the fantastic view. I’m sure this place is even better when it’s warm. We did take advantage of both the fire pit and the fireplace. Nothing like relaxing with a fire.
We will definitely be visiting again. What a wonderful weekend at a fabulously relaxing location! Thank you, Laura!"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Relaxing, peaceful weekend. Enjoyable, comfortable space. Will absolutely book again!"
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"What a great cottage on the lake. Beautiful surroundings. We felt so comfortable there we didn’t want the weekend to end. Laura is a very attentive host and responds quickly.
Can’t wait to book again in the summer."
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Laura’s place had everything that you could ask for. It was our second time staying.
It was comfortable and quiet. Loved the fireplace!!"
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My stay at Moon Lake Cottage was exactly was I was looking for! I wanted a quiet, cozy getaway for a few days to rest & recoup after a long string of life stressors. The fireplace was especially wonderful for relaxing in my PJs, reading, and journaling beside a crackling fire. A real fire, not gas or electric, with more than enough firewood provided. The cottage itself appears to have been built in the 1920s or 30s and feels extremely solid. The rain on the roof made a gentle pattering sound. I couldn't be happier with my stay, I definitely recommend Laura's place even in the middle of January!"

2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is a MUST STAY place! We had a quiet weekend surrounded by beautiful nature in a pristine cottage! Everything you could think of, and more, was here. Even walking sticks m, binoculars, birding books, and games. Charming does not even begin to describe this place. Top notch!!!"

2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Perfect place to disconnect and enjoy a weekend by the fireplace.
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very nice little quiet place
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,The place was clean and as described. I loved the location and the decor but the checkin time was later than I would like and the cleaning fee and service fee made a one night getaway too expensive for less than a 24 hour stay. Otherwise a nice place
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This little gem has an amazing view of Moon Lake and has great fishing! I thoroughly enjoyed the sunsets and view of the mountains all around the lake. Be sure to check out the Little Brown Barrel for an awesome local grub spot!
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The cottage was so cozy and homey for our girl’s weekend! The lake and homes around it are straight out of a movie or book. Everything you could possibly need is at the cottage. We definitely will be back !
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This was our first time at an air B&B so we were not sure what to expect. The cottage was very neat & clean! Comfortable beds & many extras in the closet for our use & enjoyment. We were very happy with our choice.
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Peaceful lodging with an incredible lake view! Cottage is clean, cozy and well stocked. We enjoyed kayaking with our kids (6, 4). They didn’t want to leave! I’d certainly recommend it and hope to return again. Thanks Laura :)"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Darling cottage with beautiful views and a comfortable, versatile outdoor space. The a/c was great but when it was cooler we appreciated the screens on the windows and the porch door. Other things we liked: the comfortable beds, the selection of flavored coffees for the Keurig, the solo stove, the walk around the lake, the serenity, and the homey touches. Restaurant recommendations and menus were very helpful. The description of the cottage was spot-on. Would love to come back in the cooler months."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We initially booked the Cottage as a place to stay when visiting Knoebles, but it turned out to be so much more than that. The house was adorable and just the right size for 2 adults and 2 kids. The property itself was beautiful. The view was incredibly scenic and we found ourselves spending most of the time outside by the lake. We used the kayaks and did tons of fishing - the lake is fully stocked. We also loved the fact that the parameter of the lake was walkable and all the neighbors were friendly. We had a great time and would recommend to anyone!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Beautiful, cozy cottage in a peaceful location. Laura was very responsive and accommodating. Would love to stay at the cottage again in the future."

2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Great place to vacation at! Beautiful little Moon lake was so peaceful. Must take the kayaks out on the lake! The mountain views were stunning! It was just a 30 minute drive to Knoebels amusement park. There was plenty to do in the area. My 10 year old son and his friend had a blast!
The host was very quick to respond with any questions we had. Would definitely stay there again!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Well appointed small cottage in rural Schuylkill County. Relaxing views of tranquil Moon Lake and close proximity to Knoebels, Pioneer Coal Tunnel, and other regional treasures. Cottage was very clean and provided all of our needs with the bonus of a washer and dryer. There was a faint mildew/mold odor- just a warning for those with allergies. Overall, our stay was lovely and I’d absolutely return to this gem."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great little cottage in Pennsylvania. Amazing for our quick getaway before the end of summer. This place would be beautiful in every season!! Laura was quick to respond and very helpful. We recommend her as a host!
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"There are few words that will actually do this cottage justice. For one, the pictures and description don’t even come close to how lovely and peaceful it is! Laura was EXTREMELY responsive whenever we had questions, the cottage was BEYOND stocked with anything and everything you could need, and the space was PRISTINE! The beds are memory foam and we slept like babies. Sitting in the porch at night listening to the bullfrogs and owls was enough to make me want to book again in the future! Thank you Laura for a wonderful stay!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We enjoyed our stay at the cottage. It was exactly what I was looking for; peaceful and relaxing with a wonderful view. There was plenty of space for us and very clean.
We did the Yuengling tour which is pretty interesting. Its about 20 minutes from the place. It’s an hour long tour and you must wear closed toe shoes.
It was a great relaxing weekend. Thank you!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a lovely time. The house is really nice and cozy. We enjoyed the nature around. We used the kajaks.

We had a great conversation with Laura. We would love to come back."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This cabin was amazing! The setting, the cabin itself, and all the amenities
were such a plus! The lake, ducks, geese, otter, bald eagles, etc it was such a relaxing experience. Words cannot do this place justice and we travel often!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This beautiful lakefront cottage was the perfect getaway! My grandmother, mom and sister had an amazing time! We were able to kayak, fish, take a nice walk around the lake, and enjoy the peaceful surroundings. We were extremely happy with all the amenities and accommodations Laura had provided us with, and great communication! Will definitely be back!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This house is beautiful! The scenery is just as described. The house is stocked with everything you could possibly need! Great house, great host and great memories. Thank you, Laura!"

2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Fantastic time!
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"310 Moon Lake was just such a beautiful cottage on a beautiful lake. It felt like a world all on its own. I think I'll be chasing that feeling for a long time!
The house was immaculately clean, beds so comfortable, and exactly like the photos. In fact, the photos don't do it justice!
Laura was amazingly responsive and proactive in her communications. Check-in and out was a breeze.
Here's the deal: if you want a quiet place to refocus and rewind, just book it! You will not be disappointed."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Laura’s place was really amazing and had a great view of the lake. I didn’t get out on the kayaks but very easy access to do so. This quiet little place was amazing and I really enjoyed the outdoor patio at night. Highly recommend.
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,I've stayed here multiple times and will be back! That's how awesome this cozy cottage is! Has everything you need for remote work or just relaxing and listening to the geese and spring peepers.

2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I dont use this word often.... but this cottage was PERFECT!! The cottage instantly felt like home and was amazingly well stocked with everything. I loved sitting on the back porch, front swing and enjoying the wood fireplace. Also walking around the lake was beautiful. It was the peaceful retreat I had hoped for."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,It's a beautiful spot. I highly recommend it
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This Cabin was everything and more. Beautiful location and everything you are looking for on a getaway.
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Laura's cabin was just what we needed for a weekend out in the country! It was fully stocked and gave us flexibility throughout the weekend to stay in or go out.
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Cute place to visit with s beautiful view. Neighbors houses are throwing distance which was not expected. All and all I would visit lake again.
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Such a beautiful cottage with the cutest decor and views, overlooking moonlake, fireplace was the highlight of our trip. Definitely coming back 10/10 recommend!"
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"It's a treasure of a spot, and an adorable home. Everything you need to rest, recharge and rejuvenate."
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We had a great time. Laura answered all of our concerns nearly instantly as they arose and was a fantastic host. Hope to be back soon!
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Laura’s Cottage was lovely. It was stylish, cozy and peaceful. Well equipped and stocked. The view of the lake is beautiful and accessible from inside and out. The fireplace was amazing with an ample supply of wood and fire starters. Laura was immediately responsive to questions. We would definitely return."
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We enjoyed our stay, and you have a lovely cottage. Even this time of year it's great to walk around the lake. We also enjoyed the fireplace. It was great to watch the EAGLES win there too. We highly recommend this place for a romantic and quiet get a way! Feel free to quote me. Would love to share a copy of some of the pictures that we took. We visited many of the quiet towns in the area and had a great dinner at the Summit View. There is also a very beautiful church in Mt. Carmel a few minutes away. Thanks. Jim and Doreen"
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"One of the most amazing places I've ever stayed--the space itself is incredibly cozy and inviting with remarkable views, and there is everything you would need for a great, relaxing weekend retreat. Highly, highly recommend!"
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"A beautiful, quiet cottage. The cottage itself is worth a visit. Cozy and spacious, with a very well-equipped kitchen and everything you need for a relaxing weekend. Beautiful. Thank you, Laura!"
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Such an adorable and lovely place! The decor was our favorite part because it made it feel so homey and warm and just a great environment to spend time in. It has the cutest patio with lights and comfy chairs and then you walk down to another space with the fireplace; we heavily enjoyed sitting out there in the morning with our hot coffees and then at night making some s’mores. The house had everything we needed and more! Coffee, towels/toiletries, comfy blankets, many games, anything you’d need for making a fire, etc. Everything was clean and easy to use. The lake and the views around were already so nice and it was the middle of winter- I can’t even imagine how beautiful it is in the fall or spring. Laura and her property manager were both very responsive and answered any questions we may have had. Would 1000% recommend!"
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Laura's place is the best😍😍 It is serene and peaceful. Great location to disconnect and recharge. We will definitely go back soon
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Wonderful home. We had a nice relaxing time for Thanksgiving. The house is very cozy and comfortable. We felt right at home.
Also, the host was very friendly and quick to respond to questions.
Will definitely return."
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Wonderful stay! Quiet, quaint, great view of the small lake and the fireplace was excellent. Would stay again"
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My wife and I stayed at the Moon Lake house for our first wedding anniversary and this was our first Airbnb. I feel like I’m bound to be disappointed with the next Airbnb we book because there’s almost no chance it will compare to Laura’s. The amenities provided here along with the beautiful scenery and rich local history made for a perfect get away. The view from the back porch overlooking moon lake is amazing day and night with ever present ducks and geese swimming around the lake. We were a little worried there wouldn’t be much to do during our 4 day stay but between Jim Thorpe, trail hiking, and visiting the coal mining tourist attractions, we ran out of time and didn’t even go to knoebels. 10/10."
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The cottage at Moon Lake made for the perfect Fall getaway. Gorgeous views everywhere you looked, with lots of fun ducks and geese to watch. It was so cozy that I felt right at home. The cottage is stocked with anything you could possibly need, towels, shampoo, coffee, tea, s’mores, plenty of firewood, etc. We had a very peaceful stay, with some exploring nearby, Mt. Carmel, St. Clair, Centralia, Pottsville, Jim Thorpe. Visited some of the local wineries, King Cole winery, Red Shale (on a beautiful scenic road). If you are thinking of booking this place-do it! The photos do not even do it justice, everything was exceptionally clean too. Thank you for sharing this gem of a home. It was nice to escape the city life and have some mountain time. Looking forward to a future visit again sometime!"
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Laura's place is absolutely incredible. So warm and inviting—like being at a family friend's lake house. It's very much a home and has all the quirks of a well-loved place, and Laura is so easy to communicate with and check-in is a breeze. The lake is absolutely beautiful and the kayaks are great. Lots of geese and fall foliage to see during our stay, and I'm sure it's lovely the rest of the year as well! Very quiet and serene. I hope to be back soon!"
2022-10-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"The place was great, beautiful lake view and cozy and clean house. Had a nice time hiking and was great to come back and start a fire, was nice to have firewood supplied. Nice selection of K cups. There was a pet fee that wasn’t communicated until day of check-in, otherwise no issues."
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My third stay, and still just as fantastic as ever! Such a relaxing location. I work remotely and the cottage is setup perfectly for that as the Internet/WiFi works really well, you can relax on the porch and listen to the geese and ducks. The cottage is well appointed and has all of the amenities you'd need to enjoy a week away!"
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Another fantastic stay at the cottage! This is such a great location and a wonderful house. It's so relaxing to hang out and listen to the geese and watch the water. The cottage has everything you'll need to enjoy your stay!
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We loved our stay, waking up to lake front views and sipping coffee on the porch. The Lake is small, but we still enjoyed the kayaking around. We hiked some trails nearby in the Weiser State Forest - easy to moderate trails. Would definitely stay again."
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,It was definitely worth visiting!
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Nice weekend getaway!
2022-08-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"Laura was an absolutely amazing host; she was available and responsive to any needs that cropped up.
The cottage and surrounding area are absolutely beautiful!
Our family really enjoyed our getaway in the mountains!
Knoebels, Pioneer tunnel, and Jim Thorpe along with the Lehigh Gorge Scenic Railway we’re all fantastic places- all within 40 minutes or less of the cottage; we had so many activities planned that we didn’t get to visit the fossil park, reptile park or deer farm this time around!
Laura has two sit-on-top kayaks available for use in what locals call “Moon Lake.”
The lake, as listed, really is more like a large pond; it’s recently been drained, but is still very usable and scenic. There’s fish and tons of wildlife going on during all hours- it was a treat to watch from the back deck.
Baggo/corn hole, rockers, multiple seating areas as well as a solo stove are also provided; all wonderful additions that add to the experience.
The fireplace in the main living area is stunning, and the furniture in this room is actually quite comfortable for an AirBnB listing; it really feels like home.
Books and games are available on the shelf for use, and pamphlets for local places of interest are available in a basket as well.
The entire cottage was absolutely spotless upon arrival, and the oil diffusers were a great addition.
There’s a smart TV and internet access, along with a DVD player all available for use.
The AC is in great working order and is located in the main living area and kitchen; it is run by remote. It’s helpful to know that the remote comes down from the holders and worked best when aimed directly at each unit. The only down side to the AC was that the bedroom doors must remain open for the air to get in, thus cutting down on privacy.
The bedrooms themselves were small, but functional for a small family getaway. The accordion doors provided little to no privacy, and the first bedroom door was broken upon arrival and never fully shut.
The bed in the second bedroom was comfortable, but the bed frame, while new, was broken up arrival as well; for full transparency- Laura did offer to fix this during our stay and we did decline. The frame itself in this room is not quality. The lack of a carpet in the room also allows the bed to shift with typical use which may have been the problem to begin with.
The neighboring home next door has a motion activated flood light aimed right at Laura’s cottage and kept us up the first night; we bought sleep masks and we were fine after. This light absolute pours into the bedrooms; room darkening shades and curtains would help this area tremendously.
The kitchen is a more adequately stocked than the listing gives itself credit for. Plenty of items for use along with fully stocked bins of coffee!
All of the house info can be found on the side of the fridge, along with menus of local places to eat at/order from.
The only issue we had with the kitchen was that the stove was not functioning and we were not notified prior to arrival; we spent a bit more than planned eating out and carried our store bought groceries for dinners home. with us.
The bathroom is equipped with a full washer and dryer, and the hot water never seems to run out. The bathroom was fully stocked and the water pressure was great! The bathroom door could use some attention, but with some care you can close the door.
The front door feels secure and the check in/out process is super easy; the digit locks and alarm make the home feel super safe.
The driveway is crushed stone and has room for two vehicles parked in a row; we recommend backing in. The road is a 35 mph zone, but the locals seem to do 60; the trees that are at the edge of the driveway provide some privacy for the home, but block views of the street as you pull out.
While the door and bed were minor issues experienced- it’s not something that can’t be fixed. We had a wonderful stay and look forward to a return trip soon."
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Only regret is booking for two nights. Beautiful place to stay at, would book again."
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"The perfect places for a nice quite, relaxing get away. The post does not do this place justice at all!!! Its is absolutely beautiful, cozy and has every accommodation you could possibly think of. I was impressed with how well stocked the entire home was, with EVERYTHING you could possibly need. There are so many little things we always forget and thankfully everything we needed was provided. I loved sitting on the porch watching all the ducks, geese and even enjoying a nice storm. Everything is very clean, all the furniture is super comfortable especially the couch and beds lol. We felt right at home and will definitely be coming back!"
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We enjoyed the fire pit and back porch - every morning the whole area is alive with wildlife from Kingfishers to ducklings. We saw a 6 inch Imperial Moth! And fire pit hotdogs or s'mores at night made great memories. Loved the pet door on the back porch so our pooch could be with the family. Plus - everything you need is found in the well stocked cabin!
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Moon Lake is a secret gem! Very calm and scenic, there is so much nature to take in on the lake and it’s surrounded by gorgeous tree-lined hills/mountains. Laura’s place was very clean and cozy, and the lake access was so nice for morning walks and kayaking. Laura was super responsive and we had no issues during our stay. I’d fully recommend (and already have) this place for a small getaway! Thank you so much Laura!"
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Cozy cottage on Moon lake is perfect! The listing is just as described & some! Fully stocked with little things you may have forgotten for you to use. Very clean & super cute & peaceful ❤️ my husband & my two girls 14 & 8 had a great time using the kayaks & catch & release fishing 🎣 plus it was about 1/2 hour from Knoebel’s which is what we were in the area for.
Laura was great with communication too! I would love to stay at Laura’s place again some time :)"
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We were only at the house at night, but coming “home” to this cozy and comfortable cottage in lieu of staying in a tent this year elevated our vacation from good to great!"
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful view! So much to look at from all the wild life around to all the different flowers and trees. The house has everything you would need and then some! The owner was very nice and easy to get a hold of during our stay since we had a little problem and had to have the handyman come out.
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"My family had a wonderful time here. The house is well stocked and cozy. There is a variety of choice for coffee and tea. We enjoyed playing games and reading books that were here. TVs with OTT are a big plus. The view is breathtaking. We saw a rabbit, many fish in the lake, geese, ducks, sparrows and many birds. There's a fire pit with well stocked firewood where we enjoyed making smores. From sunscreen to bug repellent lotion, Laura has everything stocked in the house. The house is just as described and is beautiful. Our little kids loved the house. We would love to stay here again."
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We had a fun stay! It was quiet and cozy. It made for a perfect getaway :)
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Laura’s cottage is a great place for a little R&R. It was fully stocked with the necessities. There are plenty of fun things to do around town also. The lake is spectacular. It was serene to wake up to in the morning. Sitting out at night with the fire pit going was also a great experience. We plan to come again soon !
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,All you need to bring are your groceries to eat while you are there! The place has pretty much everything else you may need. We spent at least half the time we were there out on the back porch enjoying the calming view and fresh air. Tons of nearby hikes and some good options to eat or have a drink not to far away if you would like to. Perfect getaway place for some R&R!!
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We came to unwind and relax after a stressful school year. I planned to come and do some hiking, read lots of books, and build a nightly fires. We did all of those things and more. We took the kayaks out for an easy and relaxing paddle. We walked around the lake daily. That was a nice surprise and we met some very friendly people!
We took some hikes out at Sweet Arrow Lake, beautiful. Highly recommend. Also at Swatara Park and a little bit on Appalachian Trail. We explored around Centralia which was very interesting.
The cabin was perfect. I loved the art that was everywhere. Very whimsical and fun. The supplies in the kitchen were bountiful. I have never been to a rental with such variety of items available. My favorite part was to sit on the porch every night and just read and look at the lake for hours, watching the mama bird feed her babies in the birdhouse on the porch. Then we would switch to the fire pit and make s'mores. Perfect stay! Looking forward to return!"
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We found Laura's cottage to be just as described. The cottage was very clean and the beds were comfortable. There was plenty of seating in the living room for the four of us.
Having the fenced in front yard and the gated back porch was just ideal for Luna (our miniature Bernedoodle).
My parents owned the cottage next door many years ago. We spent so many fun summers at Beury's Grove (now Moon Lake) - it was nice to spend a few days reminiscing about times gone by.
Next time we would like to stay at Laura's bigger place right on the lake so my sister can join us!"
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a great time! The place is lovely, quaint, and the perfect quiet getaway."
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"An adorable little cabin! My newlywed husband and I stayed here for a weekend getaway honeymoon. The house is very cute, clean, and pleasant to stay in. The area is peaceful. We loved kayaking and walking around the lake, grilling outside and roasting marshmallows over the fire pit. We went to Knoebels amusement park which was about 30 minutes away. Laura was a wonderful host- very communicative and thoughtful. I recommend it!"
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,We really enjoyed our stay. Such a beautiful property and well designed!
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place for a relaxing get away. Extremely clean. Very cute. Loved sitting on the porch watching the birds and ducks. The Keurig coffee pod selection is a nice touch. Thanks for a great couple of days.

2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Really comfortable property with beautiful views of the lake and lots of homey touches. The air conditioning worked great even when it was 91 degrees outside. Lots of wildlife, crickets, and birds on a sleepy, well shaded lake. Great, prompt communication and the property was even better than described."
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This cottage was very warm and welcoming! The amenities were wonderful from the coffee to the wood burning fire pit to the kayaks! Felt so comfortable and homey❤️.

2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This cottage was so perfect from having everything available that you could think of to the beautiful lake view and all over welcoming and cozy atmosphere. We watched the Mama Ducks with their Ducklings, walked around the lake, cooked a few meals, and enjoyed the various coffees Laura had made available, in addition to many other staples. The inviting back porch has a wonderful, peaceful view of the lake. The cottage decor was very thoughtful and cozy. LOVED IT!"
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had signed up for the Yuengling Light Lager Jogger 5K and were coming from Philly, so decided to turn it into a weekend and found Laura's delightful lakeside retreat. The home was exactly as described, well-decorated, and very well stocked! Lots of natural light with windows across the back of the house, overlooking the lake. Excellent outside spaces with a covered porch and patio with a fire pit lakeside with Adirondack chairs and a table and chairs to take your dinner outside. Laura's house sits high on a hill overlooking the lake, so the view is lovely. There is also a grill on the patio. We took advantage of the kayaks and spent some time on the lake. The lake is small and shallow but perfect for lazing around in a kayak.
The bedroom we slept in faced the lake with sliding glass doors, allowing for pleasant morning light and views of the lake from the bed. The second bedroom does not have a view, but perfectly adequate for sleeping. The living room has a working fireplace (which we lit the first night) and very comfortable seating. Wood for both the fireplace and fit pit was plentifully stocked around the property.
The bathroom was well-stocked and also included a washer and dryer. Shower was comfortable. The kitchen had everything you needed to construct meals at the house and some pantry items at your disposal should you need.
The house was about 20 minutes from Pottsville, where the race was. We stopped at Boyer's Food Market for supplies for Saturday dinner. A few food/beverage highlights from the area were Pilger Ruh Brewing in Pottsville and The Little Brown Barrel in Minersville.
We would 100% return to Laura's house in the future. Perfect for a lazy weekend getaway on a lake."
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Very cozy and fun cabin overlooking a pretty lake and forest. Very quiet area, easy to get to and find. Great back deck and steps down to the lake, well stocked kitchen and supplies, wonderful fireplace inside and outside, absolutely a perfect quiet and peaceful stay. The wifi is fast, over 80-100 mbps. Perfect for a remote work get away. Laura was a perfect host. I had a seamless stay and would highly recommend Laura and any of her listings on Airbnb."
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,It’s the perfect place to stay for an easy get-away. It’s definitely peaceful and I highly recommend staying here.
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful cottage! Lots of firewood for the amazing fireplace or fire pit. Relaxing view of the lake.
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"A very cozy place next to the lake in a quiet neighborhood. The house is very clean and comfortable, with an awesome fireplace and plenty of wood! There are lots of extras in the pantry and tons of teas and coffee available. The weather wasn't great so we weren't able to walk around the lake but it seems like a great place to visit in warmer weather too."
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"You can expect a very cute, cozy, clean cottage! Beautiful view and cute and cozy living room with fire place!"
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great weekend getaway—thanks again!
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This cottage is exactly as described by Laura. Cozy, homey and warm for the perfect weekend getaway. It was exactly what we needed to bring in the New Year with my husband and baby. We spent majority of the time nestled near the fireplace. Beautiful quite community. Laura responded quickly to all of our questions. Could see us returning back here again!"
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,My boyfriend and I had an amazing stay! The cottage was absolutely beautiful and everything we imagined it would be and more! The place was clean and well stocked. Kitchen had everything we needed to cook a meal. Towels/linens were clean. Beautiful views. The place was so cozy and everything we wanted for a weekend getaway/holiday stay. The Christmas decor was beautiful and we enjoyed the fireplace (he also ended up proposing on our last night!). 10/10 stay! We’ve already talked about coming back :)

2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,great stay
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Fabulous little cozy cottage with stellar views over Moon Lake. Neighbors on both sides but didn’t hear a peep. Spent a LOT of time out on the back porch which is covered and comfortable. Great place to relax while watching and listening to the wildlife. Whole flocks of Canada geese, ducks and a blue egret call the lake home, and an adorable pair of chipmunks nearby. Easy in & out off of 901 and a quick jaunt to Ashland (Whistler’s Mother statue, Pioneer Coal Mine & Tunnel Tour), Knoebels in Elysburg, and plenty of restaurants in St. Clair, Pottsville and Pine Grove. Gorgeous furniture, comfy beds and all the amenities you need for a rejuvenating getaway."
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great Lake house! Great host! Great value! The pictures you see online are great, but until you see it in person you can’t imagine. It was SO cozy and the host had everything you could want already set up. TVs, fishing poles, kayaks, towels, washer dryer, tons of firewood, coffee, pots and pans, you name it, she had it. I was settled in right away and able to relax and enjoy the view of the lake and wildlife. It was a great value! Will definitely be booking again! Excellent Host! Thanks again Laura!"
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We had a great time staying at the cottage. The lake was nice and relaxing to walk around. We really enjoyed sitting on the back deck and watch the geese and ducks. The bench swing out front was a plus. Everything in the house was laid out nicely and flow was good. Overall a great ABB!
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful getaway, relaxing and peaceful"

2023-07-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,It was a nice setting and convenient to visit the nearby brewery and downtown area. The historic house did live up to its description by Sky.
2023-04-01,3.0,Stayed about a week,Great place close to lots of places
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We didn’t stay at the apt very long, as we were visiting family nearby. The apt was quiet and we slept well in the comfy bed. Would definitely stay again."
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Second time staying. Sky was very flexible with my last minute check in needs and communicative.
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"historic spot, classic city row home with parquet floors and just up the street from the Yuengling brewery!"

2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Beautiful place to stay that’s comfortable and packed with history. There’s so much to look at in the house and Sky has it decorated perfectly. We wished we would’ve been able to stay longer! Snacks were provided in the room and everything was nice and clean. Coffee downstairs in the morning and a display of the works of John O’Hara. Will be back if we are ever out East again!
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Very neat place and Sky allowed us to check in early!
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Booked last minute and couldn’t have gone any better. Loved the character and history of the house and occupant. Super cute town too.
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The O’Hara house is so quaint. It’s clean, has comfortable amenities and is right up the street from D.G Yuengling and Sons brewery (where you can get a free tour and some beer to taste at the end). Host is responsive and easy going. We really enjoyed our stay and will recommend to friends and those who are considering visiting the area."
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"My second stay in about a month's time. I won't say it was like coming home, but it was awfully nice to walk into that familiar old house. I stayed in a different unit (2nd floor). The unit was more apartment-like. Very pleasant."
2022-07-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Stayed for 2 nights with my wife.
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Very historic stay in an awesome part of town!
2022-06-01,4.0,Stayed one night,Quirky old building in a super convenient area. Great value and character!
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Sky was great. He greeted me at the front door when I arrived and took me inside where he shared some history of the building. He was very responsive to anything I needed. Great Host!
The place was clean and comfortable (Bed was great) and in a great location if you're looking to explore Pottsville - very walkable. If you're visiting the Yuengling Brewery, it's right across the street. The building itself is beautiful if you can appreciate old craftsmanship. beautiful wood floors and moulding. The downstairs is a great place to sit and relax with a book or a drink 😊
I'd definitely stay again."
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is a quaint and quiet little spot in an area that is otherwise not so quaint. Sky was very accommodating, friendly, helpful and honored a special request I had. Bathroom is a little small but I guess that can be expected from a historical house.
They offer coffee downstairs in the morning, kitchen has utensils for cooking and plates. Also a microwave and large refrigerator.
Only suggestion to guests is maybe bring an extension cord as there are not many outlets in the bedroom.
I’m originally from the area and this apartment is walking distance to all the restaurants I missed as well as the Yuengling Brewery. Overall it was a great stay!"
2022-06-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Basic airbnb that has what you need.
2022-05-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Small place, hard to use toilet. Ideal for couples and maybe small pets. The neighborhood is very run down and many shops are not open to explore. Other than the brewery, not much else to really do, especially coming from a larger city."
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Totally awesome stay, fabulous hosts and very cool historic home!! Lots of fun facts in this hidden gem on Pottsville!! Highly recommend"
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Fun place to stay in a town with so much history! Talk to Sky about all the great places to eat and secret spots to visit.
2022-05-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"A cool, simple historic apartment with beautiful wood floors and comfy couch and bed. Just a block from the Yuengling brewery (we took the tour—really cool). Easy parking and quiet. The open parlor downstairs was really lovely and learned a little about the history of the house as well. Perfect for our surprise Mother’s Day visit to my mother-in-law."
2022-04-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"Had a lovely time in this historic gem in Pottsville! Sky’s super responsive and helpful and the space is full of charm and thoughtful details. We spent a good portion of one evening exploring the short stories of one of John O’Hara (who was one of America’s most prolific writers and had grown up in the home) and playing games from the public sitting area. The space is small and quaint, but boasts all the necessities you would need for a short and sweet getaway - a full kitchen (complete with pots, pans, plates, silverware, and glasses - but oddly no mugs), snacks for us to nosh on in-between hikes, a decent tea selection, a comfy bed, and an easy check in & out. Enjoyed exploring Pottsville, though be forewarned that everything closes pretty early there, even on a Saturday night. But for a short escape from the city to explore the hiking in the area, it was great for our needs!"
2022-04-01,3.0,Stayed with kids,Great location in Nyack. Walking distance to Main Street with all the restaurants & shops. Perfect space for one person or a couple to stay in.
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"My SO and I stayed here for 2 nights in April. The apartment was small, but perfect for 2 people and 2 dogs. It had everything we needed to be comfortable: kitchen, table, bed, couch, TV, internet, extra blankets, etc. The location was easy to find and we were able to walk the dogs to a park only 1 block away. Plus, checkin was easy, and Sky was quick to answer any questions! Would recommend this air bnb to anyone looking for a comfortable place to stay in Pottsville."
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful apartment convenient to everything in downtown Pottsville

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Everything was great Lisa is very friendly and helpful great person and very caring only thing is the listing says 4 beds when it’s wasn’t it’s 1 queen bed in the room and one sofa bed in the living room had to buy a air mattress for a code worker Lisa called after and explained but it would be nice to actually know the exact description of the Airbnb travel workers travel in groups so we like our private space main reason to chose a Airbnb over a hotel overall everything was perfect!

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Lisa's place was exactly what I needed for my family. she was also very responsive and proactive when it came to any questions I may have had. It was a great place to stay in Frackville.
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Lisawas an absolutely amazing host. She makes you feel like family. She is always checking to be sure everything is meeting your expectations and is on top of communication with you. I even discussed extending my stay and maybe staying another time. I would highly recommend this host if you are traveling through the area.
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,My Fiancée and I stayed here while visiting family. We absolutely loved our stay at Casa Del! It was peaceful and comfortable and met all of our needs. Lisa was a great host!
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My first AirBNB stay and it was a very enjoyable experience, massively impressed with the quality for the price offered, pretty close to all our touring destinations as well! Lisa is also very friendly, and is more than happy to help with any questions provided."

She made sure my stay was perfect, frequently checking in, making sure I had everything I need for staying long term and even provided food for me! Her place is clean, quiet and great of your a night shift worker who needs to sleep during the day. The bedroom is so comfortable, quiet and dark. The living room is also very comfortable to hang out and lounge in. The kitchen is fully functional for cooking. The bathroom has all you need as well. I recommend staying here 100%, it made my 3 month stay comfortable while in the area for work."
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Lovely cozy spot. Nice kitchen and very clean!
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Spacious apartment equipped with everything you need for a long weekend! Having extra breakfast was a plus
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place is so quaint and easily accessible. The perfect apartment for my needs as a travel nurse. Lisa was super helpful my entire trip and her little abode was truly divine. I liked it so much I extended my stay! Definitely a must stay, again and again."
2022-10-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Lisa was very kind and accommodating. The house was very clean and she has great attention to detail. My wife stayed here as she completed clinicals for a medical program, and during her time she did report that the host had attempted to access the residence for various reasons on more than one occasion. It sounds as if intentions were good! just not something we were used to.
The upstairs neighbors are up all hours of the night and they have a lot of people in and out of the home. my wife returned from clinical and the police were at the upstairs unit residence due to an unknown issue, but after the police left there continued to be a lot of yelling and some sort of issue going on.
Besides the neighbors and access issues which made my wife feel uncomfortable, the stay met expectations and we used the location for several weeks as she completed her program."
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Lisa's attention to detail is welcoming. Music, electric fireplace, cleanliness, and nice fragrance greeted us upon entry. Would stay again. Pleasant experience."
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Lisa was sweet and friendly. She is very outgoing. She called and texted a lot, sometimes early morning or late night hours. Her intentions were good Check in is very late at 7pm and there's a $30 fee for early check in. Lisa controls the thermostat. She entered without the unit without permission. She means well but I like privacy. She shut air off and adjusted it up and down as she chose, despite my asking her to leave it at 71. She would shut it off when we weren't there. She would put holds on the thermostat so we couldn't adjust it."
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,excellent!
2022-09-01,3.0,Stayed one night,Parking could of been communicated better. Spots out front had meters that appear to not be working any more. Spots were to small for my truck which most people don’t have a problem with. Found a place out back in some grass to put my truck but was fearful of getting towed. Breakfast wasn’t advertised correctly. Items that were said to be there were not. Bed was not my preference and more pillows would of been nice. House is very clean and well kept.
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very clean and beautiful. The colors inside are very welcomingband cozy.
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Lisa is a warm and gracious host with a perfect amount of communication. Weary from a long drive in construction and traffic, we entered the apartment to find soothing music and cooling fans. A/C was perfect. Everything was clean and fresh. Although free breakfast food was available, we chose to experience the local diner down the street.
Truly a diamond in the north end of town which has seen better days, Lisa's place was perfect for visiting the Pioneer coal mine in Ashland and Knoebels in Elysberg."
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Wonderful host and great hospitality. I would definitely stay here again. Thanks Lisa.
2022-06-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"The listing is for the most part exactly what it says. The location was great for my reasons of being in Frackville. Free Breakfast was a bust due to low supply of stuff to cook but besides that it was beautiful. The apartment is spacious and very clean. I’ll most definitely be visiting again. Hopefully when the listing is at its normal price. If your reading this, this is a sign for you to book your stay here, you’ll have a blast."
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,great place. great value. the place is equipped with everything you need. Lisa is a great host. constantly checking in and ready to help. recommended
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,super kind person
2022-05-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,"CONS
Smell of the house
Noisy: upstairs neighbors and traffic outdoors
4 of the worst nights of sleep I’ve gotten, up all hours of the night
No cleaning supplies
No paper towels or towels in the kitchen, only a dirty wash cloth and used sponge
No disinfectants
Host called me twice at 10:30 p.m. and 9:30 a.m. just to check on how I was temperature wise
You aren’t allowed to change the temperature in the house without calling the host
No spare blanket
All the extra fees and up charges
The late check in time (which changed from 6 to 7 after booking, I had it in my trip notes)
Breakfast cereal was stale
No “free breakfast” for people with dietary restrictions
PROS
Really hot shower water and nice pressure
Nice sheets on the bed
Number of fans available to use
Square footage was large"
2022-05-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"Very clean and quiet first floor unit with easy parking just a short distance from I81. Breakfast offerings were Fruit Loops, eggs and butter in fridge and pancake mix. That’s it. Probably would not stay again as the late check-in time would not work for me under usual circumstances. Lisa was easy to reach by phone to answer questions. The rain shower did not work properly and the bathroom sink faucet leaked, but Lisa is aware and these will be fixed. Potentially a nice place to stay."
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"10/10 on all marks !!
I will highly recommend this listing to everyone I know coming to this area."
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"I'm a traveling night shift nurse. Lisa's place was perfect for my contract at Lehigh Schuylkill, 15 minutes from the hospital and quiet for sleeping during the day. Lisa was a very gracious host."

Anything we needed before, during, and after made us feel very welcomed and like family.

2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This space is great and Lisa is an attentive host! everything was all set up for us when we walked in the door. Frackville is a small town but we enjoyed exploring the surrounding area in Pottsville and Reading.

The amenities were squeaky clean. It was all that we expected and more! Thank you for the quick responses and always at our service. So sorry we weren’t able to see you.

2018-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,she was so kind & place was beautiful❤
2018-11-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Nice surprise in downtown Frackville. Bottom floor apartment on Lehigh Ave. There are two upstairs units which are permanent residents in this building. No noise could be heard from upstairs and plenty of free parking right out front. There is street noise mostly from truck traffic. Not a real issue as the bedroom is set back from the street. Place is nicely decorated and all amenities are provided for a comfortable stay.
The best parts about this rental might be the updated HVAC system and modern plumbing. It was cold and blustery outside but warm and comfy in the apartment. The water was hot and water pressure awesome. This is an old building so you can tell it had been completely updated. Also nice fast WiFi and multiple places to charge phone and laptop.
The unit is nicely decorated and clean. The location was perfect for me as I was staying alone to visit family and help out with my elderly parents. It’s easy walking distance to mostly all of Frackville and all of my relatives. If you forget anything Family Dollar is a 2 minute walk away. This end of town is looking a little shabby but inside the apartment is like a whole different world.
Thanks Lisa for a nice stay I hope to be back again!"

The space was completely refurbished with the most modern equipment, fixtures, kitchen, tv, and climate control. Lisa's communication was excellent- a response within minutes. The apartment is an extension of herself- it is a matter of pride and a major achievement in her life to be able to have the opportunity to host- a super kind person. Please do not hesitate to book this apartment for up to 4 person. The location is very convenient not only for staying in Frackville, but also for anywhere within a 10-15 mile radius. While our visit concentrated on Frackville, other towns such as Shenandoah, Mahanoy City, Ashland, St Clair, New Philadelphia, and even Pottsville a short drive away. Parking is right at the front door- the meters are not enforced any more. You can expect a super clean, well maintained apartment, very spacious living room with bigscreen TV, all the kitchen amenities and utensils you realistically need. Very new and well appointed bath room with shower. Everything literally sparkled spotless. Thank you so much! We will be back!!!"

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Emily's house was perfect. We were in town for a baseball tournament and decided to make it into a weekend. So glad that we did. Check in was seamless. The house has been completely renovated but kept such cute touches. All the bedrooms were nicely furnished and clean! Bathrooms were amazing, love the decorating.
Off-street parking was helpful and the covered back porch was perfect for sitting outside and enjoying the rain we got Saturday night.
The house is on a quiet street. It's close to the Yuengling Brewery and parking wasn't an issue on the weekend with the parking garage (free on weekends!).
For the weekend we ate at The Brickhouse in Orwigsburg (only a 15 min drive south), the Wooden Keg and the Little Brown Barrel. We also stopped for a drink at Pilger Ruh Brewery. Highly recommend all these.
If you are looking for a gorgeous, relaxing place to stay in or near Pottsville, you cannot go wrong with Emily's house!!"

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This fantastic Air BNB comes with only one caution,
Stair climbing is an absolute requirement!
EVERYTHING else is fantastic if your can easily manage the stairs. There were 4 adults, two preteens in our group. Everything we needed for our comfort was there. Emily and Braden are good examples of young adults making constructive use of their god given talents and strength!
The local history and of the area is fascinating.
We will definitely return if the opportunity presents itself, and we are still able to climb the stairs with ease. Thanks so much!"

The kitchen is super well-equipped, and it's equipped with nice stuff -- not old worn-out items. Emily was super helpful and friendly about check-in, and we enjoyed our stay overall. The only thing I would recommend would be blackout curtains for the bedrooms."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This home was SO beautifully renovated. The hosts kept so many wonderful original details while also bringing a more modern feel to the home. It is EXTREMELY clean, cozy and feels surprisingly spacious!
The surrounding area of Pottsville has SO much to explore. We stayed here for Spring Break and because it is so centrally located - it made checking out other areas (i.e. Reading Pagoda, Pulpit Rock, Yuengling Brewery, Sam Adams, etc an absolute breeze.
IMO the area around the home is nice and walkable - there is food/bev options within 1 mile with plenty of resting places / historical sites in between. Otherwise, it was VERY easy to find parking downtown between the ParkMobile app and the parking garage.
We can’t wait to visit again!"

2024-01-01,5.0,Group trip,Our stay at Carol was great. Beautiful home recently renovated. House is very modern. No issue with parking.

This is by far, the cleanest, nicest one we have been in at this price point -and better than a few much pricier. Great location, walk to Yuengling brewery tour, Roma Pizza, market etc. Enough room/seating/beds for the 7 of us. Modern kitchen and bathrooms were sparkling clean and spacious."
2023-10-01,5.0,Group trip,"I've worked in Pottsville for the greater portion of a year in the emergency department as a travel RN. I've stayed at multiple abnb and hotels nearby. NOTHING compares to this place. I shared the spot with my three friends and my wife, we all had enough room to spread out and be comfortably. You will not find a cleaner, well decorated, beautiful abnb in this town. You can feel the love the owners have of the place the second you walk inside. 10/10"

We will absolutely be using this location again."
2023-09-01,5.0,Group trip,"My family and I stayed at Emily's place for my little sister's wedding and felt right at home. The beds were comfortable and the kitchen had all the needs for us to enjoy take out. I loved the convenience of the SmartTvs and Emily responded immediately to all of my questions. The back porch area was beautiful and so relaxing to sit during the evening. As my family frequent Pottsville, this is definitely going to be a return spot for us."
2023-09-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"The home was beautifully renovated and comfortable. The communication from the hosts was excellent and they took plenty of care to make all steps in the rental clear and easy. Plenty of room for 4 full adults, with comfortable beds.

2023-08-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"Emily is a very good host. She was responsive even though we booked many months in advance. She was also responsive when it came a couple days away from our booking. She made sure to let me know that if at any point of the stay or before the stay I had any questions I could let her know. The home was very clean and matched the description.
One downside was the mattresses in two of the bedrooms were a little too hard and it didn't allow for a comfortable sleep and also left us with some back pain. The two twin size mattresses you could easily feel every spring, though I'm not sure children really mind. Another thing was the street the Airbnb was on and some surrounding streets didn't look so safe and made us all a little nervous at first but we didn't have any problems.
Overall we had a great stay and felt at home. We will definitely come stay here again!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,The interior was beautiful. It was really clean and felt cozy. The patio in the back was a great place to relax.
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Everything was wonderful! Emily was helpful and quick to respond. They did a great job updating the house! Lovely!
2023-08-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"This home is amazing. It is so comfortable and better than any hotel. The beds are comfortable and would be a five star place to stay if the outside atmosphere was better. I can see why the couple has invested and remodeled it. If you have something to do in the area I recommend it, especially for the incredible price. But don’t recommend it if you are going to have a vacation with exploring things in the area unfortunately."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Without a doubt A LOT of thought and detail went into this house. Emily has a keen eye for detail and art. I grew up in the area and am amazed at what she has done with this house. Comfy, cozy and inviting. A good stay for a short trip back home, so glad I found it. The town needs this type accommodation because the other choices are just not a choice at all........"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Beautiful home!
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"What a gem of a house! Our group was travelling from Germany for work and this was such a welcomed change from hotel rooms.
Beautifully decorated, super clean and modern and wonderfully comfortable. Easy check in and street parking and not far from restaurants etc.
Great stay and highly recommended"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I wasn't sure what to expect from this small town in eastern PA, but not only was the town adorable and friendly, but Emily's home is beautiful! My colleagues and I felt at home and comfortable. Take advantage of some of the amazing food in the area - we loved The Crimson House! I'm not contemplating a little weekend vacation there. If I take this step, I'll definitely seek out Emily's house again!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"great place to stay with family in northeast pa. Just loved our stay, beautiful house remodeled with a perfect mix of old and new! Thank you Emily and Braden for making our stay such a comfortable and relaxing experience."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"It’s 10/10 for me! I love how spacious it is and how clean it is! I am a germ freak type of person. So clean home is a must for me. Another thing that i love how easy check in and check out, you know how they usually have a long list to do before you check out, with this place i didn’t have to do much at all. Thank you so much. We will be back for sure."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The house was great for us--pet friendly and close to where we were going during the day. It is an older home which has been completely remodeled with an attractive decor and is comfortably furnished and very clean. It is in town, so a downside is there is only on-street parking. Hosts are very friendly and respond very quickly to messages."
2023-06-01,5.0,Group trip,"Upon entering, we found the Carol home to be extremely welcoming and clean. In fact, the pictures don't do the home justice in terms of how spacious it truly was. The seven of us were able to comfortably roam around the house and also have our own space when needed. Emily and Braden were so responsive throughout our time there-- thanks for a great, comfortable space & for their hospitality!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Group trip,Emily’s home is absolutely adorable! Very spacious for our family of 8! We enjoyed our stay and would definitely book again!

2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Just as described, great place to stay."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Emily’s place (The Century Home) was beautifully decorated, the cleanest house we have ever stayed in, every little detail was placed with so much thought, the appliances were excellent, this homeowner paid great attention to detail of what we needed, the restoration was phenomenal and we loved the book showing us the before after of the restoration process. The history of the town on the wall, the awesome games that we all played were fantastic, the outdoor balcony was very inviting and we used it a lot, TV’s all worked. Kudos to you Emily! Well done! We would stay here in a heart beat!
The only thing that was a little bit challenging was parking, but EVERYTHING EKSE WAS PERFECT SO IT NADE UP FOR IT."

2023-04-01,5.0,Group trip,"Picture perfect decor, cosmopolitan, comfortable and inspirational space!! Loved Emily and Brandon’s passion and quest for “saving the old homes” They did an amazing job from bathrooms to entry way to kitchen and back porch! Each bedroom comfortable and classy!!"

The master suite is large with an amazing spacious bathroom. We had the pleasure of meeting Emily and Braden who couldn’t be more helpful and accommodating. We will definitely return to hands down the best AirB&B ever!!!
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Very clean and tidy. We loved the home. Just be prepared to find parking
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I was coming into town with some coworkers for an event at Penn State Schuylkill and Emily’s place was a great choice for us to stay and get a good nights sleep the night before.

2023-02-01,5.0,Group trip,We came into town for a family event and the house was perfect for our extended family. Spacious; each room was well appointed and the living space and kitchens just what we needed for the various adult family members. The smart lock made it so easy for all of us who were arriving at different times from different directions. It was so nicely designed and so homey.
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Absolutely fantastic place and one of the best AirBnBs I've ever stayed in! Newly renovated and very comfortable. The host was very communicative and all instructions were very plain and simple. Would stay here again in a heartbeat!

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We had such a great stay at Theresa's studio apartment! Everything was well taken care of and any questions we had were quickly addresses by Theresa.

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We really enjoyed our 3 nights/ days. Artfully and tastefully decorated. Music was playing on a vintage radio upon arrival! Well stocked kitchen n touches of comfort (pillows, plush towels). Easy access, but necessary to climb full flight of stairs. It was just right for 2 ... relaxing, reading, Netflix binging and hanging out. Even though we had lots of rain while we were there, we loved it."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Comfortable studio with very nice amenities. Next to a nice Italian restaurant which we loved. Everything was very clean and orderly which would make it nice for a short or longer stay.

2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We loved our stay here! It was quiet, clean, and comfortable. Orwigsburg is a charming little town. We loved our hike on Hawk Mountain - a short drive away - and enjoyed the restaurants nearby which were a short walk from Theresa’s place. The bed is really comfortable and the shower was great. The place was very clean which I most appreciated. We didn’t use the kitchen but it was also very clean. The decor is nicely done."

2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Theresa‘s Studio was perfect for a night away.
We visited Hawk‘s Mountain & Jim Thorpe incl. the Lehigh Gorge State Park.
The town itself is small & quiet with pretty buildings. We loved our dinner at Di Maio‘s Mustard Seed.
The studio was very cozy on a cold winter‘s day, the bed & couch comfy, the shower warm & clean. It had a great kitchen area which we didn’t use. On a good day, we would have loved to use the balcony out back.
We brought our corgi and he had his own little corner. Perfect stay!"
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,we absolutely loved it here and plan on visiting again. It definitely felt like home away from home! best weekend getaway yet!
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Wonderful little apartment with all the amenities. Everything we needed was there and easy to find. Instructions for the home and WiFi were easy.

2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,My partner and I were visiting family in the area and picked Theresa's for our one-week stay. It was perfect for the little town and exactly as advertised. Nice little touches like a range of toiletries. Nearby Di Maio's restaurant was also a convenient food option for us. Our top pick for future visits to the area!
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Needed a place to stay for work. Theresa’s place was a 5 minute drive from where I needed to be. It was quiet, clean, and so cute! I got to meet Theresa’s lovely daughter, who also works in the salon below. I’d definitely recommend staying here! Thanks Theresa!"

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"This was the perfect stop for us in the middle of a long drive! Everything was super clean, cozy, and easy to find. Restaurant downstairs was perfect to grab dinner.

2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We stayed shortly for a funeral in another town so we did not spend any time in the town/airbnb other than to sleep and shower. We chose this airbnb for its price and proximity to Hamburg. It was cheaper than a hotel and way more quiet and decked out! We got in very late but Theresa had sent me clear instructions on how to get inside so getting in was very smooth. The door is very obvious and can't be missed. Plenty of roomy parking in front on the street. We did notice the apartment number was wrong on the listing but it didn't matter with such straight forward instructions. The place was very clean other than a few spiders but we understand its impossible to not have spiders in such an old wooded area. The water pressure was great and the furniture and electronics seemed pretty new. Theresa was very friendly in her messages and even offered to wash and ship back a rag we left behind. I'd definitely stay here again.
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"this was a fun place to stay. i would go there again, as well as recommend it to other travelers."

2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was a perfect location for our first trip to Pottsville. The apartment was comfortable and cozy, making us feel at home from the start. The easy parking and entry made for a seamless arrival and departure process. We enjoyed the open spaces and the generous amenities. We also appreciated the ability to walk to nearby restaurants and points of interest. Savas’ was so responsive to messages before and during our trip and his recommendations were spot on! He went above and beyond, quickly letting us know that we had left some items behind - yikes! - and arranging to get those back to us. We can’t thank you enough for a great stay!"

2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"the stay was great! it was what we we’re looking for- small, nice place to get away & stay at while we explored other areas. The apartment itself was perfect size and all accessories were available. the walls are thin, and it’s a busy town so definitely was a bit noisy in the morning. wasn’t a huge deal for us though and would definitely return!"

2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Awesome space, open roomy, good kitchen and comfortable bed.
We had a good time walking through the town during the day, there were coffee shops and restaurants close by, and people in the area were friendly. Town hall is close as well as a few churches; so you hear the lovely bells in the morning..
I would def stay again in the future."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,I would definitely recommend this awesome historic loft stay for anyone coming to the area! We did it as a stopover on our trip East and enjoyed walking to dinner and the local brewery. 10/10 would recommend.
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Space was upscale and trendy. Nice blend of modern features/amenities and old school historical chic. 10/10 would recommend. Quite frankly I will be looking forward to staying here again next time we visit.
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Inspirational space
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Loftsville was a wonderful stay! Very homey and right around the corner from a neat brewery. The loft was super cozy and we loved the upstairs! Nice shower head too. Stairs may not be suitable for young children or elderly. Food in the area is fantastic and many recommendations are provided by the host. Thank you!!
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great place to stay, very nice and clean!!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Savas was able to quickly accommodate our needs and was a great host. It felt just like home and had great views and everything we needed . Anytime we are back we are staying with Savas and Loftsville ! Thank you
2023-07-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,"If you need a place to stay in town, I’d bet this is the nicest!
I needed to work remotely and this was a perfect space for that. Fast and reliable internet. Parking was easy to find, although in a highly trafficked parking lot. Shower was solid. All the stuff I’m always looking for was there.
I needed this stay last-second on a holiday, and Savas made sure to communicate everything super quickly. So helpful.
Savas was also very helpful during a weird situation I found myself in. Went out of their way to overcommunicate and try to help out. Great host! Just keep your eyes peeled and don’t ignore anything weird things you may see or hear - trust your gut."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Loved it
2023-06-01,3.0,Stayed one night,"Savas was a great and communicative host. The place looks exactly like the pictures and has everything you could possibly need and more. However, you would be surprised to find such a great place given the surroundings. The houses next door are dilapidated and abandoned, and out of the front window is a parking lot and a tall defunct building. The walls are pretty thin and you can hear most of what’s going on, which can be pretty inconvenient given the place is in the center of town. There are also a lot of drug addicts wandering around the parking lot and street next door, which makes getting in feel a bit unsafe. There is an amazing taco spot a block away though, which has amazing food and drinks!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We were very happy with Savas's loft. It was very clean, reasonably priced and exactly where we wanted to be: in the heart of Pottsville. Lots 'o steps but that wasn't an issue for us. Parking was directly across from the front door and access was easy. A great view of the Yuengling Brewery from the front window. The loft oozes with history. Just a few recommendations for Savas--since we are height-challenged a small step stool would have helped us in reaching the dishes on the open shelving and a microwave would have been nice. An extension cord to use for phone charging near the bed at night would have been helpful, too. There was some noise on when the bars closed on the Friday night we stayed, but nothing a set of ear plugs couldn't fix and it was very short-lived. The loft is very close to several good restaurant options. We absolutely recommend Savas's loft!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We loved Savas’s place. It was very charming and beautiful and cool. The town is cute and the parking is great! Easy check in, great local restaurants, all walkable. We would definitely stay again!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My wife and wanted to get away for our anniversary and found this place. The loft was just as described and was very convenient for taking the Yuengling tour. We also went to the Lavender Hill Farm and Hawks Sanctuary since they were nearby. For a quick weekend getaway, I would definitely recommend it."
2023-06-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Looked just like the photos. Lots of recommendations for things to do and places to eat.
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Absolutely beautiful home! We were looking for somewhere to stay in the area for a night and after being unhappy with the hotel selection, we were beyond pleased to find this gem. Loftsville has everything you'll need during your stay plus more! It is evident Savas takes great pride in what he does."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Another great stay at Loftsville! My family loves the location, ease of parking, and the cleanliness and convenience of the Loft. Thanks again for a great stay!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Savas was a great host, place looked like the pictures, very clean, organized, everything anyone would need for the stay, helpful with any questions, very quick to respond, I highly recommend to anyone wether their stay is just for a night to a couple weeks."

2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great stay and host!
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Easy check-in, parking permit included for lot within feet of the door. In the heart of downtown, within blocks of entertainment and good restaurants. Cool rooftop view of Yuengling brewery and the city skyline. Note there are steps to second floor kitchen/living room, and steps from there to loft bedroom and bathroom. Worth the walks up and down."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This is a delightful little gem right in the heart of Pottsville. We were able to walk to the things we wanted to do, but we also enjoyed relaxing and listening to music in the living area . The bedroom is especially charming and waking up Sunday morning to the sunlight streaming in and the church bells ringing was a perfect way to start the day."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Perfect place to stop for the night! My boyfriend and I really enjoyed it!
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Great place!! Has everything you need there and very clean, exactly like the pictures. Perfect location if you’re visiting yuengling brewery.

2023-04-01,4.0,Stayed one night,Very good place
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is a unique and spacious place. It sits on a well traveled street in Pottsville, but yet it feels very private because the living room is on the 2nd floor above the garage, and the bedroom is on the 3rd floor. The character of the building further adds to the comfortable feeling of this well maintained space. This is a gem!"
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I am from the area and stayed at Savas’ place as a change of pace while visiting family. Savas’ space was exactly as described and conveniently located in downtown Pottsville, close to good restaurants and a coffee shop (Pressed) that looked like it was out of NYC. Savas was very responsive and helpful during the stay, as well. I would definitely stay at his place again!"
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great place right in the center of Pottsville with super easy parking included! Can walk anywhere. Neat three-story layout, comfortable bed, and loved the aesthetic with all the exposed brick."

2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Lovely, convenient, comfortable."
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This was our first time staying at Loftsville, but I know it won’t be our last. The location was perfect with super easy walks to at least four good restaurants and a coffee shop. We really appreciated the included parking permit for the adjacent lot.
The loft was just as pictured and the furniture, linens, and appliances were all spotless and in good working order. We had a late night check in, but Savas was still readily responsive when we reached out, and had the air mattress set up and ready for us so we could all just fall into bed right away.
Loved the clean and modern space with thoughtful touches! Thanks so much, Savas, for the great stay!"

2022-12-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"In life, sometimes mishaps occur, but it's how those mishaps are handled that speaks to the quality of the people involved. In our case, when we checked into Savas's place it had only been half cleaned. We messaged Savas on the Airbnb app and he responded immediately. He contacted the cleaning person and within 5 minutes they were there to finish cleaning. Savas also volunteered to refund our full payment, which was very generous. My husband and I thought a full refund was unnecessary so Savas refunded the first night's stay. Savas is clearly very dedicated to customer satisfaction and I was really impressed with the speed of his response and his very evident care and concern that everything should be right. I highly recommend staying at Savas' place for this reason, he is an excellent host."
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Such a cute little place! It is right off the main street and you can walk to a ton of resultants. It’s a great space to get some work done or to have a little night away. I will be back for sure!

2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place is so very cool, convenient, comfortable, and thoughtful. Clean, stylish, and catering to our needs. I’m from Pottsville originally - been gone 35 years - and loved seeing and experiencing the new downtown hot spots. This apartment is convenient to all of Pottsville’s historical and other attractions. My bro in law said it was originally a tobacco factory. Go and check out your theory on its history. The history is still there, but so is a great living space for a visit. Thanks Savas!"

The apartment was gorgeous with the history well preserved and we had a great time guessing about what it used to be. The bed was super comfy, and the place was spotless. So many kitchen gadgets that I wish we had time to use! We especially appreciated the use of the washing machine. It’s within walking distance to all of downtown (however we were there on a Sunday night so not much was open) and parking was super easy. I recommend this spot to anyone!"

2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place is great! The bedroom with the lights, exposed beams, and bricks is really nice.

Responsive and helpful host! We would stay again, without a doubt. 👍"

2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Everything was better than the photos. Just a lovely find for a work trip.
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This is a clean and very special, beautiful historical lodging that's been tastefully renovated. My husband and I were comfortable and able to relax for the last night of our long trip. The living room and kitchen area had everything we needed. Love the original artwork!
The bed was comfy. We're always grateful for a king-size bed, which the loft has. We're medium-size people who can't share anything smaller as we're very light sleepers.
If you, too, are a light sleeper, I recommend bringing a white noise fan (we travel with two, which we ran). The awesomeness of the town-center location means street noise is audible from the bedroom. Fortunately, it's a relatively quiet town. On the Saturday night we were there, things quieted down early, and the last gunning car engine of the night happened just after we turned off the lights.
If light interferes with your sleep, bring a sleep mask. The bedroom does not get completely dark with all the curtains pulled closed.
The town seemed worth taking time to explore. We wished could have arrived earlier, toured the Yuengling brewery, and taken the self-guided walk around town our hosts left us a map for."
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Place was ad advertised and then some! It was clean and very homey! It was very easy to walk around and explore the town. There was also a $10 gift card to Wheel restaurant. Would recommend 100%

2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was a great place to stay for our quick weekend trip. The loft was very clean and comfortable. The surrounding neighborhood wasn’t too loud at night, couple of good places to eat but was neat to drive around and see the old parts of central PA. Overall, a great experience and would recommend 10/10."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The perfect place to stay if you want to walk around town! My husband and I celebrated our 2nd year anniversary here and it was everything and more than we expected.
2024-06-01,5.0,Group trip,"This place was gorgeous! As soon an my friends and I walked in we were all in awe. It feels like you're spending the night in a museum in the bedt way.

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The house was clean, and I loved the decor. Everywhere we looked there was another fun item to see.

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place was very immaculate and in some ways reminded us of house that would be in New Orleans. Definitely loved the high ceilings and the back patio was perfect for a nice small get together. This place reminded us of not just being a base of operations for the weekend, but a home away from home. Very convenient and walkable to downtown. If we ever need to return, I will definitely look to see if this place is available again."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Amber left lots of little “notes “around the space which were extremely helpful for working the different amenities, appliances in the house. If you are a history buff, you will really enjoy this stay!"

2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Such a unique and wonderful place to stay. A feast for the eyes and senses. Great antiques and artwork throughout as well as bits about the local history which is a lot of fun. Part bnb, part museum!! The outdoor areas (including a screened in dining room and garden) are beautiful and unique. Bedrooms are comfortable and filled with more little “treasures” to appreciate. I loved the bathrooms and shower/bathtub was perfect to refresh after our travels. Neighborhood is terrific with the oldest brewery in the country, historic homes and a nearby cafe/bookstore we really enjoyed. I can’t wait to stay again."

The fusion of history and meticulous attention to detail, coupled with Emily's outstanding hospitality, made ""The Charles"" a gem in the world of AirBnB. A truly magical and distinctive retreat that I wholeheartedly recommend."

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Edward was very helpful and his place was just right. Beautifully located, good parking, and he was very responsive when I had questions. If I’m ever in the area, I will certainly stay there again."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Edward’s place was exactly as described and the location couldn’t have been more perfect since I was there for the Lager Jogger weekend. Every place we wanted to visit was in easy walking distance. We parked the car on Friday and didn’t use it again until we checked out. Even though this location is in town, it was surprisingly quiet. The house was very clean and had all the amenities we needed. Would definitely stay here again!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is my second stay here and I feel the listing is contemporary and secure. I travel to see family and want a quiet, secure, clean and comfortable space.

2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Place was great it’s surprised me but I paid for what is was worth great price as well I’ll stay again if I choose to come back
2023-12-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"Worth the price paid. I'm from the area and only needed a room for the night, and it served that purpose. However, the tenant above woke me up around 5a and banged around for an hour, stomping heavily and seemingly dropping heavy items. Could not fall back asleep. Also, lacks basic amenities I've come to expect, e.g. soap and shampoo/conditioner that wasn't left by previous guests."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Edward was a great host and provided a lot of great suggestions. Apartment was as advertised and clean. Great spot for a long term stay
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Great stay in Pottsville, PA -- it was a quick overnight stay but Edward's home was perfect for what we were looking for. The first level apartment was comfortable for two people. His recommendations were great and we took advantage of many of them."

The lack of free parking was a nuisance, but we knew that when we booked the place, and it was easy enough to plan ahead. There are some nice stores and restaurants within walking distance, although we didn't have much time to explore. Overall, it was a fast, easy stay, and we really appreciated having a host that was so helpful."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Nice place
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Within walking distance of local attractions! Felt right at home as soon as you walked in. Clean. Host gave great recommendations.

Check-in instructions were posted a bit late but didnt matter for us as we were not arriving until much later."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Was perfect for us to enjoy a stress free weekend! This was our second time staying at this unit, so it was very easy to get unpacked and go do the fun things we wanted to do and familiar enough to fall asleep easily. We travel a lot and find it hard to fall asleep in a strange place the first night. Recommendations from Edward are always helpful. We look forward to our next visit!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Edward was very responsive and kind. He explained everything in detail and gave recommendations on where to eat and what to do.
This is a great little apartment for 2 people. Very clean and exactly as described in the photos and listing. Seems like it might be noisy due to the location but it’s actually very quiet and relaxing. I already booked again for my next trip!"
2023-08-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Very nice space, great host. The AC was very loud but it definitely cooled the whole apartment down other than that no complaints at all."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Beautiful Airbnb apartment in downtown area with lots of nice touches inside and everything you could need for a visit. Liked the walkability to local pub and restaurants. Did not like the mess of being in the middle of road construction but that should be short-lived. Parking is metered so be prepared to pay Mon-Fri 9 to 5 to park near the unit. Owner was very responsive and made lots of good suggestions for places to eat in the area.
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,.
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The place was a well-kept apartment close to restaurants, including a great Mexican place called Tres that was less than a block away. The apartment was clean and the bed was comfortable. Check-in was easy and the list of recommendations for places to eat was really helpful. We will keep it in mind for any future trips to the area."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Our stay at Edwards air bnb was wonderful! He gave us great food recommendations that we were glad we checked out. Accommodations were very comfy and homey!

Lol Absolutely go there and enjoy the amazing food and service! We will definitely come back to visit PA again!
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Everything was perfect. I especially am grateful for Edward to allow me check in early. I arrived in town earlier than expected and that was really nice of him to let me in.
Had a very nice time and it’s a place that I would come again and stay at. Also Thank you for the chocolates!"

2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"We traveled 30+ hours from Sydney, Australia to Pottsville to visit family. We ended up booking Edward's place to stay as it was close to town and within walkable distance to everything in town. The AirBnB was bigger than expected as well as very clean and updated. There are so many good restaurants and cafes in the area. We loved Pressed Coffee!
The only downfall is the Pottsville Parking Authority is ruthless on this street. We are not from the country, so we did not have the parking app. Eventually, we figured it out and had to switch App stores to download it, but it was extremely buggy and sometimes did not work which led to us getting a parking ticket. Be aware of making sure that you keep up your parking time on the app!
Overall, we had a great stay! The value and cleanliness were so worth it. We will definitely be back!"

2022-07-01,3.0,Stayed one night,We had to leave less than an hour after checking in.

My husband made omelettes and I even found a peeler when putting a salad together. Bed was comfortable and the shower nice and hot. Parking fees were reasonable to me. I really appreciated the salt/pepper and especially the powdered creamer and stevia in the raw!!! I had forgotten mine.

2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Edward’s place was the perfect location at which to stay in Pottsville. It was central and within walking distance to everything we needed to enjoy a night in town. The apartment was one of the cleanest AirBnBs I’ve been in. It was cozy and the bed was very comfortable. Parking was very easy to figure out. Parking is free weekends (after 5pm on Friday). We chose to pay for a few hours on Friday (1pm - 5pm) and only paid $3.80, which was worth it to have the car right outside the patio steps. I think what really made this AirBnB stand out is that Edward is a very attentive host. He sent us very detailed instructions for accessing the building, parking, and some really GREAT recommendations. While we stayed here, we walked to the Yuengling brewery for a tour (very impressive by the way), we ate at Wheel for build your own grilled cheese (they are very diet/allergy friendly, which was very helpful to us), and the next morning we had some great coffee and breakfast (eggwrap/crepe) at Pressed. Thank you Edward - you made our stay in Pottsville very enjoyable!"

Edward was detailed in his messages about what’s in town and the realness is so appreciated. Only small downside was the shower is pretty smaller than usual, but that’s not much of a big deal. Would totally recommend this place and come back whenever!"

2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Edward‘s cozy Pottsville spot is perfect! It’s spotless & an ample amount of room for two people. He & his wife are so accommodating. My husband & I were in town for a family wedding & Edward even made sure that the window AC unit was installed for us so we wouldn’t be too hot while getting ready for the wedding. It’s located near everything you can think of needing or wanting. I highly recommend Edward’s place. We will definitely be staying there next time we visit home!!!
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This place is very clean & comfortable
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The pictures don't do this place justice. Their is a patio off the street with its own entrance, there is also a backyard that has a grassy area. This was perfect for 1 person or a couple. Everything was brand new and they did a really good job renovating the interior. Was blown away for the price i paid."
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I stayed during a work trip, and enjoyed being able to get to the local breweries and restaurants on foot. The apartment is incredibly clean and well-appointed, I slept well, and communications with Edward were very quick and helpful. He accommodated a last-minute change to my reservation as my work ended earlier than expected, and it was much appreciated. I hope to stay again when I'm in the area."

2024-06-01,5.0,Group trip,"What a wonderful place to get peace and quiet. The house is absolutely amazing! We were in town for a memorial, from Virginia. I could not have chosen a better place to stay. The decor was first rate, the house was clean and inviting. the host, Jairus was just a text away and super flexible. Some of the group just wanted to live there after taking in all the attention to details. The beds were comfortable, the master even had an adjustable bed. The Master shower was amazing. The back patio was a place to be morning and night, so clean and plenty of seating choices. Landscaping was amazing! Supplies like paper towels, TP & other consumables were available, which was a life saver a few times. the hot tub for those who used it was an added relaxation option. Saw lots of wildlife. Just a great place all around. So much good to tell you but not enough space. Thank you for such a wonderful creation! Hope to come back under different circumstances. Well done, Jairus, well done."
2024-06-01,5.0,Group trip,Jairus was very friendly and responsive. His space was perfect for our family’s weekend getaway. The house was clean and welcoming. Ample space to accommodate everyone in our group.

2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This stay was fantastic. Myself and girlfriend came for a little weekend valentines getaway. The house is absolutely beautiful and matched the photos.

2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"My friends and I drove out for kozairs Christmas village and we wanted to stay in a nice place I picked this place and couldn’t be happier.
when you get up the driveway and see this place prepare to be blown away it’s beautiful! Not just that but it’s like something out of a magazine. Every room is perfectly decorated the gameroom is my favorite room in the house but the kitchen is beautiful I don’t know what the beds are made out of but it was the best night sleep I got in a long time
It’s a beautiful home an we are already planning our next year trip to stay in this beautiful house"

2023-11-01,5.0,Group trip,"My group had a fantastic time at the Farmhouse secrets. It is very private and perfect for a relaxing getaway. The house is very modern and has beautiful decor. Two fire places kept us nice and cozy, as well as the many blankets we were provided. The house has a cozy, rustic feel and sits on a beautiful patch of land that had an amazing view thanks to the outdoor balcony. We would love to come back soon!"
2023-11-01,5.0,Group trip,this place was absolutely gorgeous and felt like right at home. never had an airbnb this amazing in my life.
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Jairus is an awesome host ! Super easy going and friendly ! Will definetely be booking again in the future .
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great place..great neighborhood..and you can taste test Colan's tasty beers
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Great value for such a unique, great place! The apartment was as described, and we felt comfortable and at home. We arrived late on a Sunday, so there wasn't much open, but it was in close proximity to shops and places. It's a really nice place. Thanks!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great place to stay and explore Pottsville, felt right home. The brewery below was also a cool vibe and everyone was friendly."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Had a great stay at Conlan's place. The rooms were nice and clean when we arrived. The bar below us was a bit loud o. the days they were open, but not super disruptive. Some nice restaurants and stores within walking distance. Overall a fantastic stay!!"
2024-06-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"A few lights outside to main door and the upstairs apartment door would have helped. The locks were slightly difficult to both open and close without pulling on the door handles/pushing the door closed.
Maybe add a pull out bed in the living room space to allow for larger families."
2024-04-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,The location was good and convenient for my stay. Everything was as described.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great place and host
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Conlan’s place was perfect for our stay in Pottsville. The apartment was as described, spacious and tidy. And can’t beat the location in the centre of town with a brewery downstairs! Conlan was quick to respond and very friendly. We would definitely stay here again."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Conlan’s place was larger than we expected. He met us in front of the place and told us how to get in. It was great to have a place to stay that was right in town. My husband and I slept like a log. Our friend in the smaller bedroom said she could hear the music from the bar below. My husband and I would stay there again. We liked the convenience that we parked the car and walked to everything.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Super easy stay in a peaceful town, perfect for a fun lively place to stay after a day of hiking around the areas !!
Great host, always responsive and considerate!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Enjoyed my stay, had plenty of food options near by and the place was exactly as advertised, would definitely stay there again!"
2024-04-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"A friend and I were in town for an event and Conlan's place suited us well. We were disappointed that his brewery wasn't open the two nights of our visit - we were looking forward to checking the place out .... and having a beverage or two.
Conlan was very communicative and helpful in guiding us to some other options, there is not a big selection of restaurants or pubs nearby but he did point us to some good alternatives.
Also - might just have been lucky, but I parked right in front of the apartment while we were there. I couldn't figure out the parking app, maybe it doesn't work well on android, but didn't get any tickets.
If I am back in the area, wouldn't hesitate to stay here again !"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great location to a very walk-able town center.
The apartment is basic, but has everything you need."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Had a great time and it was worth the stay
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Perfect place and location in Pottsville.
Rooms located above brewery.
Conlan was great and responsive.
Definitely would stay at that location again….."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We loved conlans place and will definitely be returning!
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Conlan was a wonderful host and his place was perfect. Large, spacious, well appointed, and right in the center of town. Street parking was easy to find and super simple to manage. Would highly recommend and hope to stay again soon!"
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Our Night at The Brewery was terrific 🔥 Thank you so much for the opportunity Conlan! Great communication, smooth check in, and the location couldn’t have been better for hearing a favorite band downstairs in the Top Shelf Pilger Ruh Brewery 🍻 Highly recommend 😎 Thanks again for everything Conlan, appreciate you 💯 Until next time ✌🏻"
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great place to stay and very friendly. Looking forward to booking again!
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great place and great brewery too. Thanks Conlan!
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Perfect location for us to visit Yeungling Brewery and Pilger Ruh Brewery.
Great places to eat and view within walking distance. His place is very well kept and very clean. The place is a lot bigger than we expected. Great communication with the host. We are very thankful for this awesome experience."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Conlan was very accommodating and responsive. The location was close to great dining experiences, and we enjoyed the beer and live music at the brewery. It was perfect for what we were looking for. We would definitely revisit!"
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great space to enjoy downtown Pottsville
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Very accommodating and responsive host. Great location. Was perfect for what we needed, close to great food. Beer downstairs was great, walkable to everything we wanted to experience. I’d go back for sure if we’re in the area again."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Owner was friendly and easy to deal with
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great spot and great host!
2023-11-01,2.0,Stayed a few nights,"Conlan's place is a nice, well appointed apartment. We had an issue with the loud music and noise from the bar below. If you want to be asleep before 10pm, this place likely will not work for you."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Everything was clean and nice. I was there on a Saturday night when there was music downstairs. It was hardly noticeable. Big kitchen, dining room, and living room. Very nice place with easy check in."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Awesome
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place! Super easy to work with! Worth every penny.
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,great place right down town!
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Conlan's place is a great value and Conlan is extremely friendly. The fact that it is right above Pilger Ruh Brewing is great. The live music is only until 10:30 to 11 and it closes at midnight so it won't stop you from getting a good nights sleep. Would highly recommend staying here.
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,revisited!
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Highly recommend this place. Perfect location, centrally located to everything we were doing. We were able to walk almost everywhere. You pay for street parking til 5pm Mon-Fri (easily done on parking app and very inexpensive) but free on weekends. Apartment had all of the comforts of home. Conlan was very responsive to any/all questions that we had. Apartment is directly above the Pilger Ruh Brewery so you will hear music/people especially the weekend, but not too late, it wasn’t bad at all. Stop downstairs for a drink or two. You won’t be disappointed. Would definitely stay here again."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"""A Night at The Brewery"" was perfect. Accommodations were just right for my teenage son, husband, and me. The noise from the brewery/bar downstairs is loud in the apartment (to be expected), but things get quiet in the late evening. The kitchen is stocked with everything you need. There were menus provided for many great, local dining options. Everything was very clean and accessible. The location is perfect for easy walking to many great local attractions. We loved our stay and plan to come back and stay at Conlan's again soon!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,A night at the brewery is a great apartment above a local brewery. Was clean & honestly better than the apartment I live in. If I could live here instead of my place I would. Plus extremely convenient having a brewery right below you.
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Loved our stay at the brewery! Spacious, clean apartment. Great location, Conlan was very responsive and helpful."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Couldn't have asked for a better place to stay, Conlan even went as far as to 'baby proof' a bit for us. The apartment was perfect, and felt like home for the weekend. If you need a place to stay in the Pottsville area, this is the place !"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I enjoyed my stay, I am a beer guy so staying above the Brewery was a definite plus. Street parking was never an issue and it was centrally located for my needs. The apartment was clean and well maintained for the age of the building. I would stay here again if I am in this area."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Had a wonderful night at the Brewery. Cool place. Great time
2023-08-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"Just stayed for one night, but was the perfect location, near many Pottsville activities - walking distance to the Yeungling Brewery and near several restaurants. Music/noise from the bar/brewery was quiet by 10:30-11pm (and we stayed a Saturday night). Very comfortable. Window A/C unit in the bedroom was great for sleeping. Wifi is public and was slow at times. Would definitely stay again when visiting!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great little place over the brewery. There were live bands downstairs one night I was there but they were wrapped up by 11:30.
2023-07-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,No central air / Bathroom small
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Much larger than anticipated. My boys loved the PS4. Great location for what we needed. Conlan was great! Brewery downstairs was super fun and variety of beers!
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Love the location, and the brewery has a great selection of beers. The staff is excellent and the vibe is friendly."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Conlan was very responsive. The place was huge., parking was fine and although above a bar it was quiet at a reasonable hour. We really only had 2 comments. The Wifi was not working which meant no cable/tv. As we really only slept there that wasn't a huge issue and we were able to connect and stream through public wifi in the bedroom. Hopefully he can resolve that. The last issue is no air conditioning. In Conlans defense this is an older building with oversized windows, so it is probably difficult to accommodate a window unit and cost prohibitive for central. He did have ceiling fans and a box fan, and we were ok, but if it would've been hotter, it might have been a challenge to sleep. Other than those 2 small things, it was a great place and I highly recommend staying with Conlan."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Conlan's Airbnb was a fantastic stay and I enjoyed every second! The apartment was quite large and was right in the middle of downtown Pottsville, so it was within easy walking distance of the Yuengling brewery and many other local bars and restaurants. The greatest aspect was by far the Pilger Ruh brewery just underneath the apartment which had delicious beer and great live music. If you are spending a night in Pottsville I can't recommend this stay enough!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We only stayed for one night, the place was very clean and met our expectations. Beds were very comfortable. There wasn't any available street parking in front of the place when we got there, but there was a parking garage nearby that was free. If you're into craft beers check out the brewery downstairs, great selection, and there was a really good pizza place right around the corner. The brewery did have live music the night we stayed and they went on til 11 pm. That didn't bother us at all but just be aware that if you want to go to bed earlier, you will hear everything from downstairs. The host was very responsive to all our needs."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Conlan was a great host only downside was the lack of internet and central air but he was very helpful to make us comfortable great area would highly recommend
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Everything was great, thanks!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I took a little risk taking lodgings on top of a small craft brewery. I was pleasantly surprised that it was not that noisy and the hours were quite limited and did not interfere with sleep. The apartment was spacious, clean and discreet right in the downtown area of a small mountain city in Pennsylvania. I enjoyed my stay. Also, thank you for pointing out Ken’s Garage which fixed the hole in my tire very quickly and at a reasonable price."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Conlan's place was very nice would definitely stay again.
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Nice place, right above brewery and located downtown. Good if you like beer like I do. It is above a bar, so if you want complete silent solitude, this probably isn’t the place for you."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Nice place, cool town"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My friends and I go on a couple long weekend ATV trips every year. We chose The Stone Barndominium for it's open floor plan, gaming area downstairs and private outdoor space. The kitchen is a little small but we cooked all our meals outdoors under the covered patio on the side of the home. We spent nights outside and downstairs playing pool and shuffle board. The landlord is very responsive and accommodating. This seems to be a newer property that was crafted with a lot of detail. Before you go, download and create an account on the Sonos app. The speaker system is both inside and outside. It's about a 25 mins ride to FRO so it wasn't terrible. Would stay there again. Beautiful property."
2024-04-01,5.0,Group trip,Great location and layout for what we needed. The place is well kept and accommodating inside and out. Landon/host is quick to respond to any questions. This was my second stay there. Great time just like the last.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,As I looked around the place with my boyfriend we realized how there were pictures of the place from how it used to look. We loved that there was character from when the barn was used for horses. We loved the space in the barn and how it could be used for a wedding reception. We might plan on renting this place out once every 2 years or so. It was a very neat experience to share with family and close friends.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Wonderful stay!
2024-02-01,5.0,Group trip,"Every year a group of us get together for a weekend of cards, games, eating and drinking. The Barn was perfect and we will definitely return. The group varies from 5-8 and the Barn can comfortably host groups of that size.
It is an absolutely beautiful space and was clearly restored with a great deal of care. Everything about it was just cool. The open layout is framed by hand hewn timbers and sleeping lofts at each end over looking the action below. Functional barn doors and barrels add to the charm.
The bar/game room maintains the atmosphere with its rock walls and multiple heavy wooden doors to the outside. We love shuffleboard, so that was a big draw. Two bathrooms in the barroom, no waiting!
I will caution anyone considering the Barn to make sure you understand the sleeping situation. The lofts and Murphy beds are not private rooms. We knew this, and for 5 middle aged guys it is not an issue, but I am sure some for some it would not be ideal."
2024-02-01,5.0,Group trip,"Pictures and this review will not do justice to describe how beautifully of an experience we had! Love this barn and the improvisation of the indoors, the sound settings, basement, the bathrooms, -the barn itself was a dream! Our pre wedding weekend with friends and family was perfect here! Landon was worried about power outages but w didn’t have any issues ! This has just inspired me to book more of his properties! Check them out guys! The aesthetic of this place made it perfect."
2024-02-01,5.0,Group trip,This beautiful home met all of our needs and more! We had a great time staying in this house and it had all the amenities that we were looking for. We are hoping to book this place again in the future. Highly recommend this beautifully restored barn.
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Always a fun time at the Barn and surrounding area.
2024-01-01,5.0,Group trip,Landon was so helpful throughout the whole process. The place was absolutely gorgeous and I hopefully can come back during the summer!
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Incredible clean place. Highly recommend. There’s nothing like it
2023-12-01,5.0,Group trip,My brother wanted a woodsy feel for his birthday vacation so we found the barndominium. The barn is spacious inside and out. You are anywhere from 15-20 min out from restaurants and stores. The neighbors are quiet and friendly. All of the amenities worked and there are attractions not too far away for adults but also for kids. If you go online and lookup the town they will tell you everything that they do for that season or year round. Landon couldn’t have been more helpful when I asked any questions and his response time was fantastic. Everyone is wondering when we are coming back!
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We had the most magical Christmas and amazing time at the Barndominium. Landon is an amazing host, easy to get a hold of and is extremely welcoming. The moment you walk in you are in awe of your surroundings. Everything feels so warm, homey and welcoming. As you walk around you find so many other cool features to appreciate. We loved the nice open feel of the house… everyone had their own
space but there’s also a feeling of togetherness no matter where you go. The basement with the pool table and shuffle board brought so much fun and laughter to our crowd. If you do come across any items you forgot from home, there is a grocery store moments down the road and a Dollar General even closer. We would 100% stay here again."
2023-12-01,5.0,Group trip,"Fantastic from start to finish. Our group was equally wowed by the barndominium and cannot wait to find another excuse to go back! The location is great - we were 15 mins away from Hawk Mountain and Pulpit Rock (both great places to hike with beautiful views). It was such a memorable trip and a huge thank you to Landon for being such a proactive, informative and responsive host. Highly recommend!!"
2023-12-01,5.0,Group trip,Awesome place to stay.
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Wow! What a gem! Perfect for our multi family weekend getaway. The place was spacious and accommodating for our young children. It did lack privacy for our babies but overall it was a super fun ‘camp out’ atmosphere. The barn was so interesting and we really enjoyed all its beauty. We are already talking about planning another trip soon.
2023-11-01,5.0,Group trip,"This is hands down the greatest Airbnb I've ever stayed at. Everyone on the trip was blown away by the property. Plenty of space for large groups in sofa, beds, parking, rooms. The basement is amazing with all the games. Perfect location, great price,great host. Cannot complain in the slightest."
2023-11-01,5.0,Group trip,"the place was amazing. we had 8 guys and it worked out great, plenty of space. the game room down stairs was awesome. the host is extremely responsive, gave us recommendations for things to do in the area and was great to work with. I highly recommend this place especially if you are looking to hit up Rausch Creek or Aoaa off road parks. we had 3 trucks with trailers and fit all vehicles fine in the drive way. Will definitely be back next trip."
2023-10-01,5.0,Group trip,"Beautiful rustic accommodations, perfect for four couples that needed a weekend getaway. We look forward to spending another weekend."
2023-10-01,5.0,Group trip,"Great place, exactly what we were looking for. Clean, roomy and everything was in good working order. Landon was easy to reach and responsive when questions arise. Hopefully we get a chance to visit it again in the near future."
2023-10-01,5.0,Group trip,"Our family was in town from Florida for a wedding in Harrisburg. The Barndominium provided us such a unique experience. We loved it! Words that come to mind are very spacious with a cozy feel! Rustic and beautifully appointed! We opened up the barn doors and enjoyed the outdoors, indoors. We had so much fun in the bar/gameroom. We roasted hotdogs on the grill, watched football in the living area and had a big family breakfast at the dining table. We highly recommend this big beautiful barn! We also enjoyed and recommend Marchiano Pizza in New Ringgold and hiking at Hawk Mountain."
2023-09-01,5.0,Group trip,"Another great stay, thanks!!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,A beautiful property with tremendous charm. Landon was extremely responsive.
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We had a great time there with my family. The space is very big and clutter-free. If you have small kids, there are gates to each stairway, which is awesome. Relatively clean place. The surroundings are nice and peaceful. The weather was great when we went. It's up in the mountains away from city noise. The host is very friendly and responsive. They communicated well. The Catina is a very good restaurant to eat at."
2023-08-01,4.0,Group trip,"Enjoyed this unique space. Very comfortable beds and furniture.Easily accommodated 9 of us but there are a number of simple improvements that would enhance the experience. We knew there was no dishwasher so brought paper plates.Also sent a message to Landon about the other specifics.
If you are in this part of the world and want a unique experience with a group of close friends or family it is a fun place to stay."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,The place was beautiful the pictures don’t do it justice it’s was amazing!
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"spectacular building, awesome rural location. highly recommended"
2023-07-01,5.0,Group trip,"Even though there is little auditory privacy within the Barndominium, we enjoyed our stay. We could lay in bed and say good night to each other like the Waltons (old TV show reference). It was a perfect gathering place for our family reunion. We enjoyed the open space within the barn and surrounding grounds. We also appreciated that there was absolutely no clutter within the space. The barn is beautifully finished."
2023-07-01,5.0,Group trip,Fantastic and unique place that made for a memorable weekend. Very pleased with our stay! Landon was an excellent host.
2023-06-01,5.0,Group trip,Place is exactly as describe and in great condition.
2023-05-01,5.0,Group trip,"The Stone Barndominium exceeded all our expectations! It was absolutely stunning! Very spacious, clean and perfect for hosting. We were getting married at a nearby venue and used this amazing space for our rehearsal dinner! It was perfect! The large open space was great for everyone to be together but plenty of room to spread out! We had a perfect night and could open the barn doors for easy indoor/outdoor space. The basement was a great entertaining space with the bar, pool table, shuffle board table and corn hole. Everyone was wowed! My bridesmaids and I stayed the night and everyone was comfortable. Plenty of bathrooms to get ready in the morning. We are local to the area and were blown away to find this beautiful property so close to home. We will definitely be back! Landon was very attentive and helpful with any of our needs. Overall great experience, 5 stars!!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Group trip,"The place was very unique and beautiful. It also was nice to see pictures of what the barn used to look like.
The decor, the speakers through out the property, the game room, the multiple bathrooms, and all the open space made this a great place to stay.
The place was in pristine condition and very clean and well themed.
If I am ever in the area again I would definitely stay there again."
2023-04-01,5.0,Group trip,Great stay!
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Staying at the barn is an experience in itself. We rode ATV and dirt bikes at the Famous Reading Outdoors which is 30 mins away. That’s why we rented this place.
Everything inside was immaculate. Loved the open floor plan, lighting, speakers, game room and outdoor fire pit. Host was very responsive."
2023-03-01,5.0,Group trip,Fantastic place for large groups to meet up. Me and a group of friends stayed here for a long weekend of gaming and are already planning a trip for next year.
2023-03-01,5.0,Group trip,"Absolutely stunning! We really enjoyed our stay at the barn. Perfect for a weekend getaway. This barn is a ""must see"" with its spacious layout, cozy sitting areas, down stairs bar/game room and great outdoor space. We only had one little issue with the oven and after contacting the host, it was resolved immediately. After seeing old pictures of this barn (and speaking with the owner), you realize how much time and effort went into making it so incredible and unique. I highly recommend the Barndominium to anyone looking for a unique place to stay in the Auburn area. We will definitely be back!"
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We had a fantastic long weekend with a group of friends and kids. The barn was such a unique space and perfect for relaxing with families and kids, who had a blast on the lofts and playing outside in the creek. The owner had thoughtfully installed retractable baby gates at the tops of stairs, and all of the furniture was comfortable and stylish, while being functional for the space. You can immediately feel the love and attention that went into restoring and converting the barn, and it was surprisingly cozy for being such a big open space. We are already talking about coming back in the summer!"
2023-02-01,5.0,Group trip,Amazing place and the host is super nice and helpful
2023-01-01,5.0,Group trip,"We had a great stay at the Bardominium. The space is massive and really well done inside. It's the perfect space for a group - lots of space for activities including the downstairs bar / game room and the fire pit outside.
Location is great as well - it's in a quiet part of the area, but a relatively short drive to town if you need groceries or want to go out for a meal.
Landon, our host, was very responsive - generally replying within minutes of sending a message both before and during the stay. Instructions were very clear, and we felt like if there was anything we needed we could reach out.
Highly recommended, especially for a group trip"
2023-01-01,5.0,Group trip,"We went for a girls weekend and had a great time. The place was open, spacious and a really cool change from a hotel or typical house. The game room was fun and the place was unique."
2023-01-01,5.0,Group trip,"Booked this location for a semi-annual reunion with friends. Absolutely amazing! We have always chosen a new location for every get together. During our farewells, it was unanimously decided that we will be revisiting this property. Cannot recommend enough."
2023-01-01,5.0,Group trip,"My family and I really enjoyed staying at Landon's for new years. The barn was warm, had tons of room for fun inside the house in addition to a sonos sound system and great game space downstairs. I am a pool player and thoroughly enjoyed the table! Landon was very responsive and proactive communicating before / during our stay. There wasn't a dishwasher so recommend paper plates/solo cups to save yourself constant hassle. Not a ton to do in the local area but if you are looking for a spacious fun retreat with your family / friends, this is a great pick at a great price."
2022-12-01,5.0,Group trip,"Even though the pictures were beautiful, opening the door to the barndominium took our breath away. The space was huge yet cozy, warm and beautiful. Upholstered furniture was all clean and in like new condition. Linens were nice, crisp and white. Showers has beautifully scented, full size body wash, shampoo and conditioner. The heat works so well that we had to turn it down so it wasn’t too hot to sleep upstairs. We played in the adjoining files, made s’mores by the fire pit. We didn’t center far because the living space was a great place for the whole family to congregate. The kids loved the games in the basement. Highly recommend!"
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"The place far exceeds what any listing could try to depict. This house is GORGEOUS! the interior is absolutely breath taking all with custom finishes and so much charm. House is kid friendly and has locking baby gates which came in handy since we had 2 small kids with us. SO CLEAN, and also has a full kitchen with ample dishes and cookware.
Basement was fun with a bar and a pool table/shuffleboard table and everything was In incredible working order. Host was super friendly and responded quickly with any questions we had.
This place is super close to Cabela’s, so there is a decent amount of stuff near by. We would absolutely stay there again and would be a place to stay in the summer time. Looking forward to another trip in the future!"
2022-11-01,5.0,Group trip,The place was amazing! Me and my fiancé enjoyed our special day.
2022-11-01,5.0,Group trip,This is definitely a place you’d want to return to. Far enough away but still close to good food and things to do. The fire pit was great and the openness inside and out was perfect! Great find and fantastic service!
2022-11-01,5.0,Group trip,Beautiful Barn! We loved our stay there!
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The Stone Barndominium is amazing and looks just like the listing. All our guests LOVED it and had an amazing time! The location is great, secluded and quiet, but still just minutes away from stores and restaurants.
The pool table, shuffleboard table, and whole property stereo system made this place a blast!! The kitchen was well stocked and the 5 bathrooms were more than enough!
We barely drove away, and we were already planning a return trip next year!!
Landon is a great host and will be looking at his amazing properties in the future!!
Note: It IS a barn, you may see a bug or a cobweb here and there, this should be expected, but this was the cleanest barn I was ever in ;) and the bathrooms, kitchen, and beds were all very clean."
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Superb interior decor!!! Perfect for a slumber party. Huge huge HUGE space! So open. Fire pit was a great touch as well. Highly recommend, definitely coming back again."
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The Barndominium was beautiful! We stayed for my sons birthday and we all had such a blast! Gorgeous property, great location! Stay in the autumn-you won’t be disappointed! 🍂🍁"
2022-10-01,5.0,Group trip,Great place to stay at!
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Cannot give a higher recommendation!! Incredible place, very clean, super responsive. Fantastic across the board!"
2022-09-01,5.0,Group trip,"Overall, we had a wonderful stay. I would definitely recommend this place as a peaceful getaway and enjoy returning.
The barn is absolutely beautiful! Every location within the building offers a unique view. In some ways, I think the space looks better in person.
I would advise considering the open floor plan when thinking of group dynamics. While the sleeping areas are separated by partitions and curtains, there is more than plenty of space to spread out - outside, in the basement and main level.
The speakers in and outside of the barn are a good touch. The firepit is a considerable size. The stones that surround the pit insulate the heat, so consider bringing a little extra firewood if you want to stay warm while the fire is going.
Landon replied quickly to my inquiries. The code to enter the barn did not work when we arrived, but the issue was resolved within a reasonable amount of time. We were given local recommendations. Folino Estate Winery was on the list and did not disappoint. The only downside was the oven did not work during our stay. Again, Landon was quick to reply, however, there was never a final word from the owner on the matter.
Great experience! :-)"
2022-08-01,5.0,Group trip,Once in a lifetime.
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Verry nice
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We were in town for a family funeral so needed somewhere to lay our heads after a long day. Jonathan’s place fit our needs perfectly. Communication with Jonathan was spot on. He left coffee for us, creamer and beer in the fridge and said to help ourselves to whatever we needed. Beds were comfortable. Shower had strong water pressure. We are all under 60 and the steep stairs were not an issue for us but for some older or infirm guests this home may not work for you."
2024-06-01,5.0,Group trip,"Everything was great, and as listed."
2024-06-01,5.0,Group trip,Thank you for such a wonderful and relaxing stay. Everything was great and I would recommend the Hill House to anyone visiting Pottsville.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Quiet, quaint place that was easily accessible to the wedding venue we were attending. You must have a SUV or truck to use the parking space (which was disclosed by Jonathan) but there is a convenient parking garage across the street. Spacious accommodations and clean linens which were easily located. Everyone loved the spa shower head in the full bath. No issues of running out of hot water with a crowd of 6! One set of stairs are a bit steep for smaller children but they could easily walk up & down the other set. Would definitely stay again!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Hill House is a lovely historic house. It was great reading about the history of the house. There is a lot to do in and around Pottsville and this is central and an easy in & out of town.
Loved how walkable it was to restaurants and the very good Pressed coffee shop.
Would definitely stay at Hill House again!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was great base for visiting the Pottsville area, very convenient, being 2 blocks away from the Yuengling brewery was a bonus too! Great okeaces to eat that are also walkable from Hill House. The house was comfortable and a great place for family to come bavk and chill after a day exploring. We will stay again the next time we are in the area."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place !!!
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The house was just as described and was clean and welcoming! Jonathan was very responsive and was very helpful! The location is great and there is a lot to do within walking distance. If ever in the area again, I would definitely stay there again!"

2024-03-01,5.0,Group trip,"We loved staying at Jonathan’s house in Pottsville for a weekend getaway to Yuengling! Great location, walkable & the home was well kept, well stocked & looked exactly like the photos - he even had a bottle of wine waiting for us, and was so responsive!"
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"I visit Pottsville regularly and I know right where I will be staying from here on out! Perfect location, you can walk to everything and it’s plenty of space! I can see why it’s the first on the list!"
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Jonathan was an amazing host. Very responsive and helpful. The Hill House was exactly as described. Very cozy and beautiful old home. Lots of charm. The home was immaculate and very inviting. Very clean. Jonathan communicated wonderfully. We were able to check in early and he allowed us to check out late due to unexpected snow fall in Pottsville. We would absolutely stay here again and would certainly recommend this location to others.
One thing I will note, which has nothing to do with the host or the home and is only mentioned for awareness, is that some of the restaurants/pub/breweries in the area have closed. As of our stay (Feb. 16/17, 2024), the Tres Restaurant, Black Rock Brewpub and The Park Tavern & Grille (as of 2/17) have closed. One other thing to consider is that Pilger Ruh Brewing does not serve food, but you can bring food into the brewpub (disclaimer - we were there on a Friday. Not sure if this is different on Saturday/Sunday).
Very highly recommended!"
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Jon is an amazing host! He is very responsive and friendly. Great house with great food nearby. House was very clean.

We would be happy to stay again if we are ever in the area!"
2024-01-01,5.0,Group trip,"We loved our stay. The home was so cute and had great history. We felt very at home. It was great having a place for our family to stay all together under one roof.
Jonathan was a great host, helpful and quick to answer all questions.
The location was perfect for walking downtown for shopping, eating and for church on the weekend. Parking was close and easy.
We will definitely stay here again."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,I grew up in Pottsville so I am familiar with the area but still enjoyed Jonathan’s write up on the house history and the area. I have stayed at many air bnbs and Jonathan was one of the best hosts ever. Super responsive and helpful. He even left us a fantastic gift basket. An amenity had been stolen by a previous guest and he dropped off a replacement within a few hours on Xmas eve of all nights. The house is very spacious and nice. Thumbs up all the way around. We will be back when visiting the area. Thanks again
2023-12-01,5.0,Group trip,"Our second stay at Jonathan’s- and loved it just as much as the first time!

Highly recommend this location if you're looking to stay in the area."

2023-11-01,5.0,Group trip,"Hill House was centrally located to so many amenities, yet private at the same time. Jonathan recommended places to go and they were spot on. We had such great food and a fun time checking out a quaint town. It is clear Jonathan takes pride in Hill House and Pottsville. He was friendly and thoughtful!"
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We had a great stay at Johnathans townhouse in Pottsville, i only wishes we could have stayed longer! We came to town to visit Yuengling brewery as that is my husbands beer, but we had just as much fun hanging put in the townhome. Very historic place, well kept and very comfortable. The place is just a dive minute wLk to yuengling and also to several bars and another brewery we hit up after our tour. I am extremely impressed by how responsive Jonathan is. Answering my questions all week long . Would defintely stay here again."
2023-10-01,5.0,Group trip,"Jonathan was an incredible and extremely accommodating host! His house was absolutely perfect for what my friend group wanted to do. The Yuengling Brewery was a 5 minute walk as well other local bars/restaurants that were walkable distances. If you are looking to visit the Yuengling Brewery, I highly recommend you book Jonathan’s place."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This is an older home with lots of character, and it was better than we even expected. Jonathan was EXTREMELY responsive and helpful. He even left our favorite beer in the fridge for arrival! We would definitely stay again."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This is a nice, historic home that is clean and comfortable, and has space for several guests. The full bath is small, but clean and adequate. We didn’t prep meals, but the kitchen is very clean and suitable for cooking. The other living spaces allow plenty of room to relax. Jonathan is a very attentive host and anxious to please his guests. He made sure to let us know that he was available if we needed anything for our comfort or convenience.
I can recommend this house and Jonathan without any hesitation."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,The Hill House was perfect and fit all our needs for the weekend. Johnathon was a great host and very accommodating. He responded immediately to all my questions. We felt right at home and it was easy parking in the garage across the street. I would definitely stay here again.
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"What a charming, old time home and great location. A short walk to the Yuengling Brewery and to the Pottsville ""Main st"" where we had a great dinner at Crimson. Wish we had more time to check out everything this small town USA has to offer. Jonathon was very good at communicating everything we needed in a timely manner."

2023-07-01,5.0,Group trip,"Jonathan’s place was the perfect stay! It was exactly as described, extremely clean, and Jonathan as a host was responsive and kind. Would recommend this stay to anyone!"
2023-07-01,4.0,Group trip,Very nice historic home with comfortable furnishings and plenty of space. The only negative is parking - a free community parking garage was available after 5 and on weekends but weekdays during the day is was either pricey to park or a distance to walk. The home was spacious and had many amenities in case you forgot something - the kitchen was also well stocked with utensils and cooking equipment.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Jonathan's house was great. Unique old house in an unique town. Would definitely stay here again when traveling through PA!
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Jonathan was a great host. Very helpful with suggestions and recommendations. It’s a big place so I would recommend to anyone looking to stay with a large group but a small group is good too!
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a lovely stay at Jonathan's place, the apartment is much bigger than it looks in the photos. Parking across the street is much easier than anticipated once you figure out the app and bonus points for being able to charge my EV in the parking garage."
2023-07-01,5.0,Group trip,"After several days hiking the Appalachian Trail, my trail family sought refuge, relaxation, and restoration at this historic home.

2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Jonathan's house was a gem! We loved the two staircases (just like my husband's grandmothers house in Long Island) and the uncovered fireplace in the living room and kitchen. Plenty of info on the area was available. Would stay there again!
2023-06-01,5.0,Group trip,"A clean good stay and affordable. A walkable town with a lot of history. Jonathan was very communicative and it was very easy to check in. He left information about the area and also what we need to do concerning the place. After his instructions, we did not have to call him for anything.

2023-06-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"Great deal, nice space. Enjoyed the historic appeal and location to family. Parking garage literally next door, brightly lit and felt safe. Only suggestion would be more furniture in living space. Tv ran a bit slow (with 3 kiddos can be a bit of a drag haha)but we enjoyed the space. Definitely worth the value and would stay again. Jonathon responsive and attentive."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great stay! I loved the binder full of history of the house as well as great recommendations for the area. The house was clean and had everything we needed.
2023-05-01,5.0,Group trip,Jonathan’s airbnb was a great stay. We loved the included amenities and little bonuses as well. Loved that there was no wild chore list. The full bath upstairs was nice and we all really liked the shower!! The AC worked well and we enjoyed our time here. Jonathan even proactively let us know that the space would be available early without us even asking! Thanks!!!
,,,"Be sure to check out the Google ""street view."" before renting this place. Lisa has worked hard to update this old downtown duplex, but it doesn't fit the description of a ""high end executive Villa."""
