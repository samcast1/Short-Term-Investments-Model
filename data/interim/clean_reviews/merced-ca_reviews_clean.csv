2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"the house was easy to find. The neighborhood looks nice and tidy and is quiet. The car can be parked well on the street/parking in front of the house. Entering through the keypad works fine. The house is beautiful, tidy and clean. All in all, a nice stay to be and privacy is guaranteed."
2024-06-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,"Overall the place is great, it gets the job done. The inside of the place was very neat and clean which is always a good indicator. We did have a few things that made us not give it a 5 star. For example, the tv wasn’t working at all our entire stay. The thermostat wasn’t working either which sucked a lot because Merced is super hot already! There wasn’t a trash can in the kitchen which would be an easy fix of course but overall it got the job done."

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very nice and quiet neighborhood. Kemi Paul responded quickly when I had questions. I was at Merced to help my son (which is a student at UC Merced) move. The space was just as described and the pictures showed and what I needed. I will definitively stay again when at Merced.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Our stay was everything we hoped it would be. The place was incredibly clean and cozy. Our host was great at communicating and making sure we had everything we needed during our stay! I would absolutely stay here again.

2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very nice stay! My boyfriend and I loved it!
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I was in town to visit my family for the holidays, but their house was a bit crowded with everyone over. Having a getaway in town was much needed and this was the perfect place! I really felt cozy and at home. The decor was relaxing and inviting. Hosts were so responsive and helpful. I hope this location is available for my next visit. 10/10 would book again!"
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Very nice place. Loved the park nearby
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,Paul is an excellent host. We stay for 3 months and have zero complains.
2022-05-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"I've never been to Merced before but if I was to travel to the area again, this place would be my go to! Great location right next to the park in a quite neighborhood."
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,I enjoyed my two month stay at this location. The hosts were quick to respond to any questions or concerns that I may have had. The unit was modern and had an amazingly comfortable bed! The washer and dryer in the unit was an added plus. The neighborhood felt safe since my work shift ended at night. I will definitely stay there again when I travel to Merced in the future.
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Loved my stay here! Kemi & Paul are fantastic hosts and extremely accommodating. A few highlights about the space: a very comfy bed and couch, a lot of natural light, and a whole washer and dryer. 10/10 would recommend!"
2022-01-01,4.0,Stayed about a week,"Besides having to clean out the fridge, freezer and pantry from past due food, some rotted and eaten food. It was a fabulous stay. Nice quiet area. We really enjoyed staying there. Kemi and Paul were quick to resolve all problems/questions we had. Brought us a coffee maker and hair blow dryer right away because we couldn’t find any at all. They are very very nice people. We would highly recommend this place if anyone is visiting Merced or Atwater or need a place to stay in that area. We would go back to this place again if it’s just me and the husband visiting. Thank you Kemi and Paul!!"
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"This Airbnb truly wowed me and met my standard of living away from home. The house was spic and span once I arrived and everything is there that you need to make you feel comfortable. Although, I never met them in person, the host was very responsive to any concerns that I had. If the city wasn't so boring and if they had more hospitals to choose from to work I would have extended my contract mainly bc of the convenience of my housing. This house/apt helped me get thru being away from home and away from my family and friends. You won't regret reserving a spot with them!"
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Kemi & Paul were the absolute best host. Their place was nothing less than AWESOME & AMAZING. Perfect location, plenty of parking and very clean. I would recommend staying at Kemi & Paul’s spot to any and everyone. My next visit to Merced, California I’ll be staying at Kemi & Paul’s if it available."
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"A spacious attached apartment in a beautiful walkable neighborhood. I felt very safe as a solo female traveler. The WiFi is very fast for remote working video calls. As others have mentioned, you definitely hear people in the house but it wasn’t a bother and the hosts are respectful of quiet hours. Appreciated having a washer and dryer to use. Yosemite and Pinnacles National Parks are about 1.5-2 hours away, worked great for long day trips."
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"I had a very pleasant stay at Kemi and Pail’s place. It’s a great neighborhood with a park near by. Their place is nicely furnished and well kept. All the appliances are newer, including a washer and dryer. I very happy that I stayed there and recommend it to anyone."
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Great place to stay! Super fast internet and quite private
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Book it. Before the pandemic, I traveled a lot. I have never seen a place as spic and span as this completely mother-in-law unit attached to the main house. This is a standard of cleanliness that is a cut above. I don’t think of Merced --where I went to Junior College—as a romantic destination. Many will be there to visit family as I was or for something related to the University. This accommodation was absolutely perfect and completely self-contained. The appliances all look like they were delivered yesterday, so new are they. Although it was 96 degrees outside, the unit has central air and ceiling fans and I remained comfortably cool the entire time. It has its own private entrance which is easily accessed without the necessity of keys through a numeric key pad. Other reviewers have mentioned ambient sounds from the host family in the main house. No question. At times you will hear signs of life from next door including the indistinct voice of a child. If you are here for a honeymoon getaway, this may not be your cup of tea. However, when it counts —when it’s time to wind down for bed and throughout the night— this place is as quiet as a tomb. You are unlikely to find a more quiet place for when it counts. There is a delightful little park 60 seconds away and the entire neighborhood is a quiet and safe oasis. Single women traveling will especially appreciate this aspect. Although in a newer and non-central part of town, that, for me, we as desirable for its peace and tranquility. You will have a car and can quickly get anywhere in this small town you care to go. The hosts could not have been kinder or more responsive. Make sure you open the hallway closest as I did not until five minutes before I left. Brand new washer/dryer for you inside with enough soap etc for a single wash (so bring some laundry supplies with you). I am so glad that I chose this accommodation and am pleased that I in a small way supported a fine, working family rather than a distant corporation by staying in motel row. This felt more like a house than a hotel room as it is quite large."
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great clean place in a nice newish neighborhood. The place is spacious and perfect for a business trip.
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,Awesome hosts
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful home, and amazing hosts super quick in every which way."
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Kemi and Paul's place was one of the cleanest apartments I've stayed at and made for a very comfortable stay. Communication was very prompt and easy. I would definitely recommend staying in their flat if you are in the area.
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Second time here and it was perfect. Great location & very clean!
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,Had a really nice stay here! Internet is very fast for working remote. Very quiet and safe neighborhood with a park across the street. Yosemite is just over an hour and half away! Kemi and Paul are great and very responsive.
2021-03-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Great experience, easy to access, and a lot of room available. What I needed the most was a TV to hook my computer so I could attend to a virtual seminar and Kemi and Paul have a very nice TV, also the table on the living room and the rug helped a lot to take notes from the seminar. Thank you so much, I would stay there again in another trip."
2021-02-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"This guest suite is exactly as advertised and was a perfect choice for my solo trip. The space was incredibly clean with modern features. All check-in instructions were clear. The neighborhood is newly developed, quiet, and close to grocery stores, restaurants, and Yosemite Lake. I would definitely stay here again."
2021-01-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,Thanks for hosting!
2021-01-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"This place is great. Every little detail is taken care of. Very thoughtful and it feels very homey. The color palette of the space is earthy, so it’s calming :) I appreciate the L shaped couch, the big closet space, the press...I could go on 😄 The space is private. The neighborhood is safe and clean. There’s also a park nearby, so you can walk around the neighborhood. I didn’t get a chance to meet the hosts but they seem kind and hospitable. Seems like they love hosting people and want the experience of the person who stays here to be a good one. Thanks, Kemi and Paul!"
2020-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Thank you!
2020-10-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"Kemi & Paul’s place was great! Just what was needed for an extended stay. They were always quick to respond when there was a question, and their guest home was very comfortable and clean!"
2020-10-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"We stayed in this space for a month. The apartment was modern, clean and in a nice neighborhood next to a park. I reached out to Kemi and Paul a couple times with questions and they were prompt and helpful each time. The desk in the bedroom was a nice touch that allowed us to get work done, and the living room couch was super comfy. We also appreciated that there was plenty of street parking available right in front of the house. Overall we had a great stay!"
2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"Kemi & Paul’s place was great and it was super
clean. We had our private entrance and it felt private. The community is just beautiful, safe and had a huge park as well. Kemi & Paul were quick and helpful. Nicest people :) I would definitely stay there again in the future, lot's of restaurants and grocery store near by. I recommend everyone to try Emtea (Boba)."
2020-07-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"Our stay at Kemi & Paul's place was great. We even spent the 4th of July there and got to set off fireworks outside. :) The place was so nice & clean and had everything we needed to have a lovely stay. There is a manmade lake nearby with swimming and kayaking which was our favorite thing to do while we were there, especially with the 100 degree heat in the summer! We would happily book again if in the area. Thank you again to an awesome host duo!"
2020-05-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Kemi and Paul's Airbnb was wonderful. The neighborhood looks new, and is peaceful, safe, and quiet. There is a large neighborhood park across the street and plenty of street parking. The space itself was very private, comfortable, and tastefully decorated. The bed was comfortable, the fridge and microwave were large and clean, and they even provided some small appliances (hot plate and coffee maker). There is also a very nice, late model private washer and dryer which were a huge bonus for us. This was not only very convenient, but so much cleaner and more effective than a laundromat. Everything was very clean.
Another reviewer mentioned hearing a child in the main unit. It's true that if you require total silence in your living space, you should be aware that this is unit is part of their house so you may occasionally hear the normal sounds of life through the walls. Overall our experience was very private and quiet.
Thank you Kemi and Paul!"
2020-05-01,4.0,Stayed over a week,Great place. The set up is very cute & comfortable. I would only point out that the walls are very thin and you can hear everything. Overall it was a nice.
2020-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Kemi & Pauls apartment was cozy, stylish, & very clean. It’s attached to their home, but has a private entrance and it felt private. We never heard them and they were quick and helpful to answer my questions. I would definitely stay there again in the future, lot’s of restaurants and grocery store near by."
2020-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The place was spotless , very comfortable environment, would definitely book again ."
2020-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Very nice and new private suite in a quiet neighborhood. Owners are just a wall away, so you can hear their young child when he is home from school. Would definitely stay here again and highly recommend. Much better than a hotel!"
2020-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great comfy home very beautiful and private best in Merced 5 stars
2020-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Another fantastic stay at Kemi & Paul's place in Merced. Their place is perfect for a single or couple traveling. Easy parking right in front of their house. Such a better option than renting a hotel room. Thanks Kemi & Paul!
2020-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Convenient and clean with easy access
2020-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I loved staying at Kemi & Paul's place. Its very private, brand new (probably built within the last 2 years) & super clean. Easy to access and a very quiet neighborhood. Its a perfect location for a single or couple traveling in the area. I would highly recommend their space."
2020-02-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"The place was very clean, spacious, and modern. The neighborhood felt safe and the check in/out process was easy to follow. Parking was not hard to find, but the parking curb was a bit tight. The owner’s responded fast and gave a lot of privacy. Only complaint is that the owner’s kids were loud in the morning. Everytime I tried to go back to sleep, I could hear screaming and shouting. This is why I knocked one star off."
2020-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Really nice place!
2020-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I've now stayed here a few times, and will happily do so again in the future. Great hosts."

2020-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place was very clean, spacious, and all new. The entire apartment was new with a private washing machine and dryer. Easy check in and out and prompt response when we needed anything. Quiet neighborhood but does have limited parking. This was the perfect Airbnb experience. Walk in closet and large bathroom. Kitchen with a full size refrigerator was a big plus. Will stay here again. Definitely recommended."

The owners have big plans; I would recommend this booking to anyone."

2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Excellent Stay with Marcus. House was immaculate and exactly what my family needed. I would recommend this place for sure and when I come to visit family again this home will be at the top of my list. Accommodations for my family of 6 worked out perfectly especially after a long drive from Utah.
2023-10-01,5.0,Group trip,great place to stay
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,This was the second time I stayed here. Great place!!
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Marcus' house is awesome! Lot of space, rooms are big with nice bathrooms. Kitchen is clean and comfort.
It's easy to find his house, neighborhood is also nice, peaceful and overall surrounding of the house is great!
Beds are big and comfort!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Marcus was very attentive, organized and hospitable. The home is very clean and well-appointed in a quiet, safe neighborhood.
He had beverages awaiting us and K-cups for the Keurig in the morning.
If this relative had another event in that area, we would ask to stay with Marcus again."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Very clean and well maintained. The property seemed recently renovated and there were nice updates like no touch soap and trash barrels, remote controlled blinds, and smart dimmers.
Marcus and Amara were very responsive and welcomed us with a nice note and welcome basket.
The home is in a quiet area. We could read by the pool and be to downtown Merced restaurants within 6-8 minutes, and Modesto is about 40-45 minutes. Also very central to UC Merced for anyone visiting the campus.
The home was spacious and we were able to keep our luggage stored and out of the way. A true home experience with timely landscaping and pool maintenance. Great linens, comfortable beds, and furniture.
Would highly recommend to anyone looking for a quiet, well-appointed home experience that is still central to Merced attractions or a moderate ride to Yosemite, etc."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"My wife, myself and our two frenchies Leeloo and Zoe were in Merced to visit my inlaws and decided to book this house as it was less than 2 miles to thier house and had a pool. Upon arrival check in was extremely seamless and when walking in we immediately noticed how clean the home smelled and how neat and tidy it was.
There are instructions on how to use all the smarthome features mounted in little frames throughout the house which we thought was very cool and helpful.
The kitchen had all we need to cook a nice meal, and the weber kettle grill came in handy to grill up some steaks by the pool.
The pool was very clean, and Target is not far from the home. They had the pool toys we needed!
Overall we highly recommend this home for anyone looking for a little getaway and is visiting Merced.
Well be back for sure!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This location was perfect. It was in a great neighborhood and the pool was great for such warm weather. The house was very luxurious and the hosting was amazing.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Marcus is a great host. I’ve stayed here 2 times and will in the future as well if I’m ever in the area.
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Very nice house , super expectations, my children really enjoyed the swimming pool .
everything is very modern , Marcus is very kind. I leave us a bottle of wine and a welcome letter.
The cleanliness is impeccable, it is located in a very secure neighborhood and access to many shops , the beds are very comfortable , everything is very nice, very good stay."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Marcus walked us through the whole process exceedingly well and made our stay during my son’s engagement a memorable one. The house was very homely, clean and neatly maintained with many modern amenities. Kitchen, bed rooms, living room and bath rooms were crispy clean. Sheets were fresh. Baths were stocked as mentioned. Linen and towels were clean. The place is reasonably priced and is in a nice safe neighborhood. It’s accessible to many grocery stores and pharmacies.
The pool was nice and welcoming but we had no time to use it. Maintenance personnel were around and it was mentioned ahead so we knew it. We didn’t feel much intruded. Marcus was very accessible at every step and we truly didn’t have any issues after checkin. The best part was finding a welcome note with a bottle of wine waiting for us 🥰! We are totally sold and will HIGHLY recommend this place to stay. All our future visits are going to be here, more so with new family here. Giving a 10 out of 5 stars ⭐️ !!

2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"My family (two parents with two adult children) needed a place to stay in Merced because of a family event nearby. Marcus' place suited us perfectly - we were very very comfortable and spent a quiet, peaceful night before our event the next day. We appreciated the book Marcus put together with information about restaurants and attractions in the immediate area. We weren't able to use all the amenities such as the pool or barbeque area - but these looked very inviting and if we were in the area during the warmer months we would certainly have taken advantage of those things! A few notable items: the pillows and towels were especially soft and luxurious; the kitchen was well supplied for basic breakfast preparation; the heating and lighting worked very well and we got the place warmed up quickly on a cold evening."

Thank you Marcus for the nice note and wonderful bottle of wine! Decorative touches throughout the house provided for a very warm and cozy stay. The rooms were beautifully decorated and the house was spacious, comfortable, and modern. It is a wonderful home, perfect for a family vacation.

2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,So let me start off by saying I have used Airbnb for years and never had an issue this last year I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder type 1 and severe anxiety attacks that lead to seizures my husband and I decided to get a service dog to alert me before an attack we decided to take a family vacation to start of the new year somewhere new and fun and thank god for Marcus because every other host either told me I couldn’t stay or I would be charged extra cleaning fees because of my service dog I was starting to feel very discouraged and ashamed of my disability I decided to ask one more place which was Marcus’s beautiful home and wow he literally made me cry when he answered me back within 5 min of messaging him that he would love to have us and my service dog with no problem and waived the pet fee any questions or concerns I had was answered promptly and at late hours he was still responsive he let us check in early his home was beautiful and clean and he even had a dog bowl set up for Olaf he talked with us and even helped us bring our bags in he understood my disability and was accommodating In every way after dealing with hosts who have made me embarrassed and ashamed of my disability it was truly heartwarming and I am even crying as I write this review because Marcus truly made our family vacation possible and the best way to bring in the new year thank you Marcus we can not wait to come back

2021-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Awsome stay, ive stayed here before an will do it again!"
2021-04-01,5.0,Group trip,"The stay was very nice and homey. Wish we were able to use the pool but got back to the house late so we skipped on it. Marcus was very fast to respond (texted each other) and was there when I needed. The only suggestion that I would have is maybe add some blinds. I'm used to having blinds in the house, this one has blinds in the front of the house and in the bedrooms. The back yard and the bathrooms lacked blinds but other than that no issues with the stay. It has a nice glass table that seats 8 (but we didn't use). Where is located is a little weird, the street doesn't have stop signs so just drive slow and be careful when coming in and out of the neighborhood. The fridge is large and can store a good amount of stuff inside. He also supplied some soda, water bottles, and a bottle of wine for our stay. We will definitely be planning on coming back more often in the future because my in-laws live in Merced."
2021-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"My 2 night stay to relax and get away was amazing at this house. First off I was a tad bit iffy about staying somewhere without a type of refund in the post, (I've stayed at many Airbnb's I'm a Healthcare Worker) but for this place, there is no need for a refund. The house is beautiful, roomy, and furnishings are right what was needed. I already knew how to use a smart house, I have one too, which was super nice to be familiar with how things worked and my own comfort. Marcus replies fast and is quite efficient. The pool was a perk too even though it was chillier weather, my little one still got in. I highly recommend this house if it's not booked and your going to that area, jump on it and don't wait. 5 stars for sure!!!"
2021-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This is by far the best Airbnb in Merced and one of the best I’ve stayed at overall. Marcus is highly professional, communicative and accommodating. His place was sparkling clean and exactly like the description. We will return !"

This was my first time using airbnb and he made everything very easy from getting into the house, understanding how to use everything in the house, making sure we had everything for a comfortable stay to dining ideas. He even had a real Christmas tree and decorations up, which I thought was a nice touch especially when people are traveling over the holidays...it made it very homey.

2020-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Awesome venue great amenities
2020-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Nice house and furnishings, good kitchen, garage parking for a car, good neighborhood and location. All as represented. Only issue was balancing the heating on a cold night - high tech thermostat was hard to use (too much heat!) and lack of coverings on windows and sliding glass created cold areas and drafts. Overall, very good, would stay there again."

2020-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Gorgeous brand new house - great communication with host - I will be back!!
2020-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This house was GORGEOUS inside and out! The photos don’t do his place justice. The house & backyard are much bigger than I expected! My dogs LOVED the yard. We did have to keep them out of the pool area though because there was a small hole in the fence they wouldn’t stay away from. The neighbors dogs barked allot, especially in the mornings. Unfortunately, it was too cold to swim in the pool when we visited & the spa didn’t heat up. But the inside of the home really made up for that! It was very clean when we arrived, and he also left us complimentary beverages including wine. Love the fact that almost the whole house can be controlled via voice command. The beds were super comfy. Master bathroom is HUGE, but the water doesn’t get very hot. Marcus was very communicative, thoughtful and a great host. If you have the chance to book this house, do!"

The house was beautiful and he left great touches- personal note, water, coffee, towels, and a great bottle of wine! Loved that I was able to bring my pup... and the fact that there was three separate areas for the backyard was a huge plus. I could keep a good eye on the dog outside without having to worry about him in the pool, flowers, and fruit trees. Not sure what will bring me to Merced again, but wouldn’t hesitate stay at this home!"

2020-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I'm currently in the process of starting up a new business in Merced and I've been driving daily from Elk Grove. Often I would book a hotel in the location which has not always been the best experience so I decided to try Airbnb. This was my first time booking an AirBnB and was a bit disappointed, because my first attempts did not receive a response from hosts. A week later I gave the site one more try and this is when I found Marcus Place........
Well I have to say Marcus Place did not disappoint. I'm very into technology so the fact that the entire house had been upgraded to smart home features was plus. Also the home was very clean and in a great neighborhood. There's a nice size clean pool in the backyard with hot tube to match. Plus the added touch of bottled wine waiting for me really was great.
Upon returning the key I was a bit late because got called into the work early that morning, from which I text Marcus and he was totally fine with me dropping key off later in the day. While dropping key off, I was able to meet Mr. Marcus. Great down to earth you man who was very welcoming and pleasant to talk to. Needless to say, I will be staying at Marcus Place again in the near future.
Thanks again Marcus."
2020-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Marcus is an exceptional host. He seems genuinely interested in making sure that his guests have a great experience.

Marcus was very responsive, extremely friendly and accommodating, and was very helpful with local suggestions. The house was extremely clean, quiet, had new appliances, tech-forward (strong mesh network, two huge smart TVs, Smart Home speakers, smart locks, etc...), and there were touches of thoughtfulness scattered throughout the house. We picked Marcus' house for the pool since it was hitting triple digit temperatures the week of our stay, and it was well worth it. I highly recommend the house and Marcus as a host!"

We live north of Sacramento and have found their airbnb the perfect stop on our way to/from Yosemite (in April) and Paso Robles area (a few days ago).

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Modern oasis in Merced. Very well appointed home. Had all the needs. Insider tip - there is a presspot in the upper cabinet if you want to make your own coffee. There was oatmeal and coffee pods. And not a lot of food items if you are going to cook (e.g. salt) just an FYI if you are planning on cooking. Host super responsive when we had a problem opening the door. Would definitely stay again when in Merced.

2024-04-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,Extremely charming property! It’s unfortunately right next to a retail center and bright lights shine right into the master. Home flooring is 100% original which is cool but every step is squeaky…just like the beds.

2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We enjoyed our stay at Daniel's space. The space was clean, open, lots of natural light. There were legos and tons of kids books that the kids enjoyed immensely. Daniel and Lindsey were quick to respond, and when we encountered issues, they remedy them promptly. A couple things to be aware of are environmental light from the nearby shopping center which is not completely blocked by the blinds, and the train horn could interrupt sleep (though a noise machine goes a long way to helping with that)."

Daniel made sure that we felt secure in house during this time and offered to help us with anything we needed during this period. We'll always appreciate that. The combination of house and host makes this AirBnB a must-stay!"

The space was open concept with a beautiful kitchen/dining/living room to gather in. The fire pit in the front yard got plenty of use. The zen vibes of the front yard with the fountain, statues, and little birds that live in the trees was amazing. Visiting in fall was perfect. The trees lining the street and around the neighborhood were beautiful. We accommodated 10 people comfortably in their home. Daniel and Lindsey were both responsive and kind.

Came out here to spend time with my father who lives a few blocks away and was surprised when everything I saw online was so basic and expensive, until I found this property. Not the cheapest on the market but more than makes up for it with communication from owners, ease of access to anything, cleanliness and just a really cool relaxing feeling you get when you open the door. Will repeat when I come back to Merced."

Me and my girlfriend only stayed for a night but Cheryl has plenty of space and it felt like home to us.
We chose the location because it’s so close to the Yosemite NP (2hr drive) but Merced is a really nice village and the weather is great if you like it hot in the summer, but don’t worry Cheryl’s place is cool, she has AC and multiple fans.
I also wanted to mention that Cheryl is a really responsive and friendly host. She gave us direction to the local stores and restaurants.

My daughters slept very well in the rooms. The recommendations I have is to make the garage electric so that the guests can push the button on the wall so that the garage can be used easily. Other than that everything else was perfect. The washing machine is wonderful. Even the neighbors were nice. A neighbor came over and asked me if I could go to the backyard and get the ball that flew over the fence for the dog. I happily threw it over and he said, “thank you”. You don’t have to worry about critters or bugs because while I was there, someone came and sprayed outside. In the master bedroom and living room, it would be nice if the blackout curtains were placed at the sliding doors like all the other rooms. Overall it is a great home."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We went to Max's place to have a little getaway for my husband's birthday.

The decor of the home was gorgeous with photos of Half Dome/ Yosemite, the couch was great and plenty of room for six adults and two kids. Two adults had their own private rooms and two couples each had a room. The house was clean and beautiful. Will definitely stay here again if I ever have the chance and I sure hope I do!!"

The back yard is a decent size (we didn’t use it) but you can definitely do stuff back there if needed. I like natural lighting and in the morning there is tons of natural lighting. Equipped with what you need, felt the rooms were on the smaller end but hey, that’s just the new homes these days can’t get away from that. Other than that, great stay and I would totally do it again! A 5/5 Forsure!"

While we did pack our own toiletries and materials, the house was stocked with a lot of items (shampoo, body wash, etc). There are plenty of towels and linens. Max was quick to respond and very understanding in allowing us to have family over as we grieved. He also allowed us to have my sister’s small family stay with us for two nights (there were 8 of us total) for an extra fee (typically he doesn’t allow more than one family to stay at a time, but we had an unexpected situation arise, and he was flexible and accommodating in our tough situation). The backyard was perfect for our kids, and it was nice for them to have the space to run and play. Thanks for hosting us, Max!"

2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"This is a very generous residence for a family, with a beautiful kitchen, dining and living room in a large, open space with high ceilings, three smaller bedrooms with queen beds, and a master suite with connected full bath. There’s a second full bath in the hallway between the bedrooms. The house has plenty of storage space, and is fully equipped to make oneself at home away from home. There’s also a nice back yard with dining furniture. All appliances and furnishings are new. It comes fully stocked with towels, linen, kitchen equipment, spices, and staples to get you started.
The neighborhood is as new as the home, and very peaceful and quiet, especially at night. I slept really well in the comfortable bed, and felt very safe and cozy.
Whatever it is that brings you to Merced, don’t miss the wildlife reserves. I saw hundreds of geese, pelicans, a huge variety of ducks, raptors, sparrows, herons and egrets, the rare Sandhill Cranes and Tule Elks… all just a 30 minutes drive away. Magical!
Communication with host Max was outstanding. He’s so accommodating, resourceful and helpful, and really wants you to have the best of times. I wanted to extend my stay because it was just so nice, but the house was booked. Max went out of his way with recommendations and suggestions, really fabulous.
In other words, highly recommended."

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Ram’s house was spotless (minus the carpets), he responded very quickly to any questions I had and overall my family and I enjoyed our stay. The only issue we had (that is no fault to Ram) was that the neighbor next door had people living in an RV in front of their house for the duration of our stay. During this time they put their trash bins in from of the Airbnb, used the parking spots in front of the Airbnb, and would sit out on their lawn in pajamas at all hours of the day. It didn’t ruin our stay but was definitely unfortunate to see everyday."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We had a great stay at Ram's place. The house is very spacious and comfortable. Ram gave me all the tools to check in, in advance and was very helpful with any questions. Check out was even easier as they take care of everything for you. It was the perfect stay for my family."

2023-11-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"Overall the house was spacious. The water pressure for the showers was a little too much. There was no way of adjusting the shower head, so the high pressure would hit the face and spray water passed the shower curtain. We only stayed for a couple nights, so we didn’t mind."

2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"I booked Rams place because of the size of the house and because it came with a playpen and a high chair. I was traveling with my 1 year old so I was looking to accommodate her too. I wish I had known the playpen was for a newborn. My 1 year old did not fit in it, but we managed and my 1 year old slept comfortably. Other than the no complaints. Very clean and spacious just as described. Easy check in. Quiet community. Overall we had a wonderful stay and would definitely go back."

2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We stayed here as a group of 5 on our trip to Yosemite and thoroughly enjoyed the stay. It was a newer construction with modern amenities, located in a peaceful community, was easy to find, and the host Ram was very responsive and accommodative of our requests.

We would certainly love to come back here on our future trips to Yosemite!!"

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We requested the accommodation on the same day because another Airbnb canceled at short notice due to a power outage, Ram responded immediately and so we could arrive two hours later. The new house is located in a quiet residential area in Merced. The house is very well equipped. The value for money is completely ok. We drove from Merced to Yosemite National Park, until you enter the park you need about 1:45 h. If you have no problem with that, you will find an optimal starting point in Ram's house, which I can only recommend."

6. Great place!"

2023-05-01,4.0,Stayed one night,Nice place
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"what a spectacular place. a little far from the center of town, but the price made it worth driving through the maze of streets.
Just the 3 bathrooms alone made this place a gem.
everything was super clean and comfortable. i never once felt grossed out by something here, which happens often in Airbnb's.
one warning though, if you like ABSOLUTE quite, one of the neighbors has a wind chime that is easily activated by even the SLIGHTEST breeze. and it was a breezy night. all night i could hear that chime going off. not the fault of the host though."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"My family had a comfortable stay at Ram’s house and we would definitely stay there again. We had everything we needed, and especially appreciated the packing crib and high chair. Check in was easy and there was plenty of parking."

2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Very spacious 4br 3ba stay. Full of wonderful amenities. Ram responds very quickly.
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Ram’s place is beautiful and perfect for families. Wish we could stay for longer but we had to leave to catch our flight the next morning. Everything is so clean and organized and Ram is very responsive and friendly. There’s even snacks prepared for guests which is a very sweet touch. Would definitely recommend to others.
2023-05-01,5.0,Group trip,"Great neighborhood, the place was clean for the most part and felt safe. Didn’t get to enjoy much of the backyard, cameras in the back felt slightly invasive. Love that the master bedroom has a sliding door to the backyard though. Only complaint was the shower in the master bedroom. Since there is no door between the shower and rest of the room, stepping out of the shower felt cold regardless how warm the house was. Would definitely consider staying here again!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Group trip,"great place, just what we were looking for during a short stay in the area"
2023-04-01,5.0,Group trip,♥️

2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This place worked great for our needs - we were able to arrive later in the evening after our plans ended, got in fine and enjoyed our stay. The garage turned out to be great to park our cars and the coffee/coffee maker in the kitchen was appreciated! Ram was also very responsive in helping when we realized we left a sweatshirt behind."
2023-04-01,5.0,Group trip,"Our company was working in Merced for the week. This house was perfect for the 6 of them. They were so excited, like kids in a candy store. The place was big, new, really nice. It was absolutely perfect. They said they wished they lived there! The host was great as well."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Beautiful, clean and very spacious, I love it 💕"
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We stayed for the night while passing through Merced. It’s a nice, new home in a seemingly safe suburban neighborhood. Our 1 year old enjoyed crawling around the spacious home.
The cleaners skipped a few very minor organization tasks that we shared with Ram who offered to send cleaners over immediately, which we appreciated but it truly wasn’t necessary. He was eager to ensure we were happy. We would stay here again and highly recommend it!"
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We enjoyed the New , clean home. VERY SPACIOUS. Everyone of our family member had their own room / beds . Our 4 children were comfortable and content . We brought our own playpen for our infant, but there was one in the master sweet and a high chair ! That’s awesome!!
We do wish there were more pillows and towels, however there were washer and dryer access if we needed. It was useful to us . We didn’t use the kitchen as we were exploring the town’s restaurants. Everything was very clean. We purchased more toilet paper not realizing there was extra in the bathroom drawer in one restroom and more in garage. I think if you have questions, just ask the host . We loved our stay and can’t wait to visit again!"
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Nothing to complain. Spacious house to live!
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Just a good night's sleep in a very spacious, clean home.
We only fixed breakfast there but the kitchen is sparsely equipped. (not enough cutlery, cups, etc for 8 people. Space was somewhat impersonal just like a hotel would be, but much more space than any suite hotel would offer.
Due to construction on 99 and 3 closed exits, the house could only be reached after a 15-minute detour. Overall a good experience, I would recommend it to others."
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,The house was very clean and spacious- newly built home with nice finishings. We had 6 adults and one toddler and there was plenty of space. Ram was an excellent host- very flexible and responsive. Thumbs up all around for the house and the owner. Will definitely stay here again in future.

2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Great house! Very comfortable and cozy. We could have used more items in the kitchen (pots, pans, knives, utensils, etc). Not enough toilet paper and paper towels. We needed to buy some. But overall, would stay here again."

2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Absolutely amazing and responsive host! Ram was super accommodating and helpful during the check in process. He made sure we were able to access the home and checked in to see if there was anything else we needed. Home was beautiful, clean and very spacious. We only stayed for a night but wish we could have been here longer. Close to restaurants and shopping. Very peaceful and quiet area. Highly recommend!"
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great find and even better than the pictures. Clean, spacious, comfortable place to stay while on vacation. I was unsure if I was going to be able to make it to the area/vacation and Ram was so helpful, quick with responses, and flexible! Would recommend over and over again! Great host!"
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Our three person group moving from Oregon to LA got a great night’s sleep at Ram’s spacious house. Very comfortable beds! It was very luxurious having our own bedrooms and bathrooms. This was a good value for us and would be a truly exceptional value for a larger group (the house sleeps 8 comfortably, in real beds). There’s no character to the house as it is brand new, in an enormous new homogeneous development, and sparsely furnished. But that was evident in the pictures and information so no surprises there. It has a small outdoor area but it hasn’t been landscaped yet. We really liked being able to put our two cars inside the garage and to spread out on the large comfy couch to watch movies. A note to anyone with chemical sensitivities— the house smells like laundry detergent— it’s very evident as soon as you walk in. Ram was excellent to communicate with and very accommodating, which we really appreciated. All in all a great stay—just what we were looking for!"
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Ram's home was great. lots of space and very clean. if we are ever back in the area this will definitely be a place we would go back to.

2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Ram was an amazing host. I asked for an early check-in and he did all he could do to have the house cleaned and ready for me ASAP.
The home is beautiful, clean and well furnished for large families or friends traveling together. With 4 bedrooms (two bedrooms with 2 twin beds) and 3 bathrooms, it's definitely a must book for anyone traveling in large groups. I'll definitely book with Ram in the future!
Thanks again Ram!"

I was in Merced for work and it was so nice going home to this house after a long hot day in the sun. I really enjoyed my stay and I already have plans to go back to this house. You should definitely stay here if your in Merced you won’t be disappointed. The home owner is awesome, he gets back to you super quick. I would 1000% recommend staying at Rams house."
