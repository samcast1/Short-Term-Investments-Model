2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,Renee was amazing!
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The home was within walking distance of downtown with lots to do. The stay was very peaceful and the home had the best decor, I absolutely loved the Benjamin Franklin bathroom."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"House was very clean.
Neighborhood pretty quiet.
Beds were fabulous for sleeping!
Towels and washcloths are the softest I have ever used.
Renee was very responsive to my questions.
House is eclectically and funly (is that a word) decorated.
House has been beautifully restored. Kudos!"
2024-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beautifully renovated home, within walking distance to all the cute shops and dining in downtown Sulphur Springs! House was very clean and well stocked with all the necessities. Easy check-in and check-out procedures too. Would 100% rent this house again."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We were in town to visit family and really enjoyed our stay at The Benjamin. Such a great location. Just down the street from the square. Nicely decorated and super clean. A very comfortable place, and you can tell it was put together with a great deal of care."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Charming home in an excellent location! Spacious with a lovely kitchen, and my daughter loved the bunk beds. Perfect for our visit to see family in the area."
2024-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,Beautiful home that was very clean and had everything you could need to make the stay very enjoyable! I will be looking for the same place next time I come back!
2024-04-01,3,Stayed a few nights,"Cute place! Sulphur Springs is a small town and we had no problem getting to good restaurants and a friend’s place.
Looks exactly like the pictures and had a homey feel.
We had an issue - as we checked in, we found the beds stripped and realized quickly - it hadn’t been cleaned.
Unfortunately, we arrived 1am due to flight delays and messaged Michael immediately- we found clean sheets and made our own beds.
Very responsive host, so seems like the cleaner no showed and we got a credit which seemed fair."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Beautiful house, very comfortable and clean. Great location. Just absolutely loved it and would highly recommend!"
2024-04-01,5,Group trip,Great house. Close to down town. Lots of food options.
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What a gem! This house, the yard, the two porches...what a great place for a family gathering in Sulphur Springs! We really appreciated that the house offers so many ways for people to be together, whether for a meal on the back porch or in the dining area inside, or relaxing on the couches around the fireplace, or....doesn't this always happen...when everyone is talking and being together around the kitchen island! We appreciated all the design choices and the terrific kitchen set-up. We were there during a soggy series of rainstorms...so we didn't get to enjoy the outdoor firepit or trampoline, but we did love drinking our morning coffee on the back steps and watching the cardinals and other birds in the backyard. We are ""town"" people, and really enjoyed being close to the square and other sites in town. Just a charming place to stay!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Thank you! We enjoyed our two nights. Very clean, very quiet. Hope to visit again next year!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,Very clean. Well decorated. Excellent location. Felt like home.
2024-03-01,5,Group trip,"Very fortunate to find this home as a last minute booking, in the evening, and even last minute Michael made the check in very quick and easy. Very nice home as well, would definitely recommend."
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beautifully decorated home just minutes from the downtown area. Plenty of seating for relaxing or eating. Responsive host. If the weather had been better, we would have enjoyed the nice set up in the backyard: fire pit, grill, trampoline & covered patio area with seating."
2024-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"Very clean, spacious, comfortable. Makes you feel at home. Beds are comfortable and clean. Great WiFi. Didn’t book the place till 4:30 pm and stayed that same night no problem. Michael responded within seconds of booking and made everything stress free. Great location, good backyard with fire pit, deck and grill. Wish we would’ve been able to stay longer and enjoy the place more."
2024-01-01,5,Group trip,"Michael's house is warm and comfortable. The new decor is Texas Country, and so welcoming. The kitchen has everything you would need.
Beds are very comfortable.
My whole family is from Sulphur Springs. I lived InThe Mitchell House with my family on Collage street when
I was age 2 till about age 4.
Staying at Michael’s Home was very comforting, warm and safe.
Thank you Michael"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,Nice clean and comfortable place to stay! This will be our go to place when we're in town!
2023-12-01,5,Group trip,"Michael's place was clean, beautiful, homey and a perfect location for our needs. Michael was very flexible, allowing us to checkin early. The kitchen had everything we needed to cook a homemade Christmas dinner for our family. The open room allowed our whole family to celebrate together in comfort. The house is close to downtown shops and restaurants in addition to being steps away from Wesley House, the independent living facility. This made getting together with our elderly parents so easy. I highly recommend staying here."
2023-12-01,5,Group trip,Great place! This is a great stay and exceeds expectations. Very spacious and beautiful home inside and out. We will definitely stay again next time we’re in town!

House was very clean .
Everything on the house is working properly. Definitely I will come back here."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Michael was a proactive host from the minute we booked. A friend and I went fishing a Lake Fork and this was a convenient place to stay after a long day on the water. The walkable, quaint downtown was extremely convenient. It was our first trip to Texas… wonderful people and a truly unique part of our amazing country."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Perfection! This adorable house was so clean, comfortable and had everything we needed for our stay! Could not have asked for a more cute and cozy place."
2023-09-01,5,Group trip,"Such a cute home in SS, TX! It was the perfect space for our group. Loved everything about this stay.

2023-08-01,5,Group trip,Beautiful place. Michael is so kind and helpful!
2023-06-01,4,Group trip,"The beds we’re comfortable and the home is lovely. The only thing that was an issue was there wasn’t any “fun drinks” in the refrigerator as stated and as a superhost I was surprised there was no soap, shampoo or condition in the home."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,This house was a perfect home away from home! Cozy and clean and had everything we needed
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,We had an amazing time. Great Home. Thank You Michael!
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This past weekend we traveled to Sulphur Springs for a wedding and had the privilege at staying at Michael’s Airbnb. From the moment I booked the house to departing from the house today, Michael communicated every detail very well. The house was also very clean and there was plenty of room for everyone. The house is also really close to downtown!! Highly recommend booking this house if you are planning to visit Sulphur Springs."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I just want to say Michael is amazing. He answered all my questions. The home was very very beautiful and cleaned!

2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Such a beautiful home not far from the heart of Sulphur Springs.

Peaceful neighborhood and great location. Would highly recommend this home if you are ever in Sulphur Springs!!"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,We loved our stay here! House was clean and comfortable. The house is close to the downtown area and we enjoyed the shops and restaurants.

2023-03-01,5,Group trip,Best place ever very clean and spacious
2023-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"Quiet neighborhood, comfortable & cozy inside & very easy to locate at night. I picked this place instead of staying in Winnsboro & enjoyed the relaxing atmosphere!"
2023-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Like others have said, you’ll want to live here! It’s very high-end compared even with other outstanding properties we have stayed in, just an outstanding property all in all, lacks nothing, you won’t be disappointed"
2023-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great stay, thanks"
2023-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Due to the winter weather, we lost power and needed a last minute place to stay but all the hotels and most of the short-term rentals were booked so we stayed here.
Michael was turning up the heat at the place while we packed our things in the candlelight. He was very kind and understanding.
The place was beautiful and clean. The beds comfortable and plenty of clean towels available.
I would definitely recommend Michael’s place to anyone. It’s large enough to accommodate most families and has a good-sized back porch and yard with fire pit and trampoline."
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"THIS HOUSE!!!!
I wanted to hitch it to the back of our car and take it with me!
High quality EVERYTHING. Normally, you’ll find shortcuts in an Airbnb but not Michael’s place! From the towels and linens to the hand soap— all were things I would (or have) purchased for my own home!
Loved every bit of it and all the thoughtful extras — beer in the fridge and wood next to a fire pit—- made it over the top!
THIS is how an Airbnb is done."
2022-12-01,5,Group trip,The craftsman home was beautiful and clean! It accommodated our family so well. We enjoyed the well designed space with great gathering areas both indoors and out. We loved our post Christmas get together and are looking forward to our next stay!
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Remarkable home that is equipped with everything you’ll need for an enjoyable stay. Not far from downtown, actually walked there from this house in about 10 minutes. Very safe street. You’ll love this!"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very clean very beautiful house. Responsive to questions and information easy. Which we had more time to enjoy fire pit and outdoor seating. Walked to town. Very convenient
2022-10-01,5,Group trip,"Excellent location, the house is beautiful and in excellent conditions. Everything is well taken care of and the place is very peaceful."
2022-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Great place! We really liked the house, the backyard. Very cozy and would definitely stay there again. Side note if you drive a Tesla there is a supercharge station nearby."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,Love this beautiful private home! The kids had the best time swimming in the pool! The setting was just gorgeous and we felt very relaxed! Only thing I would suggest is curtains or blinds on the windows for less sleep disruption but not a deal breaker. Thank you so much!
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Beautiful home! My family enjoyed the pool for most of the stay. The home was very cozy, relaxing, and secluded. Would definitely stay here again!"
2024-06-01,5,Group trip,"My friends and I had a wonderful time at LaWana’s place. It was super clean, conveniently provisioned, quiet, and sort of secluded. We played sports, cooked a huge meal, swam in the pool, and played lots of music!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,We had an amazing stay here! LaWana was so accommodating and helpful. She was always very quick to respond to all my questions. The place was exactly as described. We loved how peaceful and beautiful it was outside. It was perfect!
2024-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This Airbnb was great! My in laws live 20 minutes down the road and we needed a place to stay during our wedding week so it served its purpose. Extremely spacious home . It did seem like this is someone’s home , there was food in the fridge/freezer and pantry was stocked , so that was a bit surprising but did not bother us at all! Lawana was extremely responsive and very gracious during our stay, we appreciate her flexibility to work with us. Even as someone who lived in sulphur springs for 6 mos , I did find the house difficult to find . however if you drop a pin to the driveway on Apple Maps, it takes you directly there and then you just follow the road all the way to the end."
2024-04-01,5,Group trip,This place was great!! Felt so peaceful having our own space with no neighbors in sight. Would highly recommend!! Will be returning 💗
2024-04-01,5,Group trip,"Beautiful place, super peaceful and felt at home, the weather didn’t allow us to check the surroundings but the home was very cozy. Me and my family had a great time, would definitely be back. Friendly and communicative host!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,Great place to stay and great host
2024-04-01,5,Group trip,We had a wonderful stay. The Place is beautiful! The home and grounds are lovely and relaxing. We felt right at home.
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,We were EXTREMELY pleased with The Place! Absolutely perfect for a few days of quality time with just us and our kids! Will absolutely stay here again if in the area! Thank you LaWana and Broc!
2024-03-01,5,Group trip,Thank you for providing your precious home.
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,Wonderful home and location! My daughter loved meeting and playing with the kitty 😊
2024-03-01,5,Group trip,"Overall a good place to hang out with friends and family, it is a big farm, spotted some wildlife in the morning"
2024-02-01,5,Group trip,The house was beautiful and worked perfectly for me and my friends for our short stay. Also they have the best dog
2024-02-01,5,Group trip,It was great so beautiful!
2023-11-01,5,Group trip,"Awesome place! The house was great, clean, quiet, and secluded. favorite part was the loving farm dog that greets you at the gate and escorts you to and from the house."
2023-10-01,5,Group trip,"This was the perfect escape for our guys trip. The place is very private and great for disconnecting and grabbing some quality time. Kitchen was amazing, no need to go anywhere. Host was very responsive and helpful."
2023-10-01,5,Group trip,"We had a wonderful stay at LaWana’s Cabin home. The highlight was the pool, we had fun and enjoyed every minute of it. We would definitely return at another time. Thank you!"
2023-09-01,5,Group trip,"We had a lovely stay! Beautiful kitchen, property is peaceful and such a sweet dog on property. Would definitely stay again."

2023-08-01,5,Group trip,"Great space, pool was fun. Loved that she had towels and sunscreen as we forgot ours! kitchen was great for hosting a crowd. I felt safe and the space was clean, I would recommend to others!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Amazing house, nice and relaxing. The host communicate great and the property is better than pictures can show."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Overall, our stay was great. We had a few hiccups but nothing that made us regret our stay. This was for our son's sweet 16th birthday which was a big deal to us. We stayed 4 days. Communication was a little off as owners and or workers for owners showed up without notice. We also rented this specific house for the pool with included diving board. The diving board was removed on day 3 without notice. Was told it was due to insurance issues. The owner was very apologetic which was nice but didn't really help the feelings of my son and other kids being upset. We got over it. It just would have been nice to know it was going to be removed while staying there and we may have booked elsewhere. Also, day before arrival, you are informed that this is also the owner's home full time and that the master bedroom + bathroom is locked and off limits. They do not have it listed but also do not state it is off limits either so plan accordingly as there are only 2 complete beds for adults."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,Had such a great time. The place was beautiful and secluded. Nice to not have neighbors. A beautiful home and pool area. We can’t wait to come back!
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,My family and I had a great time here. It was peaceful and the place itself is really nice!
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What a gorgeous little haven , away from the hustle , quiet and private . Just delightful !
Was a little indulgent for 1 person , but I would love to return .
The owners were lovely and I may have fallen in love with the house dog Remy , was just like coming home .
Thank you for such a wonderful experience .
Would love to come back with a few friends and family , would be a great house to share ."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,This is our second time booking this place . Kids had a great time!
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"Beautiful home, perfect for a relaxing weekend and swimming. Definitely would stay again"
2023-07-01,5,Group trip,Want a weekend getaway with your friends and family? This is the place to go to!
2023-06-01,5,Group trip,The house was beautiful. We enjoyed the swing upstairs and hanging out at the pool. It’s a cute town for a calm relaxing getaway.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,Beautiful place! 😍
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Great home, everyone loved it."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We had such a peaceful and relaxed stay. LaWana is a great host.
2023-04-01,5,Group trip,The Place was amazing! All of the things were great!
2023-04-01,5,Group trip,Spacious beautiful property 3 miles outside of sulphur springs.. great host and beautiful property and house. zero complaints. We will definitely be back again!
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"LaWana’s place was amazing! Beautiful home and beautiful surroundings and her pets were amazing hosts too! Loved it, definitely worth the extra drive!"
2018-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,LaWana and her family are the perfect host. Their house is beautiful and their hospitality supercede any and all expectations you could have for a vacation.
2017-10-01,4,Stayed with kids,"Great secluded place. Nice home & great hosts. Upstairs bed is not a queen as advertised, but for 1 adult it's perfect. Bunk beds were nice as we had a few kids with us."
2017-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"If you are wanting a place to stay that is secluded and yet close to town, this is the place to choose. LaWana and her family are very involved with making sure you have everything you need. Her breakfast is amazing, the space is gorgeous, there's a really nice pool to keep you cool, and a wide open space to enjoy nature. You will encounter the occasional dog, cat, and chickens which was fine with me as I'm an animal lover."
2024-06-01,3,Stayed one night,"This place is a bit harder to get to than expected. The path to the home was muddy already with rain water and the last section was a bit rougher than expected. The home is a match for the pictures, albeit felt very small. Shower was great. I think I would have enjoyed this place more in nice weather. Unfortunately we stayed when a tornado warning and tornado watch was happening. Saw a tornado producing storm move just north of it. It was a very, very scary night. The power was out before we departed. Verizon cell service didn’t work. Felt unsafe due to height of building, glass windows, nowhere to hide for tornado warning. After a night of rain we still made it out in small suv but fishtailed a little in excessive mud. I would say do not risk staying here if inclement weather is a possibility."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very nice secluded place!
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Everything I wanted in an AirBNB , I loved every part of the treehouse. I love the off grid location (yet you can still get there by gps😏) soaking tub is spot on! Would definitely recommend to my loved ones!😁"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,This is a very well-built space. Everything was clean and comfortable. The setting is peaceful.
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"If you’re looking for a place to relax and unwind, this is the perfect place for you - away from the hustle and bustle of the city. You’ll also have everything you need from the grill to the fire pit and a bonus soaking tub. Great experience over all!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Lovely place. Since it is by many trees, watch it out for little spiders. Since the tub was outside, it needed to be cleaned so we decided not to use it. Once inside, very clean space. Great communication with hosts. Definitely recommend for a couple needing a quick getaway."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place! worth for my money !
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I dont even have words to discribe how utterly amazing our stay was. Husband and i needed a relaxing, private get away and thats exactly what we got. I am already recommending this place to all our couple friends. The only issue we had, and definitely not the owners fault, is the road on the last mile to the location was bumpy as all get out. So people should be aware before taking any low riders or super expensive cars. Not a deturant at all though. Absolute heaven and i hope we can do this again sooner rather than later."
2024-05-01,5,Stayed one night,Charming place to stay
2024-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The treehouse was absolutely peaceful and loved the outdoor tub. The road to get there was very bumpy and it rained both days while we were there so it made it difficult to drive on the dirt road. The Wi-Fi was very spotty but it was nice to just get away from everyday life. The hammock was nice to lay on and just relax. Overall the treehouse was definitely worth it to just relax and catch up on sleep! Would definitely book again.
2024-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Minna & Severi always communicated and gave clear instructions. The place was peaceful, clean & beautiful. They had so many cute details, very thoughtful. We will be back again for sure. Thank you."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,Loved it will definitely stay again
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,Amazing! The perfect location & great house!
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This quiet, peaceful getaway was exactly what we needed! Everything was super clean and the hammock was our favorite!!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The treehouse was such a relaxing place to spend my husband’s birthday. The hike was incredible! Not tough at all- just relaxing to be in the woods. No tv, we put our phones away, and just enjoyed the quiet nature. You can hang out by the fire pit on ground level or on the 2nd or 3rd tier- giving you a change of scenery. Very comfortable. The trees are gorgeous and we spent hours just looking at their uniqueness. Next time I go I’ll bring my keurig and a cooler with ice. They have a espresso machine but I really like morning coffee and the fridge didn’t keep our drinks as cold as we like them. Neither greatly impacted our trip at all, just little tips for anyone who is serious about their coffee and cold beverages."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is a wonderful getaway tucked into the woods. Very pretty surroundings with cardinals hopping around. Easy to find, easy to get in, and very clean. The shower is great, and the bed is very comfortable. The trail is nice, too. We were glad we brought our hiking boots. 5*"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great Stay don’t pass this up.
Will hope to book again when back in the area."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,Soooooo relaxing and peaceful. With unpredictable Texas weather it was a little rainy and chilly but the bath water got nice and hot along with the heater close by it was still enjoyable! So glad they thought of all the little things to make this the most refreshing and relaxing trip we’ve had in a while. Didn’t want to leave!!
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,It’s was a peaceful and serene setting.
2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,Very nice and clean! Cool stay.
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The treehouse was spectacular! It was exactly as described and the hosts were very nice. The place was beautiful, peaceful and relaxing. It was designed so so good from top to bottom! We couldn’t have asked for anything better for our little get away! 10/10 recommend, we can’t wait to return in the future!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Absolute best place that we could have picked for our wedding and honey moon ! The bath was amazing and the star gazing was even better ! 10/10 definitely recommend !!
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Such an amazing getaway! We live just over an hour away in Dallas and it was so nice to get away from the city and enjoy some peace and quiet.
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Everything was so amazing, we really got to unwind and just relax completely. We were so impressed with everything. I highly recommend this air b n b."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"An excellent place to enjoy a weekend with your partner, it has excellent facilities to have a good time and enjoy the environment. We recommend it 100%."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Such a beautiful place to stay with your partner. We had a very peaceful valentine’s getaway and will definitely be booking again!
2024-01-01,5,Stayed one night,Loved being in the trees! Thoroughly enjoyed the rain shower and outdoor bath. Comfortable bed. Quiet area. Other visitors should be aware that the road is difficult to navigate after rain and there are no drapes/blinds on the windows if you are the type that likes a dark room.
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Nice quiet and peaceful location for a quick getaway. Would definitely recommend to book.
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Nice, cute and quiet getaway! I wanted some time to myself and this place was perfect! I loved the patio! I would definitely return!!"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"My boyfriend and I loved staying at this wonderful hidden getaway! It was so beautiful waking up next to the woods, laying in the hammock watching the stars, sitting by the fire drinking coffee and listening to the sounds of nature!

2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"Loved our stay! The interior looks just like the photos, has the comfiest bed at any Air B&B we've stayed, and so unique. Our favorite features were the hammock, outdoor fireplace, and the incredible stargazing. Minna and Severi were great hosts and gave detailed directions for arrival."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"The treehouse was everything we wanted it to be for us. The neighborhood isn’t the most attractive, but inside the treehouse was beautiful. It was also very peaceful. Quiet, except for the cacophony of nature. Which is amazing! The house is well appointed and has a very comfortable bed. It was a great night of sleep. Perfect place to unplug and reconnect."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place is very clean, quiet, private, and cute! Would definitely stay again so I can try to catch some sunset armadillos. Thanks for everything!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We loved staying in the tree house. We had an excellent time, and though it was a bit warm when we got in (Texas heat can’t be helped) it cooled down after we got the AC going. We loved the balcony! The trail had a lot of poison ivy but if you’ve ever stayed in a remote cabin that should be no surprise, just be aware of your surroundings. It was cozy and the drive to Cooper Lake State Park was easy."

2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My husband and I found Minna’s place after deciding to take a spur of the moment anniversary trip, and her treehouse did not disappoint. Everything was absolutely perfect. The treehouse is secluded and altogether lovely.

2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Minna's place was amazing. We wanted to get away, be relaxed, and be away from everything and everyone ... this place was PERFECT! Severi and Minna were very prompt with answers to questions before we got there and were on top of giving us driving directions and instructions on how to get into the tree house. This quaint, quiet place was spotless, beautiful, private, and extremely comfortable. This is the place to go if you want to escape it all. Thank you for an amazing weekend and such a beautiful tree house! We will be back!

2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,It was a great experience awesome location to get out of the city for a couple of days
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Minna’s place is the perfect quiet retreat only a short drive from the Metroplex.
The Treehouse is artfully built and situated among the tree tops with a glimpse of the sunset.
The decor is perfectly minimal for my taste yet you will find everything you need for your stay.
The Hosts are extremely attentive and answered any question I had quickly.
Overall I enjoyed the stay and will return for another retreat."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"This was a great little getaway for my fiancé and I. The surroundings were unbeatable. The patio was so cozy and restful. The hammock net was definitely a fun, exciting bonus! The hiking trail was muddy but very easy to follow thanks to the colored ribbons so just be sure to bring proper shoes or a backup pair. The treehouse itself was decorated to the 9’s and so cozy! The AC worked incredibly well and the extra provided pillows and blankets were such a thoughtful touch. And the hosts were so friendly and quick to respond! Can’t wait to come back! 💕"
2023-02-01,5,Stayed one night,Beautiful and peaceful. thanks!!
2023-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"We had a beautiful weekend getaway at Mina’s! The treehouse was cute and very well insulated on the cold night we stayed. The hammock was super comfortable and relaxing and the trail nearby had colored markers so we could easily find our way back. We brought food to heat up for dinner and breakfast, the fridge held everything we needed. The small stove and microwave worked great and the coffee maker was stocked. Would definitely recommend!"
2023-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"Rented this beautiful treehouse for my fiancés birthday. We wanted time away from the kids and we found it with this place. Views were amazing, very clean, and very peaceful. Owners were very responsive and we weren’t disappointed one bit. Be careful with the potholes lol. They even mailed my license plate holder for my truck that fell off from the bouncing. I recommend this place to all of my friends and we will definitely be back to stay again"
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The treehouse was amazing! It was super cute and clean on the inside, had everything we needed in the kitchen for the dishes we made, plenty of clean linens for showers & extra blankets (we sleep with alot of blankets so we were happy about this lol). We absolutely lovedddd the hammock, it’s so relaxing and such a pretty view , we stayed on it for hours talking and watching movies. My car did get stuck right in front of the treehouse in the mud because it had recently rained but we were able to get it out without any extra help. It was an amazing place for a really fair price."
2023-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"This treehouse was great! It was very clean, modern, and well kept. It was a little hard to get to with the roads and mud from the recent rain, but it was well worth it once we got in."
2023-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"This was the most wonderful place to spend some time away from home. The design is amazing .. the whole place, very well thought out. We couldn’t have asked for more! We especially enjoyed the time outdoors, riding bikes and hiking through a very clean forest. You won’t get this anywhere else. We look forward to coming back!!!"
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great spot for a quick getaway & disconnect from everyone. will definitely stay again & recommend anyone to stay.
2023-01-01,5,Stayed one night,I just want to say this is my best Airbnb experience ever! It is a perfect place for a getaway. My husband & I enjoyed it so much. Thank you! 😊 We will definitely come back.
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Spent New Year's Eve here and it was wonderful. Took advantage of the outside fireplace, the hammock and the sunsets. Thanks!"
2022-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"Can not say enough wonderful things about our experience staying here. The treehouse was in immaculate condition and the host Minna was so sweet in promptly answering any questions we had. She even reached out to us the day we were going as it had stormed and wanted to make sure we could get there safely in the mud, so sweet!
We stayed one night to celebrate my fiancés 30th birthday and he ADORED this place.
With the amenities provided we were even able to cook a nice pork schnitzel dinner and enjoy it by the adorable little fake candles that just made for a cozier ambiance.
We got greeted by a little baby cow in mooing at us in the morning and even a rooster chimes in with its broken cock-a-doodle doo, made for a great laugh.
10/10 recommend and will be sure to return!"
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Everything was new, pristine, spotless. The morning views were superb. Even driving a Mitsubishi Mirage after 5 inches of rain, I could still get in and out with minimal issues. That being said, it was muddy."
2022-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"The treehouse was as described. Very quiet and away from city life. It’s tucked in between large trees, which provide privacy. Will definitely come back!"

2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My wife and I enjoyed our anniversary weekend. It was peaceful, quiet, very clean, and very quaint.

2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Absolutely loved this place! Very relaxing and comfortable. Enjoyed every little thing about it. If you’re looking for a relaxing getaway I definitely recommend it.
2022-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"Cosy, lovely, and perfect for autumn and winter getaway 🍁🍂"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed one night,This is truly a hidden Texas gem and perfect for a weekend escape. We had a wonderful stay among the trees in this newly constructed treehouse! We really liked the seclusion and privacy the treehouse offers and the views into the woods from the unit were gorgeous! We actually had the windows open during the night and fell asleep to the sounds of nature which you don’t ever get to do in the city- it was very peaceful. The unit’s décor is modern yet tranquil. The shower had amazing pressure and plenty of hot water. The bed was extremely comfortable and the soft lighting by the bedside was perfect for reading at night. The communication with our host (Severi) was excellent. He was always quick to respond and was very accommodating. We hope to be back soon!
2022-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We really enjoyed our night at the treehouse. The interior of the treehouse is all well-thought-out and the Scandinavian interior is really calming and feels like you are in a room of a wellness hotel. We slept with the windows open and the only thing you could hear is the sound of nature. The view from the very comfy bed is as of you sleep in the middle of the tree canopy since the treehouse is so high up and has lots of windows. The deck is ideal to eat al-fresco. My son and I went for bike ride in the area which took us on the gravel country roads through forest areas and infinite pasture views and even to lake Tawakoni So if you like the tranquility and the sounds of nature in the middle of the woods, this treehouse is definitely worth considering for your next getaway. Loved it all the way."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,Very unique place that you need to try. Outdoor shower was a highlight. Host was super helpful with everything.
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"This was a perfect getaway that’s just outside of Dallas. The place was clean, quiet, and semi-secluded; exactly what we were looking for."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,This place is amazing. I went solo for some down time and to see a graduation in SS. This is glamping next level! Done so well. Great communication from host. Go any chance you can! Absolutely amazing!
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We had an amazing restful time! Even the dog was sweet and welcoming! The location was private and secluded! We will be back!
2024-06-01,3,Stayed one night,The space was great and the jacuzzi tub was amazing. Being able to walk around the area around was a nice bonus.
2024-05-01,5,Stayed with a pet,I wished we could have stayed longer! Very unique and cool place - we loved it!
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,Very responsive host! Made sure we were taken care of and very friendly!
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,The secluded area was perfect and peaceful! We arrived when it was raining and the rain made it that much more peaceful! It was the perfect get away for the weekend to reconnect! 10/10 highly recommend!!
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,Amazing getaway! Especially loved the tub!
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,Such a beautiful place we had a amazing time ♥️ everything was perfectly organized 🩷🩷
2024-04-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Great place and private area. I love how we had our own space and no neighbors. Perfect view for the eclipse. I loved the outside shower and I had a great time with my boyfriend. A few negatives for me, I wish there were more essentials. Like a microwave would be really convenient or a small stovetop or grill outside. No essentials wouldn't be so convenient for long stays. It was really hot during the day, the AC wasn't strong at all and opening the window didn't help. The weather was in the 70s-80s for reference. There was some bugs but not so bad for being in the woods. There were quite some spiders even on a towel we were provided and I'm horrified of spiders lol. Also a let down was probably the kayaking advertised. The lake was brown and there wasn't a path to get there. The host says there will be a path sometime soon but honestly not sure I would kayak because the water was so brown and was barely a lake in my opinion. But overall great experience for my boo and I."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great place. Very cool idea. Nice and quiet. We only stayed one night so we didn’t make it out to the fire pit, but the jacuzzi tub was very nice. Bed was extremely comfy. Nice to just unplug and relax for a bit. Only thing that we thought could be added was a front patio light (unless we just couldn’t find it) for when we got out at night. And maybe eventually add a gate at the turn off entrance for added privacy. Overall, highly recommend."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,It was perfect I will definitely do it again!!
2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,We have found a true treasure in North East Texas. Everything about this place we loved and cannot wait to stay there again. This was such and incredible experience!!!!
2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"This was exactly what we needed for a weekend getaway, very private and peaceful. Would definitely stay here again!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"I inadvertently ended up with a mini staycation, as this Airbnb is in my hometown - I had reserved it for my sister and her family and their plans changed - so youngest daughter, her friends, and I enjoyed the night! I walked into town to meet up with friends, then enjoyed the back patio with a book and glass of wine. I ordered pizza for the girls and they played ping pong and card games, baked cookies, and laughed and talked until the wee hours. Everything was exactly as pictured and super clean!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,Second time and everything was wonderful. Beautiful home.
2024-06-01,4,Stayed with kids,Great location and super cute house with lots of character! Host was extremely responsive and helpful!
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I can’t say enough good things about this cottage! We walked in and fell in love. It is beautifully decorated without clutter and has its original wood throughout. The teenagers loved the ping pong table as well. The rooms were large and the beds were comfy. It’s on a street with other beautiful old homes. Speaking of old homes you can’t hear the outside and barely the train that runs through. It’s in walking distance to downtown. Really didn’t want to give a great review because I’m afraid it will be booked solid for the next time I have guests. Thanks again!
2024-04-01,4,Group trip,There was an issue the first day but is was resolve quickly by Michael. We enjoyed the time there.
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Loved our stay in Sulphur Springs. Perfect location! We walked to the square daily. Great restaurants and shops nearby.
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Responsive host that concerned themselves with the experience of the people that rented their home.
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Pate Cottage was a beautifully restored home with an amazing kitchen full of everything needed to prepare and cook meals. We’ve never stayed in an Airbnb rental with such nice pots, pans, dishes and glassware."
2024-01-01,5,Group trip,Fantastic place to stay would love to stay there again in the future.
2023-06-01,5,Group trip,"We loved our stay at Michael's Airbnb. The whole home is beautiful, very thoughtfully decorated throughout, and contained high quality beds, furniture, and amenities. Qe are hosts ourselves and have been in countless airbnbs. This is one of the best airbnbs weve stayed in. 10/10 recommend and no hesitations to recommend!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,My wife and I are transitioning to the area due her job. The host and his family were gracious enough to work with us during this transition. Stay here is part of that transition. We are thrilled with the stay!
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The Pate Cottage was nothing short of a dream. “Dream, dream, dream, dream”. The floors, the doors, the decor struck me to the core. Well thought of spaces detailed with care. This place had everything. I willing to bet their chart has Cancer, Virgo, and Capricorn placements. Oh wait, that’s mine.
It checked all the boxes. Open and spacious, yet warm and cozy. Take a long soak in the claw foot 🛁. Morning ☕️ on the patio. Stroll down to Haystack for the chicken and waffles. Promise, nothing will disappoint. I was working this weekend but The Pate Cottage made me forget. I will definitely be back real soon. Thank you for sharing your beautiful, immaculate home with us.
P.s.- The parade really made our day! What a wonderful strike of good luck. We caught it all right from your stoop. ❤️ thanks again"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,We enjoyed our night here. Looking forward to more nights in the future.
2023-06-01,5,Group trip,The vintage cottage architecture with modern amenities was phenomenal. The stay was highly enjoyable with our only regret being not having a longer trip.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,Beautiful! Wonderfully decorated and very clean and cozy. Walkable to downtown locations. We enjoyed it very much and wish we could stay longer!
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,My husband and I stayed at the Pate Cottage while in town visiting family. The Pate Cottage in Sulphur Springs is right down the street from Sulphur Springs' downtown square. There are many restaurants and lots to do all within a short walk. The cottage is delightfully decorated while maintaining much of the historic character. Throughout the house are modern amenities as the house has been updated from one end to the other. The ping pong table added to the entertainment...and the competition.
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"Completely Unique! We loved our stay in this vintage cottage that is brand new. All of the rooms are spacious, the house is peaceful, and its location is so convenient to the downtown restaurants and events. We would definitely stay here again, and plan to use the ping-pong table when we do :)"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The place was big, homey, and clean. They had the softest towels in the bathroom. It was a nice neighborhood. Very quiet. Natalie was extremely accommodating. I will definitely be staying here again while in town."

2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,What a fun little place to stay. The driveway was a little rough due to the rain but we made it! The ac was great and cooled us off from fishing. It’s a very peaceful place even though it’s right off the highway.
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,Great place for an overnight with the kiddo. He loved being right on the pond. Fish until dark wake up and do it again.

2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My husband and I had a wonderful getaway at Eagle Lodge. The place was great for the two of us and was relaxing for us on the lake. The location seemed remote when you were there, but it was actually less than 5 minutes from local restaurants and grocery stores. James communicated very well and was gracious with our check-out time. We would love to return in the future!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Lovely place to stay while visiting family. Very peaceful, great place to get away from it all. Definitely would recommend. Will be coming back"

2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,My friend and I stayed here for a few days and it was wonderful. James was very nice and responsive. The place looked just like the pictures and the lake was beautiful.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,Such a great getaway spot! Went on the boat and enjoyed the sunset while fishing. So cozy and at home in the cabin☺️
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"James' place was just what I needed to get away for some alone time. Had all the amenities I needed, and was clean and comfortable. The view from the porch was amazing! Fishing was not that bad either. Would highly recommend to anyone wanting to get away from the hustle and bustle but stay relatively close to DFW."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,Always stay here when we are in the area. Great place and James is always super helpful!
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay James was quick in helpful when I reach out to him the cabin was super clean in peaceful will be booking again a hidden gem
2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"Fabulous place, fabulous hosts - first off, I accidentally only booked for one night when I thought I had booked for two. James was extremely understanding, and I was able to book for the second night immediately upon realizing my mistake. I appreciate that so much! I felt so badly about it.
Secondly, the space is fantastic. It is secluded, quiet, and has a beautiful lake in front. We loved using the kayaks, and the view of the sun setting from the kayaks was stunning. The inside was clean, easy to find things in, and there were lots of things provided like keurig pods, filtered water for the coffee, and a couple of water bottles. We loved our stay so much!!! We will be back!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Wonderful weekend, cute cabin love the deck right up on the water to fish"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,Wonderful place to get away. We will be back!
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The cabin is brand new and well-built with up-to-date electronics like YouTube (with no commercials!), USB charger on the clock, etc. Large screen TV was great. Indoor and outdoor lighting were very good with auto control. Kitchen had all we needed to do breakfast every morning. Walmart nearby if you need anything.

2024-01-01,5,Stayed one night,James was a very good host. The place was beautiful and very clean. I like how private the area was while still being 4 mins away from fast food places and stores. It’s definitely worth the money and James is very good at answering any questions you may have about the place! Thank you for the wonderful stay!
2024-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"Right on the water. Very quiet, I hadn't realized how loud my life had become until the noise was gone. This allowed for an excellent nights sleep.
Excellent water pressure for bathing. You will need to bring your favorite water to drink. A gallon of water is supplied for the Keurig. (Bring your own pods. A couple are supplied, but if you are staying for one night, you will need them.)
The two person rocker on the porch will allow for that couple time the most of our lives don't really allow for.
Go. Enjoy. Recharge."

There is not a corner, nook or crannie that doesn’t make you feel wrapped up in a blanket of love! It is charmingly decorated and supplied with all essentials including the things we often forget to pack. It is nestled on acreage that brings peace and tranquility. Truly the sky is even prettier here. The icing on the cake is truly the icing on her homemade, hand delivered cinnamon rolls - amazingly scrumptious! Everyone can benefit a stay at their favorite Auntie’s house and that is exactly how you will feel here, I certainly did. A night of infinity stars review and can’t wait for my next visit!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The cabin was a delight - clean, light, very well-appointed! Felicia truly thought of everything you might need. From the hot chocolate basket, a cabinet full of games, and the pantry full of snacks we were very well taken care of. The antiques and furnishings were lovely, and cleverly disguised conveniences like charging ports at each night stand.
We love the square in Sulphur Springs - great shops and dining. We’d come up to see family, and enjoyed our time there in town.
And honey - those cinnamon rolls are the BOMB!! I kid you not, we couldn’t stop talking about them. Fantastic!
Aunty Anna’s was wonderful, I highly recommend it and will stay there again. If I ever ran away from home, I’d head straight there - it was that great!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Auntie Anna’s Retreat was so beautiful and comfortable. The decor is beautifully decorated with quilts and historical items. Felicia has not missed dotting all i’s.

Auntie Anna’s Retreat is definitely the best airbnb we have ever stayed in as well. We hope to return for another visit one day.
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We enjoyed our stay at Felicia’s place immensely, it was the most peaceful 4 days we have ever had! The house will always be a slice of heaven for me, it was peaceful, cozy and extremely comfortable. Felicia was the most welcoming and friendly host, I feel that I have gained a friend in her!

2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"WONDERFUL, adorable, peaceful and comfortable!! My husband and I have fallen in love with Felicia's country retreat! She is a fantastic hostess and a kindred spirit with our love of quilts. We will definitely return the next time we are in the area!!!"

Loved having the chickens on the property. The fire pit and barbecue in the back we really enjoyed as well. We look forward to staying here again soon."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"My wife and I booked this stay on a last minute whim for our fourth wedding anniversary. We’re simple people who love simple getaways. We thought the listing was attractive, peaceful, and very affordable. However, when we arrived, it more than exceeded our expectations. Everything was charming, pristine, and comfortable. We felt immediately at home. The views from all sides and various outdoor seating areas allowed us to truly kick back and relax. The host, Felicia, was excellent and friendly. She brought us cinnamon rolls for breakfast one morning, and even brought us over a carton of eggs when we feared the hen in the chicken pen. She kept the cabin stocked with snacks, water bottles, and a pitcher of fresh lemonade. She also had chocolate covered strawberries waiting for us as a small anniversary gift. This was by and largely my BEST airbnb experience, and I have had many airbnb stays across the world. I highly recommend!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Beautiful place with beautiful scenery. Felicia helped us with booking and even worked with us when we didnt make the first night.

2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"Picturesque. Quaint. Charming. Welcoming. The list of descriptors is endless. While studying the options on AirBnB, I knew by seeing the pictures online, by reading the information provided, and by receiving a very positive & timely response from the host when I had an initial question, that this was the place where I'd book our stay. However, there is no way, without seeing it, that one can absorb the totality of Auntie Anna's Retreat. It is jaw-dropping gorgeous. So much attention to detail has been given! The depth of the amenities, the variety of snacks, the many extras for the purpose of comfort ... it really is a 'see it to believe it' kind of stay. While on property, we had the fortunate opportunity to meet the husband & wife team who together dreamed up this retreat, & they are absolutely delightful! She is the epitome of a gracious, southern host, & he is a very high quality, custom home builder. This equates to a perfect combination. Book it! You'll love it!"

We’ll be back! ❤️"

2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,Beautiful area. Adorable little tree house. I have terrible service on my phone so I didn't get the clean up notification of where to put dirty linen until well after we were gone but that's more of a carrier issue than anything else. Our sincerest apologies for that! The place was immaculate and just so cozy and just all around romantic and peaceful. The views were spectacular and the whole place was absolutely breath taking.

They had mostly everything you need for a short visit in the woods."

2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"Perfect blend of rustic charm and luxury—everything was exactly as described and pictured, and there were many happy surprises, like a roof overhang over the hammock deck so we could even enjoy it in the rain. Setting was magical. Design was incredibly beautiful and thoughtful throughout. Hammock with outdoor pillows was amazing, bed was beautiful and comfortable, kitchen had everything we needed (fridge was small for a 12” pizza box; bring your own ice), bathroom and outside tub/shower were gorgeous. Loved the many artistic touches and multiple upgraded lighting options. Be careful on stairs when raining/wet! Treehouse was closer to main road than we had imagined it would be. Overall five stars; we will definitely be back!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This cozy treehouse was a peaceful oasis outside of the hustle and bustle of the city. We were visiting the area to attend a concert within the city, and it was so nice to have a basecamp to come back to that we knew would be quiet and relaxing.
The bed was amazingly comfy, the showers were spacious and soothing, and the view was beautiful. We also really enjoyed cooking on the grill on the deck. We're even considering getting one of our own!
We'll definitely miss waking up slowly to the birdsong and breeze blowing through the trees in the morning. If you're travelling to Dallas but are wanting more nature over city life, this is the place to stay!"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This treehouse is amazingly thoughtful and creatively designed and well built. They thought of every little detail. Super fun, cozy, tucked in the trees, everything you need, and absolutely awesome. The stay was everything I hoped for and more. Absolutely recommend and would definitely stay again. Thanks Aaron and Niki y'all did a great job, thanks again so much."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed one night,Aaron and Niki’s place was beautiful! I loved looking out into the woods and hearing the birds sing. The treehouse was very cozy and had all that we needed for a quick getaway. Thank you so much for everything!
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,.
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place was AMAZING! A perfect relaxing weekend was spent here. We enjoyed the shower, tub, hammock, swing, cooking, & the bed was so comfy! The kitchen area is small so keep that in mind if you’re going to make a big meal. We managed just fine with the outdoor ninja! There are neighbors close, but we didn’t see anyone! It was quiet at night, but Saturday there was some construction noise? Not a big deal though as inside you can’t hear much outside. The shower & bath area was wonderful! Just a tip- make sure to turn on the fan as it will get very humid/ steamy in the whole tree house. Another thing to note- if you have a service dog it might be challenging if your service dog is big due to the stairs. I luckily opted to bring my smaller service dog so it was no issue to carry her up, but if I would have brought my bigger service dog- it would have been an issue getting her up there. The host was understanding about my service dog which was much appreciated!"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"The treehouse was a perfect over-nighter for us to enjoy time away without laundry and dishes and other work staring into our faces. We could have stayed there much longer. We hated to leave, even temporarily, but the restaurant suggestions were great.
We want to go back lots and use the coolest showers! Thank you for providing such a Lux place that we can afford to experience!"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great, cute place. I would stay there again."

2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The accuracy of everything was amazing. The cleanliness of the cabin was great . I took my husband for his 39th bday celebration and I requested for some special details inside and without hesitation they completed the task!
2024-02-01,5,Stayed one night,What a beautiful place to get away from it all! It was perfect and I couldn’t have enjoyed my stay anymore. Very well maintained and beautifully decorated. Thanks for the excellent communication as well.
2024-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"Really lovely place. Very romantic. The bathroom is amazing including the outdoor shower. So many, thoughtful and beautiful details everywhere. It’s even prettier than the pictures. All you see is trees and pastures through every window! The grill is awesome and the kitchen is small but well organized with everything you need. Except don’t forget to bring food! There are not a lot of restaurants or stores nearby. Aaron and Niki were very kind and extremely responsive- even late at night about a streaming question. Really nice hosts who have created an artful and peaceful little haven within easy driving distance of Dallas. We will definitely be back. Thank you so much A&N!"

Will definitely be recommending this place to anyone wanting a unique relaxing weekend!"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place was so beautiful and cozy! It was exactly like in the pictures. My fiancé and I are from Miami and we were celebrating our anniversary on what seemed like the coldest weekend Dallas and surrounding areas have had in a while. Nonetheless, this place was really cozy and welcoming and we were able to enjoy this treehouse even when it was freezing outside. It snowed so we got to have some fun outside, watch the birds, enjoy nature and the swing just right below the treehouse. We would definitely recommend this place. We had a magical weekend ♥️"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I would stay again hoping to see all the birds including a glimpse of two great Horned Owls. I would return to sleep in the big cushy bed and have a rain shower while looking out to the woods. I would return due to its proximity to Lake Tawakoni Wildlife Areas and State Park. I look forward to returning. Spiral staircase is tight but I smiled every time I circled up or down. I felt like a lucky kid playing in a fancy treehouse - which is exactly what went down. Thanks Aaron and Niki for a wonderful experience!

2023-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"We LOVED our stay here in this remote little treehouse. The design, architecture and layout of everything is beautiful, well thought out and there was an attention to detail for sure. We especially appreciated the fan, swiveling tv and the candles. Aaron and Niki were responsive and had clear instructions to get in. This spot also had a great view. We were expecting to use the outside tub but it is actually more of an outside shower and would have been a very tight squeeze for 2 so we didn’t use it, but the indoor shower was beautiful nonetheless!
We will definitely recommend to friends to come for a cozy getaway in the woods!"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My stay at UpCountree Cabin was absolutely perfect! The cabin itself is cozy, modern, clean, well decorated, and 8 feet in the air! I especially loved the netted hammock (also suspended high in the air) and the 2 rain shower heads in the bathroom. Aaron & Niki themselves were the best hosts as well! They even responded pretty late at night when the WiFi went out and I asked for help to reset it. I would very highly recommend both these hosts and their cabin to anyone wanting a top tier stay!"

Hosts were really cool to talk to. We loved every detail of our stay, from the string lights, to the swing, to grilling some steaks, to enjoying movies and relaxing in the tub, we loved our stay. This place was very intentionally built for comfort, romance, relaxation, and crafted for lasting memories."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great stay in a newer, elevated (treehouse style) cabin in a very secluded location. Not many amenities in the immediate are. But if you are looking to detach from everyday life for a night or two, this is a great option. The interior is very cozy, much like a studio apartment. Nice finishings and amenities. Very nice, spacious bathroom and shower. Only challenge was the spiral staircase up to the front door. We had a great overnight getaway. Easy drive from DFW in just over an hour."

I reached out to them very last minute as I was on a cross country road trip and needing a place to rest for the night. They were able to get the treehouse ready for me within just a couple of hours the same day. I’m so glad they did! The treehouse was so comfortable, I loved all of the fun details that were added from the swing to the bathtub on the deck and especially the double waterfall shower."

My wife made several comments about the wonderful bathroom and how soft the towels were. Once we noticed the Ninja grill, we made a trip into town and bought a few steaks to eat in instead of going out. I am a big bbq guy and have many smokers/grills but this little guy impressed me for sure. Steaks turned out perfect every time with a hint of smokey goodness! I have already recommended this beautiful place to family and friends."

2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"It was magical. We didn’t want to leave! The only thing that stunk was picking all of the beetles and spiders out of the outdoor shower. It had a cover but they still get in. It was well worth it though, to shower outside! They had everything you could need. Everything was clean and white. The local coffee shop, Sacred Grounds, in Lone Oak was our first stop every morning. Super nice folk in the area. We got the chance to go to a dance hall and swing plus catch a Kenny Chesney tribute band! I can’t wait to go back. If we could buy this place we would."

We went into Lone Oak to eat several times. Stampede Pizza was our favorite, but we enjoyed The Grill and Sacred Grounds Coffee, as well.
Aaron & Niki were very responsive. They were able to let us check in a bit early, and communicated the instructions for check in and out clearly.

From the pictures I fell in love ....I reached out to her about dates and heard back almost immediately even though it was late at night! They were SO friendly over message, the best kind of hosts. The place itself was lovely, a very relaxing needed getaway for two. A very romantic place for couples! We will DEFINITELY be back!"

2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Me & my husband were looking for the perfect getaway to spend our marriage anniversary. Aaron’s and Niki’s cabin went above and beyond what we were looking for. It’s the cutest, most romantic place in the country. We enjoyed how cozy the cabin feels, we enjoyed lying down and relaxing on the outside hammock while listening to sounds of nature. We enjoyed a donut shop nearby and sonic for desert. We loved the king size bed, it was so comfy and we enjoyed how it’s facing a big window where you can see the forest trees. We enjoyed the magical bathroom, where there was 2 waterfall showers and an outdoor tub. We relaxed lots in the outdoor tub and fell asleep there or read books. We loved the movie selections of dvds in the cabin. Everything far exceeded our expectations and we will definitely be returning!"
2023-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,"I love romance and I love the outdoors! Staying here gave me and my husband the best of both. The outside was stunning and the inside nothing short of luxurious! The top 3 things for us was the outdoor built in hammock (its huge), the comfortable king size bed, and the outdoor bath/shower. We placed candles by the bath and enjoyed the hot water in the cold breeze...a truly romantic evening. We will absolutely be coming back!"

2024-04-01,5,Group trip,"This place is a lovely little slice of Sulphur Springs. Troy was so responsive and quick to allow us to change plans to see the solar eclipse. The cons are a lot of flies since you’re near a cow field, but otherwise it’s great!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Troy's place was perfect. We were in town for our Niece's wedding and Troy's place allowed us to stay with our kids and grandkids in one place. We do lots of AirBnB stays and often the beds and pillows leave something to be desired - Troy's beds had a nice cushy memory foam topper that prevented us from going home with neck and back aches. We know that often it doesn't make sense for renters to spend that little extra money on these types of details, but they are much appreciated. We also had good internet we we were able to work remotely which was also nice. You won't be disappointed in this stay!"

The house was a great place for this large group to gather. The home is inviting and has historic charm. The beds were comfortable, and the house was equipped with everything you would need. It is within walking distance to the charming downtown Sulphur Springs, which was still decorated for Christmas.
Our group would not hesitate to book this space again.
You don’t find beautiful, endearing Airbnbs like this often."

Thank you!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,Thank you for allowing us to stay. It was beautiful and a perfect location.
2023-11-01,5,Group trip,This has to be one of the best surprises ever. The home was perfect in every way. Comfortable and cozy. Had everything we could ask for and such a great location . We really did not want to leave . I have a VERY picky daughter in law and she was overwhelmed at what a great place this was. She was the last to leave. Wanted one more bath in the claw footed tub! Planning a girls trip now with friends from High School !

2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,The house was beautiful and just a block away from shops and dining. Only thing I wasn’t expecting is there is no showers. Only claw tubs with a shower attachment which was fine for us girls but my husband had a hard time with that. He also said the downstairs bed felt like we were sleeping on the floor. The home was so beautiful and has so much elegance. They carefully consider us ladies for sure with the small amenities like make up remover wipes and a black face towel! Extra points for that!

There was something going on in the middle of town square every night we were there. One night a movie was played on a large blow up screen and the next night there was live music. There were many little boutiques to shop at and unique places to eat! Highly recommend the Italian place and you have to have dessert!!! This was a girls trip to the Bookworm, Colleen Hoovers bookstore! It was amazing!
The house itself is an experience of its own. It is like taking a step back in time! From the beautiful chandeliers, to the wallpaper, to the 3 claw foot soaker tubs this house it has everything needed for a girls weekend of relaxation. If you forget your bath bombs buff city soap in on Main Street and has plenty to chose from. The gentleman worker there said he was a graduate for OU but don’t hold that against him! Go POKES! Highly recommend this host as she was very easy to get in touch with and was amazing! She checked in several times and recommend things that she was aware that were going on! Such a great weekend!

Pantry was well stocked as well. Comfortable bedding in all the large bedrooms. Callie Jayne is very nice to work with.
Beautifully decorated home, incredibly well appointed, clean and very comfortable. A wonderful experience.

2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This house is simply gorgeous. It is well appointed and has plenty of space for a family gathering. The location is perfect and just a short walk to the downtown Main Street. The check in was seamless and easy, and the host was very easy to communicate with. We will definitely be staying here again when we are in town."
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We enjoyed a week stay in this beautiful Victorian home. The house was impeccably clean, and there were even welcome snacks when we arrived. You can't beat the location, a short two block walk to all the downtown attractions. We will definitely be back!"

2024-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,We had a wonderful stay at Felicia’s. The home is so charming and inviting. Felicia has a welcoming touch! Everything is so clean and fresh. We needed a home away from home and that’s exactly what she offered.

2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I have stayed in many Airbnbs for work and personal travel. This has to be in my top five places I’ve ever stayed. Most places definitely cut corners to get a place on the market, but it was not the case here. The home was very clean and well stocked! The host was very helpful and gave a detailed list of what and where everything was at the house. I loved this place and will definitely be staying again next time I’m in the area. I highly recommend this place!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,My family and I needed somewhere to stay for a month until our house was finished. This house was perfect for the long stay and Felicia communicated very well and responded as soon as I reached out to her. Definitely recommend this place for anyone looking to stay in Sulphur Springs.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The minute you walk into the house, you realize it isn't a house, it is a loving warm hug from a proper southern Aunt that welcomes everyone into her home for a home cooked meal and fun times. Our Host was so thoughtful with small extra's that made us feel like a beloved family member. The house is very family friendly with games (both indoor and outdoor), a fire pit (with wood provided) a grill and a kitchen that looks like it stepped off the page of Southern Living magazine. This place is perfect for a girls get-a-way weekend, or a family gathering to enjoy all the great restaurants and shops in and around Sulpher Springs. We didn't want to leave!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,We had a wonderful stay at the half lady! Our family enjoyed spending time together in the open space inside and out! Mary is so friendly and was available for all questions. We will be back! 💜

2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"The Half Lady is a wonderful place to stay. Mary was a great and friendly host, check in was easy, and the bunkhouse was very clean. Walking the property in the early morning was a great and very peaceful start to my day. My biggest complaint is that I couldn’t stay longer. I can’t wait to come back!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Is a great place for a guys get away and if you want to unplug from devices. It is just a very simple layout and for people that dont need entertainment and can handle not having ceilings or doors to the rooms.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"A great stay & a lovely host! Very clean and open space. Wifi was very weak, but no other issues — it was clearly a spot with a lot of intention put into it. Thank you Mary!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,Mary's little spot in the woods was absolutely amazing. Felt right at home and perfectly as described. communication from the moment I viewed and asked questions and up to checkout. Wish we could have stayed longer but will look for another stay there if a future trip comes up. Thank you so much.

2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We stayed at Mary’s with our six kids on our way to and from our spring break destination. It was unique—felt a bit like glamping with the bunkhouse style. Rooms were very comfortable, we were able to cook meals for our family, and our kids loved the puzzles. We would definitely stay here again if we end up in the area!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,We were arriving when it was dark so Mary turned on the porch light for us. We slept great! It was only 5 mins from the family we were visiting. We only showered and slept there. Worked great for us! I would stay there again!
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,We loved our stay at The Half Lady! Great set up for our family of 8.

2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Half lady is a great place for who wants to stay in the nature, there was a pond nearby and a hammock as well to relax. Also there is a BbQ grill and Fire pit outside the house to chill and enjoy. Overall a good experience!"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Had a quick one night stay while attending a wedding near by. The place was very roomy and Mary was extremely accommodating and friendly.

Highly recommend!"

2024-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"My only regret was not being able to stay longer. I’ve stayed in several places and this was one of the best - great cabin, rustic yet modern, spacious yet cozy, nicely decorated and well appointed. The only complaint is internet. Wifi was available but not great at all. i’ll be back for sure!"

2024-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"My wife and I had a rare opportunity to spend the night away from the kids and chose to stay at the Half Lady to get some ideas for a future barndominium we plan to build.
It was a great stay. It's pretty quiet and very clean. Unfortunately it rained all day so we didn't get to go fishing but the rain on the metal roof was peaceful for a night away. We will definitely recommend to friends and family."
2024-01-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"A wonderful property, in the county and just moments from the city. An open concept with lots of space and all of the necessities. We'll be happy to visit again."
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I have stayed here quite a few times now. I plan on staying the next time I'm in town. I would definitely recommend the Half Lady to anyone staying in the area.

Thanks for sharing Mary"

2024-01-01,4,Stayed with a pet,"Had a very good time! Beautiful land and the house was very well cleaned on the inside. The only downside we had with our stay was the DVD player only plays movies in black & white. My husband and I did try to see in the settings was good, which the setting where on the right settings for both TV and DVD. But we still overall enjoyed our time out there. I loved that the place was about 5 minutes away form the gas station. I would most definitely stay here again."
2024-01-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"perfectly private, open concept space and large yard area.
Mary was super kind to us when we got cancelled on twice by other hosts.
the area is super cute!
would stay again"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Mary was a great host! Her place was very open and nice. We had it over Christmas and on Christmas Eve was check in and she offered for us to drop off stuff at 11:30 even though she was still cleaning from last stay. Beds were comfy and everything was clean. Kitchen was adequate for what was needed. Fishing pond we tried but no luck but it made my 8 year olds day. And at the end she gave him two poles that were left behind which made that day! Thank you Mary for a great place to stay over the holidays. Happy new year!
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Perfect getaway for our small family gathering. Mary was very helpful and the place was clean.

2023-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Everything went very smooth for our stay. From the ease of finding the place, to getting in, to checking out. Very easy and efficient. Great quick stay"
2023-11-01,4,Stayed with kids,"This is a charming place to stay. It's definitely the kind of place you would have for a girls' trip or if you have a large family. There really isn't much privacy on the inside of the home. You hear everything, and there is always a light shining through the tips of the rooms if anyone else is awake. You can not be intimate here if there is anyone else staying with you. However, the kitchen is beautiful, there were board games, the couches are so comfy, there is plenty of space, and it's in a peaceful location."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Mary's place never disappoints
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We stayed at The Half Lady and it was a great time! Plenty of space for a family of 6-8! Fire pit was great for roasting marshmallows, beautiful views! Thanks Mary!"

2023-10-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"I stayed here for one night while travelling through town. Mary was very kind and responsive! The place was fantastic, comfortable furniture, and beds! The kitchen had everything I needed to cook. I would definitely stay again, if in the area."

2023-10-01,5,Stayed with a pet,We had a great weekend at the Half Lady. Beautiful scenery and well kept property. Mary was very nice.
2023-10-01,5,Group trip,"Thanks Mary, what a great space to accommodate our party of five. Open spacious layout with large kitchen island was perfect. Bedrooms and bathroom were clean and plenty of towels and amenities throughout. The place was easy to find, quite, and we caught several fish out back in the pond (released back of course). Would definitely stay here again and recommend it to anyone — especially with a big group."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Fabulous communication, wonderful relaxing stay."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with a pet,It is a beautiful place.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,The Half Lady was by far one of my all-time favorite AirBNB's we have stayed at. It is very unique and was very cozy! We loved that there were 4 bedrooms to accommodate us 4 ladies giving us our individual sleeping areas. Mary was a great host and was very responsive. We highly recommend The Half Lady!
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The place was as described in the posting. very nice and spacious
2023-09-01,4,Stayed with a pet,"All I can say is location ,location, location!!! Beautiful sky's, quiet and peaceful. Had a great time with my children. Owners are less than 15 yards from you with their home. The niebor's across the road 10 yards away from your cabin door let their dog's run free. If you bring a pet, be on the lookout for their pitbull dog's to cone and bark you back into the cabin from your walk with your dog. The place was really well decorated with lots of amenities, but needed a good cleaning."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Mary's place was super comfortable, spacious, welcoming, and peaceful. Intrigued by the Half Lady! swinging on the hammock was blissful. Price is more than fair, excellent well worth it."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Our kids had a great time! Big open area was fun for play. Close to downtown Sulphuric Springs. Recommend!
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,Amazing house everything exceeded my expectations. I would definitely stay again.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"My stay at Mary's place was just a short stop on a long road trip but it was a very welcome getaway as everything was top notch. Great communication and easy instructions from Mary. The house is remote and a great place to stay if you wanna get away from it all. I was initially worried that I might have a hard time finding the location because I was arriving late at night, but it actually was a breeze to locate the place. The surroundings are nice and quiet. I love the layout and the design of the space. It was a hot night but the AC was blowing nice and cold when I arrived. The space had tons of room with a large, well-stocked kitchen and several bedrooms. Everything was well decorated and very clean. I felt right at home and would definitely stay there again!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Love this place very clean and private,will be staying there again when visiting my daughter college"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,This is the second time we stayed at this location and both times have been well worth it.

2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful property and beautiful house! Loved our stay and Mary was a great host.
2023-07-01,5,Group trip,"Beautiful, peaceful & relaxing. Just what we all needed. The moment we stepped in, we were astounded at how spacious & roomy it felt. We will be coming back."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"Mary's space was exactly what my work crew and I needed. The space and solitude was just right. Wish we could have stayed longer to take advantage of the beautiful surroundings, grill out and go fishing. She was very accommodating and provided welcoming accomodations that were clean and easy to access. Will definitely stay again whenever I am back in the area. Thanks Mary!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"great peaceful place, highly recommend. loved listening to the rain on a tin roof. we would definitely stay again."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We loved our stay. We even hope for future trips that The Half Lady is available for us to stay again!
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We loved staying at Mary’s place!! Super cute set up, clean, Mary was very responsive and friendly!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,Mary was very responsive and certainly added personal touches that stood out. Highly recommend!!
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We had stayed here before and knew it would be perfect for us. Mary is very kind, friendly and accommodating. It's a great place to stay and the price is very reasonable. We love this place."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Lots of space and a great value.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We and our 2 dogs had a great night stay at The Half Lady ! It was over 100 degrees outside, and we were pleasantly surprised to find that the house was very cool inside upon arrival. The kitchen and bathrooms were well stocked and there was plenty of room to spread out. We’d definitely stay again if we’re passing through the area."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,Affordable and clean place to stay.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"This was hands down one of the best locations we've ever experienced with Airbnb. Surpassed all expectations and then some. Mary has put so much thought into every last detail of the stay and we were at a loss to find anything we wished we could change. The only tip I would give to future travelers is to use the room fans provided at the house for white noise or bring a sound machine-- the neighbors had a small dog that was very protective of their property and yapped into the night. Otherwise, this place was absolutely amazing and we will likely go out of our way to stay here again in the future every time we're on our way through NE Texas. Thank you, Mary, for an impeccable place!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"What a great place to take a break from the city! The space was functional and everything was well thought of for your comfort and convenience ! The bathroom has a lighted make up mirror! The personal touches like cookies and dog biscuits were very kind. You get more than what you expect or pay for. The kids enjoyed themselves too, especially the furry one ! We want to come back. Thank you Mary!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Booked this last minute as we had lost power at our home. Mary went the extra mile to get the place ready early for us to check in so we could get out of the heat of the day. Home is huge and really well decorated. Loved the personal touches like dog biscuits for our pups and cookies for the humans. Was really easy to find and loved the ""Half Lady"" lore and decor around the house. Everything worked well and we enjoyed the satellite TV. Would stay here again and definitely recommend for people who love a country setting that's only a few minutes from town."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Mary is a great host and her home is a unique delight. It is located just outside of Sulpher Springs and is very nice & relaxing after a long day on the road. Mary reached out with simple, detailed directions to her property and made sure everything was ready for us. Anytime I had questions Mary would reply quickly!
The house was not only unique and comfortable but also thoughtfully acquainted, like a small vanity in the bathroom that my wife loved as well as extension cords for your use if needed. It was a very hot day when we arrived but the AC was cold as ice and easily tackled the Texas heat. My wife and I enjoyed the leather couches and almost fell asleep in them watching TV, we had to drag ourselves out of them to head to bed. If you are looking for a place to conduct video conf calls, or need fast WiFi this place is not for you, however if you are looking for a peaceful place to unplug and enjoy nature in a beautiful setting, you can't go wrong with Mary & The Half Lady!"
2023-06-01,5,Group trip,Mary went above and beyond to accomodation us. Will be back
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Wonderful host and super space. Very nicely decorated and clean with lovely touches
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Very pleasant! Loved the land! Great dream builder. Overall COOL spot. We’ll be back.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"It’s always amazing to come back to a place that feels like home! The half lady always exceeds our expectations. We have gone to plenty of cabins here in Texas, but nothing beats the half lady. The amount of property that the cabin sits on is perfect for secluded enjoyment. So much space for the fur babies as well! Some cabins I have been to will excuse the dirty appliances or area since you are out in the woods or there’s always bugs around to keep clean enough , but the half lady is spotless and smells clean! Cleanliness here is top priority and it shows. We can’t wait to be back again soon! Mary is always a wonderful host."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"What a uniquely designed place! We were very impressed with the simple, clean, even elegant design so cleverly appointed and arranged! We were only there overnight, but the bed was comfortable, there were convenient places to open suitcases for in and out, and I can imagine families staying here as the space is large, uncluttered, & comfortable. Thank you, Mary, for stopping to check that everything was okay for us. We loved your place!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"We absolutely loved this place we are stopping back for a couple day on our way back from San Antonio half way point to Heber Springs AR
This place is amazing so comfortable, definitely recommend. Dogs love the running space. We all felt at home.
Mary was a super host and helpful with any questions we had (guiding responses) thank you for having us, see you soon."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Can not say enough great things about our stay at The Half Lady and the wonderful host Mary! We are traveling so only stayed one night and we did not want to leave. Pictures do this place no justice! So beautiful and peaceful. We enjoyed fishing, grilling, sitting by the fire, lots of room to run around outside for our kiddos and dog then going inside to a very cozy and comfortable home. Super clean, great beds… seriously the best place!
We have decided to use this place as a half way meeting place for our family in Arkansas and can’t wait to come back and stay again."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"Beautiful, peaceful location much needed after a long drive! Had everything we needed. Thanks Mary!"

2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Excellent accommodation. Awesome host.
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We only stayed one night as part of our cross-country road trip and Mary’s place was the best place to rest our heads. The space is huge, spotless and well appointed! Gorgeous property. Thanks so much for sharing your space with us, if only briefly!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This place is fabulous! It was just as Mary described and she was a perfect host. She even brought us a bottle of wine! The loft-like feel to the interior was new and exciting. It is more than fully furnished, there’s nothing you will need. The art and the furnishings were fresh and eclectic. Pay attention to the dressers and chests, not one is the same and they’re all interesting. Comfortable couches, comfortable beds, comfortable kitchen.
There is so much land for you to roam (and a pond with bench and hammock), our dog Dolly was thrilled. And the legend of the Half Lady made evening walks exciting.
We definitely recommend Mary and her lovely home and hope to be able to stay at the Half Lady again!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We loved our stay at the Half Lady. We were in need of some quiet and relaxation and this was just the ticket! Visited our favorite state park, Cooper Lake State Park while there and had a wonderful time. The house was larger than expected and comfortably appointed. We had everything we needed and great communication from our host. We hope to stay again sometime!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,We absolutely love the place my husband and his brother couldn't quit talking about the design. My boys enjoyed the country life.
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,We enjoyed our stay at the Half Lady. Mary’s place is not listed as handicap accessible but my husband is bound to a wheelchair and it worked very well for us. The only step is a very small one at the front door and we just pulled up to the porch so his lift could land on it. All doorways are wide enough and the shower could be if you bring a shower chair with you. We were very pleased with this place!!
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,Quiet and peaceful
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,We had such a great time staying at Mary’s place! It was so spacious and comfortable. Very relaxing. Would definitely recommend this place.
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Mary’s property was exceptionally stellar, especially at the price she has it listed for. It was very large, clean, and full of amenities. Mary’s touch of hospitality was very welcoming, from keyless entry (code provided prior to arrival) and a complimentary bottle of wine that my wife and I enjoyed after a long day of driving. Fresh towels, sheets and kitchen eatery. The property outside the home is large, clean, and gives you a nice feel of nature. If I’m ever in the area again I would most definitely stay here again, and I would say it’s the best AIRBNB I’ve stayed in under $300/night. Cheers!"

I would definitely stay here again!"
