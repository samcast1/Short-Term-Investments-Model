This house was adorable, very comfortable, quiet and close to everything we wanted/needed. We only had 1 negative, missed having Granny's Breakfast casserole.

2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This place was all we were needing and more. The neighborhood is quiet and felt very safe. The yard is gorgeous. The house says it can hold 8 guests and truly can. So many times a number like that means someone is sleeping on the floor on a mat and half of the people are standing up to eat. Not so in Jeffrey’s home. He thought of everything and had amenities stocked we never knew how much we would appreciate, even a cabinet filled with dishes specifically geared towards kids. And books. So many books. Which our family loves. We’d definitely stay at Jeffrey’s place if we end up in the area again."

2020-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This house is beautiful - it’s quaint, with a touch of classic and modern. The hosts add little treats in the fridge and cabinet and have everything you’d expect, like great bedding and towels, to amenities you may not, like an indoor and outdoor seating area, pots and pans, hairdryer, great TV area, and a very modern kitchen. The house comes with wifi and everything is very user-friendly, from ease of check-in to communication and check-out — all airbnb’s should be like this."
2020-03-01,5.0,Group trip,This place is a gem! Extremely clean and very comfortable. We had a party of 6 adults and we had plenty of room. Jeffery has lots of added touches to make your stay comfortable. You definitely will want to try out the breakfast casserole that is provided. We were there to see a concert at WinStar. It was very easy to get an Uber to take us back and forth. We will definitely stay here again for our next trip this way! You will not be disappointed!
2020-02-01,5.0,Group trip,"Amazing house with every amenity you could want. The location is perfect a quick short drive to winstar. Jeffrey has the house setup so cozy with every detail to make you comfortable!

2019-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Look, I've stayed in a lot of Airbnb's, and if you're reading this, it must be available for your needs, so the best advice I can give you is to stop reading this and book Melody Lane right now before someone else gets it and you miss out on a great experience. Amazing space, amazing amenities, a great location, and a great host. I'd stay here again in a heartbeat."
2019-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Unbelievably lovely. Hope we can get back there again. Thanks Jeff for everything.

2018-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We took a chance with this property and were over-the-moon happy here! We needed lodging and a place to meet each evening after a weekend horsemanship clinic and found this to be a perfect choice. Beautifully decorated, quality furnishings and appointments and a truly home-away-from-home feel.
We thoroughly enjoyed the time we spent before and after our horse clinic each day. Lovely; so much better than having separate rooms at a hotel.
P.S. That morning casserole was a huge hit with our riders!"

2018-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Jeffrey's place is amazing. You will feel right at home in this immaculately kept, well-appointed home. The attention to detail is unmatched. He has thought of everything a guest might need . . . from the well-stocked kitchen including water, juices, soft drinks and snacks to the well-stocked bathrooms with an abundance of toiletries and towels. It was very easy to communicate with Jeffrey (even when I locked myself out!) This is by far the best property I have ever stayed in. You will not be disappointed."
2018-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My weekend here blew away any expectation I had about Air B&Bs, I'm already looking for an excuse to go back to the Winstar so I can stay here again"
2018-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"I had a golf event at the Winstar casino which is about 10-15 minutes from this house. It ended up not only being the perfect location, but an exceptional rental as well.
The house, which is in a quiet neighborhood, has every amenity you would need for a short or long stay. Large open kitchen was FULLY stocked with everything needed. Fridge had everything needed to cook and some. The home is very well furnished with comfortable and stylish furniture. Wi-fi is fast. Huge backyard that my kids played in for hours. AC was ice cold. Water was hot instantly. Wide driveway that parks you right at the front door under a carport that provides privacy.
The host was easy to contact and provided us all the info needed for an easy check in.
I highly recommend this house especially for families and groups of people looking for convenience and quiet."

2018-05-01,5.0,Group trip,"This house is the way to go if you are ever needing a place to stay when traveling to the Winstar world Casino and resort like we were. It’s located about 15 minutes away in a quiet neighborhood with friendly neighbors. Jeff provided all sorts of amenities during our stay that were a nice touch to a very stylish and CLEAN house. Jeff is very quick with his responses to anything that you might need while staying in the home. We will always stay with Jeff anytime we are traveling north up around the border, he made sure our stay was great, and having this place to stay at over any hotels in the area was a nice treat, we definitely recommend this home to anyone, very affordable price and very, very clean home! Thanks again Jeff!"

2017-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"205 Melody is a very well-appointed home in a quiet neighborhood and was a great choice for our weekend stay in Gainesville. This host provides guests with an easy check-in process, clean, comfortable and attractive decor and furniture and a generously stocked kitchen. We enjoyed our time with family this weekend and this host's thoughtful extras helped to make our stay a memorable one.

2017-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great house! Decor was perfect, great neighborhood. Very thoughtful extras that we didn't expect. Have stayed at different Airbnb properties and this is my favorite!"
2017-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"If I could rate our stay higher than 5 stars I would! Our stay was perfect and Jeffrey was amazing! I booked his place for my bridal party to have a place to stay and get ready for the wedding and when we walked into the house he had left me a congratulations note, glasses, champagne and even made us breakfast casseroles. How sweet is that!! The place was super nice and clean. We all loved it!"
2017-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great house. Jeffery easily let us extend our stay.
2017-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The house was wonderful. Very well stocked kitchen.
2017-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,What a surprisingly wonderful oasis in a little North Texas town. Centrally located between Dallas/Ft. Worth and Winstar Casino but away from the hubbub. Jeffrey makes you feel right at home. The amenities are spot on and the tasty breakfast casserole was amazing.
2017-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I don't know if all Airbnb hosts go to the lengths that Jeffery does as this was our first Airbnb experience. He has certainly set the bar very high!
I was somewhat trepidatious as I was traveling with my elderly Mom who has some physical limitations and meeting my brother and his wife who has some severe allergies. Jeffery's prompt responses to my questions put my mind at ease.
And once we arrived, WOW! His home is immaculate, more spacious than it appears in the profile photos and is flawlessly appointed with every need anticipated. From the selection of breakfast items (including Grandma's breakfast casserole) and the stocked refrigerator in the kitchen to the ceiling fans AND floor fans in every bedroom, Jeffery has thought of everything. He even had great dining recommendations for our family.
We had a relaxing, easy time enjoying each other's company and the comforts of home away from home. We are already talking about scheduling our next trip to Melody Lane."
2017-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful home, very inviting!
Well stocked & breakfast casserole was delish!!
We will definitely stay again."
2017-07-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"beautiful updated, modern house!
super well stocked. tons of food and drinks. very very clean. just about a 30 minute drive from Denton"
2017-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I was in Gainesville visiting family, and traveled with my daughter and three young children. The house was perfect for this, especially with one bedroom having double beds for the kids. We also loved the outdoor space, and the school playground directly behind the house was a nice bonus.
The house was nicely decorated without being overdone, and the kitchen is very welcoming with an island with bar stools (we spent a lot of time just hanging out in the kitchen).
Everything we needed was provided in the house, including many coffee choices, water and juice in the fridge, fruit, and homemade breakfast casseroles in the freezer ready to pop into the oven.
I travel to Gainesville quite often and would definitely stay here again."
2017-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My wife and I stayed with friends for 2 nights coming into Gainesville for our high school reunion. The home greatly exceeded our expectations. From the moment we walked in the door, we knew we had made the correct choice in staying with Jeffrey. The house had a fresh smell which was huge for my wife and we were blown away by the decor and work that had been done in the home. There literally was nothing not considered. From breakfast ready in the frig for two days to it also being stocked with water and juice. Snacks and several different coffees were available. Everything you could possibly need was stocked in the kitchen and bathrooms. The house is very clean, great layout and cozy. We enjoyed our stay and will without question stay here again. This is probably the best overnight spot in Gainesville, especially for the value. We all highly recommend Jeffrey's and promise you won't be disappointed."
2017-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"House is recently remodeled and immaculately kept. Great kitchen and bedrooms, and wonderful backyard for grilling, entertaining, and having a good time. Would absolutely recommend."

2017-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The home is beautifully remodeled. We felt at home immediately. What really made this stay amazing is the house is located next to a school. The neighbors were friendly, and the red cardinal family in the backyard was breathetaking. The outdoor area is by far the most memorable for my family. We sat out there for hours. Jeff went above and beyond to make our stay welcoming. We truly enjoyed the down time between events and it is located just 2 miles from the college."
2017-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is the best place in town! The inside has been completely redone and the pictures don't do it justice. There are blackout shades in the bedrooms, a modern kitchen, and a nice back patio with large back yard. Jeff was the most responsive host and far exceeded our expectations. He even provided breakfast for each morning of our stay! This will be our go to place when visiting. A+++"

2024-04-01,5.0,Group trip,"We just checked out of Amy’s house today and re-newed our reservation for the same weekend in 2025, so on its own, that says that we loved her house. It is huge and historic, and comfortable for 4 couples. The location a block or two from the downtown square, and in the middle of a beautiful historic district was a bonus. We’re already looking forward to next year’s stay, as well as the awesome bike tour and Germanfest in nearby Muenster!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Overall fantastic stay. Amy is incredibly responsive and easy to work with. Everybody enjoyed the stay and I would definitely look to book here again.

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We greatly enjoyed our stay at Livier’s historic home, which is as much a museum as a an air b and b. Lots of lovely antique items to admire, but the home is updated enough to include modern comforts. Livier had impeccable communication and the house was ready for us much earlier than we could get there. We had no issues during our stay except that it should be noted that the house is very close to busy train tracks. Might be worth throwing in some foam ear plugs to help dampen overnight train horns and whistles. Overall, this was a unique, convenient, and affordable place for my adult family members to stay while in town for a concert at the Winstar. Because of all the lovely and fragile items on display, I would not recommend this location for families with young children. It is a more formal space. We would definitely stay here again if we returned to the area."
2024-04-01,5.0,Group trip,I would rent this place again it was absolutely gorgeous. beds were very comfortable
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,I love old houses and this one did not disappoint. The entire family enjoyed the place and really loved all the memorabilia around the place. The side enclosed patio is a great spot to have quiet time and kick your feet up.

2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The owner was absolutely responsive and helpful; we also had to find a place that fit our needs for specific food prep, and this was perfect. The house was extremely unique homey and peaceful I would definitely stay there again when passing through Gainesville"

2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Great, historical house! Comfortable bed in Master bedroom, all around great booking. Be aware that a train track is nearby. A train will come by several times at night. Would definitely stay here again if booking in Gainesville."
2024-02-01,5.0,Group trip,"A great historic home. Had lots of historic artifacts. Lots of space for
3 couples. We didn’t get to enjoy as we had wished because of other
engagements, but would have loved to have been able to spend more of our day there.
Had a little in house wasp issue but she came right over and helped as much as possible.
It was a great comfortable stay!"
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Wow! This house exceeded all of our expectations! We were so fortunate to find Livier’s house on the way to Winstar to attend a concert. It was like a beautiful step back in time to be surrounded by such inspiring historical artifacts and furnishings. The ONLY thing wrong with this house was that we only booked it for one night! I would love to stay longer and really dissolve into the lifestyle of days gone by. I highly recommend staying here! I will be back and find an excuse to stay longer!
2024-02-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"The only reason for not giving 5 stars was the frequency of the trains. If we would have known about that aspect, we would have still come and enjoyed the home. Alot of history and very well maintained. My suggestion is to put the train and it's frequency in the description. That would not have altered or selecting the Home."
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Loved this gorgeous and spacious historic home. Great location and very comfortable. We went to a show at Winstar. We made dinner at the place before. Everything was great.

The whole house is gorgeous. The Airbnb was tucked away in a residential private area which my family and friends enjoyed. The house is full of historical unique well preserved things. It felt like we were stepping back in time but still offering us all the amenities that we needed for comfortable stay. The host is friendly and responsive as well. Our experience exceeded our expectations. The place is spacious, cozy and comfortable. We will definitely book at the same place again the next time when we go there for vacation. Highly recommended to anyone."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Absolutely loved staying here! The rooster and cows were a nice country touch! The neighbors are so friendly. It’s a beautiful neighborhood to go for morning or evening walks. We loved sitting on the porch playing guitar and singing in the evenings!

2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place was great for us and going to WinStar Casino for a concert. It’s a 20 min drive but an easy drive. The inside is amazing and was very clean and stocked. We were really impressed with the host and all the amenities she left for us. We didn’t walk to the lake but it looked very pretty. The animal life around the area will come visit and that makes it more fun.
I absolutely recommend this rental."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Stay the weekend! It was a short drive to the casino and to town. The house was absolutely adorable, very cozy and clean.

We loved it!"

You can hear a train in the distance but it’s nothing that keeps you up or is disruptive. There is room for two cars in the driveway and there is also street parking right out front. Really easy to get to—about an hour drive from DFW without traffic. Would stay here again if I’m in Gainesville.

2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Great place to stay while in town for a wedding. The layout was perfect for our family! My brother's family with 2 kids slept in the first two rooms, my parents in the master, and myself (a single) in the back room. There is definitely room to throw a air mattress down in the living room if needed. We had additional family come and visit during the day and it was big enough that everyone could relax comfortably. The place is larger then the pictures imply. The home was very clean and had all the things that we needed (and forgot - i.e. a blow dryer) The washer and dryer was a nice touch and utilized for someone who didn't have time to wash a few clothes before the trip. The location was perfect as well, we walked to a restaurant a couple blocks away for dinner one night. It was also close to the highway, as well as the zoo which we also visited. We feel very fortunate to have found this place and would book again in a heart beat if ever in the area again."
2022-09-01,5.0,Group trip,"Beautiful clean home very close to the quaint downtown area. Beds were comfy and the extras like snacks and waters in the fridge were great!

2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My dad, sis, BFF and I went up to visit some of the wineries in the area. The location of this house was perfect. We not only had easy access to the interstate but were also down the street from the town square which has cute shops and nice eateries - all within walking distance. It’s also around the corner from a beautiful historic neighborhood.
The space was very comfortable. Super clean with plenty of amenities. We felt safe and secure. Tommy was extra responsive and basically just a great host. We will definitely stay here again."

2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"A seamless and smooth visit from start to finish! Thomas is communicative and accommodating. My large family had a wonderful three-day stay as we gathered for a wedding in Whitesboro. The home has a nice and open-concept kitchen, dining room, and living room providing plenty of space for a pre-wedding family breakfast and for game nights. The four bedrooms allow for private and quiet areas. The home is tastefully decorated and has many amenities that made my stay easy. The yard is nicely kept and welcoming. I highly recommend this home and would stay here again."

Very spacious, private rooms with tons of storage and great common areas. We had 8 people so it was perfect for us. Clean and nice. Definitely five stars and the neighborhood was quite as well as easy access to all the main roads and several restaurants within walking distance. Just off the square is not an exaggeration.

2020-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We've stayed in many vacation rentals and this is one of the best places we've ever stayed! It was exceptionally clean, had wonderful amenities that many other places do not include (examples: extra blankets in eyesight, coffee filters and K-cups for our use, booster seats for our kids, nice big fluffy towels, etc.), and the layout and location of the home was perfect for our use. Highly recommend this home and would definitely stay here again."
2019-12-01,5.0,Group trip,We were completely thrilled with the house. Everything was so well appointed.

Tommy & Paula's tips for the town really came in handy and we didn't feel quite so lost. Their quick responses were super helpful, as well. The house itself is close to much so it gave us the opportunity to easily roam and browse the town.
All in all the stay in their home was amazing and we'll definitely be staying there for all our Winstar trips! If you're reading this and on the fence about where to stay in Gainesville, do yourself a favor and stay with Tommy and Paula!"

2024-04-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Looks just like the photos. We had some crazy storms roll through overnight and they offered us guest bedroom in another Airbnb for the night so we were safe. I will say, this dome is not sealed well so expect an extra amount of bugs. The amount of gnats all over the dome, bedding, and kitchen made our skin crawl. Not sure if they were in excess due to all the rain we have been getting but it was rough.
Hot tub and outdoor shower were great and very relaxing. I expecting the outdoors areas to be a little more put together. The dome was stocked with most the things we needed."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Clean and cozy! We really enjoyed our stay, hope to visit again and stay longer!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Amazing place to stay for someone trying to get away from the city. This place gives you that outdoors country feel, but has way more to offer than your regular hunting cabin. The host did an amazing job with instructions. Just wished we had the opportunity to stay a little longer. Our quick weekend getaway was a success and would love to come back. One of our friends on social media is already asking about this place and will be booking soon."

2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This was our first getaway as a couple. The photos do this place justice! We didnt want to leave. Lol We both loved everything about the skydome. Such a beautiful and peaceful environment to unwind and connect to each other. Cannot wait to book this place again for the summer.
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This was our very first getaway since we got married in 2020, and although it was 4 years too late, this stay made it all worth it! It was the best place to spend our anniversary. We even saw some rabbits running around while we soaked in the hot tub. Genuinely the picture perfect getaway. We will absolutely be coming back.
Side note - My husband is now obsessed with domes and wants us to live in one in the future 😅"

2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"What a hidden gem, so close to Dallas! If you’re looking to get out of the city and reconnect, this is the place to go! The host thought of every detail, and was available anytime you needed them.
I can’t wait to go back and rejuvenate!"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Easily one of the coolest Airbnbs we've stayed at. Such a cool experience to ""glamp"" in a geodome but with all the luxuries. The place was well-thought out from the design to the nice finishes and to the layout of the dome and the area around it. We walked the trails behind the dome and also enjoyed the hot tub. Charles and Laurie were very responsive and thoughtful -- while there wasn't thunderstorms like it was forecasted during our stay, they easily reassured us of a comfortable stay and even the light rain made it a much more relaxing stay. Definitely will come back!"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,If I could give this place a hundred stars I would! The atmosphere is so relaxing and romantic. It really set the tone with the jazz music very good touch! They had games for couples to play which was so sweet. Whatever you didn’t remember to bring Charles and Laurie thought of it! The little outside blankets were such a cute little idea! Even the puppy dog was so sweet he came and said hello while we were grilling! All around such a great experience and definitely need to come back soon! They also have cows we stopped and said hello to!
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The stay exceeded my expectations & looks even better in person. Loved it so much!
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,It was a amazing stay. The jacuzzi was really nice. The paper with the instructions and things to do were really helpful. It was a really good place to propose to my wife. Thank you guys for this amazing place. I recommend bringing a rubber ducky for the jacuzzi.
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Wow. That’s pretty much the only way to describe it. It’s just what you’re looking for if you to unplug and have a peaceful get away. You can only hear the birds chirp and trees blow in the wind.
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Very nice place to stay. This was the cleanest Airbnb we have ever been to. Instructions on how to get to the dome were very clear and easy to follow. Charles and Laurie were very responsive and friendly to communicate with. They left rose pedals on the bed and a bottle of sparkling apple cider, plus an assortment of snacks in the kitchen. We would definitely stay here again."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Definitely a beautiful place to go to disconnect from the busy life we have in the city.

2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This place is one of a kind! So peaceful being tucked off in the woods. Charles and Laurie are great hosts and responded within a timely manner to any questions we had. 10/10 recommend staying here.
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We loved Charles and Laurie's place! the dome was exactly as described with lots of little extras they thought of. blankets for the fire pit, hammocks outside, the heated blanket on the bed was absolute perfection. Very secluded area so a bit of a drive (30-45 mins) for anything but that's what we were hoping for, to disconnect and unplug. Loved walking I to such a peaceful space with Jazz music going and essential oils. just Perfection."
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"my husband and I loved this place. It was cozy, beautiful, comfortable, and peaceful. The hosts were very responsive and friendly, which made this stay even better. They gave many local recommendations, and when they didn't have an answer, they found things for us quickly."
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"An absolute gem, we enjoyed every bit of our stay. The host Charles and Laurie are so so kind and worked with us to ensure we were able to experience the Sky Dome. They truly went above and beyond from the cute petals for our anniversary to the amenities provided. I posted our stay on my snap and so many of my friends were like SEND ME THE INFO ASAP! Our favorite was taking the walk on the trail, there were flashlights, and plus a map provided. We definitely experienced exactly what we needed and expected from this trip.
P.S The outside shower seemed skeptical at first but it was in fact very private, WARM WATER and honestly therapeutic! during my shower a squirrel ran the tree. Hahah.
Thanks again Charles and Laurie!"

2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The absolute best place to stay for a weekend getaway. Walking in it was just as pictured, the bed was comfortable, the outdoor shower and jacuzzi were wonderful. All in all wonderful place, wonderful price. Will definitely stay again."
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Charles and Laurie’s place lived far beyond our expectations , this place was beautiful to say the least. We spent Valentine’s Day here and it was such a peaceful experience, being able to relax in the hot tub and be surrounded by the outdoors and having a shower outdoors before calling it a night was exactly what we needed. There’s so many of their own touches that come in handy throughout the house that show they really put thought into their place being a memorable one. As you can see , I’d love to come back for an extended stay next time."
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The SkyDome really is an oasis. Quiet and peaceful…a great place to unplug under the stars with something cold to drink in a hot tub. It’s outside the glow of any city, the sky really pops!
There were several personal touches we liked and did we mention peaceful? I loved not being accessible very well by the outside world.
Next time we will plan for time to walk the hiking trails on the property. We missed that option in our itinerary but it looks like we shouldn’t have. Something to look forward to!"

2024-01-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,We enjoyed our stay. We would reccomend to go in the spring or summer to get the full effect of the outside shower. It was too cold for me. However i loved the heated blanket. It was nice over all and great for photos.
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,SkyDome is a lovely place! The dome was cozy and decorated so beautifully. The outdoor shower was a first for us and we loved it. The attention to detail at the SkyDome shows and is done with a lot of love. Our mini getaway for our anniversary was so relaxing and perfect. We will be back!
2024-01-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Everything was as expected, only downfall was the shower froze and there wasn’t any other options for a shower on site. The outdoor shower was beautiful but I wouldn’t recommend going in the winter time. Any other time i would highly recommend 🩷"

2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Such a peaceful and beautiful place! Just like the photos. It was an amazing day. We will definitely be back!
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I made it a goal to stay in as many unique airbnbs as possible this year and let me tell you, this one is right at the top of my favorites. First off the pictures don’t do it justice. It was almost so beautifully done that I didn’t even want to put my stuff down and ruin the aesthetic! The dome itself is so incredibly unique but yet so homey feeling. At night when all was quiet, you could hear and see every leaf hit the dome, it was this incredibly serene sound almost like asmr. It was nature in surround sound! The amenities were flawless. The hot tub is always my favorite but I fell in love with the outdoor shower and decided my next home will have one. The water’s so hot that it didn’t even matter the exterior temp. Looking up at the lights and stars while you shower was just such an unexpected joy. The dome is tucked away off a quiet country road and private however there’s a six minute drive into a cute little town for great food. 10/10 stars for this immersive nature experience!"

2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,What a wonderful stay for a getaway in the woods!
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Staying at the Skydome, was the ultimate experience, I never knew I needed in my life! The beautiful scenery, the luxurious accommodations, and the outdoor shower was absolutely invigorating. I never thought I would be excited to take a shower in the woods, in December, but it was one of my favorite things. Charles and Laurie make you feel right at home. They supply everything that you’ll need. The dome is so beautifully decorated and we appreciated the perfect instructions to enjoy all the amenities. Do not wait, book this place immediately it’s truly heaven on earth. ❤️"
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This luxurious Skydome near Gainsville, TX is fabulous! We came to unwind from all the Thanksgiving holiday festivities, and it was the perfect place to relax, decompress, and feel like we were in an elegant, classy home-away-from-home in the midst of a peaceful, beautiful landscape! All the essentials are provided, and it is the perfect place to go ""glamping"" while still feeling like you're staying in a 5-star hotel. The outdoor shower is the perfect touch, and although we stayed here in late fall, we never felt too cold to enjoy the outdoor amenities, including the firepit and hot tub!
Charles and Laurie were in contact with us throughout our stay, and they were proactive in ensuring we had all the information we needed to make our stay comfortable and magnificent! Thank you for building such an amazing get-away on the outskirts of the DFW Metroplex maze! It was an absolutely wonderful experience, and we can't wait to do it again next year! It's our new after-Thanksgiving tradition!"
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Had a really good time!
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,The location is stunning and everything about it makes it a perfect getaway spot. Our only disappointment was that we weren’t able to stay longer!
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My husband and I stayed in the beautiful sky dome for our 8th anniversary, and it was just the getaway we needed! So peaceful, beautiful, and serene. We would recommend this luxury ""glamping"" experience to anyone who wants to escape real life for a few days and surround themselves with nature. Laurie and Charles were so accommodating and friendly...we couldn't have had better hosts!"
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We absolutely loved our stay here and we will definitely be back!
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Cozy & charming little hideaway. Great location if you’re looking to disconnect & escape the fast paced city life for an extended weekend. 10/10 recommend!
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was the absolute best honeymoon spot. It was all we could have hoped for and more. Charles and Laurie went out of their way to make it special for us and arriving to jazz, sparkling, a sweet note, and rose petals was the perfect touch to set the tone for the entire stay. The place is immaculate and rejuvenating. Nothing beats waking up under the natural light of the sun through the canopy of trees over the dome; it’s incredibly soothing and a great way to start a day. Whether you like hikes, reading (or napping) in the hammock, soaking in the hot tub, or curling up inside with a puzzle, there is something for every mood. This hidden gem will be a true favorite of ours for years to come."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My spouse and I stayed here for our honeymoon. The best decision we could have made. It was incredibly romantic and private, the hosts even left us a little welcome tray with cider and chocolates, and rose petals on the bed!! we spent every night in that hot tub, it was soooooo nice 😍😍 we absolutely will be back again, and recommending this place to all our friends and family!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Tranquil retreat that you never want to leave. Looking forward to rebooking and coming back.
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful, well apportioned, and well designed inside and out. Clean, simple, comfortable and natural, yet chic. The bed ensemble and linens luxuriously comfortable. Outdoor shower a brilliant feature, in natural daylight or under the lights at night, for enlivening one's inner bohemian. Although you are aware you're part of a rural neighborhood, it is still able to be a private sanctuary. While all in one space, the bedroom, dining, kitchen, bathroom, and sitting areas are arranged to feel like each their own space apart from the others. Along with the outdoor shower, hot tub, seating/fire pit/grill area, play area, and walking paths in the woods, we felt no need to ""go"" anywhere else for four days. We did use our tokens for ice cream at the family soda shop in Whitesboro when we checked out on the last day!
Gracious, kind, attentive hosts."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Absolutely loved staying here. So cozy! Also if you have time definitely make sure to check out the host’s restaurant love joys on main. It’s only like 15 minutes away and has great food and a lovely staff. I felt like I was in a hallmark movie.
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My husband and I celebrated 20 yrs. together, at the Sky Dome in Gainesville, Tx. Everything was exactly as pictured, and the beautiful natural surroundings are even better in person! We had so much fun walking the nature trails on the property near the dome and experiencing all the sounds of the local wildlife. We had a truly magical time while staying at the Sky Dome, a perfect getaway for couples! We cant wait to return!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We stayed here for our mini moon after getting married and it was wonderful! Great place to relax and unwind after a stressful time in our lives. We loved it!!
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We traveled 1500 miles to stay in the sky dome and it was the best decision we could have made! Every last detail was thought out and you could absolutely tell!

2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Sky Dome holds some of the greatest memories we’ve made- just a breathtaking experience! Our honeymoon was here & we booked it again exactly one year later because it’s just that amazing. Charles & Laurie have thought of every little comfort & even provide special luxury touches to make you feel like you’re at an exclusive exotic resort. My wife is an avid Airbnb user and she says the sky dome is in her top 5 stays of all time. I loved the mood lighting, hot tub, outdoor shower, walking path in the trees & mister system for swinging in the hammock. We enjoyed Lovejoys (the restaurant/shop in town owned by the hosts parents) and appreciated the tokens for free ice cream that were left for us in the welcome display upon our arrival. The Sky Dome is private, secluded and quiet. It’s the perfect setting for a peaceful romantic getaway. If you are considering booking DO IT NOW! I also suggest booking a minimum of two nights to be able to really soak it all in. You’ll be glad you did!"

The Sky dome was so serene and peaceful. They’ve set everything up in away that leaves plenty to do on the property, we were never bored. The Sky dome was clean and had all the essentials for cooking. I honestly have nothing even slightly negative to say, they thought of everything. It’s the perfect trip for a couple. We also ventured into town, which was amazing! I love the buildings in an old town. We stopped at Love Joys for ice cream. The owner, or who I think is the owner of Love joys, came out to talk to us. She is a beautiful, kind, caring, and compassionate woman. She made a large impression on us during our stay. We will remember this trip for a lifetime. Thank you Laurie and Charles for creating a safe and relaxing getaway! It was perfect!"

2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We loved staying in the SkyDome. It was a one of a kind experience staying in a dome with an expansive view of the surrounding woods.

We walked up the pathway to the sound of beautiful music being played from the TV inside and as we opened the door we were greeted with an awe inspiring view and thoughtful treats in a very romantic and peaceful setting. Charles and Laurie were both very kind as is the entire family and their parent’s restaurant in the local town. Instructions were everywhere that covered anything and everything you would need to know. I travel extensively for work and this was by far the cleanest, most beautiful place I have ever been in. It was a delightfully refreshing trip. So many friends and family have asked about our beautiful photos and we have already been recommending this stay! Walk around the backwoods to discover areas and trails that are more than peaceful with beautiful picture worthy pieces of nature. We will definitely be back and try to make it around the fall-winter! Thank you!"

2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Lovely little get away. The jacuzzi and outdoor shower at night are surreal. Hosts were very attentive, preparing the house with clean robes/sheets/light music playing upon our arrival. It felt very welcomed, but simultaneously private. What Airbnb was made for!"

2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Best Airbnb we have ever stayed at. Charles and Laurie work hard to make your stay the absolute best, and they knock it out of the park. The area is secluded so you feel like you have the utmost privacy. The dome has the most beautiful views. We were able to cook all our meals there so we didn’t have to leave! The hot tub is a game changer for couples celebrating and the outdoor shower was a show stopper!! Thank you Charles and Laurie! We will be back!"

A personalized note and helped us with accommodating an early check in. Super clean, so unique, just like the pictures shown. We cannot wait to get back.

It was exactly what we needed to get away and recharge. 👏🏼"

The location and property were beautiful, serene, and exceptionally well-kept. I enjoyed walking the trails on this lovely property and spending my time in nature. The dome itself is amazing and extremely comfortable. Enjoyed the hot tub and very well-built outdoor shower. Slept like a baby and had a very relaxing, peaceful experience, which is what I came for. I definitely plan to be back as soon as I can. This is my new go-to for a peaceful, close-enough getaway. The hosts were so sweet and the communication was great.
Thanks for creating this little sanctuary in the forest. Such a treasure for sure."

2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Way better then I expected! Extremely cozy! We had a perfect grilled dinner outside, that was so peaceful and connecting for my husband and me. We played in provided games in the evening. We took a hot tub, and outside shower (I worried that it won’t be convenient but that was perfect!). In the morning we did yoga and walked around a little. We’ve been there only one night (my husband’s birthday) but it feels like we had a good long vacation. On the way back to Dallas we stopped in Pilot Point (very authentic place).
BTW Charles and Laurie prepared a little surprise for my husband’s birthday even better than I asked
Thank you for that amazing getaway!"

2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This was one of the most unique and beautiful Airbnb’s we’ve stayed in. Laurie and Charles were great the whole time. We had some bad weather while we were there and they kept a lookout on the radar and kept us updated on weather so that we didn’t even have to check. The place was amazing from the beautiful view to the peaceful surrounding and all the small details that made the place feel like our own slice of paradise. I would highly recommend this place for anyone looking for a truly magical stay.

2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The Skydome Hideaway was easily the best AirBnB my husband and I have ever stayed at! We chose to stay here for a few days on our honeymoon and it was worth every penny. Everything was super clean, there were instructions for everything, and we thought it was the most beautiful place with the coolest views. It felt like we were somewhere else far away from other people, a great place if you want somewhere private! We loved how Charles and Laurie wrote us a personal note wishing us a happy honeymoon and there were so many thoughtful things during our stay such as having water bottles in the fridge, sparkling apple cider as a congrats, tokens for free ice cream, and more. We highly recommend this place!!!"
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was a vacation that was well needed 🙏🏾. Charles and Laurie thank you for being so generous and very efficient with all of the notes and tips ! Any questions that we thought we would have you covered it. We have recommended this to all of our friends and family but we also trying to be stingy because what if we want the same weekend 🤣. The scenery was beyond peaceful! I think we got some of the best sleep of our lives there. We didn’t want to leave at all 😂
Thank y’all a bunch! We really enjoyed it!"
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The SkyDome was absolutely beautiful. It was everything it was said to be, it looked exactly like the photos. The nature, and trails behind the dome were an added bonus. Hearing cows mooing, birds chirping and little squirrels run through the trees was so peaceful. It was definitely relaxing and rejuvenating to say the least. We couldn’t have asked for a better weekend. My husband said it was the best birthday ever. We were recommended horse back riding and Reed and his horses were amazing. Such an amazing experience we will never forget. Thank you Laurie and Charles!! We will be back and sending all of our friends."
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a fantastic experience at the SkyDome. It was private and relaxing! The space was very clean and their was great care to make sure we had everything we could need. It was my birthday and the hosts left a bottle of wine, chocolates and a sweet note.

2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Charles and Laurie have created such a beautiful place and experience for couples looking for a peaceful and romantic getaway!

2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,My husband returned from deployment and we celebrated our anniversary. It's the best time we've ever had. Everything is perfect.
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Charles & Laurie were the best hosts!!!! I surprised my husband & told him we were going “camping.” The sky dome was my perfect version of that! I can’t wait to come back!!
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is a very unique stay if you're wanting to get away, unwind, and reset. This was one of the most interesting places I've stayed and is exactly as advertised. Laying in bed, you'll feel like you're laying in an adult treehouse with all the room amenities you'd want from a nice hotel. The location is the type of place you come and stay and don't plan on going out. Just nest in and enjoy the time together with no responsibilities. Charles was very responsive to us via text and handled everything we needed in a timely fashion and willing to jump on things immediately, if requested. This is a great concept I can see taking off if ever expanded."
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,my only complaint is we didnt book a longer stay! We will most definitely be back!
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Charles and Laurie’s place was fantastic. We loved the atmosphere and the aesthetic. The grill, fire pit, hot tub, the bed, and all the other details of the space made our stay so relaxing and special. Would definitely recommend!"

2023-02-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"Amazing house. Very unique. Great stay with great people.
Eat at El Patron!"
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Thank y’all so much for the stay! We really enjoyed relaxing and appreciated y’all’s quick responses and helpfulness! It was the perfect spot. I recommend anyone stay here if you want to get away and enjoy some nature time. Going into town was very fun and getting to know the the local butcher shop owner Melissa in town is highly recommended as well. It is near Lovejoys so it’s worth the trip!
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"As the other reviews say, this place is seriously cool. Comfortable and romantic with incredible ambiance.
As homeschooling parents of four, My wife and I needed a night away and this hit the spot. It rained, even thunder stormed, during a large chunk of the night, but it actually added to the ambiance. The pitter-patter on the dome was relaxing.
The only things I would note: Bring slippers, and note the toilet has little privacy (behind a wall but of course still in the open of the dome) although most couples probably wouldn’t even think much of it."
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Thank you for another beautiful get away!
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Charles and Laurie were amazing hosts and we were very happy with our stay!

2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The SkyDome is the perfect place for a romantic getaway. We went for one night and did not want to leave! Steaks on the grill, s’mores by the fire, wine with some music, a soak in the hot tub, it was all fantastic. There’s also a wide range of TV shows/entertainment inside the dome. Charles and Laurie were great hosts and provided us all of the information necessary to just show up and enjoy the dome. We’ll definitely be coming back for a full weekend. P.S. try Lovejoys on Main for some incredible desserts and milkshakes!"
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"from the entrance, bedding, hot tub, grill, everything was well thought out for the guest and clean. We slept very comfortably and enjoyed nature/camping atmosphere in the nice dome. Place was very clean and welcoming. Lovejoy restaurant was a must stop, very nice host and family. Thank you so much for all the amenities and kindness!"
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We came as a getaway weekend and it was so nice to be away and live in our own little bubble. It was so peaceful and so cozy I love all of it. RECOMMEND TO ANYONE WANTING A GETAWAY
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Unique and an easy drive. One of a kind experience. Would love to go back again.
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"A perfect getaway.
Beautifully decorated with detailed instructions that left nothing unanswered. From the music drifting down from the sky canopy upon arrival, to the beautiful welcome basket, note and fire pit perfectly set up; the details have not been missed at this property.
The play of light and wind on the canopy and the beauty of waking up with a view of the trees makes this place magical.
The outdoor shower worked perfectly, and the evenings unwinding in the hot tub under the stars added to the charm and uniqueness of this location.
Extremely comfortable bedding and furnishings with all the right touches of luxury, made this truly feel like a 5 star hotel experience.
We look forward to the next time we need to sneak away and recharge."
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Enjoyed our stay
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,I absolutely loved staying at SkyDome! It was the peaceful break away from the city I was looking for. The trails around their home are lovely and it was truly relaxing. Charles and Laurie take great care of their spaces and their guests. Highly recommend!
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,What a beautiful place tucked away in nature! We were in awe the moment we walked through the door. Such beautiful touches made our stay feel extra special. Thank you for creating such a relaxing space to recharge. We hope to come back soon :)
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,It was great! quiet and peaceful! They definitely are a superhost!
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Cozy and roomy. Great hosts. Definitely give it a try
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Charles and Laurie are amazing host. Incredibly responsive communication, extremely detailed, proactive….they make your stay very convenient and effortless. The place has everything you would need, private surroundings, items designated in appropriate locations, clean and very well thought-out to make your stay comfortable. For example, upon arrival we wanted to spend time outside by the fire using the BBQ for dinner and making s’mores….well, the fire pit was completely set up for us….the only thing we needed to do was light the paper. The place is definitely worth a 5-star rating due to the experience you receive from the host and the complete facility on location. Beautiful place!!!"
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We could hear the Christmas music as we walked up the steps to the dome. To our surprise, there was a lovely note and welcome gift (we were celebrating husband's birthday), Christmas decorations and essential oils being defused. We honestly felt so welcomed! Such a perfect way to step away from all the responsibilities of life and stay someone that feels out of this world.
We loved the outdoor, indoor feel. The outside shower is GORGEOUS and everything is so well done. We used the grill to make dinner and had such a relaxing time.
If you are a light sleeper. bring a sound machine or play white noise from your phone. My husband got woken up by a donkey! So funny. Didn't bother us at all, but you are in the country. Know that this is a dome and the bathroom is sectioned off, it's not a separate room.
There are a couple other residences on the property, but you are completely secluded in your area. Loved the privacy and the quiet. And, yeah, this place was beyond cool. We will be back!"
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Absolutely perfect stay! We will be back.
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,It was even better than the pictures and it was perfect for our honeymoon. They thot of everything you might need during the stay and we were able to do some of our own cooking. The hammocks and hot tub were our favorite parts. The hosts were very responsive and gave us a great recommendation for a trail ride about 30 min away. We definitely are hoping to come back
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I can’t begin to describe how perfect the SkyDome was! This stay was exactly what my husband and I were looking for to celebrate our first wedding anniversary. The space was even better in person than the listing shows (if that’s possible)! Our jaws dropped when we walked in! It was secluded and peaceful. Charles and Laurie were great hosts - very responsive and friendly. The space was so thoughtful in how it was presented and decorated, they thought of everything! The bnb had everything we needed for our two night stay. The AC units inside allowed the space to become as warm or cool as you needed and the bed was so cozy with plenty of extra blankets provided, perfect for a cold Texas night. The fire pit, grill, and outdoor seating were perfect. The outdoor shower and hot tub made the space. It was so romantic, we felt like we landed in a 5 star resort in the woods. If you’re thinking about staying here, don’t waste another second - book this space right now! We can’t wait to return."
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Thank you for creating a beautiful space for a birthday weekend!

2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"What an amazing getaway! Charles and Laurie thought of everything for this sky dome. It was cozy, clean, and super relaxing for our one year wedding anniversary. The outdoor shower was probably our favorite part, it was really cold but the shower got so hot we didn’t even notice the cold. We will definitely be back in the future. Thanks Charles and Laurie for an amazing stay!!"
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place is AMAZING!! The hosts, Charles and Laurie, have an amazing attention to detail. The little things they do throughout the place were just as amazing as the place itself. There's trails to hike, amazing sun rise to view from the dome window and the outdoor shower is a must try even in the cold weather. This place is solid and sturdy! There were 20mph winds outside one night and the dome didnt move even the slightest. You def feel well protected from outdoor elements. if you're looking to get away for a week or weekend check this place out for some much enjoyed R&R"
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great for a couple’s getaway, beautiful space and location."

Honestly this place felt like home. Loved my stay here.
Can’t wait to come back!"
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Loved the SkyDome! Everything was accurate as pictured in the listing! Perfect for relaxation and being isolated to have time to ourselves. After a couple days camping in a state park it was amazing to get to experience “Glamping” and feel pampered while still in touch with nature! We could use the outdoor shower and still feel clean, as well as have so many provided amenities like the kitchen tools, coffee and the amazing personal touches when we were celebrating our wedding anniversary! It was raining the morning of check out and it was so relaxing having coffee by the large windows and listen to it out the roof of the dome!"
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great plAce
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This was such an amazing experience. The SkyDome is so peaceful, beautiful, relaxing just amazing literally a slice of heaven. Laurie and Charles were amazing host they set the mood before we arrived. We will definitely be back. You also have to go in town to Lovejoy family owned restaurant the food is amazing."
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The SkyDome is magical! Inside and out, the space is inviting and cozy. Waking up to views of the forest and hearing the wind in the trees is so relaxing. All the amenities and decor are well thought out and aesthetically pleasing! If you stay there, make sure to eat at Powerhouse Burgers in Pilot Point and Lovejoys in Whitesboro."
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This was such a unique stay. The listing was accurate and the dome was incredible. Highly recommend if you’re looking for an escape.

2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great getaway place, very clean and cozy. We had a great time! Thanks Charles and Laurie for creating this amazing spot 🤗🤗"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The Ranch House was absolutely delightful. The decor was lovely and the home was very comfortable. The lights were a bit complex but the owners had left all of the necessary controls near the lights so it was easy to figure the variety of switches and remote controls out. The kitchen was wonderful with very high quality appliances and just enough cookware and dishes for what ever meals were planned. I would highly recommend it to others.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Such a cute home! We loved it.
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is paradise! Walking trails and games, plenty to do! Place is cozy and comfy. We had everything we needed for family event! We really enjoyed our stay and would book again!!!"

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had SUCH a great stay at the caboose! Ashely and Eric are excellent hosts. The space is so unique and comfortable and has everything we needed (and more). We especially loved the lofted reading nook and enjoying the fire pit! The grounds are also gorgeous and the animals were delightful. We felt so rested staying at this spot. Thank you so much for a great stay, Johnsons!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The Caboose was amazing! It was such a fun getaway and the place was so pretty!
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Y’ALL. This caboose was kind of a dream airbnb for me. If you’re looking for a peaceful getaway, this is it - you will not be disappointed. I read reviews and looked at photos, but all of it was so so much better in person.
I loved drinking my morning coffee on the patio, just watching the horse and goats graze while the wind whipped through the trees and clover. At night I sat out under the string lights and listened to the toads in the pond. I could have happily sat there for hours. As a solo traveler it was a perfect reset for my brain. Work and life can be so stressful but to just sit and listen to nature in such a beautiful setting was everything I needed.
It is well stocked and had even more than I anticipated. They made such good use of the space and it feels so much bigger than it is. You can tell so much love and care was put into the caboose and into making folks feel comfortable and at home.
I can’t wait to come back!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We needed a break from the hustle and bustle strewn with copius amounts of stress, this place delivered and then some!!
Peaceful and quiet was exaclty what we got, easy to get to and close to lots of activities.
Ashley was very sweet and helpful, making sure we had everything we needed and werent bothered by anything. So helpful and always available for anything.
We will definitely come back and stay again, we thoroughly enjoyed our stay."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This place exceeded its value and expectations. The perfect couples getaway and exactly what we needed. Thank you wonderful host. Absolutely amazing. 👏
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Such a cool little place. Very peaceful and perfect for our one night stay while we visited family in town.
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Loved our stay. We would definitely stay again!!
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Just what we needed as a couple for our get away weekend. Quiet, clean and well designed cozy space in a lovely country setting. Ashley and Eric replied quickly and helpfully whenever we had a question."
2024-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We stayed at Ashley & Eric’s caboose while we were in the area for a family wedding. It was the perfect tranquil spot to balance out a hectic event schedule! It is the perfect amount of space for 2 people, was beautifully decorated and spotlessly clean. We both worked from the caboose during the week and had no problems with the wifi. A huge bonus was the outdoor space and we really enjoyed watching the horse and goats roam around the field.
Ashley & Eric were so communicative and response during the stay, their directions made navigating very easy and they were so accommodating to allow us to check in a bit early. We would love to come back!"
2024-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I could totally live in this amazing tiny home! I felt so peaceful and happy all of the time. The décor is delightful, refreshing, and thoughtful. I appreciate the details everywhere. The hosts were beyond nice and welcoming. And the view, the privacy, pond, goats, horse, dogs, wildflowers… I could go on and on… thank you so much!!!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very sweet private place to stay. It is small in the windows do not open but the air conditioners great and the door can let him plenty of sweet breezy air.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The caboose was an amazing place to stay, even for a solo on a short trip. It’s secluded, but not remote, and the hosts are easy to communicate with. I would be careful if you are driving a normal sedan, there’s a bit of dirt and gravel and a hill in order to get to the property."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,From the tree lined drive to the entrance to the variety of farm animals present to the hospitality… this place was the BEST experience. The caboose made it such a novelty type stay but the care and extra amenities made this place no doubt why Eric and Ashley are Superhosts. They went above and beyond. We so enjoyed getting acquainted with them. The place is tranquil as well as entertaining. We can’t wait to come back. I would say it’s the only Airbnb I didn’t want to leave !
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Wow! Views of this property are better than the photos. Such a beautiful spot. Caboose was so fun and novel. Great place to stay! My wife and I loved our time.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We were fortunate to find this little gem for our 40th Anniversary and Eclipse 2024 viewing. Ashley and Eric were great and what they are building there in their little piece of heaven is outstanding. We really enjoyed meeting all the animals along with Ashley and Eric. Dave the Horse was our friendly morning visitor which we loved. Our last night there was privy to a series of really bad Thunderstorms, but the caboose was solid protection. Not sure if we'll ever be back to that area of Texas, but if we do, we'd definitely look them up and stay again. This place is perfect for a couples getaway. Thanks guys for making our anniversary trip a win! *****"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Loved the Caboose! I wanted a private getaway, and got just that. It’s surrounded by land, and an experience you can’t get just anywhere. I will be back 🙏🏼"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Ashley and Eric were phenomenal hosts. They were attentive and catered to our every need. They communicated effectively and clearly and responded quickly. I would HIGHLY recommend coming to stay at the caboose! It is a beautifully unique stay! They knew what they were doing with the attention to detail! I liked that they had a wall in heater, that they included a crossing light to the caboose as a porch light that could actually be controlled by a switch. Definitely loved waking in up in the morning and listening to the birds chirp, and looking outside my window to see a beautiful white horse walk around. It was a very relaxing, and peaceful trip. Perfect for a weekends getaway!! Definitely will be coming back to stay here !"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The Country Caboose was the perfect place to get away from the city for the weekend. They have thought of everything down to a small heater in the bathroom. Loved sitting outside around the fire pit and watching all of the animals. The turkey was absolutely beautiful. We will definitely be back.
2024-03-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"We loved our stay here! It is private, and had beautiful surroundings. There was even a horse on the property that we got to go up to and pet, it was super nice! Everything was clean and organized, and smelt wonderful!"

The animals were sweet as could be. Would absolutely stay with Ashley again!!"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Absolutely incredible experience! The property was really peaceful and fun to explore. Immidiately felt right at home!
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,It was a fantastic breakaway from the hustle and bustle of our everyday life. Internet not great so it sort of forced us to unplug…much needed! We would like to go back again & hated to leave!
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Ashley was an incredible host! I booked this as a fun little get-away for my friend's 50th birthday. Ashley even left a sweet birthday wish for us when we got there.
The caboose was decorated so cute, and was organized so well for such a small space.
Highly recommend!!"

2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Very peaceful weekend getaway spot! The place was immaculately clean and extremely cozy. Plumbing and electricity/wifi all worked wonderfully and without issue. All the animals (goats, horse, dogs, duck) were cute and extremely friendly! Ashley and Eric were both very responsive and proactive about communicating. Would absolutely recommend staying here and I hope to go back!"
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,My husband and I had a very relaxing and quiet weekend at Ashley’s place. Great location with beautiful surroundings. It was very clean and comfortable. Highly recommend for a quaint getaway.
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was such a quiet, peaceful place. It was just right for a short getaway. Such a cute & clean caboose!"
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This is the most amazing place we’ve ever stayed, the space is so well edited it could be featured in a magazine. You’re intrigued by the fact that it’s a caboose but once you go inside you’re blown away. So cozy but completely uncluttered. Each item has been carefully chosen to work perfectly. I was smiling the whole time we were there because everything made me so happy. If you are looking for a place anywhere near here, THIS IS IT. I am so grateful that we had the opportunity to spend time here."
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We had the best time and will definitely come back! The spot is great and there’s a great winery 7 min away! Ashley was a great host and was so communicative! You will love staying at this unique airbnb! Nothing else like it!
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I'm a handywoman and I also own a janitorial company so when I walk into an Airbnb, I have high expectations of things working properly, the finish out on a home, and cleanliness. Let's start from the beginning. The communication was the best I've had from any Airbnb host. The directions to get to the home, the gate access, how to enter the home were perfect-east to understand, easy to follow. Upon entering the caboose, I immediately felt at home. The smell was refreshing, the clean crisp look allowed me to relax right away. I loved the simplicity. I loved that it wasn't cluttered but yet it offered everything a guest needs. It was a bit cold for us to enjoy the outdoors but I enjoyed looking out the window at the peaceful surroundings, the adorable goats, and the pretty horse. I will definitely return as soon as I'm able to get away again. This place ranks my #1 out of any Airbnb I've been to and I've definitely been to alot of them. Thank you Ashley and Eric for a wonderful stay."
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We loved this spot! So unique and restful! We will definitely try to book again when it's not raining (the area is beautiful), but we did love the sound of the rain on the metal caboose - felt like we were in our own little world. <3"
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Picturesque place! Love the goats and horse that were waiting for us on arrival. Perfect stop on our travels.
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Stay was amazing, so excited to come back. Instructions were clear and it was such a unique stay."
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,My first Airbnb and it was great! The caboose was charming and Ashley was wonderful!
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,My way wife and I enjoyed the unique experience.
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We had a great time, we wish we had more time than what we did to truly experience the Caboose in the daytime"
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Gosh this place was awesome!! We've stayed in over a dozen cabins, THW's, apartments, etc. This was our first caboose experience. We'd have to rank A&E's Caboose as one of our top stays...The Caboose itself was real cute and the interior was fantastic. They did a great job fixing it up and making it very cozy and convenient for most day to day living. Shower was great, cooking was easy, bed was comfy, temperature control was good, and now we are more appreciative fans of Uriah Heap and David Bowie LP's. It was enjoyable to walk around the semi-wooded property. There was a thing we saw that at first scared us, but upon closer inspection made us laugh, lol. Can't give away the surprise that was wearing a Christmas cap. Feeding the goats, horse, chickens, turkey, and one duck was fun...We visited several breweries and wineries in the area and participated in a craft activity down in McKinney. All in all a great place to stay and wonderful hosts."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"It’s one of those rare places that’s worth driving out of your way to. But especially, when the plan is to be out of the way.
Eric and Ashley have an incredibly secluded and cozy stay on the way to or out of the way from wherever you are.
Their attention to detail and hospitality, matched with the seclusion and natural surroundings of the property, work perfectly in tandem with the lovely caboose they refurbished. All the appliances are perfectly suited for the space and everything is very well curated.
Lots of thought and love went into this place.
Open nature in a private setting with the very well behaved farm animals that give you your space but serve to enhance its backdrop.
If you’re looking to get away to nature or stop somewhere to recharge, go see Eric and Ashley.
Absolute super hosts.
You don’t want to miss it."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I cannot say enough great things about this place! We are always looking for unique places to stay and this quickly became our favorite. The caboose was absolutely adorable, decorated perfectly, and so comfy. And we LOVED hanging out with the animals! Horse, goats, chickens, duck, and our favorite was the friendliest turkey we’ve ever met! Ashley and Eric were such great hosts and it was a perfect, peaceful retreat. We cannot wait to come back!"
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Our stay was great! We loved sing all of the animals and relaxing by the fire, I can’t wait to go back!"

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I absolutely had the best time at the cozy caboose. The location is gorgeous. The Caboose was super clean, thoughtfully stocked, and had everything I could have needed. I really liked that the windows have reflective glass so you don't feel the need to pull the shades in the daytime for privacy or to block out any heat. Everything ran perfectly. Ya might be cautious of falling acorns - I got pelted a few times - ha, but that comes with being in nature. Everything was so nice that I had trouble deciding whether I wanted to spend time inside or outside by the fire pit! Hard choice so I went back and forth often. :) Solo traveler recommended for sure.
I highly, highly recommend this special place."

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Loved every minute from start to finish! Even the drive there was very pretty and Whitesboro is full of horse farms, ranches, and green grass and trees for days! The road leading to the caboose was a tunnel of trees and so pretty too! The turn off was well marked with railroad crossing signs on the trees so you can’t miss it and it helped a lot. The caboose itself is just perfect and so cute. Ashley and Eric did a great job on it and you can tell a lot of hard work and heart went into it. It was super functional and comfortable and I loved the bed and shower! The farm animals are so cute and fun!! I really enjoyed Dave the horse he was so calm and sweet! It’s very peaceful out there and I enjoyed just walking around and taking it all in! Oh I also went paddleboarding at Moss Lake and it was so calm and pretty out there:) Thanks again Ashley snd Eric for being so helpful and kind!! Can’t wait to come back and bring the rest of my fam!"

We were greeted with a beautiful sign welcoming us and party horns to celebrate my partners birthday! We got to feed goats and pet the dogs. The horse was precious to see and wake up to. The fireplace had wood ready next to it and it was clean and secluded. There were horse shoes outside and games inside if you don’t want to play the outside games. We appreciate the time and effort taken to make the caboose feel welcome and safe! 10/10 would recommend to anyone who needs a peaceful getaway!
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We had a great stay in this quaint and unique tiny home. It was very clean with a very comfortable bed.

2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"An amazing stay all around! The owners have done a great job converting this adorable caboose and providing a peaceful, clean, and cozy atmosphere. We loved enjoying the space inside as well as out — patio furniture was so comfortable we spent half our stay just enjoying the breeze and greenery with a good book. Was a little windy for the fire pit, but they made sure we had good logs for it just in case. Farm animals were SO cute and we loved watching the goats and horse roam around with the occasional dog or chicken. Owners were so kind and respectful of our space and time, but we highly recommend saying hello if you see them out and about!! We had a fun chat and got introduced to the animals, really cool people all around and you’ll be happy you did :D Also be sure to look at all the details in the caboose! We kept discovering little things like the dimmable lighting, speaker table, and vinyl records that really made the stay extra special. Can’t recommend this enough!"
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This was a great place to stay! The caboose was pristine in a beautiful location. It’s clear there was a great amount of attention to detail given. Ashley and Eric were excellent hosts with helpful recommendations. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay and hope to be back!

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This place is absolutely perfect for a couple. It has romantic little touches everywhere and I appreciate it. Its a tiny little place, but it beats the hell out of 10 minute walks in and out of an expensive hotel every time i need to go to the car. It's in a gorgeous historic neighborhood and it's quiet. You're 15 minutes from the nearest casino and right around the corner from gas stations and food places. We had a great time and I hope to do it again next year."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We visited the Paris-themed guesthouse to celebrate our wedding anniversary. It was a small, private space that was perfect for us!

This place feels private and tucked away, yet close to everything. The house is equipped with all the basics and our host was quick to accommodate anything we asked for. She even left a basket of snacks and the sweetest welcome note. The special touches made us feel right at home. I was a super host previously and this home wins my stamp of APPROVAL! I would absolutely stay again."

2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Hosts responded quickly and were friendly and easy to work with. The house was very clean and orderly. The “extras” like coffee, popcorn, and snacks were much appreciated. It was even better than expected, the pictures on-line don’t do it justice. I would most certainly stay here again! Everyone has a different preference, so be aware the master bedroom mattress is slab hard."

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"An absolute gem!!! We stayed here as a retreat while attending a nearby concert. Everything you need is in the home plus some—the snacks and food to pay for were a welcome site and so helpful in a pinch. Going out with Shannon to the pasture was a highlight for everyone, so many animals to see and interact with. The kids enjoyed the games and ping pong table too!
The house was pristine, comfortable and going for a morning walk while drinking coffee and saying bye to the animals really wrapped up a wonderful weekend. We can’t wait to return! Thank you, Shannon!"

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"The Big Red Barn and Bed at Moo and Bray Farm was wonderful! The barn apartment was easy to find as Shannon gave excellent directions on how to find the property. Shannon had prepared a binder that gave instructions and also local recommendations for things to do and places to eat. The decor in the barn apartment was so unique and fun! My husband and I had a lot of fun reminiscing about some of the decor in the apartment. Everything was clean and tidy and we had all that we needed for a peaceful and very quiet weekend. It rained most of the weekend so we did not get a chance to see the cows, but Shannon did offer a tour Moo and Bray Farm. Definitely a place that is on our ""want to return to"" on Airbnb."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Shannon was a wonderful host and her property is beautiful! We will definitely be back when we are in the area.
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Great location! We had a blast feeding all the animals!
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"The Moo & Bray is a great place to go for a quiet retreat. It is a very rural ranch setting in beautiful North Texas with highland cattle, donkeys and horses. Very scenic and very peaceful. The animals are all sweet & very friendly.
The bnb is a cute Western themed barndominium with great wifi, perfect for getting work done.
As stated in Shannon’s description, GPS does not really work out there, so follow her directions, they are spot on and will take you right to the bnb. I also had trouble with my cell phone signal that far out, but the wifi is very strong so I used wifi calling to bridge that gap.
Shannon is very friendly and always ready to help. Great place to get away for work or rest!"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This was the best staycation ever. The rental was fabulous and Shannon was amazing!!! The time and effort Shannon put into our weekend was wonderful. I would highly recommend this place to all my family and friends:).

2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Shannon was the consummate hostess. She is friendly and welcoming. She offered us a tour so that we could meet and feed the highland cows and calves, pigs, donkeys, and alpacas. As well the pups! You can tell by the way she speaks about them that she adores them. The Big Red Barn is beautiful and fun. It had all the essentials for cooking and relaxing. Shannon's place was the last stop on our trip, and it was definitely worth the wait!!"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Shannon was a wonderful host! We loved getting to feed the animals and the barn’s aesthetic. Would definitely recommend this location to a friend.

I was a little sad… But at soon as I got there I wished I was all alone… Shannon put out super cute valentines decorations and the place is just so neat I fell in love as soon as I walked in the door… The next morning going to feed the animals and talking with Shannon about them was a great addition if you like cozy farm life you will love this spot… I plan to return with a few books and bottles of wine maybe in during fall all by myself and I can’t wait… I grew up in a very small town in east Texas so this was the best thing to me cozy romantic OMG and I almost forgot She had snacks and adult beverages it was really just THE BEST EVER I forgot all about not having a valentine Lol"
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Absolutely perfect! We went to the Winstar for a concert and the Red Barn at Moo & Bray was a great place to stay. Peaceful, clean and cozy. The place is beautiful and the animals are a plus. Highly recommend for your next getaway."
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"This was by far our favorite place we have ever stayed. The place was decorated so well, it was clean, and the host put extra touches that made it even more amazing. The snacks were perfect! The animals were great to visit with and leaving carrots for us to feed the animals was super cool. The host was attentive and responded so kindly to everything. 10/10 recommend! I hope they make an even bigger place at some point so we can bring friends. If you have well behaved dogs that you cannot leave behind, bring them with you! Best little get away! Our dogs enjoyed meeting the horses, cows, and donkeys. We will come back!"
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"My husband and I loved our stay! The place is very comfortable and decorated in a fun Texas/country theme. The property is beautiful, and the animals are cute!!

2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We had a great stay! We went to see a concert at WinStar and this was a great option to stay at. What a beautiful place in setting on the ranch with all the animals sounds and sights. Would definitely recommend and hope to be back soon!￼

2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We chose the Big Red Barn because we had tickets to a concert at Winstar. The wide open peaceful setting of the fantasy farm was the perfect juxtaposition of the crowded, noisy casino. We loved it! We spent more time at the barndominium than we expected.
Our host took us on a tour of the property and we met pigs, horses, Highland cows, alpacas and miniature donkeys. I got to hold a baby donkey!
I enjoyed exploring downtown Gainesville and Whitesboro. We’ll be back! Thank you Shannon and Chris"

2024-06-01,3.0,Stayed with a pet,"The owner was nice and the house was well maintained. However the pictures and listing werent depicted properly. It was much much smaller than we thought. We used a filter to find a place for 4 adults and a dog and this place showed as adequate. However after paying (non refundable) we were sent a message stating that while doable it would be very tight for 4 adults. So we had 2 adults find other accommodations. Glad we did, because when we got there the main bed was suppose to pull out to a king but there was only a single mattress and topper. The 2 of us had to sleep on the single bed. The two lofts were far to small to get into and they had a shared ladder even tho the lofts were across the room from each other. The ceiling in the bathroom was so small we were barely short enough to walk properly. Overall, we were disappointed due to the lack of information and transparency of the size since we paid well over market price for it."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is one of the best locations to get away alone. I live and work in the city and once in awhile it is just good to get quiet and refocus, then get back to the daily. I heard numerous birds, animals (thankfully remembered to bring binoculars). I took the time to just enjoy things like reading and artwork. It was perfect for what I needed."

2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"What a beautiful and cozy mini getaway from the Dallas area hosted by the kindest and most endearing woman. My family and I cannot wait to get the chance to visit again. The horses are phenomenal, btw. Very mild mannered and so social."

2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"My three kids and I went on a quiet overnight getaway and thoroughly enjoyed ourselves. Horse riding and feeding Otto the giant tortoise added to the fun. The home was cozy, clean, and perfect for the four of us."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Our family had a fantastic weekend in this beautiful place, it was a connection with nature that many of us need, we enjoyed walks surrounded by many trees and breathing fresh air. Melanie's attention was 10/10, she was always there for any questions or recommendations, we were 4 adults and my 12-year-old son and we were all comfortable in the tiny house, this little house is complete for whatever is needed."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Had an amazing time for my wife’s birthday getaway. Being able to see a cool tortoise and able to see horses was amazing. The cabin felt so comforting and homey.

2023-10-01,5.0,Group trip,Thank you Melanie!
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Melanie is the best. At no fault of hers we missed the driveway. She walked out to the gate so we would see her. She was a gracious host making sure she was available if we needed anything. Enjoyed talking with her in the morning before we left. Enjoyed seeing the horses in the morning. The cabin is an adorable tiny house.
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Melanie was thoughtful and attentive. She gave my girlfriend a complimentary birthday card. The area is quiet and peaceful, and the horses were fun to be around."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Melanie was very kind and her tiny house made for a very peaceful experience for me and my dog Raven. It was lovely walking under the old pecan trees and around the horses. And the tortoise was a sweet surprise. I enjoyed watching him (or her) and the tortoise also seemed curious about us. I would stay here again when I come back to the Dallas/Plano area. Elisa
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We loved this place, everything was wonderful, we had an experience to take a breakfast with the horses…. It was marvelous…. You need to have the same experience….. our family are very happy"

2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,It was a great experience overall. My 5 year old son did horseback riding for the first time and he loved it. Melanie was so helpful during our stay and spent extra time with my son to let him feed the horses and a tortoise. Watching horses wondering around so close to where we stayed was another memorable experience.
2023-05-01,5.0,Group trip,Melanie’s place was awesome
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We had a great stay. Just what we needed with good Wi-Fi and peaceful surroundings. Thank you!
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,This was one of my favorite Air B&B stays to date! I was overworked and tired when I arrived and I left feeling completely refreshed. Waking up early wasn’t on our agenda but having done so gave us the opportunity to enjoy the horses and creek before we made our way to Germanfest ( maybe a 20 min drive). Melanie is an amazing host and her recommendation for Lavender Fields Farm was also a 10/10. Thank you for such a pleasant Birthday weekend. ♥️♥️

2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We were very happy with our stay. Would give 10 stars if possible. Everything was as described and just as adorable as the pictures. Clean and cozy, restful nights sleep away from city traffic and lights.
I think my 10yr old would agree that his favorite part was having the opportunity to connect with and ride one of the horses. Melanie gave him an experience he will be talking about for a long time to come.
We visited a couple of recommendations from Melanie, the local brewery and the lavender farm. Beautiful Lovely We will be back if our travels bring us back through the area."
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"This was our first time staying at a tiny house. We had our dog with us. We really enjoyed the stay although it was very short. Our dog had a lot of fun- too much fun I think. The area worked out great for us as we wanted to check few wineries around so it was perfect.
Melanie was very helpful and quick to respond to any questions we had. Place is indeed small but that is what tiny homes are but it was very cozy and was fully equipped and clean. Melanie's instructions were very clear. We really enjoyed our short stay and will be back in the future."
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,the place was very peaceful and quiet she has a very big lot to walk around and the horses were awesome the would come up to you to pet them if you love horses and a quiet place to relax I highly recommend this place and it was very clean and cozy

2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We had a great time at this tiny home, it’s very peaceful and relaxing with horses everywhere. Melanie was great and very easy to communicate with. Thank you!"
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The entire stay couldn't have been better. The tiny house was quaint and to sit back in the morning enjoying your coffee and watching the horses was relaxing. The horse experience is a must, Melanie is very knowledgeable and her horses are well trained."
,,,"There was a train horn all night long and an outside light shined in a bedroom window all night. Curtails could not be adjusted to block it out which made sleeping difficult. Description said “currently” decorated for Christmas. Didn’t realize it was permanently that way. There were so many decorations it made the home feel cluttered. Only one TV in the house. It was in a bedroom and positioned where only one person could see it. Bathrooms only had one towel in each. Two of the three bathrooms did not have toiletries, only hand soap. The paint was peeling off the ceiling and walls. It was clear maintenance is needed. The ice maker was frozen to the fridge and not producing ice. Dining room table was covered with items for sale from the “store”. Drawers and closets were full so very limited space to unpack our stuff. While we understand it is a Victorian style home, furniture was not comfortable for relaxing or social gathering. One positive was all the beds were comfortable and clean."
