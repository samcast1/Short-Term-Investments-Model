The museum next door is interesting and we were lucky enough to be there for their annual Cajun Festival. We enjoyed the live band while sitting on the side porch.
Harold has excellent communication and we say this despite a snafu at check in due to a broken cell phone. Things happen - he made sure we were taken care of and had everything we needed.
Thanks!"

2023-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"This Airbnb is combines the coziness of your grandma‚Äôs house, with the modern chic or your sister‚Äôs new place. You can sense that the home has a warm and rich history, yet it‚Äôs well maintained- like if Jennifer Aniston were a building.
Speaking of Jennifer Aniston, your host, Harold, will make you feel like one of his friends, as he preemptively tends to your needs like Rachel Green serving coffee at Central Perk.
Overall, I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs a wonderful stay, would definitely recommend, and you can count on the fact that your host will be there for you too."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Harold was the nicest host! We had a few requests that he was so happy to help us with! ‚ÄúHarry‚Äôs House‚Äù was there when we needed it the most and Harold was the most gracious person to work with!
The home is BEAUTIFUL, the beds are comfortable, and there's LAUNDRY! Great for a much-needed respite from the camping life!"
2023-03-01,4,Stayed one night,"Harold was great and gave me plenty of information about how to find and access the house. Unfortunately, I came in a bit later than an average guest, well after dark, and wasn‚Äôt sure where to park, since there was no driveway, no designated parking, and no clarification in the info I scanned, but it was too late at night to expect a response, so I was a bit restless for the first two hours, worried that my rental might get towed while I slept. A few screaming girls at the house across the street didn‚Äôt help matters, but in the end, the house was comfortable and it was the first night in a while that I rested so well (once I fell asleep) that I didn‚Äôt want to leave as early as I had planned. Very homey inside. And parking in the street, anywhere, was fine."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,Amazing location and beautiful cottage. Harold was great and fast with communication. Would recommend to others and would also rebook!!!

He made accommodations for our stay, and was respectful of our privacy and the needs of guests. The home does have coffee, tea, a pot, pan, cutting board, some cooking utensils, silverware, and fully useable stove, microwave, dishwasher, and washer and dryer. The location is quiet and right next door to the Whitehead museum. If you‚Äôd like a downtown Del Rio place to stay with a feeling of safety and peace, this is it!"
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I very much enjoyed my stay at Harold‚Äôs house. The house has a lockbox and was easy to enter with the code provided by the host.

We were even here for Halloween and were able to meet about 45 trick-or-treaters! AnaKaren is the most amazing host we‚Äôve ever had! And we use Airbnb extensively. This was without a doubt our favorite Airbnb stay we have ever been at!! Seriously, I cannot say enough good things about this place. You will love it! Our dogs loved the big backyard. we were ALL so comfortable here! As for Del Rio, we love this town! There are so many walking paths and so many parks.

available dish towels
liquid hand soap in the bathrooms
comfortable furniture in the living room

A bit more cleaning on the kitchen cabinets would've been great, but having a garage was a bonus. Kim was an awesome host üåü, and the location was super convenient, close to shops and eateries üõçÔ∏èüçΩÔ∏è.

2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had an amazing experience at Kimberly's place! It's so clean, the decorating looks wonderful, AND we were comfortable. The first thing all of us said was how nice it smelled when we walked in. Having a kitchen with everything we needed was so helpful. The back yard isn't done yet but we still enjoyed sitting out on the little patio. It had just the right amount of shade and the breeze made it perfect, even in the afternoon. Great space that was perfect for our needs and even though there's construction in the area, we barely noticed any noise. Lovely neighborhood."

2021-03-01,5,Group trip,"Loved all the decorations! Place was great, very clean, organized and stylish. Would likely book again in the future."
2021-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This home was an ideal home base for our family of four (2 adults and 2 kids) as we explored some nearby state parks. The house is new, modern, and clean with a well-stocked kitchen to cook meals. It‚Äôs located in a neighborhood still under development, but we did not experience any construction noise. Easy access to HEB and the main drag for dining and shopping. The front of the duplex actually faces Jason Circle (we initially drove right past it!). I highly recommend Kimberley‚Äôs place."

2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was a great ranch style home that offered plenty of space, was clean and offered privacy and a peaceful surrounding. The kitchen was very easy to cook in and had all of the necessary items. The grill could use a bit of cleaning, but worked fine for our needs. The only drawback was that the lake was down 60+ feet, and so our stay wasn‚Äôt quite what I had envisioned, but that had little to do with Mike‚Äôs place. The deer were very friendly and the wildlife was plentiful but if you‚Äôre looking for fun on the lake, it is limited. Be sure to check with a local Lake Amistad recreation facility firstüòâ"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,Really great staying
2024-03-01,5,Group trip,"We really enjoyed our stay. The house looks just like the pictures and was perfect for our family.

Mike was wonderful and made checkin and checkout easy with a very short check out list."

2023-09-01,5,Group trip,"We absolutely loved staying at Mikes place. So much so, that we booked it again before our stay was even up. We‚Äôre originally from Del Rio, so we visit often.

Plenty of towels and other amenities so we felt really at home. Check in/out was a breeze and Mike was always very communicative and suggested local places to enjoy.

2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The deer like to hang out everywhere and once they start to feel a little comfortable with you they‚Äôll eat some bread from your hand. I also recommend going to the creek. The water is very refreshing and clean. It‚Äôs so clear it looks the same as bottled water

2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"I want to start off by saying, besides staying with family in Del Rio. This was by far one of the best experiences and stays in Del Rio. Wife and I live in Abilene and we usually visit Del Rio as much as we can. We usually stay at a specific Hotel in town. This weekend my cousins wanted to get the family together and BBQ there down by the San Felipe creek ( Lt. Thomas Memorial Park) to be exact. So with a last minute trip hotel was booked. So we decided Airbnb, as soon as we opened the app and put in Del Rio, her house was the first one to show. After clicking we immediately fell in love with it and knew we had to jump on it so we did. From the response times to the accommodations and the decor of the whole house. We enjoyed it especially how convenient it was to where we needed to be. Thank you to Carla and Jay for being amazing host. We will definitely be staying again in the future."

2024-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"Pre-Covid and the opening of the borders I would travel to Del Rio a couple times a month for work and stay at one of the hotels. I always loved going to Del Rio as part of my work territory, and it was time to get back there. All the regular hotels I typically stayed at we‚Äôre all booked up and the one I could find was very overpriced. So I went to AirBnb and found Carla‚Äòs place and was enamored by the pictures. I reached out to Carla with some concerns and she was very responsive and set my mind to ease. I am so so glad that I booked this little gem of a place, it exceeded my expectations and was so cozy and beautifully decorated and every touch possible you could imagine or want in a home away from home. This will definitely be my go to as Iwill be back to my regular routine of visiting and working in Del Rio again."

The home has many amenities We absolutely loved the decor and we even reached out to Carla to ask her where she purchased items from around the house.! Carla was so responsive and assured us that if we had any questions, do not hesitate to ask! This home is in downtown Del Rio with lots to do, and within walking distance of great coffee shops, the oldest winery, as well as a super live nightlife!

2024-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"My family and I were very impressed with the house; it was clean and spacious. The minute you walk in the house you know you made a good choice. I certainly was happy to hear from my family say I chose well in selecting this house. The amenities were outstanding, plenty of coffee pods and coffee pot to make coffee. There were snacks and plenty of room to have your own snack supply. The fridge was big enough and clean to place our food. Plenty of dishes silverware cups glasses, etc..everything you would need in your home. The bedrooms were clean and spacious and there were closets to keep your clothes, but not enough hanger. Based on the information stating house would accommodate 11, I don‚Äôt think 2 bathrooms is enough for 11. We were 7(two little kids) and it was a little challenging taking turns to bathe/shower. We definitely felt welcomed, it is a quiet street no problem with the parking, plenty of space. We definitely would not hesitate in staying there again."

2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"The house was very comfortable and cute! Lots of nice touches. The hosts were easy to communicate with and very responsive. It was perfect for our group, but the bunk room is a corridor that connects the front of the house to the back. This room would not be private during the day but has doors to close when needed. I highly recommend staying here."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Karina and Sostenes were lovely hosts! The house was clean and charming, a wonderful spot to gather as a family‚Äîand see the eclipse. We enjoyed the backyard chairs and picnic tables and did all our own cooking in the big kitchen. (Note: no dishwasher.) We‚Äôd absolutely recommend this spot for anyone passing through.

2023-11-01,4,Group trip,Perfect for a large family/group. We had planned for more than just my wife and I. That‚Äôs what took away from the value we gave it. Not the hosts‚Äô fault in any way.

2023-09-01,5,Group trip,Once again a great stay at Sostenes and Karina‚Äôs home. A beautiful time in a beautiful home! Can‚Äôt wait to be back. Thank you Sostenes and Karina!
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"Sostenes & Karina were very helpful and hospitable from start to finish with our stay! We live in Del Rio, and our air conditioning failed. We needed a place to stay last-minute, and their Air BnB was open for the night. I had access to the home within just an hour or two of booking it. The home was decorated to feel very comfortable and welcoming, with lots of couches and seating areas. It was very quite at night, and we slept very well. As someone who lives in Del Rio, the area of town in which their Air BnB is located is one of my favorites. Its within walking distance of a great tap room that usually has food trucks on the weekends (Mesquite Creek), an amazing local coffee shop (MoMo's), and the town library (very beautiful and peaceful)."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This house was perfect! 3 ""adult"" bedrooms and the kids had a room with 2 bunk beds (4 beds total) where they could have fun. Kitchen was huge and had everything we needed including a toaster, dishes, new fridge and stove. Location in south Del Rio is awesome. Very quiet street and tons of parking. Back yard was awesome with a patio and grass area for the kids. Two very nice bathrooms and a very well decorated home. Hosts were incredible and very accommodating and we will be staying there again."

The house was a stone‚Äôs throw from HEB, several great restaurants, the creek, and downtown. Sostenes and Karina were fantastic hosts, we arrived a little early from the 16+ hour road trip to get to Del Rio and they allowed us to check in early. I had a few questions along the way and they were really responsive. Like other guests we were greeted with some sweet treats, snacks, cold drinks in the fridge, and a fantastic little coffee setup! I have a lot of family in Del Rio but our family of five needed a spot to be able to wind down on our own and this house was more than perfect! Whatever the reason for your visit, I‚Äôd recommend this home and these hosts without reservation!"

2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,We were traveling from San Antonio to Big Bend and thought Del Rio would be convenient halfway place. Also wanted to visit Amistad National Recreation Area which is nearby. If we were to do it again I think we‚Äôd spend a day or two in Del Rio which seemed like a nice town.
2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,Lovely place to stay that makes you feel right at home.
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Absolutely would recommend

2024-02-01,4,Stayed with a pet,Exactly as described in listing. Was 10 min walk to Main Street where Mesquite Outfitters and Shane‚Äôs is for night life. Parking would be an issue if you had a large or multiple vehicles as you are only able to park on road in front of the house.
2024-02-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Perfect location
2024-02-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Enjoyed our stay at Adriana's. Very clean and had everything we needed.
If you're traveling with dog(s) take note that there isn't a fenced in area, but plenty of yard space on the side of the house."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed one night,Great stay
2023-12-01,3,Stayed with a pet,"The house itself is fine the problem was in the accuracy of the listing. The listing was corrected on the spot by the Host but at the time of my booking the listing indicated a fully fenced backyard was available. It was not; in fact the backyard was occupied by a dog (not ours) during our overnight stay. Secondly, the listing indicated on premises parking was available but our check in instructions said the driveway was private and we would have to park in the street. The Host did make an an ‚Äúexception‚Äù when I told her the listing indicated otherwise. Lastly, upon check out the Host requested a pet cleaning fee of $75 that was not in the listing."

Her home is so charming, roomy, peaceful & quiet and my Lab and I enjoyed her quaint patio and large yard, which borders a serene, crystal clear canal off of beautiful San Felipe Creek. I can‚Äôt say enough about the convenience of her home‚Äôs location and what an attentive and friendly host Adriana was to our family. Thank you so much for everything Adriana and we look forward to additional stays in your home in the future!"
2022-01-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"House is charming and convenient to downtown. I used the house while visiting Laughlin AFB, and would recommend for similar situations. Additionally, Del Rio is cute town and seems to have a lot to offer travelers looking for some fun outside adventures."

2021-12-01,5,Stayed one night,Excellent attention to detail and cleanliness. Great experience all around and the location and amenities were awesome. Beautiful little craftsman home with all the creature comforts you could ask for.

2021-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"Adriana was a very gracious host.
We had left a pillow on a previous stay, about 4 weeks ago, and she kept it aside, locked in a closet, and made the effort to get it back to us.
She even swung by in the evening to
Get it out of locked storage for us.
Meanwhile the house is super cute and neighborhood is a great‚Ä¶with walkable distance to old town, HEB and Main Street.
Thanks again"
2021-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Casa Sol feels like your right at home. Nice location close to many restaurants & outdoor activities.

2021-11-01,5,Stayed one night,Very clean and comfortable!
2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Check-in was easy and the home was very charming and clean. Nice amenities too including coffee, toiletries, clean towels, wifi and smart TV‚Äôs. The home is pet friendly for a non refundable $75 fee but be sure to bring your pet beds/kennels as house rules state pets are not allowed in the beds and furniture. I would say the pet fee is reasonable if you have a large dog with you but is a little on the high end for myself and my 7lb Chihuahua. I was not aware of the pet fee before I booked(I might have missed that part in the rules). Regardless, I would book again. Casa Sol is definitely one of the nicer stays in Del R√≠o and will be on the top on my favs for sure."

The home is LOVELY. Perfect for our family with kids. The living and dining room were very spacious and the laundry room with french doors also doubled as a play room. She even had a small storage bench with random kids toys that our little ones loved. The kitchen was stocked with plates, pans and utensils and each room had several bath towels set aside for everyone. There was a private entrance to the larger bedroom which leads to the cute patio!

The house was clean, tastefully decorated and easy to access.
Anyone would do well staying at this home in a visit to Del Rio."
2021-06-01,5,Stayed about a week,"What a Great Place! Had everything I needed while waiting for our house closing to go through. Adriana was very responsive with communication.

2021-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Adriana was a gem to work with - extremely responsive and accommodating. Her home is very clean. Spacious rooms. Bright, clean, updated bathroom. We were just there for a quick overnight and it was far better than a hotel stay. She was super and I am confident she would assist in any way. The town has limited hotel options so if two bedrooms and one bath is what you need, I would consider her home."

2021-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"This is a lovely home. The place is easy to find, very comfortable, and very clean. Adriana provided clear expectations and thorough instructions. The home is stocked as though it‚Äôs lived-in everyday. There wasn‚Äôt anything we needed that wasn‚Äôt available. We did bring a bag of ice because we like it in our sodas. I especially appreciated being able to bring my small dog. I will definitely look for availability here the next time I‚Äôm in Del Rio!"
2021-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Adriana is an amazing host. She responded to our questions within minutes, and kept checking in on us to make sure we were okay. Will definitely be back. **Also, love the record player and the eclectic selection of vinyl!"

2020-12-01,4,Stayed one night,"Great location. Very clean, check-in process was easy, and Adriana was very responsive. If you are planning on traveling with pets just be aware of the burweed or stickers in the back yard, they were constantly getting in our pets paws to the point where we had to walk our pets elsewhere."
2020-12-01,4,Stayed one night,Adriana was very nice and responsive in our communication. She was also very accommodating of our request for a 1-hr late checkout. It's clear that she put in the effort to make the stay comfortable. The property is spacious and in a convenient location.
2020-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,Great place to stay with family or friends. This home has a special charm to it. Very clean and the details in every room is special.

2020-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,Terrific house. Cozy and cute. Nice touches and decoration throughout the house. Beds were comfortable. Everything was clean. Access to the house was well communicated. WiFi was good. Nice to have the washer/dryer and a reasonably stocked kitchen. The location is close to the historic downtown Del Rio. Its not far from the Val Verde Winery. A short walk behind (NE) the house takes you to a park and the San Felipe Creek which is pretty. Nice residential area. We really enjoyed the house.
2020-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Casa Sol was well worth the visit and will most definitely rebook in future visits to Del Rio. Thank you for the great amenities!
2020-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Our second stay at Casa Sol was just as wonderful as the first; every room of this house is carefully considered & there is a little peaceful patio. We are martial arts instructors so the yoga equipment & laundry room proved very handy. Our 6'3"" friend was happy to discover that he was able to fully stand underneath the shower! We did run out of Keurig refills after our first night, but we are a multi-cup crowd & HEB is just down the street. We will be back for our next visit to Del Rio!"
2020-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Great location in town and at the end of a quiet street. Clean house with all the utensils and essentials we needed. Has good WiFi, too. Pet friendly.

2020-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"I really wanted to say that it met my expectation, but that doesn't do Casa Sol any justice! I KNEW walking in it was going to be the perfect little getaway bungalo and it was every bit of that and more! Beautiful furnishings, the kitchen is an absolute dream! I was mesmerized by the beautiful prisms on all the windows! 10/20 would visit again! Del Rio is the perfect small town and of course, no visit is complete without going to A Ramon Imports! We loved every minute of it!"
2020-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,One of our best airbnb stays ever! Even better than listed and expected. The perfect stay for us during a long drive. Would most definitely stay here again. Thanks Adriana!
2020-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"This was our last night after spending a week in the Big Bend area. Casa Sol is a lovely place with a full kitchen, comfortable beds, nice clean bathroom and shower. The location is close to restaurants and within walking distance to Val Verde Winery. We will definitely be back."
2020-10-01,5,Stayed one night,Fantastic stay! The place was immaculate. I would say the shower and bathtub were the cleanest I‚Äôve ever seen in any Airbnb and I‚Äôve stayed in Airbnb‚Äôs from Alaska to Texas! The host was very kind and helpful and responded to my questions immediately. The house was comfortable and decorated so nicely. There was the most lovely creek in the backyard. They were butterflies migrating and beautiful flowering trees in the backyard. We loved it and highly recommend and would definitely stay there again. And did I say the bathroom was immaculate? Stupendous!
2020-10-01,5,Stayed over a week,Adriana‚Äôs place is very roomy and super up to date. It‚Äôs very calm and relaxing and the kitchen makes you feel at home. Having a laundry space is always great and convenient. Definitely a place that when you travel you will feel right at home.

2020-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Adriana‚Äôs place is cute, clean and very well located. If you are looking for the perfect accommodating spot in Del Rio, Casa del Sol is it! Looking at the photo book of the renovations, it is amazing to see how much the house has changed, and how hard they worked on their home. We enjoyed our stay!"
2020-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"We loved our stay here! When compared with other AirBnb‚Äôs, I felt that we got a lot of space and amenities for our money, but we did have some issues with the space not being clean. The owner was very kind, and told us she would let her cleaning crew know, so hopefully this issue is fixed in the future! Overall, we really did love staying here!"
2020-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great accommodations!!
2020-08-01,5,Group trip,Very clean home. Perfect for a family of four. Great kitchen and comfortable beds.

2020-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"This is a great little house in Del Rio. We love these well maintained older houses. You can tell that a lot of thought was put into decor, and it is very kid friendly. The bed was also super comfy. It was close to everything we needed. We were passing through so we only stayed one night, but we would not hesitate to stay again for an extended stay."
2020-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"Cutely remodeled house, keyless entry made arriving late at night really easy. We were able to use the washer and dryer after a long day in the river - a great feature! Adriana was super communicative and flexible. Beautiful hard wood floors and nice little record player."
2020-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Casa del Sol was amazing to stay in! I‚Äôll definitely book again in the near future. And the H‚ÄëE‚ÄëB nearby was a great perk. Thank you, Adriana! You have a beautiful home."
2020-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,An ideal place to stay in Del R√≠o. Wonderful host and fantastic place. Very clean and has everything you may need. Would definitely stay here again!

2020-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,The town was extremely clean and we loved the fact that there were many items to help with infants/toddlers. The house is very well put together and we even played a little Sinatra on the record player. We will definitely be back in the future.
2020-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"Casa Del Sol is so welcoming and inviting, it has everything you may need and more. I can‚Äôt say enough good things about the house and my stay. I will always go back if it‚Äôs available. Always. Thank you üôèüèº"
2020-07-01,5,Stayed one night,Amazing home! Very responsive host. Will be back for sure...
2020-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Very clean and comfortable home. Refrigerated air was awesome, you could stay in all day and really enjoy the rest and relaxation. Grill outside or cook in makes for a great stay. Sits back out of traffic but still close to stores and restaurants."
2020-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The house was very cute and clean. When we arrived, there was a smoke alarm that was beeping due to a low battery. I text Adriana and she came right over to replace the battery. The only thing I would note is that the toilet is very hard to flush. Sometimes we had to flush 2 or 3 times just for water to go down. Other than that, everything was great! I would recommend this house for a safe and clean place to stay in Del Rio."
2020-06-01,4,Group trip,"The house is great, decorated nicely, a/c works well, there‚Äôs a sprinkler system in the yard to walk through and cool off when you‚Äôre sitting outside on the patio. House is located at the end of a dead end street which added to the overall privacy.
The only major drawback is the lack of water pressure inside the house. It‚Äôs so bad that on the day of our arrival we were asked not to flush our used toilet paper down the toilet in fear the plumbing would back up. This was a real turn off and clearly a major sanitation concern having to throw used toilet paper in the bathroom trash can. Had we known about this sooner, our party of six would have stayed elsewhere for the week. I don‚Äôt want to discourage anyone from staying at this house because it was a nice place, but on the other hand I think this is a serious enough issue that others need to consider before booking.
My hope is that the host addresses the plumbing issue so others can enjoy the house in the future."
2020-06-01,5,Stayed one night,Great space and big kitchen for cooking. Charming neighborhood. Will definitely stay here again if In del rio.
2020-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This home is wonderful! It is in a beautiful part of town, very quiet and very safe. Highly recommend this home for your visit to beautiful Del R√≠o, TX."
2020-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We stayed at Casa Sol for a martial arts seminar & had a wonderful stay. Laundry & a sparkling clean bath were great perks for such a trip. The kitchen is notably well equipped & every room was enjoyable to spend time in. The only thing we wondered was if there was something wrong with the water pressure in the shower - the tap burst forth powerfully with water but the shower was a bit trickly. Other than that we had a perfect stay & will be back for the next seminar!
2020-06-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Great, homey stay!"
2020-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,Adriana was a very good host. We drove from Oklahoma City and were looking for a place to stay last minute and super late. We would definitely book here again. Kid friendly too.

This is a 5 star place!"

2020-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,.
2020-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"My grandmother passed away and I had to go to Del Rio for her funeral. We were debating between a hotel and this Airbnb and we are very happy we chose this place. The house is beautiful and has everything that you would need. We felt safe and secure in the home which was very important to me and my husband as we had our twin boys with us. The house had several updates that were very pleasant to see and made us feel at home. We did have to check in later than expected due to the cleaning ladies finishing up later than expected but we got a later check out time in return and the house was very clean. The cleaning lady is super sweet and did a great job. Overall, if we ever come back to Del Rio we will opt to stay here again for sure. We also appreciated the accommodations that Adriana made for me. They made a difference in this rough time for me/us."

The rooms were clean and well-furnished (with a TV in each), and the living space, dining room, kitchen, and bathroom were impeccable. Check in/out were a breeze as well. It made being in Del Rio an absolute joy - a 10/10 experience!"
2020-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Adorably home, with cute decore."
2018-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"Casa Sol is an adorable house in downtown Del Rio. I loved the decor and the overall bright happy feel of the home. It is very secure, super clean and really well kept.

It was so easy to get to. The neighborhood was nice. Access to get inside was easy. Parking was plenty with a carport The pool was still a little cold when we first got in but it was wonderful once in the water. The 4 bedroom's was beautiful and the beds and pillows were comfortable. It was nice having 2 an 1/2 bathrooms. The dinning area was so nice with its coffee bar added. The living room was nice and comfortable. We enjoyed hanging out in our little spare time and watching movies on the huge TV. We had a problem with one of the beds, it had been broken by the last guest so I text Cassandra. She and her maintenance assistant contacted me back immediately and we had a new bed quickly. Cassandra even can to make sure we were took care of. We will definitely love to stay in her home if we ever get to go back to Del Rio Tx. We will definitely recommend Cassandra and The Pool House to you on your visit to Del Rio."

2023-10-01,5,Group trip,Another great stay !!!
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The house is older, and the bathrooms were pretty small, I think they would be a bit difficult to use for larger people, but my kids had no issues. The pool was great. We used it every day! I cooked several meals and the kitchen had everything I needed. The washer and dryer look a bit ruff, but they worked well, we did several loads during our week here. If you have a person who moves a lot during sleep, the full-size bed in the back righthand bedroom creaks quite loudly, we did some bedroom shuffling after our first night and switched the kiddos.

2023-06-01,5,Group trip,"This house is perfect for our family. This was our first time doing AirBnB in Del Rio. Usually we stay in a motel.
Pool was clean and they had toys, floaties, all the things you need.
Bathrooms and laundry stocked with everything you need.
Plenty of things to cook on in the kitchen, even left some Folgers.
We'll stay here every time."
2023-06-01,3,Group trip,"The house needs some TLC. LAMPS. We are all night time readers and the living room didn‚Äôt have any. The cabinets had expired items. The fridge had old milk and ice. We were looking for a few amenities in the bathroom, because with five women left small personal items at home thinking we didn‚Äôt need to bring them. (Bar soap, shampoo) the seller point was of course the pool. If we rent this house again it will be for the pool."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Thank you for sharing your home. We enjoyed our stay and will definitely stay again. The pool was a bonus. 3rd time I have stayed here, centrally located, easy to find and great communication! Modestly appointed."

2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Awesome place definitely staying here every time I‚Äôm in town.
2022-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,Home away from Home. The home is welcoming and inviting. The TV was equipped with all the latest tv and movie apps. The pool was clean and great when the temperatures soared. Ample bedding and towels available for guest and a well stocked kitchen with appliances in excellent condition. The community is very safe. It felt like one could sleep with the doors open all night. Beds were huge and comfy and water was hot after sweating in the Del Rio sun. I hope to return next time we need housing while visiting family. Highly recommend this place.

2022-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Very nice, Great Location, we really enjoyed our stay"
2022-01-01,4,Stayed a few nights,The house worked well for our visit. The location was great. It is an older home but was comfortable . The power sources on the sides of the night stands in bedroom #1 for charging phones etc was so appreciated. It had easy access for our Mom who uses a walker. The check-in was easy and our hostess answered our questions well. It was too cold to use the pool or back yard but they looked inviting. Definitely would recommend it.
2021-12-01,5,Group trip,Amazing place with a great location. Definitely recommend.
2021-12-01,3,Stayed with kids,"House is very roomy fits a large family but is very, very outdated and restroom door on hallway did NOT locked which made it uncomfortable for whoever was in restroom. Neighborhood dogs will be your alarm.
House does offer plenty of parking and location is close to stores and restaurants. I think with some much needed updates to home, this could be a great rental."
2021-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Honestly a very beautiful home. We were in town for a wedding and this place went above our expectations. Clean, spacious and overall welcoming. We hope to return when our travels bring us back to the Del R√≠o area. Thank you to the hosts for the fast communication and easy check in. 100% recommended."

2021-09-01,5,Group trip,Great place it was so much fun!! Pool was amazing such a warm and cozy home definitely will be staying here again!
2021-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This house was great! We had 6 people (2 adults, 4 kids ages 6 - 17) and we had plenty of room/ sleeping space. Even my inlaws that we were visiting loved it. There are 2 full bathrooms and a half bath. One full bath is a jack-and-jill bath between the room with queen beds. The other full bath is in the master bedroom which has one of the king beds. This room also has night stands that have several plugs built into the side so you cannuse them for your charging/ cpap machine area. The half bath can be accessed from the hall but also the last bedroom with the other king bed. The little kids loved this room because it had a popcorn ceiling with glitter in it plus a nightlight that made it sparkle like stars when they went to bed at night.
Our kids spent all three days in the pool, and even insisted on swimming at night since there was a light in the pool. There are quite a few life vests and other pool supplies but many of them are broken so you might want to bring your own life vest floats for younger kids. There were water guns and some goggles also.
There are two grills, a really nice large gas grill and a small charcoal grill. The gas grill worked great and there were plenty of grill utensils.
The kitchen is equipped with most of what you will need to cook. The only things that they don't have (as of this review) that you might need are a roasting pan, large cookie sheet (there's a small one), or a pitcher. There's a dishwasher and a large fridge.
The house was very clean and comfortable. The carport is very high so we were able to park our NV3500 passenger van in it with no problem. There is only one TV and it is a ROKU smart tv in the livingroom. There is a large dining table that sits about 5 - 6 people. However, there is a large coffee table that can be used for the kids, or a folding table that is putside along with 4 folding chairs. The porch has a comfy sitting area with a coffee table, and a gazeebo with a metal table with four metal chairs. The grass next to the pool has stickers in it so don't let your kids run around without shoes in the grass area (this is typical of this area though).
There are plenty of towels in the laundryroom, and the washer and dryer work great.
The host was very responsive to pur questions. We can see why they're a ""super host"". You will not go wrong by staying here especially if you have a large group like ours."
2021-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This home is beautiful in so many ways, 4 great size bedrooms, 3 restrooms, everything you could want in a getaway. The pool is perfection and always so clean, backyard BBQ time oh yes. the most comfy sofas and we all use the recliner for naps or just to watch TV.
We are always so excited and grateful to stay here."
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Excellent find! Great location . Extremely clean, spacious and overall comfortable home. The pool was an amazing addition to our visit! Will definitely return."

2021-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,Awesome!!
2021-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This home was very comfortable inside. The kitchen had everything you need to cook with. The fridge was big with a big freezer. The A/C worked great, since we came from a dry and cooler area we were relieved about this. The pool was wonderful! There was plenty of room, the living room couch folds out into a bed, but we didn't need to use it. The home is close to shops and restaurants. The washer/dryer worked well. Don't be discouraged if the front lawn doesn't look as pleasant as the house is inside. We really felt at home. There is no cable for the large screen tv, however the house does have Wifi connection. We streamed different apps using my personal account."

2021-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We love this house. I have kids and it‚Äôs really hard to stay at a Airbnb if they have way to many decorations (glass,pictures, glass tables) this house don‚Äôt have all that extra fancy stuff and it‚Äôs perfect for me I can relax and know my kids won‚Äôt brake anything. It‚Äôs always very clean and communication is great."
2021-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"I cannot say enough great things about this rental. My family and I had the best experience and our kids really enjoyed to beautiful pool during the day and night!

We really appreciate the host, especially since we came in a day early and left a day later, your accommodations were outstanding no matter what! Thank you so much we appreciate everything!"

2020-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Great stay, and great location."
2020-06-01,5,Group trip,"The house was clean and simply furnished. There are 4 bedrooms, 2 full baths and one half bath. The kitchen is well supplied with dishes and such and there is a nice eating area. The pool is small, but clean and refreshing. It's clear the house was painted quickly as their paint on the dated borders, likely painted quickly to make it a rental property. The interior of the house seems to be well maintained and clean. There is a large, fenced, private backyard with a pool. We spent the first evening out in the pool (it was after dark, so we were a bit surprised to see the yard in daylight the next morning). The backyard could use some TLC - gazebo needs paint, pieces of the decorative trim around the overhang are coming down, there are some old, broken plastic toys under one of the trees, weeds growing in the sidewalk, falling apart artwork and such hanging around, etc. The house and yard were fine and comfortable for our purposes. If you are looking for a 5 star place, this not it; however, it was clean and comfortable. Cassandra was a very responsive and hospitable host ."
2020-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,This weekend as such an amazing house . We used the pool so much and loved that there were toys and life jackets there for us to use . Definitely a place we will stay at again .

2020-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,The house was really clean. The beds felt like pillow tops. The pool was really clean and had great shade to protect you from the sun. There‚Äôs some lawn chairs and some life jackets for kids by the pool. It was awesome and so much better than staying at a cramped hotel room. WiFi and Tv were a lifesaver. Already looking for availability to book again since my boys loved the experience. Imagine a day on the lake then coming home to sparkling pool.
2020-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great location for fishing at Lake Amistad. Beautiful home with a pool and lots of space. Cassandra is super responsive. A+

2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great location in a private neighborhood. The communal areas (kitchen and living room) are very spacious. The beds were comfy, and it was nice that each bedroom had its own thermostat. The showers were fantastic! The kitchen was easy to use--we had an easy time doing our own cooking, but we didn't need to because the house is just minutes from fantastic restaurants in both Del Rio and Acuna. The pool was great, and the backyard is big and private. Great place."
2024-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This place is very well kept, a beautiful home. Every appliance you can think of. A bit pricey given the location and neighborhood. There was roosters crowing all hours of the day especially at night."

It just feels like home. The house is super spacious, clean, quite area and provides everything you need. Would recommend this house if you are traveling to Del Rio. You won‚Äôt be disappointed with the house and Lucielly is a great friendly host."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed over a week,Lucielly's home was a fantastic choice for my boss's stay in Del Rio. Lucielly truly cares about her guests and checked in with me several times to make sure everything was going well. Would definitely reserve this home again.

2023-07-01,5,Group trip,"Our family really enjoyed the Casa Mestiza home. It is definitely very spacious and roomy, we felt like we were at our home. The pool was very enjoyable and relaxing. If your looking for a beautiful, spacious and well kept up home. So book for your next stay!!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,This house was beautiful very spacious and lucielly was very reachable at all time she was very helpful for anything we needed. Will definitely rent again my concerns were addressed to her and she was great at responding. Made my family feel like we never left home and very peaceful.
2023-07-01,4,Stayed with kids,"This house is very nice inside. it's roomy, very comfortable beds, a large open kitchen, and living area.
The host was super fast to respond to issues and any questions we had.
The only thing that you may want to keep in mind when considering this rental is that this area of town is actually more like being out in the country among a bunch of small farms/ ranches. This means that you may have farm animal sounds, saceda sounds, and other wildlife. This wasn't a big deal to us, but some people might not realize this due to its close proximity to downtown.
All-in-all, the house was great stay for our family of 6."
2023-06-01,4,Stayed with kids,Beautiful home. Much bigger than we expected. All the bedrooms were spacious and clean. Each bed room has its own thermostat so you can set your own temperature. Living room super spacious and great comfortable sofa that at both ends of the sofa you can recline. Over all a good place to stay and at a good price rate for the size of the house.
2023-06-01,5,Group trip,We stayed for the weekend and we felt like we hadn‚Äôt left home. Just a very peaceful place with very comfortable beds
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Absolutely the best place to stay! The home is beautiful with lots of amenities! The beds are super comfortable, the kitchen was great and the pool was a cherry on top for our small family gathering! Lucielly was a great host, always communicating. She was accessible at all times. Thank you Lucielly. We'll definetly stay here again!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We stayed a couple nights at the end of May and really enjoyed our stay. We didn't have any issues. I think we ran out of trash bags and we asked Lucy if there was any more, she responded fast and her son ran us out some. Lucy was very accommodating and responded fast. We stayed there for a family reunion and my sister in law in her kids had issues at her hotel, and Lucy let my sister in law and her kids stay with us free of charge. The house was extremely roomy and can accommodate a lot of people. We just relaxed and hung out by the pool most of the time. I really recommend this house if you plan on staying in Del Rio. Thanks Lucy"
2023-04-01,5,Group trip,"came to town for a wedding. Perfect location as Del Rio is really small. Close to the winery which is a must go to when in Rome. The pool was clean. There are a lot of extras. The big spray is there but empty, so I would recommend being your own insect repellent is you want to spend time outdoors."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"La Casa Meztiza was amazing. There was plenty of room for our family and the beds were comfy. We appreciated all the essentials that were provided like paper towels, toilet paper, soaps and even snacks!! The pool was a big plus!
My daughter is stationed at nearby Laughlin so I plan on booking Lucy‚Äôs place in the future."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Absolute best place to stay in Del Rio! Communication was very timely, accurate and helpful. Host was extremely responsive. Everything was extremely clean & organized. The home is wonderful - plenty of space and comfortable areas to gather. The covered patio and pool area are great also. Had a terrific stay with the family and definitely plan to stay here next time in Del Rio (even if it is just my wife & I). Great value for the price."
2023-03-01,5,Group trip,"My family and I were in Del Rio for my nephews graduation from fighter pilot training. The house is gigantic and we never felt like we were in one another's way. The home is beautifully decorated and all the little extras made for an easy getaway. The coffee and tea station, treats like chips and cookies, laundry room with detergent, plenty of dishes, cooking utensils, wine glasses and we were even greeted with a bottle from the local winery. If I ever have the pleasure of returning to the area I will definitely stay here again. So far the best air b & b.
Lucielly is a wonderful hostess, she went out of her way to make sure we had everything we needed.
So happy she let us know about the deer feeding in the field behind the back fence, my Dad especially liked watching.
Janet and Family"
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Enjoyed the stay!!
2022-11-01,5,Group trip,"I cannot say enough nice things about our stay. The home was very welcoming while still being clean and organized. We loved that there was the ability to control the temperature in each room and it really helped for our guest who needed a different temperature than everyone else. Every single bed was comfortable no one had any complaints at all. It was awesome having a TV in every room so that when everyone went to bed they could still have their own time to unwind. The house itself was laid out perfectly for entertaining and for good family time. We were able to cook and still enjoy one another, and then all of us get around a table together to eat, which we really appreciated. The back was awesome and perfect for hanging out. and as if the house wasn‚Äôt great enough, our host was just the kindest person ever. She wasn‚Äôt overbearing but made sure that we were having a good time and there was nothing we needed. We will definitely be booking the next time we are in town and don‚Äôt plan on staying anywhere else. Shower pressure was great too-which is a major plus!Thank you for an amazing weekend!"

From the start, they loved the property and had zero complaints during their time there. Helen was an absolute pleasure to work with and you could tell she cared about your comfort and experience while at her property. Anytime I had a question or a request she was incredibly responsive and willing to accommodate if she could, and in our case she did every time. My boss and his wife loved her property, it was exactly as portrayed in the listing, and very clean. If they return to Del Rio, we will be requesting her property again."

2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is my new go-to place the next time I‚Äôm in town. Super easy to find, if you‚Äôre already on Veterans Blvd., it‚Äôs right by the bank and within walking distance of some good restaurants. The home was exactly as shown in the pictures, the amenities were great, and the place was spotless! My favorite thing about the property is the private enclosed backyard and patio, wonderful quiet place to relax after work. Enjoyed the bonus patio above the garage overlooking the long driveway. Will definitely have to bring the boat next time I‚Äôm here with family!"

Despite being in an older neighborhood, we enjoyed peace and quiet, allowing us to unwind and relax. Plus, the central location made it easy to explore Del Rio's main streets with quick access to both directions of hwy 90 and Laughlin AFB.
The host was exceptional, providing clear communication and ensuring that our stay was nothing short of perfect.
We would definitely recommend this home for anyone looking for a safe, clean, comfortable stay in Del Rio."
