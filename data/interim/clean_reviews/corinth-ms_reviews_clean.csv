2023-11-01,5,Group trip,"This house was ideal for our needs. We had people from Ms,Mi and Fl here for the wedding of my grandson. The house made a great place where we could relax and visit between the different events. The location is beautiful, quiet and private. The house is elegant yet very comfortable at the same time. I would highly recommend this location for anyone spending time in Corinth. By the way Tammi is a great host."

2023-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We were in town for our daughters wedding and selected this home to stay in for the weekend.
I'm so thankful we did.
Tammi was a precious host and her home is absolutely gorgeous.
Spotless clean and so Peaceful.
We have already talked about renting it again just for a weekend getaway because it was so amazing and we didn't feel like we got to spend enough time just enjoying the beautiful home.
I would 100% highly recommend it to anyone. We look forward to staying again.
Thank you Tammi for a wonderful experience and for sharing your gorgeous home with us. It was a absolutely perfect weekend, all the way around."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful home, nice quiet location, and a very responsive host."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,The property was beautiful & comfortable. We were in Corinth for a wedding and this house served our needs in the best way. It was great to show folks who had never been to Mississippi what a southern charming house looks like. Thank you for adding simple amenities like soaps and coffee.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful home in quiet area. Very easy process throughout. Not a location (Corinth) I’ll probably ever need to return to, but if I did this is definitely the place to stay."

2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Tammi is a delightful and helpful host. The Carriage House is beautiful, inviting and very comfortable. It was the perfect place for 8 of us to stay while we enjoyed a nearby family reunion in the charming town of Corinth! Thank you, Tammi!"
2023-06-01,5,Group trip,"My high school friends and I got together for our 43rd class reunion. The house is on a beautiful street really close to downtown Corinth. It could
Not have been more perfect - gorgeous home clean easy comfortable - Tammi was the perfect host - very flexible and assessable"
2023-05-01,5,Group trip,"How many adjectives can I use? Spacious, clean, well maintained, beautiful home in a quiet neighborhood. Miss Tammi was very helpful through the whole process and was quick to respond to emails. The neighborhood has some beautiful and well maintained older homes. The neighborhood itself was quite and peaceful. All of us loved the house. Miss Tammi has thought of every detail so we were well taken care of. If we’re ever in Corinth again we would definitely stay here!"
2023-05-01,5,Group trip,What a beautiful unique home! The entire house is perfectly decorated!
2023-02-01,5,Stayed one night,Their home is so beautiful l. We used it for a bachelorette night. It has so much space and we had plenty of room to get ready. Mrs. Tammi was so flexible with us and it was so very appreciated!
2023-01-01,5,Group trip,This is one of the most amazing homes I have ever been in. I have lived in corinth most of my life and love Tammi's homes. I rented the home for my gymnastics judges to stay in while at my STARGAZER meet . We will definitely do this again!
2023-01-01,5,Group trip,I want say that Tammi went above and beyond for our stay. She was one of the most kindest people I have ever dealt with staying out of town. The most accommodating places I’ve ever had the pleasure of staying. Beautiful home just as described. Cleaner than a brand new house. Tip top in our opinion. Would definitely recommend staying here to friends and family.
2022-11-01,5,Group trip,"We were in for a wedding and everything went beautifully for our group of 8! This home was the perfect property! Cozy, quaint, comfortable and THE cleanest (which was most appreciated)! Thank you Tammi! The pictures of the property don't even do the home justice!"
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We really enjoyed our stay at the Carrage House! It was perfect for a family gathering! The pictures don't do justice to how nice it really is.
2022-11-01,5,Group trip,I came into to spend for a family trip to our hometown. Tammi is an amazing host. She’s a true southern belle. This home is amazing and filled with a lot of character and love.

Recommended!"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Amazing house. Beautifully styled with a cosy southern feel. Plenty of room for everyone and Tammi is a great host. We wish we could take this house with home with us.
2022-09-01,5,Group trip,"If you ever find yourself visiting Corinth, MS this is a MUST stay. The carriage house is one of the most coziest homes we have ever been in. Our host was available for any needs and being next door she was literally able to walk right over. Cheers to you Tammi and your lovely rental. We can't wait to come back! #superhost"

2021-11-01,5,Group trip,"One of the most well-appointed and comfortable places I have stayed! (Ritz-Carlton like) Beds and linens were amazing, plenty of dishes/silverware, cozy fireplace. Great area to take a walk and a town that has some really cute shops and great restaurants. If ever back in Corinth, will definitely stay here!"
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This house is beautiful and in a great location! Perfect proximity to downtown and mixture of old charm with new amenities! Will definitely be renting again!

5/5 stars across the board. Thank you Tammi for making our stay in Corinth a wonderful experience!"
2024-06-01,3,Group trip,"We love the character of the house and it was perfectly located for the event we were there for. There were areas that were not clean; however, when I notified Kelly, she immediately replied and offered to correct. Beautiful spacious home and friendly neighbor. Limited parking. Would stay there again."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Charming large 100 year old house with many original features, all on the ground floor. Historic neighborhood in a civil war town of important battles. Original 19th century downtown only two blocks away.
New kitchen, nicely tuned up bathrooms. Charming “Shabby-Shiek” decorating to go with the vintage house.
Lots of great cafes and restaurants on Main Street and tons of fast food options on all the highway routes into the town.
If you love history and charming old Southern towns, this will be a very memorable place to stay!"

2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great
2024-04-01,5,Stayed over a week,Great
2024-03-01,3,Stayed with kids,"The location itself was perfect. The house has tons of charm, unfortunately it seems to be in disrepair. Some of the things promised on the website weren’t there on the property. The back yard needs major maintenance. There was not a fire pit as advertised. The back door was spongy from leaking and there was a mold smell throughout the whole house. The kitchen was beautiful but needed to be cleaned. The drawers had old stuff from previous renters and food crumbs in them. The shower had a razor that had been used in it. The front porch was not maintained. We removed the cushions as they were so dirty. The American flag honestly needed to be removed it was in such poor shape. On arrival we did not receive instructions on check in with keypad code or any response from Kelly until I contacted airBNB. She was quick to respond after but it was 4pm Corinth time when we were able to check in. All in all, wonderful location. Hope it receives the maintenance it deserves."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was perfect. We’ve stayed at quite if few Airbnb’s and this one exceeded our expectations.
Kelly was great to work with."
2024-02-01,5,Group trip,"My bridesmaids and I stayed here a couple days before my wedding. It was easy to find, safe, extremely clean, and spacious for 6 girls to spend time together. The house is beautiful and had everything we needed. The downtown location was convenient to local restaurants, shops, and coffee shops. Kelly was so helpful, kind and was a great host. I highly recommend staying here. Would love to return when in the Corinth area again."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,Thank you so much Kelly! This is our favorite place to stay when we come to town!
2023-12-01,5,Group trip,Great location! Walkable to all downtown has to offer. Very nice historic home!
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Kelly was fantastic! Will stay with her again in the future.
2023-11-01,5,Group trip,"Me and a few members of my wedding party stayed here when I was getting married. The house was spacious, beautiful and very clean. Definitely would recommend this property!!"
2023-10-01,4,Stayed a few nights,My daughter and I stayed here and really loved it. The remodel was done so well. Lots of space. Easily could accommodate two couple and a couple of kids. We could walk to historic homes.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We were in walking distance to coffee shops and downtown shopping, as well as The Generals Quarters for a drink before dinner. Visitors loved the place as well and wanted to know how we found it."
2023-10-01,4,Stayed with kids,"Beautiful home.
Only 10 min to wedding venue."
2023-09-01,5,Group trip,"Kelly is an awesome host - thoughtful, and great communication. The cottage is a great property - clean, tastefully furnished, and highly functional. We stayed for a week and enjoyed it very much."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Absolutely a beautiful home, very clean & close to everything"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Kelly’s downtown Corinth home is quiet and inviting. It is tastefully decorated and free of excess clutter/decor. I wasn’t constantly worried about my young children damaging “trinkets” as the home has a minimal, yet pleasing vibe. The beds were comfortable and the hot water was quick and ample for all 6 of us. Kelly is extremely responsive and eager to help during your stay. Very hospitable."
2023-07-01,5,Group trip,This was a beautiful very cozy and spacious place to stay.
2023-06-01,3,Stayed with kids,"Visiting family in Corinth. We rent houses every year when traveling. I specifically searched vrbo and Airbnb sites for a home that was downtown Corinth so we could walk to the shopping. When we arrived the location was perfect, it was easy to check in. The walkway to the back door needs some attention. Entering the house the musty smell was overwhelming for me. Hubby talked me into staying. The house decor was cute as shown in pictures. I had to sweep the floors they were dirty. The blankets on couch were dirty so I washed those so we could enjoy them.The beds were clean. This house needs to be sprayed for bugs. Hubby was on the couch reading as a spider crawled on him. There was a spider in our daughters bed, a spider and big cockroach in the tub, ants too. No string lights in backyard as described, but that back space is unusable anyway. Location was great, but from the smell, bugs and it not being super clean it wasn’t worth the price. City is safe to stay in."
2023-05-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"it was located very close to all my family events.
quiet, front porch was good to sit,rest. reflect.
lots of room and all went fine."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"BOOK NOW!!
Kelly was great throughout the entire process. She was extremely responsive, helpful, and sweet. We used this air bnb to get ready for a wedding then a honeymoon suite the night of the wedding.
The house is absolutely beautiful and so much bigger than the picture portray. I even took pictures to use as inspo for the house we are building.
Great location and super quiet.
We LOVED this Air BnB!
If you are thinking about booking…DO IT!!"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,This was a wonderful stay for me and my family. The neighborhood is beautiful and its nice to walk around and look at all the nice homes and shops. I highly recommend for this area and I look forward to staying again in the future. Kelly is also a wonderful host & is very responsive!!
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We had a wonderful time during our stay. The house was the perfect mix of farmhouse/modern design. It was very clean and family friendly. The house definitely has a welcome feel with southern charm. Thank you again for your hospitality!
Lori"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,My family and I enjoyed our stay at Kelly's home in historic downtown Corinth. Kelly did a beautiful job updating this home while keeping the homes historic feel. We had everything we needed while staying here. The kitchen was well appointed and the beds are very comfortable. We enjoyed taking walks in the neighborhood and looking at all the old homes. The house is within walking distance of the Civil War Interpretative Center and library. I would highly recommend this home if you are coming to Corinth for a visit.
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Had a great stay again
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Had a great stay

2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place and clean. Would definitely stay there again
2022-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"I've stayed in many Airbnbs and VRBO rental properties all over the country, and rarely do I find one that is so spot-on, so tastefully decorated, so comfortable, and so charming! Kelly was an excellent communicator and when we come back, we'll definitely stay again. It's perfect for couple travelers, or a small family. Highly recommend!!!"
2022-10-01,3,Stayed about a week,"The home was nice, but there were things that were things that were not there that were offered. like a grill, and fire pit. I did ask for it twice, and never got it. the place was kind of clean, meaning the stove was filthy, the pots and crock pot was filthy. there were coffee grinds in the coffee maker. my wife and sister took time and scubbed them clean. that back door handle didn't work, so you could come in, but you couldn't use to go out. when I let her know, I was told if I didn't feel safe I could just leave and she would give me a full refund. kind hard to do that when we booked it for 7 nights. also the back door trim was falling apart at the bottom. also the swing in the back yard has a huge tear in the part where you sit, making it unusable. Also in the first bathroom
if she got a new cleaning lady, and did some small maintenance around the house it would be much bettershower the paint is peeling really bad off of the window. I would also suggest dressers in every room not just one room. also in the back bedroom there is a huge hole in the closet. and she might want to get a person out there to check her attic, there is either mice or a small animal living up there. we paid a lot of money to stay here, and was very disappointed in what we got for the money. Don’t like to be ugly, just stating the facts. however afte.r we cleaned up and bought some supplies it was a nice location. and could be a great home to stay if she got a good cleaning lady and did a few maintenance on the house."
2022-10-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Exceptionally homely and a comfortable stroll from all of downtown. Nice and quiet for sleeping and a great place to sit on the front porch and watch the world go by, A very pleasant stay."
2022-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The home is a nice blend of modern and “old world” charm. It was clean, spacious, and relaxing. We had everything we needed and the host was good to check on us after we arrived to see if we needed anything. I would definitely recommend."

2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great house! The house is deceptively large. It looks like a small cottage from the outside but when you get inside the house is very spacious. Kelly has done a beautiful job of updating the house, especially the kitchen and bathrooms, and still preserving the historical charm, like the built-in corner cupboard and the transom windows at each room. My family truly enjoyed the house and I hope it is available the next time I go to Corinth because I would love to stay there again!"

2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This house is located in a rural location near the MS/TN state line. Selmer, TN and Corinth, MS are only a short drive away. Local convenience and dollar store only 5 minutes away. The house is very comfortable, clean, and stylish. This is a no-brainer if you have to stay anywhere near the area."

2024-02-01,5,Stayed one night,Great place! Amber was very accommodating when our original plans fell through. Had some trouble with the code but Amber was very quick to respond and help us. Just wish we could have enjoyed the place longer.
2024-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,We loved this place. It exceeded our expectations. So much character. My wife came home inspired to make our farmhouse look better. She was literally shopping for furniture on the ride home. Amber couldn’t have been kinder or more helpful. We’ll be coming back next year and as soon as I know the dates we know exactly where we’ll be staying.
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,My wife and I actually got to meet amber this time. This was our second time staying in one of her homes and we highly recommend it. Her and her husband are absolutely precious. They’ve about got us wanting to move to the area. It’s so peaceful and quiet. This home was so pleasant. It was comfortable and so clean.

On a tree lined street with many other historic homes , the house and community was like a step back in time with all the modern conveniences. Everything in the house had been updated but done in a way as to maintain the integrity and the character of the orignal features of the house. Amber was also a very gracious host who allowed us a late last minute booking and check in.

It was very clean also and easy to find."

2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a wonderful stay in Amber's cottage. It is spacious, spotless and decorated in such a beautiful style. It was so relaxing to listen to the rain on the tin roof while relaxing in a very comfortable bed. The yard is perfect to enjoy coffee and take in the peaceful country area. There are so many great restaurants and history very close to the cottage. It felt like home and we are planning our next trip back!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed one night,Absolutely perfect! Can't wait to visit again
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is a cute little place! We had a wonderful time, and it was perfect for the two of us"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"You know how sometimes you look at a listing and everything seems great, and the photos look amazing, and you can't wait to get there...but then you do and it's just not what you expected? That's not this place at all! Everything was not only just what I expected, but honestly even a little better. The neighborhood was quiet, peaceful, and there was lots of room between this house and other houses. Rooms were impressively furnished, kitchen/living room were extraordinarily cozy, and the view from the back porch was outstanding. This is an easy five-star review--I strongly recommend it, and I hope we can go back again."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,The house was beautiful. Pictures do not do it justice.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We enjoyed our time down in Guys, the house is well kept, clean and updated. Amber was a great host and very responsive. Thanks again."

2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This AirBNB was excellent. Better than 5 stars. Better than the photos. Beautifully furnished with all we could possibly need for a peaceful get away. We enjoyed the front & back porches and the lovely quiet country setting. Easy safe Parking at the door. Lots of small touches, ceiling fans, lights next to the beds to read by & our own thermostat! (no misery being stuck too hot or too cold)There were Comfortable attractive furnishings, lots of natural light and plenty of easy to use window coverings. It is close to Cornith with good restaurants, (not always the case in small towns) There is always a moment of trepidation when checking into an Airbnb. Is there going to be something I missed in the listing, or maybe an unwelcome surprise? It felt wonderful to pull up and walk into such a lovely place. The host topped off the visit with a carriage ride & showed us the old Church across the street they recently renovated for weddings. Can’t wait to go back. Thank you! Thank you!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Me, my wife, and my two sons wanted to visit the Shiloh Battlefield (well, I did, anyway), and this AirBnB has got to be the best bang-for-the-buck in the area. Lovely and quaint, but with a modern touch, this place was perfect for us. The hosts were responsive about all our questions and gave recommendations for local eats. Would love to visit again!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Jessica’s home was truly stunning. Just the small touches spoke volumes in the home. Everything was comfortable for my guests and I. I’d recommend her home to anyone looking to stay in the area. Jessica is a 5 star host.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We were pleasantly surprised by the openness and large feel of the living area. The decor was beautiful with a lot of attention to little details. The view from the porch was peaceful and relaxing, although we couldn’t spend much time outside because of the humidity. We are from out of the area and we appreciated that the air conditioner was quiet and kept the cottage cool! The kitchen was fully stocked with cookware, dishes, etc. We had a delicious salmon dinner from the local steakhouse restaurant."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,We spent a night here traveling cross country and it was exactly what we were after. The home has been recently updated and sits in a very rural location that gives a great feel for country living in this part of Tennessee. Beautiful and felt very removed from the standard urban/suburban/interstate experience. We would definitely book this again.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,great place to stay!
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Second stay for us with Jessica, and the guest house cottage is super cute! Much bigger than expected and very well-finished."

2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"I can’t express my gratitude for Jessica and this wonderful place…right out of a movie. It was a very last minute booking, I wish much I could stay longer and bring my loved ones. Beautiful old southern house on the outside with classic sultry scenery in every direction. Modern, tasteful, eclectic, impossibly clean and efficient inside. Amazing experience!!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,What a lovely place. Everything was as advertised. The hosts are amazing. And super helpful.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"You want small town southern charm, this is your place. it's quiet, peaceful, and charming. Everything is newer and comfortable. Beds were great! the King bedroom has a porch outback which worked well having dogs. There's no traffic and no noise; great for a good night's sleep. We appreciated this place after a long drive. Glad we booked it. Now we just need to know where you got the couch :)."

2023-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Beautiful house. Beautifully decorated, and the kitchen was fully stocked with nice stuff - not cast-offs like I've come to expect. it was perfect for 3 of us plus a great dane. Love the area, and Jessica was always responsive."

2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We really enjoyed our stay. It was cozy and peaceful. Great location as we were visiting family in Ramer. Kitchen is fully equipped with all appliances. Keurig and coffee pot. Beds are very comfortable!!
2023-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,Very cool spot off the beaten path. It seems to be connected to a wedding venue but far enough removed that the wedding didn't disturb our stay. Very nicely decorated and great use and renovation of an old home. Would recommend it if you're looking for something off the normal routes.
2023-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"Very cute, cozy, and clean!"
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We stayed for two nights had a small issue come up, and Jessica went above and beyond when she didn’t have to. Highly recommend staying there, genuinely a good person! Hard to find that these days!!!"

2022-10-01,5,Stayed one night,Awesome and clean place. Perfect if you rent the heart pine hall venue for a wedding. Me and my groomesmen stayed here while the bride and bridesmaids stayed at heart pine hall.
2022-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"Jessica was a wonderful host, communication was very prompt. We stayed at two of Jessica’s listings. Pine Hall was our favorite, but if you book any of them…. You cannot go wrong. Beautifully decorated, clean, and well equipped. The beds and linens are extremely comfortable. We travel a lot for business and frequent many Airbnb’s, but Pine Hall will definitely be one to never forget. Just book it… you will be blessed."
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Will definitely go back .
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is my second time coming to Heart Pine Hall, and this time we had a bigger group so we also rented the guest cottage! It continues to be the best Airbnb experience. An amazing property, perfect for large groups. The weather was perfect for the porch."

My wife travels on business and looks forward to the next visit very soon! Also, can’t wait to check out some of Jessica’s other properties! Thank you again for a great stay!"
2022-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"Jessica’s home is perfect! It’s easy to find, and looks so pretty and peaceful outside…but inside is breathtaking! We were only there for one night, and I wish we had more time! It was immaculate! Had plenty of towels and washcloths. I had no reason to communicate with Jessica, because everything was great, and clear instructions were left. I will say it may benefit to have a few more spices and things available for guest’s use…but that is truly a personal preference! I hope to stay again!"
2022-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"Another wonderful girls weekend at Jessica's sweet cottage for my sister and me! Not many places are as beautiful and peaceful as this lovely Airbnb property. The cottage is very comfortable, clean and updated, but the owners took great care to preserve the history of the place - like stepping back in time, but with all modern amenities and decorated just beautifully. Corinth is a short drive away and a great place to get lost in on a Sunday afternoon. Jessica is extremely responsive, kind and accommodating. We want to return when the pond out back is finished! 5-stars and you also will sleep like a baby.... Thanks, Jessica!"

Some took a day trip to see Shiloh national park and some of us went to have slug burgers in Corinth! Such a convenient location for us all! We hated for our stay to end!"

It is located just a short drive from the Shiloh Battlefield and has a couple of gas stations and a Dollar General right down the road if you forget something or want snacks. Corinth is close by as well. I had a couple of questions once we got there, and the host picked up right away which is definitely a plus. We will absolutely book again!"

I felt very safe and comfortable throughout my stay, and would absolutely stay here again."

2023-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Our stay at this precious cabin was so special! It was cozy, made excellent use of the space, and had so many small thoughtful details! We stayed just a week before Christmas and the decor was even changed to match the holiday — complete with a small lighted tree! Jimmy and Jill really go out of their way to make you feel comfortable and at home no matter the duration of your stay! This is the kind of place you’d be content to just sit and watch the fire or enjoy coffee on the front porch!"

They offered to bring us food and brought us some home grown tomatoes. She told us anything we needed she would help us. Very nice cabin pictures don't do it Justice they have decorated the cabin so cute and it is so peaceful. I hope to visit again in better circumstances.😊❤️
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was the nicest AirBnB we have ever stayed in. Most places think of the living area as an afterthought (not enough places to sit) but The Oakley House had plenty of comfortable places to sit and read, talk or watch television. We would love to stay here again."

We were able to check in a little early and enjoyed touring the town of Corinth. If you are looking to relax, disconnect, and connect to nature than look no further. So peaceful."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We loved staying here - honestly, the pictures don’t do it justice - it’s even better in person!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The cabin was perfect for our mother-daughter getaway! The cabin was charming, welcoming, super clean! Very peaceful. One caution is for those who like to walk or jog...there are a lot of dogs at homes along the country roads in the area that are off leash and quite aggressive barking and running at you. Just a heads-up if you want to explore and get exercise."

2023-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"We had a lovely stay at the cabin! We loved the antique decor and the tin accents inside. The horses next door came to greet us right away! Only downside was that we planned to grill some steaks but there was no charcoal (the listing said it was provided or we would have stopped on our way). But we were still able to sit by the fire pit and we listened to the owls hooting back and forth, very peaceful and relaxing! Overall, we enjoyed our stay and had a great overnight getaway!"
2023-02-01,5,Stayed one night,We love staying here when we are in town visiting the grands. I love looking at all of the details of cabin. Very clean and comfortable!

2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had an excellent experience staying in The Oakley House!

Thank you Jill, Thank you Jimmy - we plan to return next year!"
2022-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Such a cozy retreat! Our family had a truly relaxing night at the cabin, and hope to be able to return here in the future when traveling to see family. The cabin had just about everything we needed. Thanks for sharing this comfortable space, Jimmy & Jill!"
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I've stayed here before and I'll stay here again. To me, it beats the heck out of staying in more hotel rooms while on business trips. This feels more like vacation."
2022-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This place is perfect! This was our second time to stay here, and this cabin is our choice for a quick weekend getaway. We appreciated the Christmas decor this time…it made the cabin feel even more cozy. Everything is exceptionally clean, and they provide all of the extra you may need (towels, laundry detergent, spices, coffee, shampoo and soap, etc.) My boys love to pet the neighbor horses and to make s’mores at night in the fire pit. We made the quick trip to Shiloh to explore the military park (about a 25 min drive). This is a great place to step away from the business of life, and just relax."
2022-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,"A cozy, clean cabin! Would stay here again!"
2022-11-01,5,Stayed one night,Wonderful place to stay . Very comfortable.

2022-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"The Oakley House is a very special place - particularly in October with the changing leaves. It was comfortable and very well styled, and communication with Jimmy-Jill was easy and quick. They were also not joking about their neighbors' horse and ponies wanting to make friends! They trotted over to the fence the minute we pulled-up. I highly recommend staying here if you're in the area."
2022-10-01,5,Stayed one night,Such a great cabin for a peaceful getaway! Will definitely return.

The cabin was very clean and communication with the hosts was great. Will stay again if we come back down this way.
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Absolutely beautiful cabin. My family and I loved it so much and would absolutely stay again!

2022-06-01,5,Stayed one night,Amazing place! Very clean and very quiet and relaxing of a place to stay!
2022-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,This was the cutest little cabin. It was clean and coat. The attention to detail made our stay perfect. We typed the wrong address into Mapquest (completely our fault) and messaged the owners a little frantic. They called us immediately and helped us figure out the issue. This was one of my favorite rentals to date.
2022-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Beautiful, thoughtfully furnished property. Would highly recommend for those traveling to or through Corinth. It looks like the same owners had a rental made of a silo next door which looked like a beautiful property from the outside. The neighbors to the right were very sweet horses that came running up to the fence to greet us. Lovely property."
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Loved it! Would love to own this place. It’s a lot nicer than I expected, so it exceeded my expectations. I loved all the amenities, decour, location, quiet, outdoors, etc. It was perfect!"

We especially enjoyed sitting on the porch in the evening listening to the frogs and watching the fireflies, which we haven't seen for a long time. Be sure to bring some mosquito spray if you come in the Summer. There is everything you need in the cabin and the beds are super comfy with nice linens. It's located within an easy drive of Shiloh Park, if you are visiting there."
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This place is everything listed and more. cozy and peaceful bliss. Just what we needed.

2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"If you are looking for a quaint, quiet and peaceful getaway this is the Airbnb you're looking for. It offers a serene atmosphere that is reminiscent of the Civil War era. It is the perfect location between. Pickwick State Park, Corinth and Michie. The downstairs bedroom and upstairs loft is perfect for a couple or a small family. If you want to come and enjoy the country, the Oakley House is the place for you."

2022-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"Very cute house!! It was amazing as a romantic date night getaway for me & my fiancé. I loved the decor, the fireplace in the living room was perfect & the location was amazing. My favorite part of it was relaxing on the front porch in the morning with my coffee!! I would not recommend it for more than 2 adults & possibly a younger child however because it is smaller & more adults would likely feel cramped especially with the vaulted ceilings upstairs!! But…IT WAS PERFECT FOR US!!"
2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This cabin is adorable! It was the perfect place for us to stay while we visited the area.
2022-02-01,5,Stayed one night,Such a cozy little cabin. It was perfect for a romantic weekend getaway. It's very quiet and secluded and had wonderful amenities.

2022-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Jimmy and Jill's properties are top notch in every way. They set the standard and it is very hard for any host to come close to the quality and service they offer. I decided to try the cabin this trip and I was not disappointed in any way. Super fast internet, nice DirecTV package and a warm gas fireplace (not to mention the mini-split system). It was very cold this trip and I stayed very warm and toasty. The property was stocked with plenty of towels and sundries. I always appreciate the personal touches. I cannot wait to stay again!"

2021-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Everything about our stay was perfect. The Christmas decorations added just the right spark. The location was fantastic. The neighborhood was quiet and serene. Only a few minutes into town for dining out and antique/flea market shopping. We will definitely be back!!

2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I highly reccomend a stay at the oakley cabin. It is peaceful and the accomodations are top notch. A little tight quarters in the master but not a game changer at all. Sitting on the front porch was so wonderful. I didn't want to leave. The town is nice and has anything you want or need and a lovely drive to get thete but not long.
We cooked a couple of meals and there was everything you would need. If you want a nice peaceful get away this is your place. Hope to go back and stay in the silo next time."

2020-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"These pictures are amazing, but they don't do it justice! It is even more cute, cozy and peaceful in person. I surprised my mom with a trip here for Mother's Day... she loves log cabins and loves being in nature. It was the exact peaceful weekend we were looking for. It's only a 45 minute drive from Tishomingo State Park, which was perfect for a fun hike out in nature! Jimmy + Jill have an awesome binder filled with menus and recommendations for local restaurants in town - we found this to be incredibly helpful! We're already looking at dates to come back in the summer and fall. This will be our new 'getaway' place in Mississippi. Absolutely perfect!!"

2019-11-01,5,Stayed one night,Beautiful cabin!
2019-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Spectacular place. Main floor bedroom is very cozy for two people. We were both clostiphobic so my husband ended up upstairs. We stayed at the quiet place last time and totally enjoyed our stay. We will be returning.

2019-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Wonderful weekend getaway
2019-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The Oakley House in Phenomenal!! The pictures are gorgeous, but this place is so much more amazing than what can be shown in pictures! There are thoughtful touches all through out the house, it is incredibly clean, very private and secure and beautiful both outside and in. You can really tell there was so much time, effort and care put into creating this amazing, quality home. It was such a relaxing stay for us, close enough to town to go to dinner, shopping, etc. but private enough to really feel like you really got away from it all to relax and rest. We can't wait to come back again!!"
2019-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We are local to the area (about an hour away) This is a wonderful place to escape the kids for a quiet setting. Close to everything you need. You are 15 - 20, even 30 minutes away from some very cozy home cooking style restaurants! Corinth is rich in history and if you are like us, and don't mind being an hour away from everywhere... then you have many many more options for a great travel experience using this location as a great hub.
We also have experience staying in a very old log cabin that has been modernized. This cabin, is hand down the best. Our experience was excellent! Great cell coverage and even during weather related issues with the wifi, my swap over to hotspot data was flawless. We used the internet for some light work and travel planning and location gathering info. We have stayed in the ""sticks"" with no coverage and it just makes life hard to plan a nice vacation on the fly. This place, no issues there!
Enjoy!"
2019-05-01,5,Stayed one night,Just say YES. Far exceeds any and all expectations. I could easily live here.
2019-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Exceptionally clean and quiet!!!! Amazing retreat getaway!!!!

2019-01-01,5,Stayed about a week,Great hosts! Always a pleasure!
2018-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The Oakley House proved to be the perfect quiet retreat after spending time in the area visiting Shiloh National Battlefield and Corinth area Civil War history. The porch was a relaxing place to hang out, play checkers and ring toss, or just rock in the rockers. One fall night we enjoyed a fire in the fire pit - even the firewood was provided! The grill and sparkling clean modern kitchen made it easy to choose to enjoy dinner at ""home"".
But the best part about this rustic yet modern log cabin was the detail that Jimmy-Jill thoughtfully provided. No skimping on anything. Bath towels were thick, soft and thirsty; soft warm throws were there to cuddle up in the oversize comfy chairs and watch the inside gas fireplace or satellite television on the flat screen TV. The wifi worked flawlessly.
Checking in couldn't have been simpler. The rural location is conveniently only a few miles from Corinth and other local attractions.
Rent the Oakley House, you'll be glad you chose it for your getaway! THANK YOU Jimmy and Jill."

2018-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"I can’t say enough good things about our stay at Jill and Jimmy’s cabin! My husband and I found it by chance while looking for a “staycation” on Airbnb as it is about an hour from our home. We loved it so much we extended our stay by a night and brought our children out to enjoy it as well! A little slice of heaven right in Corinth, MS. We hope to be return guests again and again."
2018-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful retreat to get away from everything. All necessary amenities and more... The hosts are very responsive and try for you to have your very best experience. 100% recommend.

They thought of everything from the the perfect farmhouse decor to Jill's Civil War book that she left perfectly placed for me to see😉 Seeing a Civil War battlefield has been a lifelong dream for me and their beautiful cabin was the perfect place to come home to after getting to finally realize that dream. Thank you so much, we hope to come back soon!"

2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My parents, sister, & I spent the weekend at King's Cottage while in Corinth for my daughter's wedding reception. Christy quickly sent the itinerary which included the code & easy to follow house rules. She even had the outside light on for me since she knew it would be a late arrival. The cottage is tidy & in a peaceful area. Most restaurants and shops are within 4 miles. This made it convenient for my elderly parents to have a nice and near place to stay both before and after the reception. My parents had never stayed in an Airbnb. They repeatedly commented how they liked the cottage so much more than a hotel. We did not have the time in our schedule to use the board games or books. With a longer stay, they would have been a welcome form of entertainment. I have recommended it to a couple with a Corinth December wedding to use for their out of town family members. I recommend it & am already looking forward to staying there again. It was a relaxing, temporary home away from home."
2024-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,This was our 2nd stay. It is such a beautiful cottage.

The first thing I noticed was the adorable decor. Every corner of the Airbnb was thoughtfully adorned with charming pieces that added personality and warmth to the space. From vibrant throw pillows to unique wall art, it was clear that the host had put a lot of thought and effort into creating a cozy and inviting atmosphere.
Not only was the Airbnb beautifully decorated, but it was also very spacious. The furniture was arranged in a way that made the most of the available space, and there was plenty of room to relax and unwind after a long day of visiting family.
Our host was very kind and responsive to our request."
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Two things I look forward to in an Airbnb: Clean space and comfortable beds and bedding, the cottage hit this marks and more. Beautifully decorated, in a charming neighborhood, and walkable to downtown Corinth ;the cottage was well worth our stay and we plan to come back in the spring when we can explore more. We were caught in the snow and ice event and couldn’t get home. We had a cozy place to wait out the weather!"

2023-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This was by far the most exquisite AirBnB we’ve stayed at, in terms of decor, attention to detail, and hospitality. The cottage was beautifully decorated and it was a lovely retreat while my husband and kids did Civil War sightseeing to their heart’s content at Shiloh and Corinth. It was lovely to read in the living room and drink coffee on the porch. In the evenings, our family has dinner together in the kitchen (we live in the midwest so barbecue take-out was a treat) and hung out together in the cozy living room. The sleeping arrangements were great for our family of 5.
Mary Kate was very responsive to our questions. There were also thoughtful touches in the house—my kids loved the snacks.
The location was very convenient for walking downtown (a must for me because my husband and kids mostly took the car). I was happy to get some early Christmas shopping done (including at her lovely shop) and enjoyed excellent food."

2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We road-tripped from Nashville to Memphis to Corinth and back to Nashville. Corinth and this cottage gave us a perfect and comfortable home base for touring Civil War history sites including Shiloh. Also great for a day trip to the music studios at Muscle Shoals, Alabama and the Helen Keller house. We needed to fit in some work time too and the cottage has plenty of room to work with solid WiFi. The cottage has a dreamy front porch—we loved sitting outside in such a sweet neighborhood. Super easy and enjoyable to walk to town. Our trip to Corinth could not have been better."

2023-07-01,4,Stayed with kids,"We had a wonderful time at Mary Katherine’s cottage! The house is beautifully and uniquely furnished, and everything—from the beds to the furniture to the porch swing—is so comfortable. The house is walkable to everything in Downtown Corinth, sad Mary Katherine graciously allowed us a late checkout. The house was a bit warm at times even with the AC on—but it being a Mississippi July, who’s surprised? We would definitely return to this lovely spot!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This was our second stay at Mary Katherine’s cottage and we had such a wonderful time. This cottage is just beautiful… It is extremely clean, and feels so homey.

2023-05-01,5,Group trip,"This cottage was perfect for my 4 granddaughters and me. We were in town for my granddaughters graduation so we came in early to visit with family. We enjoyed sitting on the front porch swing and drinking coffee in the morning. Guests were able to hang out with us on the porch. (there is a sweet courtyard with lights and a grill, but it rained so we did not get to enjoy it).
There is an ample supply of linens, towels and coffee. Washer/Dryer in large laundry area.
I do want to say that this is an older building with a lot of character. Don’t expect perfect, but do expect cozy comfort and sweet peace. You can curl up with one of the many throws and enjoy one of the books that are scattered throughout the rooms.
There are many things to do in the area and quite a few good eating places."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,Mary Katherine’s place is the best decorated air b&b that I have ever seen. It was clean and perfect!

The front porch swing in the morning was so peaceful and I enjoyed watching the sweet lady across the street work in her yard and she was so friendly. I also shopped in town and meet the other neighbor. He owned the house next door but lived across the street. Such a friendly neighborhood. We felt very safe. You are close to everything in town and you will definitely feel at home. We loved our stay. I would definitely recommend this beautiful cottage and we definitely would stay again.

2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Corinth is one of my favorite places to visit - some might say it is because I still consider it home since I was raised there over 35 years ago. The usual trip ""home"" consist of me staying with family but this time my husband and I decided to try out The Cottage to see if maybe we would have a different experience. It was something out of a story book, magical. We started our morning off inviting the family over for breakfast (the kitchen is stocked with all the necessaries), then took a walk downtown admiring all the historical houses, the library, the church we were married in, and then found ourselves at the fire station on the big red trucks. The Cottage is located within walking to Borrum's Drug Store, the home of the worlds best slug burger. I cannot wait to go back and stay again. Next time, I will spend at least one day just swinging on the front porch swing."

The view is to die for and the house was just as described. Brett was super easy to work with and very responsive. Wasn’t able to find a few things like a scrubby for dishes or oven mits, and the wifi wasn’t working well during our stay but that was no biggie as we just wanted to unplug. All in all highly recommend and great deal of a stay! We definitely will keep it on our list to come back for whenever we need a rest!"

2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Top 3 Airbnb experience for me. I was reluctant to leave, which has only happened a few times. After David explained the history of the house it made sense why love is the prevailing vibe here. The kitchen had a generous supply of snacks and drinks. The recliner was very comfortable and my favorite spot. The back yard was serene and full of birds, making the screen porch my second favorite spot. Great location from which to explore Corinth and the Shiloh battlefield (20 minutes away). David and Kim provided many brochures for local attractions geared toward my interests, and also numerous restaurant recommendations. I enjoyed Pizza Grocery in Corinth and Hagy’s Catfish Hotel on the Tennessee River near Shiloh. For a unique dish local to this region, try the Slugburger at Borroum’s Drug Store in Corinth."

We will definitely reserve this house again when we make our next trek to Mississippi.

The master bedroom had a jacuzzi and a shower as big as a walk in closet. Beds were comfortable. I want to come back to this spot to stay in this house!! Our host was very responsive to any question."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Jessica's place is so beautiful! My husband and I booked at the last minute to celebrate our 25th anniversary. Jessica was gracious, sent us anniversary wishes, and had the house ready for us!
This home is amazing, though. It's an older home, and has a great blend of old and new. The bed was comfy. The decor was excellent. The sound system sounded phenomenal. My son used to run sound for bands. He's very particular about audio stuff. He was very impressed with the sound system.
I felt like I was stepping back in time to a simple way of living. We truly enjoyed ourselves and had a relaxing time. There is so much to do in Corith, which is about 15 minutes from the house. We enjoyed learning history in person!
I could go on and on, but I won't, but hopefully from this review, you'll know this is a great place to book!"
2023-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,"What a beautiful property! My family and I felt right at home! We love to cook meals together as a family and the kitchen provided us with everything that we needed!

There was plenty of room inside and out for the children to have fun, and we enjoyed the spacious kitchen .Since we were doing our own cooking we could have used more kitchen towels, dish cloths, and dish soap. Luckily, Dollar General was only 5 miles away so it easy to get what we needed. We definitely would recommend this place and will stay there again if we are in the area and need an Airbnb!"

2021-09-01,5,Group trip,"What a fantastic Cousin Reunion we had. The home is absolutely beautiful with its attention to detail and smart decor from the old oriental rugs to the fine linens on the beds and the antique furniture. Part of us are from Florida so we brought plastic pink flamingos to put in the back yard where we played ring toss. Outside we investigated the barn and took pictures of the hydrangeas planted around the house. Inside we laughed and enjoyed the warmth of the home as we reminisced about our younger days. When we decided to take a field trip into the big city (Corinth), we locked ourselves out of the home when we returned to Heart Pine Hall. Jessica came to our rescue!!!! Thank you to hour hostess! We would not hesitate to recommended Heart Pine Hall for your next reunion…"

2021-08-01,5,Group trip,"This place was perfect for my big family. Plenty of space for the kids fo run around - the kiddos loved exploring the outside area and we all really enjoyed swinging on the bench swing outside. The beds were a bit squeaky, the walls are thin, and the living room TV is a bit too small for the space but besides that, we enjoyed our stay!
Also- a highlight that we all loved was how easy it was to find. We checked in pretty late but the place was so easy to find because the home has a beautiful outdoor lighting system! It was an amazing sight."
2021-08-01,5,Group trip,"Our family's weekend stay at Heart Pine Hall was absolutely wonderful. The house has been beautifully renovated and appointed with a fabulous mix of modern amenities and lovely antiques. Our destinations, Shiloh and Hagy's Catfish, were just minutes' drive away.

It’s in the country yet close to grocery stores, restaurants, shopping. The wrap around porch has lots of seating and idyllic views all around it. So relaxing.

2021-07-01,5,Group trip,"Heart Pine Hall was a beautiful destination that allowed my family to relax and enjoy our much needed time off. The firm mattresses were perfect for our liking and having 3 1/2 bathrooms was so nice. It's located on a very peaceful property with a wonderful porch complete with double porch swings and ceiling fan above which really helps in the heat. There are pretty lights in the yard and on the wall for nighttime. It's located only 15 minutes from Corinth, MS where there are adequate grocery stores, shops and restaurants. Shiloh National Battlefield is about 25 minutes away for those who are Civil War history buffs. There are several State Parks nearby for hiking and other activities. If we ever find ourselves in the area again, we would definitely go back!"

2021-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Heart Pine Hall is a gorgeous home you will love to stay in. Traveling with toddlers we were happy to find a closet with toys in it, and even though we brought our own Pack ‘n Play, we used the one that was already there and set up as it was so convenient! We met up with family we hadn’t seen in years and everyone had a great time enjoying the beautiful porch. It was a very relaxing stay and we would love to come back some day."

2021-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,"I really appreciated Jessica's quick response, due to that another host had cancelled my reservation, a few days, before my arrival (7-May thru 9-May-2021).

The house is beautiful with so much history, we loved wandering around the property, and the porches have so many sitting and eating areas that we enjoyed chatting on.

2021-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"Heart Pine Hall is stunning! It was just as advertised; clean, roomy, comfortable, inviting, and relaxing. We spent the majority of our time in the spacious kitchen around the island eating, drinking and playing games. The firepit, huge porch and rocking chairs make it hard to leave.

I hope we are able to return soon."

There is Dollar General 5 min away, but you won’t not find meats or vegetables there. I would stay there again. If you need wi-if, make sure you ask if it’s functional.

While the property was wonderful to stay at - spacious, clean, cozy and stocked with anything/everything needed for our stay I’d like to highlight the host Vera. Her generosity, communication and thoughtfulness far surpasses any other host I have encountered. She took time to bake fresh muffins/cookies, ensured there were dog supplies for our 2 four- legged family members, spent time speaking with us on the phone after our ETA changed and left a newspaper article related to a special family event. Thank you Vera for making our stay great!"
2024-03-01,5,Group trip,"What a perfect stay this was for our family gathering for our father’s funeral service.
