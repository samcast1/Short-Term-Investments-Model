2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We did have a minor issue with the keypad when trying to get in when we arrived, but we finally was able to get in contact with one of the owners and she was able to reset the code for us. We were provided with a binder that had lots of information in it, which was very helpful.
The home is very homey and makes you feel right at home. The home was extremely clean and there was a lot of supplies in the home. I would definitely stay here again if I came to this area.
I would also suggest maybe putting televisions in the other bedrooms just a suggestion Just in case other guest kids or just want to be alone in the room to watch TV or movies."

The pool was private and very clean There were numerous places to sit and enjoy the pool. Dollar General, Walmart and Walgreens are close by.
The neighborhood was quiet and only a 5 minute drive from the house was a happening waterfront area with many restaurants overlooking the river. There was not beach access but there are beautiful, private beaches about a 15 minute drive away.
Andrea and her husband, Jack were very responsive. Jack came within 20 minutes to remove a hornets nest that had just been newly built and came to tend to the pool mid week and made sure to text us beforehand. Andrea provided many suggestions for local restaurants and beaches. Thank you"

2023-04-01,5,Group trip,"I stayed at Andrea's place with my partner and 2 other couples for a quick weekend getaway ‚Äì this is one of the nicest Airbnbs that we have stayed in to date.

The setup of everything is amazing, the house was beautiful and I have nothing but positive feedback!"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Really enjoyed our stay at Andrea's. Beautifully decorated home with everything one could ask for in the kitchen!

Everyone loved the heated salt water pool - with the temperatures so warm this year we were either in the pool or at the beach. Having access to the shed with beach chairs, shovels and buckets was another nice touch. Looking forward to our stay at this beautiful home again next year!"

2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Absolutely the best place we have ever stayed in years! Its residential, so its quiet and private, which is what we like. Hard to list everything, but the split layout provided privacy, every inch was squeaky clean and updated, including pool/pool area .. sooo relaxing. There was even a tv outside. So we watched a movie out there. Its not ""walkable"" but close to shopping, restaurants and the waterfront is a short just drive away. We literally did not want to leave!! 10 stars!"

Bedrooms were good size and master bathroom shower was beautiful with a nice waterfall showerhead and river-rock floor. Located in quiet neighborhood, close to everything.
We were lucky to catch a rocket launch by the river; be sure to check the launch schedule while you are here. Visited the Environmental Learning Center, Wabasso Beach, Golden Sands Beach, and Jetty Park at Fort Pierce to see manatees (had delicious crepes at Old Florida Coffee Company; also don‚Äôt miss stopping by Beach Bowls for amazingly fresh smoothies and great customer service).

2022-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This has been my personal favorite rental for our family of 5 (5 yr old, 3 yr old, & 7 month old)! The house is well stocked with basics and beyond. I'm a clean freak and I'm usually uncomfortable even in the nicest hotels but this house was high on my standards of clean. We were all very comfortable and the family trip was that much better because of having what we needed already there. My brothers live in the area and they were impressed with how well the house was stocked and said it's a nice, quiet neighborhood, which you notice right away. I'm familiar with the area as well since I've always come to visit them but now we have this option to stay in our own house since we've added to our family. Stores are close by, we went kayaking just minutes away, we visited Skydive Sebastian to watch skydivers landing with the kids... other than that the kids enjoyed the pool just about everyday. The beds are very comfortable. I really can't say enough positive things! We just hope it's available for us next year! Thank you Andrea üòä"

CAN‚ÄôT WAIT TO VISIT AGAIN!!"
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Everything was clean and as described. It is a beautiful house and a quiet neighborhood which we loved.
2021-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We really enjoyed our stay at this property with the pool area, open floor plan and accommodations. This is a very well kept home, and it fit our family of five perfectly. Andrea and her husband could not have been more kind and welcoming with many thoughtful touches which we appreciated after a long delayed trip. The master bath is spa like. It is a well appointed home in a great location. I can‚Äôt say enough about the patio /pool area, the comfortable set up and large kitchen."
2021-10-01,2,Stayed a few nights,"My family and I booked this property because it had stellar reviews. The house is absolutely beautiful to the naked eye, however the house had roaches. When we first arrived before we brought our belongings in, my aunt and I decided to spray and wipe down the house (just COVID preventative measures) and while we were doing this, we found a dead roach in the refrigerator. Shortly after that, a baby roach was crawling on the kitchen island. I sent a message to Andrea about this and she was quick to respond and apologized for this encounter.
She called me the next morning and I told her what happened. She replied saying it was most likely a water bug and that they never had an issues with roaches before. I assured her that it was a roach and she asked if I see another one, if I can catch it and hold onto it for when the Orkin rep come to the house. I thought this request was very unusual and inappropriate for her to ask me as her guest so I told her I will not catch the roach but try to take a picture.
The next day the Orkin rep came and treated/sprayed the property. Andrea‚Äôs husband also came to the house. My aunt expressed to Andrea‚Äôs husband that she was concerned about the possibility of bringing roaches back home. The day of our departure, as we were packing up, my aunt found a roach in her cooler. The same thing we feared, presented itself. I immediately sent another message to Andrea regarding this. Although quick to respond, her response seemed a bit dismissive: Andrea apologized once again and told me to read her stellar reviews because this has never been an issue. I completely understand that may not have been an issue in the past but many people are in and out of the property since it‚Äôs an AirBnB and being dismissive did not help the situation. Again, the house is beautiful to the naked eye and Andrea is quick to respond to inquiries, however I think it‚Äôs important for other people to know our experience. Please also note, we found roaches also in some of the kitchen drawers, near the garbage, and near the entrance."
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Andrea's place was great. Super convenient location and quiet neighborhood.

2021-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"My family and I were extremely surprised at all of the extra touches she had in her home. We were greeted with a bottle of wine and an abundance of towels. Our favorite part being from Colorado was how big the fans were in the home and the ability to control the temp ourselves because we are not use to the Florida heat. I also loved all the other little extras that were in the house such as (knives, pots, baking and grilling utensils etc...) The kitchen is a great size and the master bathroom is lovely and clean with lots of extras as well."

2022-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This home was so beautiful inside and out. The bedrooms were very large. The living area was smaller but seemed fine as you had the benefit of a big table where other guests could sit. I was very impressed with the quality of all the items stocked in the house especially in the kitchen. They also had extra things that are not common in Airbnb‚Äôs shampoo, soap, detergent , trash bags, spices as well as cleaning supplies to tidy up on your stay. It was refreshing to see a place so clean and well taken care of. The dock was so pretty and peaceful. The location was nice and you could walk to many places.

If we are ever back in town we‚Äôd be so glad to book with Cary!"

I've stayed in a lot of BnB's and this one really stands out. First, the location is impeccable - very close to many waterfront restaurants and local attractions plus it has a direct view of the river. There is an easily accessible private dock to enjoy the water and watch the sunrise. I was very impressed with the quality of the linens and bed comfort. The house is stocked with all of the essentials for cooking, a dishwasher, AC that kept the house comfortably cool, full washer/dryer, fast Wi-Fi, and GREAT TV's with a wide selection of channels. I was on a family vacation and we felt like we were at home. Cary was incredibly helpful and attentive. I cannot recommend this property enough. I will absolutely be coming back!"

Inside, it is a very welcoming and clean space. Everything one might need. It's the little things for me ~ there were rugs in all the right places. I recommend Alpha's spot for a place that is a short drive away from the ocean and many secluded beaches. If you are not driving to her location, definitely rent a vehicle to get around."

Made you feel like you‚Äôre at the ocean with the fish and other items . Not all people like a tv but we do and having Roku for guest was great.we will stay here again . Location was perfect for us.

Everything is easy to access because of the location. Alpha was an amazing host. Only problems/concerns is with the cleaning. When it was time for us to crawl into bed we somehow thought of checking the bed for cleanliness and it was full of pet hair and human hair as if someone prior had stayed and the sheets weren‚Äôt changed/cleaned.

2023-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Mia‚Äôs house was exactly what we needed. A wonderful quiet neighborhood get away. The space was clean, bright and our family of four had plenty enough space to spread out comfortably. The kitchen was clean and had all of the necessities. The beds were comfortable and bathrooms clean and had plenty of space. I would highly recommend this house to anyone."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great house. Very spacious. Clean. Close to everything we needed. Quiet. Loved parking in the garage out of the sun.
2023-03-01,5,Stayed over a week,We loved our stay! The driveway accommodated 2 bass boats and trucks. The house was very clean and up to date. We have already booked our next stay!
2023-01-01,5,Group trip,"We had a lovely time and the home was clean and comfortable and we felt right at home from when we walked in. The open floor plan was so nice for our family to be together and enjoy one another‚Äôs company. The neighborhood was quaint and we had fun taking walks together in the Florida warmer weather. The kitchen was big and we cooked many family meals and played games in the dining room area. The laundry room was just off the hallway and there were plenty of towels and wash clothes provided. Upon our arrival were some bottles of water and snacks which was so appreciated and enjoyed by us all. Thank you :).
The Winn Dixie was about a 5 minute drive up the road and we loved Giuseppe‚Äôs Pizzeria & Italian restaurant about 10 minutes away. The Sebastian Pickleball Complex was about a 13 minute drive and we had fun getting our exercise with trips to the courts.
Nicole/Mia were very responsive and great to work with. We will definitely be back to stay in the future. 5 star experience"
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very beautiful place. Newly remodeled. comfortable beds. Great area. Very clean. My only complaint was that the curtains in the living room covering the large sliding glass doors were very sheer and see-through. Neighbors and people on the street have a clear view of the living area and the kitchen at night.
2022-12-01,5,Stayed over a week,Great stay and a great location!
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great house in quiet neighborhood. Everything needed for an easy stay. Great location if visiting Sebastian, and great for what we needed - overflow housing for big family gathering. Would definitely stay again when visiting."
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This property was awesome! We'd stay here again without question. We stayed here while our family was having local home renovations. We needed to use the space like an our home to keep our family routine flowing seamlessly. It was just like the photos and it really felt like home. It was also really peaceful as there was only 1 TV in the house which subtly encouraged family gathering in the living and dining room and uninterrupted sleep in the bedrooms with our distraction. It was clean, the neighborhood was quiet, and we were minutes from 95, groceries shopping, and a short drive from Vero and the beaches. It was decorated minimally and had no carpet and a no pet policy which worked perfectly because our little has severe dust allergies, hence why we left our home during renovation. The hostess was very responsive and flexible during our one hiccup on the stay and it was resolved quickly and painlessly. The neighborhood was quiet and the neighbors were friendly. 5 stars!"
2022-11-01,5,Stayed over a week,"Perfect place to stay, and perfect hosts. Highly recommended."

2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The only reason I gave 5 stars is that I couldn't give 6, or 7, or 10! Walters place is immaculate. Very clean. Attention to every detail. Very quick response time. We've stayed in dozens and dozens of Airb-n-b's and this was our best experience yet. Highly recommend!!!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Thanks for the lovely stay. Walter and his property manager Stephanie are stellar hosts. All the little details were seen to which make a place feel welcoming: art on the walls, comfortable furniture with pillows and throws when needed, ample space for clothes, thoughtful availability of things like condiments, drinks and snacks. There were also beach chairs, beach towels, and water-sport items available in the garage. And has been mentioned in just about every review, the standard of cleanliness was evident everywhere. This is a five-star accommodation for sure!"

The lawn and landscaping are very well kept. The screened in front porch is great. There is plenty of space and the bedrooms being at opposite ends of the home helps with privacy. The neighborhood is quiet and peaceful. The amenities says no clothes dryer and just a washer. But that wasn‚Äôt accurate and it had both. Was a nice surprise to be able to do laundry.
The host was very responsive, friendly and accommodating. If I come back to Sebastian this is where I will stay again for sure.
ü™Çü™Çü™Ç"

The property manager responded that there was nothing to be done as Walter‚Äôs priority is that guests have a relaxing time!!

There was even a good variety of k-cups for the keurig!
Communication was excellent. Both before and during our stay all questions were answered quickly. Todd and Julie were proactive and knew there was a problem with the AC before we realized it, contacted the property manager, and had it fixed within a few hours. They also alerted us to a launch at the Space Center one night and suggested that we could watch it from the front yard. We can't say enough about this relaxing, comfortable home and its hosts. We hope to be able to stay here again!"

2023-10-01,5,Stayed about a week,"We truly felt at home yet felt like on vacation too! Loved how quick and easy it was to get to many restaurants on the water and many beautiful beaches. We would make breakfast and enjoy it on the enclosed back porch , then make some sandwiches and pack a picnic so we could spend the day exploring the jungle trail and wildlife preserve or enjoy the free beaches. The time we were at Sebastian inlet park (this is a state park so this one has a small fee) we saw many different kinds of birds, dolphins swimming and many friendly fisherman. We would come home and then get ready to go out for dinner at one of the many waterfront dining options - although one evening we enjoyed Smile Thai which is not on the water. We had never been to Sebastian before and now we can‚Äôt wait to come back sometime!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed over a week,Just the best place to stay in Sebastian. My Dad passed away and I was able to extend my stay and get a lot of things done over several weeks. Always my first choice to stay there. My wife and I love it. Hands down the nicest Airbnb I‚Äôve ever stayed at.
2024-06-01,5,Group trip,"What an awesome place and hostess. This place has everything you need.

2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Elysia was a wonderful host!! I‚Äôve stayed at a lot of ABNB‚Äôs and this was by far the best!! Elysia texted me days prior to check in with information. The neighborhood was quiet and well kept. The house was immaculate and decorated nicely. The backyard was so cozy with accent lighting and seating. A huge bonus was Elysia actually had cable TV for her guests and not just Roku therefore you were able to watch local stations and programming. I would 100% stay here again and highly recommend her home!!
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Always an amazing relaxing beautiful stay. I wish I could pick up the home and the host and take it with me wherever I travel to.

2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Elysia was a wonderful host. I rented the place during Oktoberfest as I was a vendor, and I ended up needing to extend my stay because I was too tired to drive home after. She was super quick to respond and made it extremely easy to extend. She was very responsive when I first reached out with questions as well, and always very friendly, kind, and helpful. The place was prestine and felt like a home away from home. I've stayed at many places while traveling and this was a favorite. The backyard was very peaceful and well kept. The showers have AMAZING pressure (for us girls with long hair is very appreciated lol) and the towels are extra fluffy! They definitely put in the time to think about their guests. I will definitely be staying again next time I am in the area!"

2023-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This place was very nice and served our purposes well. We didn't even get to all of the things (outdoor fire pit, etc..) that it offered. We would definitely consider staying again on our next visit to Sebastian.
Please read the description carefully so you know what you are getting and not getting. I booked this so my wife didn't know what was provided and she thought there would be coffee provided. No biggie, just make sure you are aware so you can pick a few things up from the store."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"As always, Elysia‚Äôs home was exquisite. It is a privilege for me to support her business. This will always be my first choice if I‚Äôm staying in the area.

2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"Good location, Nice clean home"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed about a week,"This place is the Taj Mahal. Everything is inside is quality. The beds are extremely comfortable, the TVs were not skimped out on, the kitchen is pristine and loaded, and the bathrooms are spotless. Even the ceiling fans were above and beyond. Not to mention wireless charging stations all through the house. Such a convenient and luxurious place to stay. VERY short drive from a very nice beach. Really the only downside I have is not being able to stay longer. This is how Airbnb should be done. Tremendous value."

2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We definitely enjoyed our stay at Elysia's Airbnb!
It was very clean, modern and so cute. The interior was very nicely designed and packed with quality furniture and appliances! Only little thing we ran into was the master bedroom shower size üòÑ Very nice shower, but limited room. If you plan on staying alone it's perfect and all you need. The guest bathroom shower was plenty big.
Elysia was very helpful and responsive, and acted fast when we needed anything.
If we ever plan on staying in the Sebastian area again we will definitely come back!
Great stay! Thank you! üòä"

Large TV's with streaming aps in the 2 bedrooms and living room. Multiple charging units throughout. A kitchen & bathroom full of high end conveniences from the sharp knives to the plush towels and rain shower head. Plenty of sleeping/seating conveniences. The decor was on point and carried throughout the home very nicely. It was immaculate! I tend to be very picky (to a fault)...and I was so impressed and pleased with this home, I am considering coming back...something else I never do...go to the same place twice! Elysia...OUTSTANDING job!"

The backyard was so peaceful and serene. The screened in porch made for the perfect place to read and enjoy coffee.
Plenty of outlets, chargers, and charging ports were throughout the home."

The towels were so soft! Bathrooms were exceptional. The back yard is so cute and comfy. The neighborhood was beautiful and up the road is a neighborhood pond where you can feed ducks. Neighbors were very friendly! I don‚Äôt have a single complaint. Elysia is wonderful and always responded very fast! You can tell she put a lot of time into all of the details of the home. Will be returning to this Airbnb for my next trip out to FL.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed about a week,"If you‚Äôre looking for a place IN Sebastian, this is it. Everything was tip top. Nichole is thoughtful about her guests and had supplied all that you‚Äôd need including 2 excellent funky bikes for cruising the side streets of Sebastian. We went to Sebastian mostly to hang out at Earl‚Äôs Hideaway, listen to music and to go to the beach. This Bungalow checked all of our boxes. Don‚Äôt miss out on seeing the Mel Fisher‚Äôs Museum to learn everything about the Atocha! Fascinating! Anyway, I hope this review was helpful. Happy Trails!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We really enjoyed Nichole‚Äôs place. It was clean, well supplied and super convenient. We will be happy to stay there again when we are in the area. It is the perfect place for a couple, just the right size."

2024-01-01,5,Stayed about a week,Nicole‚Äôs place was perfect for us. We love the location because it was easy to walk to restaurants and bars with live music or just stroll along the river front. The kitchen and bathroom supplies were plentiful for our stay. Nicole was helpful and quick to respond to questions.

Nichole has been amazing both times and always so friendly and helpful! She is more than willing to answer any questions or offer up suggestions.
We love being within walking distance to the great restaurants and live entertainment. Sun rises are beautiful over the river and walks along the river are really peaceful. Sometimes you can see stingrays, fish or dolphins from the public docks. People are friendly and the town is quaint. The short drive to the ocean, inlet and all of the beaches gives lots of options for treasure hunting, sun bathing and wave riding. There are also lots of places to fish from shore or pier.
This will be our ‚Äògo to‚Äô any time we want to stay in this area."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed about a week,Nicole was a wonderful host. everything that was posted was there and more. I walked in and was amazed as I felt right at home.

Just a wonderful place to stay right across from the Indian river."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed about a week,Great place to stay in the heart of Sebastian!
2023-04-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Great place with Indian River across the street. Several restaurants and bars to walk to. The biggest draw back was little noisy. If you have noise sensitivity this may not be the place. Place is stocked well and spacious. Really enjoyed the area.
2023-03-01,5,Stayed over a week,Hope to be back next year. Nicole is the best.
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Location, location, location! What a wonderful spot right across from the water. The cottage is much bigger than the pictures show and squeaky clean. Just a great place stay and to enjoy the water and you can walk to several restaurants which is a plus. I would highly recommend!"
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Good location. Everything is there that one could want.
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Nichole‚Äôs place was awesome! It was exactly as pictured with more. She left beach towels, chairs and an umbrella. We got to enjoy a great day at Melbourne Beach and got super drinks at Sands on the Beach. There were many kitchen amenities as well as laundry pods. This was a huge help as we are on a three week stay away from home. The bungalow is located in the best spot! In the morning I woke up and saw a beautiful sunrise right outside our door and then ran along the River. The restaurants and bars are all walking distance w a great tiki bar atmosphere. We listened to live bands and enjoyed the local spots. We ate breakfast everyday at Earls, two doors down. Certainly not fancy but an awesome bacon, egg and cheese sandwich. We ate in Captain Hiram‚Äôs and Squid Lips, both walking distance.
We loved Nichole‚Äôs place and wld certainly recommend it. If returning to the area, I‚Äôd stay there again!"
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I will be back!
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,When my flight home was cancelled and I reached out to Nichole to see if I could extend my stay she responded immediately. Thank you!
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Staying at several Airbnbs, this place stood out because the location was safe, secure, clean, and well maintained. Smelled good, looked good, and the price was exceptional. I chose this place since I needed a close spot to head to the next town over for a fishing trip. The drive to Fellsmere Headwaters was less than 30 minutes and it was perfect. I was surprised how big and spacious the inside of the bungalow was! The extra linens were tagged with a clean note, and there was even an unopened 4 stick of butter in the fridge. Travel ice packs in the freezer, 2 bikes, 2 kayaks, dead bolts on the doors, fast wifi, and everything was well organized. While being adjacent to the Indian River lagoon, the sunrises were beautiful and I'd totally book another stay when I can come back down."
2022-11-01,5,Stayed over a week,"Quaint little bungalow. Nichole was a very accommodating, friendly and welcoming host. Thank you"

We were so surprised when we arrived, the location was perfect and our morning view of the water was breathtaking!! We had everything we needed at the house!! We had kayaks, bikes, life vests, beach chairs, towels and the kitchen was complete with complimentary coffee. I was able to wash a load of clothes which was a plus for me as well (laundry soap provided). This place was just so convenient and such a cute and clean environment that I will rent this again!!!! Thanks Nichole for hosting us!!! We are 100% impressed and see you again!!"
2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Nichole's place is great. Extremely clean and cozy for 2 people. We arrived 2 hours early and I messaged her to see if we could check in early and she immediately replied yes. The bed is comfortable, and the kitchen is fully stocked. She also has everything for the beach that you would need. We had forgotten our soft cooler and she had one, even the ice packs. She also has bikes and kayaks for your use. In the desk near the door she has many brochures and menus for the area. I highly recommend Nichole's place. Would definitely stay here again."
2022-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,Great location close to the water with walking/biking access to the Sebastian strip. Clean accommodations with tons of extras for enjoying your time in Florida.

2021-07-01,5,Stayed about a week,"My wife and I lived in Sebastian for 8 years and try to come back to visit friends when we can. This is the first time over the past 11 years that we stayed right in town, we loved it! We got to see our little town up close like we have never seen before. The morning walks along the river, being able to walk to some of our favorite restaurants without the worry of parking.
Nichole‚Äôs bungalow was a great place to spend our ten days in Sebastian. The home was very clean on our arrival. This is the longest we have stayed since we moved 11 years ago. The bungalow was so comfortable for the both or us we did not want to leave. Communication with Nichole was great and she was very helpful with a minor issue we had. I love to cook and was impressed at the size of the kitchen; we could spend a few months here for sure. Maybe we can one day üòâ"
2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,If staying on the Treasure Coast doesn‚Äôt it just make sense to stay at the museum that covers it all? Perfect location as everything is within walking distance. Nichole was very accommodating as our schedule had to change. Was a perfect staging area as we set up our new Sebastian home.
2021-05-01,5,Stayed over a week,"Nicholes home is lovely. We enjoyed being the location, her amazing hospitality and the loan of the bikes.üòÄ"
2021-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Conveniently located next to several restaurants/bars within walking distance. Located on a semi-busy road and railroad is close by, so if you're a light sleeper you may want to bring ear plugs. That really is the ONLY negative - everything else about our stay was PERFECT!
Extremely clean, has everything you need, and Nichole goes that extra mile to provide a few amenities that you may have forgotten to pack. She is always a text or call away and is quick to respond. And the complimentary tour of the treasure museum right next door is a bonus! I would definitely stay here again and highly recommend for couples -- a great find for the price and nearby conveniences."
2021-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Quiet, quaint little bungalow across from the river. It was bigger than I expected. Felt like a one bedroom apartment. Clean and peaceful. Sometimes noisy from the bikers and trains but you get used to it fast. Plenty of restaurants and shopping within walking distance, I recommend Mo-Bay Grille (Jamaican), Vic's Italian and Pizzeria, Squid Lips and Koji Japanese & Thai. For staying here you also get complimentary access to Mel Fishers Museum, full of history of the treasure coast and treasure hunting, highly recommended!"

2021-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Nichole‚Äôs place was great! Everything was clean and perfect! She communicated well and answered questions right away! Will definitely stay again! Perfect place for the two of us!
2021-03-01,5,Stayed about a week,a perfect spot and in sebastian right across the street from the Indian River. The layout is very convenient - hoping to have the same stay next year. Already miss the perfect sunrises right across the street.
2021-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Nichole's space was wonderful - it was very exciting every morning to just walk right across the street to the River front - watching the sunrise. We walked every morning and evening and rode bikes on Friday evening to watch the local high school band play at the park. It seemed everything was a short distance. The Sebastian Inlet State Park was 20-25 minute drive and it was awesome! Everything you could possibly want to do - you can do at the park! Fish, go to the beach, visit the Fishing museum, relax either at the beach on the Ocean side or the beach on the River. We also visited the Mel Fisher Treasure museum and enjoyed that - especially the short movie about Mr. Fisher's life. Nichole was very responsive and the space was larger than I expected and having the washer and dryer in the unit was nice."
2021-02-01,5,Stayed over a week,"Clean, convenient to walking trail and water and restaurants. Fun little getaway. I was able to do my remote computer work in the main living area while others slept in the separate bedroom. Good WiFi. Kitchen well stocked."
2021-02-01,5,Stayed about a week,This is right in the heart of it. Everything is walking distance away. Very clean and decorated top notch. A real surprise since no one knows about this hidden gem.
2021-01-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Thank you for an awesome vacation! The bungalow is perfectly located. River front and off of a main road for easy trips to the Sebastian Inlet Fishing Pier, beaches, restaurants and shopping. It‚Äôs comfortable with everything you need. The internet was perfect for working remotely. Nicole is definitely a super host and it shows!"

2020-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I can't say enough positive things about our experience staying at this beautiful cottage! My husband and I live in Cocoa Beach and love the Sebastian area. Instead of driving down for the day, we decided to rent a place to stay and explore the area for a few days. Super stoked we found this incredible Air BNB!
With ample room for parking, we were able to bring our 13 foot boat with us and park easily. The boat ramp is right across the street, so access was simple.
The cottage itself is adorable, clean, tastefully decorated, and includes everything you will need for your stay; even two beach cruisers to tool around town. The location is perfect, in the middle of everything; great restaurants, shopping, and beaches on the Atlantic ocean are just a few miles away.
You get free passes to the Mel Fisher Treasure Museum, which is a MUST SEE!
Nichole is an upbeat and friendly host who is there to help if you need anything, including suggestions for sightseeing and yummy local food.
You can walk outside in the morning and take a stroll with your coffee, grab a delicious breakfast at Earl's, or just watch the sunrise over the Indian River. Whatever your interest, you will find many things to satisfy your wants here!
Just book already, this is the place you want to be!!!"

2019-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This bungalow is in a great location right on Indian River. It is beautiful, clean, and convenient. The Mel Fisher Museum was an unexpected fun diversion. The local restaurants had music unroll 11 pm on a Thursday, just as a heads up if you like an early bedtime."
2019-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Nichole‚Äôs place is nice, clean & has the amenities that you need. It is bigger inside than it looks on the outside."

2019-07-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Nichole‚Äôs place was perfect! Like a home away from home. The location couldn‚Äôt have been better. Several establishments were only feet away from the cottage.

2019-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was our first experience with Airbnb and was pleasantly surprised how easy the check-in process was and the nicely appointed cottage exceeded our expectation. The cottage was in a great location. We enjoy walking along the river, watching the moon rise over the water in the evening. Great dining in walking distance. Free tickets to the very interesting treasure museum next door was an added bonus."
2019-03-01,5,Stayed over a week,"You will have a wonderful time at Nicole‚Äôs quaint cottage if you love the peace of a river and the sounds of Music up and down the river. Some of the best live bands I have ever heard. And the ocean, well, the ocean speaks for itself. It is amazing!"
2019-02-01,5,Stayed over a week,"We had a two week stay at Nichole's place and it was very comfortable. We were right in the middle of the ""action"" and it was relatively calm and quiet inside. The best of both worlds. I was happy that Nichole provided extras of the basics so we didn't have to run out for toilet paper or any other necessities. There are many restaurants in the area, providing lots of variety and very good quality. We could walk or bikeride to lots of activities.
The Treasure Museum is definitely a good take. Very unusual to stay in the same building as a museum with gold and silver bars from the old Spanish wrecks!"
2019-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is a wonderful place right in the heart of the Sebastian river walk. It is a large two room apartment newly remodeled with new appliances and amenities. It has a private bedroom and a pull out couch in the living room. I really enjoyed being able to walk to several different restaurants on the river walk to enjoy food, cocktails and live entertainment. Our host Nicole is available next door in the museum (Also a great attraction) and was a great host."

2018-09-01,5,Stayed over a week,"Nichole's place is very clean and centrally located. Perfect for two. We enjoyed the view towards the river morning and evening. That back porch was used frequently as well. Nichole's response time was very quick when we had questions about the area. The beaches were also clean and easy to get to. We had a rental car. We would stay again !

2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Nice place
2024-01-01,5,Stayed over a week,"Great house,reasonable price. Very good amenities, is located on a busy street, but is still quiet. Since I'm in Sebastian several times a year, I was aware of the situation. Communication with the landlord was excellent. The house well equipped. The only drawback, there is not a dishwasherü§£, but for two guests that can be taken care of,with full occupancy a lot has to be washed. Overall, we had a great stay in a chic house. Feel free to come back."

2023-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Nathan is a wonderful host who is friendly and very responsive to issues or concerns. He was so accommodating to our needs during our stay. The house is comfortable and clean and was convenient with two dogs. Nate provides so many items that travelers might not think to bring or pack and/or cannot pack (beach chairs, umbrella, towels, etc.) The house is on a busy street and therefore lots of road noise. I would still highly recommend this cute beachy cottage!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Had a problem with hot water while I was there. Nathan was quick to reply and act. The problem was resolved within about 24 hours and involved both a plumber and an electrician!
The place was perfect for me. I really enjoyed my stay. The bed was comfortable and there were several pillows to choose from. The kitchen had everything I needed to prepare meals. The bathroom towels were thick and nice. The recliner was absolutely the best piece of furniture there! This house is a gem and I would absolutely stay there again!
The only negative to the location is that some times of day there is a lot of traffic which can make it difficult to back out of the driveway. My suggestion is to back in to the driveway when you arrive that way you can just pull out and drive off‚Ä¶..made it so much easier for me!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,The house was definitely great for the short stay we had! We ran into a minor issue but Nathan was super responsive especially it being late at night. I would definitely stay again.

2022-03-01,5,Stayed over a week,"This house is very clean, and stocked well with many household items commonly needed. Access to the garage is convenient for doing laundry and for loading and unloading from your car. The road outside was busy, but probably more than usual because there were detours due to railroad work. Backing out of the driveway can be a little tricky, but just be patient and there will be a break in traffic so you can get out."
2022-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a great time at the property. There were just two of us guys, down for a fishing trip.

The house was stocked with everything we needed, including a child‚Äôs life jacket. Lynn was very kind when we met her and we loved being greeted by the outside house cat, Pixie. Unfortunately we visited while the weather was less than cooperative but my daughter loved her mini dip in the pool and would love to stay again to take advantage of warmer weather and access to the kayaks. We really appreciated the cleanliness and effort Lynn put into this place. 10/10 would recommend üòÉ"

Overall, it was a nice relaxing get away."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Lynn and her guest accommodations/location are nothing short of fantastic.

2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Sherida‚Äôs place is spectacular! A little botanical nature garden, complete with homegrown butterflies!

So many thoughtful touches, such as a basket with the snacks available as well as water, and other things. Clearly she cares that you enjoy your stay. The room was spotless and comfortable. As the bedroom and bathroom are on one side of the home, it feels very private. Would not hesitate to stay here again in the future!"

She was very nice & pleasant, had snacks put out of us, and even gave us a breakfast this morning!! A wonderful stay, and we would stay here again if were were in the area! Thank you so much!!"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"By far, this was the best Airbnb we have experienced. We‚Äôve never had nicer, more accommodating, and comfortable Airbnb ever. Underpriced for the value we received.
I‚Äôd challenge somebody to find a better host than Sherida!"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"10 stars! What an amazing stay. Sherida is such an interesting lady. She‚Äôs great to talk to. I learned a lot from her about butterflies and she even gave me a Chrysalis (cocoon). It‚Äôs magical if you‚Äôve never seen one up close.
Her space is immaculate. She has pets, but it‚Äôs Suuuuuper clean. I was hoping to snuggle her cats, but they stay to themselves on the other side of the home than the guest side. The bed is super soft and comfy. The bathroom is a private bath on the guest bedroom side of the house. Sherida was so sweet giving us fresh fruit salad and snacks for the art show we were in town for. She made us a fresh cooked breakfast in the morning. She took such good care of us.
Sherida‚Äôs home has such creativity and charm from her decor. It‚Äôs a beautiful, quiet relaxing place to stay. 10 stars, hands down. Thank you Sherida. ‚ù§Ô∏è"

2021-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We were so happy to find this place and stayed here for 5 nights.
Sherida is a perfect host, she does everything to make you feel comfortable and ready to advice about local attractions. Based on her advice we went kayaking and it was really cool. She also showed us a place with jays reservation and it was amazing.
We enjoyed sitting at the terrace and watching birds (indigos, blue jays, cardinals and many more) during the breakfast.
So the highest score possible to this place.
Thanks Sherida :)"
2020-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Simply amazing! Sherida‚Äòs place is not just an oasis for her guests but also for the animals in her surrounding. Her garden is made with love. Lots of birds, squirrels, butterflies visit and render her guests a smile. The room is so cozy and clean. She gives helpful tips which places to visit. Thank you for making our visit memorable and sharing your wonderful home with us."
2020-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Sherida could not be more of a warm person & friendly host!!
Her place is immaculate!!!
A showroom display!!
Above and beyond expectations!!
We felt so comfortable and at home, as well as, at ease with her."
2020-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"It was perfect, great house, very pleasant and available host. We had a great time."
2020-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This is a great find. Do not hesitate to stay here. The room was comfortable and really clean and the bathroom was private. There was also a separate living area with a couch and larger TV. The host was very friendly and helpful. Will stay again next year üòä
2020-01-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Sherida's space is clean and friendly. Perhaps she wanted to help a little too much. I'm a very independent person, I sometimes felt she wanted to assist me in more things than were necessary. I just needed a place to stay, not someone to take care of me. Overall good though. Also there were times I was heading out the door to go skydiving and she would stop me to show me photos on her iPad, that caused me some anxiety/impatience. Maybe I just need more privacy when I choose my air bnbs in the future."
2020-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Very comfortable, great for skydivers who travels to Sebastian DZ."
2019-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Sherida redefined for me what I can expect from Airbnb accomodations and hospitality - I came to Sebastian to enjoy skydiving, and just wanted a room to sleep in near the field, and I was blown away by how beautiful and homely her place was (warm-feeling house, bird oasis in the well kept backyard, cute cats and a dog) and how caring she was (local tips and activities, home cooking and even Christmas meal with her family!). The area is real nice - well preserved natural river perfect for easy kayaking, riverfront with restaurants and bars 10 minutes away, and amazing pristine beaches + nature preserve 30 min away."
2019-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"A very comfortable and clean house
Sherida goes over and beyond to make her guests feel comfortable
I totally recommend staying with her"
2019-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Sherida‚Äôs place was very clean and she was an amazing host. Check in was a breeze even though our flight was delayed. Wish we could‚Äôve stayed longer!
2019-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Sherida was amazingly hospitable and friendly. The house is very cute and in a great location for all sorts of activities or just driving around the coast.
2019-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,WOW! Sherida and her home were a welcome haven. The house is beautifully decorated and the yard is lovely with lots of blooms. Hospitality was exceptional for us and our fur baby. Our stay was for a family emergency and our unpredictable schedule was supported graciously. Bed was super comfy. Would absolutely stay with Sherida again.
2019-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"in our in our opinion, Sherida and her lovely home are the standard-bearers for Airbnb! Everything about our stay was perfect. Her home is glistening clean and every amenity is provided right down to some chocolates on the dresser. The bedroom and adjoining TV room are comfortable and stylish as is the bathroom and our area was private. Meeting Sherida became one of the highlights of our stay in the Treasure Coast. She is kind, generous, intelligent interesting and it all around wonderful person. And her breakfast will knock your socks off! We would go back in a heartbeat!"
2019-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Amazing Hospitality!!
2019-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Sherida's hospitality is absolutely amazing. From the gourmet breakfast each morning (including a fresh Tequila Sunrise on Sunday morning), to the fresh flowers and other thoughtful touches (inlcuding maps and suggestions for local places to visit), our stay was the best we've ever had with an Airbnb Superhost. Her house is immaculate, the bed and bedding incredibly comfortable, the decorating inviting, and the yard manicured. We look forward to staying again when we return to the area."
2019-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"I could not say enough about my recent stay at Sherida's lovely home. Everything about her home, her hospitality and herself is warm and pleasant. Her home is well appointed, immaculately clean yet cozy and comfortable. She had all the amenities and then some available; water, tea, chocolates, treats and lovely fruit breakfast she prepared herself for me. We enjoyed breakfast outside on the patio while chatting and watching the birds and squirrels...we saw cardinals, colorful buntings all while listening to a gentle water fountain gurgling in the background. Her backyard is a serene oasis. I was in town overnight for a wedding but would have been content to stay and enjoy the peaceful surroundings all day. If you are planning a trip to Sebastian, look no further; you have found the best."
2019-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful house in a nice residential neighborhood, totally updated and kept impeccably clean! I was worried about being allergic to her cat but the place is so clean I didn't have a problem at all, and the cat stayed mostly hidden anyway. She has a small dog that is well behaved and quiet. The common space is shared but her bedroom is on one side of the house and the guest room on the other, with a private bathroom, so even though we got up early we didn't feel we were disturbing her, just made sure to be quiet in the kitchen so as not to wake her. Sherida is an amazing welcoming host, very easy to communicate with, and even provided us with breakfast. Since we were getting up early most days she showed us where things were to help ourselves, but on the last day when she knew we were sleeping in she surprised us and made us a fabulous breakfast! So appreciated! She even made us little snack packs to take with us on the plane when we left!
Her place is very comfortable, spotless, and has a fantastic screened in porch overlooking her beautiful private yard and garden, very nice to have your morning coffee there! Next time I come back I will be sure to stay here!"
2019-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"Five star hospitality. Peaceful, clean and comfortable surroundings. Sitting in the screened porch having coffee and watching the birds in the backyard was so relaxing. Sherida is a great host. Our room was perfect with clean sheets, TV, Wi-Fi, ceiling fan and simple extra touches. Also office area with extra TV. Bathroom was also very clean. Shower had shampoo conditioner and body wash dispenser‚Äîperfect for an Airbnb. Easy access through the garage so not to disturb host if your evening ends up later than expected. House located in a well-maintained, safe residential community. Would definitely stay here again and refer anybody. A++"
2019-03-01,5,Stayed one night,Amazing host! Exceeded expectations in every area. My boyfriend raved about the breakfast spread to EVERYONE we came in contact with for the next 3 days!
2019-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Strongly recommend this location
2019-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Wonderful
2019-02-01,5,Stayed over a week,Sherida is a wonderful host and her place is very comfortable and has all the amenities you would ever need. Her home is exceptionally clean and the bed very comfortable. This place exceeded my expectations and I wouldn't hesitate to return. Sherida makes you feel right at home but gives you the space and privacy you need.
2018-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Amazing host! Sheridan will make you fill at home!! The place is amazing and you will find very interesting things in there!!
2018-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,What an awesome place. The photos do not do this listing justice. It was like a 5 star hotel. Lots of amenities and fresh flowers in the room were a nice touch! Close to shopping and restaurants and a short drive to the beach. We had a nice light breakfast on the porch overlooking the beautifully manicured grounds. Sherida was the perfect host. We look forward to staying here again on our next trip to Florida.
2018-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"Sherida went way above and beyond what was expected from a host. We arrived several hours late due to an accident along the way (thankfully nobody was hurt), but Sherida was accommodating and understanding the whole way. Once we finally arrived, she had a delicious spread of crackers, cheese, wine, and key lime pie waiting for us! And in the morning, she even made us breakfast, despite having to be on her way to work.
Besides the wonderful personal and thoughtful touches, the space itself was perfect. It had a TV with Netflix if you wanted to relax by yourself, or there was a screened in back porch if you wanted some fresh air (not attached directly to the room). Everything was very clean as well.
For any who might be worried about the pets, they were well behaved, quiet, and friendly. I am allergic to pet dander, but didn't have any issues while staying here; a further testament to the cleanliness.
Overall, highly recommended! Thank you Sherida!!"
2018-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was my first AirBnB experience and didnt know what to expect. Sherida was an awesome host and her home was a perfect place to relax, work and rest while on the road. The back lanai has a magnificent view of the garden which is an oasis of sweet floral smells, bird activity and lush green plants. She has set the bar high for my AirBnB expectations! This would be my first choices of places to stay between Orlando and Miami."
2018-03-01,5,Stayed about a week,For my first Airbnb experience it was above and beyond my expectations . Sherida was absolutely wonderful !! Lots of special touches including freshly ground coffee each morning . I felt at home and I would definitely go back .
2018-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Being a newbie to Airbnb I was very nervous about staying in someone‚Äôs home. We were in town to attend our son‚Äôs baseball games at Dodgertown. We did not have to worry. Sherida‚Äôs home was welcoming and very clean. You would not even realize there were pets in the home unless you saw them. She immediately made us feel at home! The bed was comfortable, plenty of towels, and her home is very tastefully decorated. Sherida provided delicious coffee and breakfast items every day. In our room was a binder filled with local restaurant menus and information on sites of interest. Sherida also gave us a route to follow to check out some local parks and other ideas on what to do in the area. We joined her to watch a couple movies and to enjoy some birdwatching from her porch. Her dog was very friendly and we rarely saw her cats. We were treated very well and highly recommend her home as a place to stay."
2018-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"This was our first experience with airbnb; we really did not know what to expect and we were focused on our itinerary. However, we were pleasantly surprised with this host and her house. She had many personnel touches that were extremely nice and appreciated."
2018-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"Comfortable, clean,well equipped. Great hostess. Good bed. Wonderful towels in bathroom. Homey. Back porch was great with a bird show in the afternoon. Painted Buntings were beautiful. Landscaping, garden and butterfly habitat. All around excellent."
2018-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Sherida offers clean and comfortable accommodation in a quality home, and a quiet neighborhood. The quality of her accommdation is only matched by the kindness and care with which she welcomes guests. She shows a true preoccuppation for the well-being and interests of her guests. Her pets are quiet and reserved.
Overall a truly enjoyable and fulfilling experience."
2018-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Sherida is a fantastic host. I was in the area with my agility dogs for practice at a nearby facility. I do have cat allergies, so I was a little worried before my arrival. I didn‚Äôt have any issues with my allergies as my side of the house was cat free. Her house is kept spotless. She was very welcoming and had many added touches that made our visit comfortable and felt right at home."
2018-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I'm not even sure where to begin! Sherida is, plain and simple an amazing host! She made my dog and I feel right at home! The room is very nice and comfortable, she made coffee every morning, even invited me to join her for dinner one evening! I was staying with her as my dog and I were attending a seminar in the area, so rather long days, but it was nice coming in after working all day to talk with someone, who showed interest in what we had been doing all day. If you are in the area, this is a must place to checkout!"
2017-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place and wonderful host. I really enjoyed my stay and recommend Sherida's place to anyone visiting Sebastian.
2017-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"Best host ever. Above and beyond the call of duty. We were mistakenly a day early and Sheri let us in and looked after us, and drove us around. A charming home and charming host. It would be lovely if Sheri could come and stay with us in Cornwall, so that we could repay her hospitality."
2017-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Sherida is a wonderful host! Her home is absolutely lovely and very clean! I enjoyed staying at her home and everything about it was convenient for what I needed.
2017-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Home Away From Home!! Sherida's was an awesome host and made me feel like I was literally in my own home!! Both the bedroom and bathroom were tastefully decorated, comfortable and private! Sherida made me feel so comfortable & welcomed!! Very much enjoyed the lanai which provides views of beautiful private manicured backyard with an abundance of birds and squirrels!! Carpe diem"

2017-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"I just spend one night in this beautiful house, because we was on a roadtrip. If it would be possible for me, I would love to stay there longer!
Sherida is a very friendly and caring person and really nice to talk with!
It worked out very spontaneously. Everything is really clean and the bed is absolutely cozy!
All in all it's very worth it! I loved it!"
2017-03-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Thank you, Sheri, for such a wonderful week at your home!
I stayed with Sheri for the first week of a three-week stay in Sebastian. I am a rower and was here for training at Canal 54. I can't say enough about Sheri's hospitality and amazing home!
She took time to help with me directions and tell me about the area when I moved in. She offered me use of her bike, and fresh herbs and vegetables from her garden, which was so nice and generous. She even had coffee ready for me when I left for practice at 6AM.
Her home is incredibly comfortable. There's a screened-in porch in the back, which was a great place to sit, eat and relax. The layout offers plenty of privacy and personal space. We were on different schedules and never even heard each other make noise. I highly recommend staying here to anyone traveling to the area!"
2017-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What a jewel...Beautiful! Clean! Comfortable!...Sherida has elevated airbnb to new heights... We loved staying with her. Sherida is a wonderful, helpful and easy-going person. She has created an oasis away from home. The guest area has its own private entrance and bathroom. It is spacious with a comfortable bed, TV (with dish and DVD), plush towels and all of the other amenities you might need. In the mornings she provided us with breakfast and fresh coffee from her gourmet kitchen. There is a huge screen porch... great for birdwatching. Her backyard is beautifully landscaped with a vegetable garden, flowers and fruit trees. If you like to travel in comfort and style... this is the place!"
2017-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"A wonderful place. She is friendly, welcoming, and great person. We will definitively recommend it, absolutely! thank you!"

We loved the openess of the house! This is one of the reasons we chose Christy's house. We were visiting family, and we had enough seating.
If you are in the Sebastian area, definitely check out this house. You won't regret it!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,Christy was an amazing host! Our family enjoyed her house and was perfect for a quiet spring break. The beaches near by were not crowded and just what we needed. The best part was the heated pool that the kids got to enjoy from sun up to sun down. We will be back.
2024-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,House was fabulous. We had cold weather and wind but we still were able to swim in the pool as it was heated. The place was clean Way better than a hotel !!!
2024-01-01,5,Stayed over a week,"Great little house in a quiet neighborhood. Close to grocery store and gas station, short drive to the riverfront and all the restaurants. House was perfect for our needs, but I wouldn‚Äôt recommend having more than 6 adults."

2023-10-01,5,Group trip,I find Christy because I had a different air bnb that canceled after a few weeks. I was lucky to find her place and so grateful the other reservation fell through because this was a fantastic experience. The bath tub‚Ä¶. Was my favorite feature‚Ä¶. So relaxing.

We came from Germany to skydive for 2 weeks at the dropzone in Sebastian. Ben and Suzanne¬¥s AirBnB Treehouse is very close to the dropzone. Since we were very unlucky with the weather in Dec 2023, we got to spend more time in the Treehouse than expected. At least we really loved the sweet little apartment, cleanliness and equipment. Ben and Suzanne were extremely supportive when we needed something, and provided privacy on the other hand. We would always come back there :) Groceries and restaurants are close by. Check-in/out very easy."

The setting is very quiet and private yet also in close proximity to several restaurants and shopping on the main drag, US-1. Ben just happened to be outside when I arrived and he is a very pleasant and gracious host.
Entry to the apartment was easy and I was glad that it was cooled down nicely as it was 95 degrees when I arrived. The kitchen is well appointed with most everything one would need. The bedroom was comfortable with nice dimming lights over the bed for reading. It felt very much like home. WiFi service was obtained easily and is quite fast. There is a large TV in the living room with Xfinity cable service, although I never used it.

As we reached the treehouse we realized it was a private road. When we got upstairs we were not disappointed. The place was very clean. No critters. It felt like if we were in our own apartment. The Treehouse was very clean. The ambience was perfect when we arrived. Disappointing we didn't get to meet Ben and Suzanne. From what we saw from a distance very family oriented.

2022-05-01,5,Stayed about a week,Great stay! Hosts are very responsive and professional. In particular I loved the decor: the walls have nice bespoke murals and the decor is chosen with care. The kitchen includes numerous appliances to facilitate creative cooking. 100% I‚Äôd go again next time I‚Äôm in the area.

2022-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The Treehouse is a very comfortable place to stay. The location and the size of the place worked very well for our stay. Ben and Suzanne were excellent at communication. We didn‚Äôt need any assistance from them but I have no doubt that had anything gone wrong that they would have been there immediately. Definitely a place I would return to if we ever find ourselves back in that area.
2022-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Just right!
2022-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Ben and Suzanne were fabulous hosts. We loved the apartment during our stay. It came as advertised.

The accommodation has its own kitchen, tv room, dining room, & bedroom. Its a 5/10min walk from Publix supermarket. I didn't meet the owners but all contact / Checkin / Checkout was done via AirBnb app and they were very responsive. Helped me with all additional queries that I had.
Highly recommended! Thank you"
2021-11-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Place is very nice and the hosts are as well. Only thing I would suggest is to bring everything you might need for breakfast etc.. including coffee and any spices or oil you need. Enjoyed it very much! üòä

2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Suzanne and Ben thank you so much for making me feel ‚Äúat-home‚Äù in your slice of heaven!!! All the rooms felt safe, area felt safe and private, and everything was clean!!! On this listing you do have to go up some stairs with your suitcases, but not bad at all. Large refrigerator for you to store groceries! Very nice place!"
2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great place, exactly what we were looking for."

2021-03-01,5,Stayed over a week,"Ben and Suzanne's apartment is cozy and very pleasant. It's in a quiet neighborhood near the Sebastian River, and the restaurants on the Indian River are just a short drive or bike ride away. We enjoyed spending the month of March at their Airbnb."
2021-02-01,5,Stayed over a week,"Highly recommend the apartment. Charming decor, bed is comfortable, well equiped and everything is in good working order. (did not use the laundry).

2021-02-01,5,Stayed about a week,Nice quiet location. Good people to stay with. Very responsive. Close to everything in Sebastian
2021-01-01,5,Stayed over a week,It was a nice place just what I needed. Was in a great location
2021-01-01,5,Stayed about a week,For the price you will be hard pressed to find better accommodations. The apartment is enough room to not feel cramped. The kitchen has enough utensils to cover most dishes. Everything is clean when you arrive. The apartment is easy to get to but far enough from main roads to be quiet. This is my second time staying with Ben and Suzanne and they were just as gracious and accommodating as the first time.
2021-01-01,3,Stayed a few nights,"The ‚Äútree‚Äùhouse is quaint and nicely decorated, but the area truly isn‚Äôt all that private, since the hosts live on property and have quite a few vehicles going in and out throughout the day, as well as two other RVs that are on property pressed up to the house. It‚Äôs stationed on top of an active garage that has quite a bit of foot traffic throughout the day and early evening.
The kitchen is nicely stocked with pots and pans, and we were easily able to cook whenever and whatever we wanted.
If you‚Äôd like to watch TV, I suggest bringing something you‚Äôd be able to stream with, because there aren‚Äôt any channels at all on the provided TV, including any news stations. It was nice, however, to have the option to watch whenever we wanted!
Occasionally a sewer smell would come from the water while we washed dishes, brushed teeth, showered, etc.
We enjoyed our stay for what it was and the price we paid, but can‚Äôt see ourselves booking this Airbnb again."
2020-12-01,5,Stayed over a week,Expect what is advertised.
2020-11-01,5,Stayed about a week,This is a great place to stay and its very clean and they are very nice and accommodating people! 5 stars on everything for sure!
2020-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Ben and Suzanne's place is stunningly beautiful and stylish. I found the one-bedroom apartment to be cozy and comfy. The apartment has pretty much everything you need. The place is very close to the beaches and great restaurants/bars, adventure places (Skydive Sebastian, Endless Windz, and many more). Given its competitive price for its awesome value, I am giving this place an all 5-star review."
2020-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,In a very secluded area. I came here to get away from the noise and it was the perfect spot. I didn‚Äôt go anywhere and was able to rest and plan my 2021 goals. Nice and clean! A lot of trees and very nature-like!
2020-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was a great find! The bed was so super comfortable. The space was bigger than what I was expecting, and I'm so happy about it! :)
The hosts were friendly, but gave me the space I wanted (basically just said hi, asked me how my stay was going, then went about what they were doing).
There were lots of pots and pans, a George Foreman grill, and lots of other provisions like bottled water, mayo, mustard, ketchup, (that I didn't use because I brought my own... but it's still nice to know that they have).
The apartment is on top of a barn, so the garage door opening was loud and scary until I figured out what was going on.
It is a short walk away from Publix, a great pizza place, a great Chinese place, and other things. The beach is maybe a 15 minute drive away.
I recommend when you first come out, that you go during the daylight hours, because this was hard for me to find at first during night time, until I knew where I was going.
There are cute little artsy touches painted on the walls and chairs and such. It was cute and quirky, and I suspect the host did them herself ;)
I will definitely be back."
2020-10-01,5,Stayed over a week,"This place is very clean, quiet, and secluded. But very close to several local restaurants, several great parks with access to the river. Sebastian Inlet is a beautiful 30 minute drive.
You will be very happy you decided to stay at the Tree house."
2020-10-01,5,Stayed about a week,"A great location, quick access to the Riverwalk and close to the ocean. Clean, comfortable and everything you need. For me internet was essential, and I was able to work when necessary, with no issues. Would definitely stay again, thanks!"

2020-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place is perfect for 1 or 2 people to visit. Located right next to everything you need but tucked away where there is very little traffic. The inside of the tree house has everything you need, very comfortable, and stylish. Will be renting again on our next fishing trip! Highly recommend."
2020-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Our stay was amazing !!
The hospitality was amazing. Ben gave us access to the pool and it couldn‚Äôt be cozier and nicer. Very good host and stay and we would definitely come back
Thanks so much !!"
2020-05-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"The tree house is just the right size for 2 people. The bed was very comfortable. The place was very comfortable and welcoming. They have multiple coffee makers so you can bring Kcups or coffee grounds (if you are a coffee person), they also have a tea pot for tea.
It is close to everything in the town of Sebastain. We had a great stay."

We were in town for a wedding at Captain Hiram's and found this airbnb to be a much better price, we're glad we decided to go this route. It's a short uber ride to Captain Hiram's and other local spots. The ac works great. Only hiccup we had was the internet was down but the host was very fast in responding via text & easy to communicate with."
2019-10-01,5,Stayed about a week,Very quiet and private location close to the hospitals of Sebastian in case you need to take care of a parent or otherwise. I stayed here a week and the value was great.

2019-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The Treehouse was even better than described. Spacious, quiet, very clean, and peaceful. It had everything I needed for my 4-night stay and more - it was the perfect home away from home while I was in Florida to visit my mom. The location was perfect - near state parks for hiking & birding, but also very convenient to a food store & shopping center. Ben & Suzanne were very friendly and my questions were immediately answered. I definitely hope to stay there again the next time I am in Florida!"

Having a kitchen with all the essentials was a great way to save time and money while on this trip. The location is awesome--within a short driving distance to so many outdoor activities like beaches, parks, and hiking trails. Conveniently close to grocery stores and drugstores for anything you might need, yet feels like its off the beaten path!"
2019-02-01,3,Stayed over a week,"HELLO

Ben was right there outside doing yard work when we pulled up, so it was a seamless introduction to the place and we were able to get in right away which is always nice. Everything was very clean and the space was nice and cozy on an unusually chilly night in Florida! The location is private but still easy to find. It was nice to be in a quiet space but not far from the grocerily store or places to eat. Thank you Ben and Suzanne for letting us stay with you!"

2024-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The Salty Pearl was outstanding. Starting out Bryan and Corinne were very accommodating and friendly! The attention to detail in this home is great and you can tell a lot of love and hard-work was put into it. Spacious, and lots to do in the home itself, the backyard is wonderful! Beds are super comfy and the home is supplied with everything you might need, they even set up a little basket of snacks for our arrival. The bathrooms were also stocked with toiletries in case we forgot anything (which we did.) Sebastian beach is beautiful very cute little town and the beach was very clean and taken care of. 100% recommend staying here, my family really enjoyed, we will definitely be back! Thank you so much to our wonderful hosts :)"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I don‚Äôt know where to start!!! What an amazing beautiful home!! I actually cannot believe we found this place. We had the most amazing 3 days following on from a wedding weekend in Melbourne. The house was so clean and extremely tastefully decorated throughout, the facilities were great and we made the most of the amazing outside space. We wanted for nothing during our stay and the welcome pack was an added bonus. Communication with Bryan and Corinne was easy and they were both very responsive. Didn‚Äôt want to leave and was sad to do so. Hopefully there will be a next time and if anyone is thinking of booking this place then HURRY UP, you will not be disappointed ‚ù§Ô∏èx"
