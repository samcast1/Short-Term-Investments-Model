2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,I own a small business and one of my contractors stayed there. He really enjoyed the place. We will comeback if need.

2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Absolutely amazing little place, Angela was an awesome host, will definitely stay again!"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The host was so so kind, accommodating and very prompt with responses to questions or if we needed anything! The animals were so cute, and the location was so private and serene. The AC was on point, and it was very cozy. As long as you can handle the sulfur water, it's a perfect stay! Great for working in the area or a vacation to relax. I recommend watching the sunrise with some tea on the deck, and petting the animals! Also the decor was adorable inside."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,love the place will definitely be back had to leave earlier then expected and they help me with my situation thank you much
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is a great place to stay. Angela was very helpful and responsive. We especially enjoyed visiting the chickens, cows and sheep. It’s small but we only needed a place to sleep. We would definitely stay here again. For the price, it’s a steal!"
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The garden camper was a nice stay. We loved the peaceful surroundings - waking up and saying good morning to the animals was lovely. The only con for me was the sulfury water, which can’t be helped, but made me hesitant to use the shower (I’m sure the smell would wear off!) However, the ac was cool and loud, comfortable bed and a good value. Angela was a friendly, responsive host and we appreciated her local recommendations. I would stay again if I came back to this area."
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,❤️
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Angie and her husband were the most responsive, accommodating, helpful, and just one of the most genuine host I've ever encountered. I stayed in the RV and it was a delightful stay overall. I needed the peace on their farm. thank you ✝️."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Angela was great, her animals and farm are great. One neighboring family has occasional Sunday garden parties, just fyi. The A/C unit is fine but very loud, which was excellent for drowning out the neighbor's party. We had a minor electrical fault just as we were retiring at 10pm (which is late for a farmer) and Angela was immediately there to fix the issue."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The space was cozy and quiet. The bed was very comfortable and the AC was cold. There was a nice deck outside to sit at but I was not able to use due to the rain. I will stay again if I get down that way.
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Was very private and nice! A beautiful place and the host was quick with responses!
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This little RV is all I needed for my quick trip. It was super cute and modernized. The only real downfall is the sulfur water but that's nothing that can be helped. I loved the animals! We arrived at night and it was pitch black. So when I went outside the first morning, what an awesome view! It sits on a little farm with sheep/goats, cows, chickens and ducks! It was pretty magical! I would definitely stay again. AC worked well too!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful property and very private
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"This was the best air B&B experience I’ve ever had! The place was immaculately clean, and cozy. Perfect for our trip. Not too far from longboat key and caspersen! I would definitely recommend this wonderful place if you are looking to visit the area!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,One of the best stays! Not even 5 minutes from the kayak/boatramp on the Peace River at Nocatee. Host was friendly and Duke and Daisy were the best puppers.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Very responsive. Would stay here again when visiting Arcadia.
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"A pleasant surprise in Arcadia! At first glance, the idea of an apartment in the back of a huge garage might seem off-putting, but it turns out that it's an ingenious use of space. The living space that Macy has created in this this unconventional setting is delightful. Everything is well laid out and appointed, and the quality of the construction is top notch. The kitchen is well equipped and the bathroom is spacious and confortable.
The place can be a little hard to find, as Google maps takes you to the wrong address, but the AirBnB app locates it correctly. Also, one end of Provau Road is missing a stret sign, so it's easy to miss the turn, but once you locate the place it's easy to get to it from Hwy 17 by memory.
Macy's place is hands down the best accomodation I have had in Arcadia -- my mom and sister live there so I visit often, and usually stay in Port Charlotte or Punta Gorda, but hopefully Macy's place will be available for our next visit."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,It was a lovely space. Would definitely stay again! Very accommodating with our big dog.
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great spot and very quiet.
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Macy and Conner are probably the sweetest hosts I’ve ever had! They’re so homey and welcoming. As an Airbnb host myself I hope
my visitors feel the way they made me feel. They were so responsive, sweet, personable and overall a sweet couple! Thank you for letting me meet Duke and Daisy by the way! Their shop was homey, clean and so peaceful, it felt so nice to walk out early in the morning and hear so much peace.. I hope to visit with my family again."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great stay! Very cozy. Love what they’ve done with the space. Perfect landing spot for the night. Easy to get to and communicative host.
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"The Shop House was perfect for what we needed, and we even got to bring our puppy! The place was beautiful and clean and just as described. They were wonderful hosts!"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"This was our first time staying at an Airbnb. We could not have asked for a more wonderful experience! Macy was so friendly with a warm welcome, a terrific smile and personality!
This place was exactly what we were looking for. We needed a place to call home for a week as we lost our home during hurricane Ian. The guest house was adorable! Loved the water, snacks and information of places to see and do. We will definitely plan to be back next year at Arcadia Rodeo time!
Thank you for the suggestion of Wheelers Cafe. We were starving when we got there and that was a perfect place to go . Please try it great menu and awesome food. Thank you again Macy for sharing your Shophouse!
Roy and Joan B Ohio"

2024-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a nice stay at your place and it was in a beautiful spacious natural setting. The bed was comfortable and ample soft towels provided. The home had a lot of natural lighting from the windows and high ceilings with an open airy floor plan. Only personal issue I had was the house smelling like FeBreze when we first entered. I do not do well with perfume smells. But once I opened the windows it was all aired out in no time. Most probably would not even been bothered with this, but it was my only complaint. I still give the place 5 stars."

2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"We would stay here again. We loved the quiet. The house is about equal distance from Sebring, Wachula, and Arcadia. All 3 have nice restaurants, groceries, and dollar type businesses. In fact, Dollar General is only a mile or so away!
The house was spotless. The beds were comfy. The towels were fluffy.
The neighbors were quiet. The birds were singing. An ideal location.
Thank you for a beautiful experience."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"If you're looking for a peaceful, private stay a little off the beaten path, this is the place for you! This home and property are ultra clean and is very comfortable for a solo traveler, couple, or family.

2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Our stay at the cottage was fantastic! The cottage had the old world charm with all of the amenities of the 21st-century. We went on a fossil egg and the peace river. So the washer and dryer was very handy. We plan on staying there again.

2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"stay was A-plus very clean, very comfortable, with a very welcoming host. Property is beautiful but possibly to remote for some, Arcadia is 14 miles out so there is no walking to a restaurant, but we knew that when we booked."
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"Meagan and Marc were wonderful hosts! They were attentive to our needs, very responsive and helpful. They were also accommodating when we had to add an extra day to our stay due to our flight schedule. We were welcomed with a variety of snacks and fresh eggs from their chickens and ducks. The cottage was super clean, with every amenity we needed. The kitchen was well equipped, the bathrooms came with toiletries, extra towels, and even makeup towels. The cottage is waterfront, and the grounds are very picturesque with all kinds of wild birds. Loved seating outside watching the birds, but my favorite activity was interacting with their goats. The goats were adorable and friendly. Meagan provided us treats to feed them and visited with us while we pet them. Loved the goats! We really enjoyed our stay and hope to be back soon!"
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,What a great little place!!!! we will be back!!
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,I will definitely be back

2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We had a great time at the cottage! It was perfect for what we were looking for.

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Love the cottage it’s very comfortable and in a beautiful location. Always clean and has all the amenities you could need for an enjoyable stay. Marc is an excellent host keeps up with all the spots he has very well. Just an overall awesome place to stay!!

2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,This is my hometown and I love the river and creeks so this was a perfect spot to be able to enjoy the peaceful surroundings and water while we visited. They had kayaks and canoes available and a cute little dock to fish from. We really enjoyed our time there and will book in the future when visiting.
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Can not say enough about this space. For the price, you can't beat it. The cost of kayaking and fishing alone makes this well worth it, as you can do both for free right in the backyard without ever having to drive. The farm animals were awesome, the space had great AC and comfy beds. Will be back for sure!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The quaint cottage was just that. It was a nice weekend getaway from the city for us. Everything was really clean and nice inside the cottage. We came to the area to paddle board and kayak down to the Peace River to look for archaeological treasures. However, due to the recent hurricane the areas we tried to go to were very flooded. We still paddled around though. It was nice to get fresh eggs from the owners farm. We enjoyed seeing the ducks, chickens, and goats free roam around the property. Last night we made a small fire in the outside fire pit. It is very relaxing to sit outside and hear the sounds of nature like owls and cicadas."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Super quiet and beautiful location with the river right out your front door! I loved listening to the animals and nature sounds. Cottage had everything you could need. A/C worked great, and the cottage was cool during a very hot week! Checking in and out was a breeze. It was a great experience!"

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Extremely clean well decorated fully functional ready to stay in cute little cottage. Honestly best experience I’ve had staying anywhere other than my home.

2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I can't say enough about our stay at the cottage it was clean, neat, updated nicely,beautiful scenery,kayaking,fishing feeding the baby goats totally made our day.

2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,What an amazing place. I loved everything single thing about it. Marc walked down to see if my toddler wanted to bottle feed the baby goats…. What a lovely place and lovely people!!!
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Peaceful AND SECLUDED with full cell phone coverage. Owners very knowledgeable in local activities. The kayaking down the river and up peace river was a very beautiful sight. The camp is very well kept and everyone is very trusting and kind. The fishing is top notch, the 21 years military and this place is one if the few that had 7 different kinds of things to catch from one place..
Ray and I will definitely be back. Great Job"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Such a peaceful, scenic stay! Looks exactly like the photos. We were able to cook dinner on the grille, and kitchen was stocked with all the cooking utensils. Hosts offered some firewood, and it was enough for a campfire both nights! We went kayaking in the morning and saw some manatees! Fishing was fun, animals around the property were nice. We even got to feed the baby goats and we’re given duck eggs!
Overall, exceeded expectations. Megan and Marc were friendly as can be. The area was quiet and safe. Very responsive, usually responding with 5 minutes. If you want a weekend away, would highly recommend! Could not have been an easier, cozier experience."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very nicely furnished and decorated. Nice towels and comfortable bed. Well equipped kitchen. Loved the snacks and also sitting in the screened porch in the morning.
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"A great little getaway, with even better host!"
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The Cabin at Horse Creek retreat provided the quinsasential ambiance for that relaxing, quiet, calming and friendly charming old Florida feel for my husband and I.

We paddled out on the horse creek seeing tons of animals and a quick drive took us to a great fossil finding spot. The setting was beyond picturesque and the Mark and Meaghan were delightful. The property, cottage , host and sweet animals made for a memorable trip. Can’t wait to go back!"

And even provided us with some firewood that we used to make s’mores one night with the kids. They have plenty of kayaks and paddle boards to use during the stay. I kayaked down to the river and back up the creek and it is a peaceful kayak. The location is perfect, and peaceful and only a short drive into town. There are some beautiful beaches just a short drive away, where you can find shark teeth and other fossils. I would definitely recommend staying here if you are looking for a relaxing vacation away from the hustle and bustle of everyday life."

Dave’s place was exactly as described. Very close to downtown shopping and the Mosiac arena. Directions were easy to follow and we found the location easily. The place was very quiet (concrete block between units) only noise we heard was from passing ambulance or fire truck (nothing anyone can control). Everything was clean and neat. The towels were plentiful and smelled really good and clean. Kitchen was equipped with everything we needed. Keurig coffee maker a plus if you want to bring your favorite pods, but Dave supplied more than enough and good quality. Also, tea choices and candy snacks were a “sweet” surprise. Dave gave good restaurant recommendation of el dorado maya which has great authentic Mexican food. Great price great portions. Be sure to visit the 2 best stores downtown, Cowboy Corner and right next door Blossoms. We will look forward to our next stay at Dave’s and visiting this adorable small town gem. God Bless❤️🇺🇸"

Arcadia has good fast food options, a Walmart superstore, and everything we needed. (We preferred to eat in most of the time, so didn’t look into area restaurants.) We enjoyed the nearby golf course as well. There are 2 TVs including a large screen in the living room and one in the bedroom, although we didn’t have a chance to try them out: they were also new.

Our kids and dog had so much space to free run and explore, they loved it and looked very happy. We did not spend time at the river but it looks like a great place to fish.

But one phone call was enough and Kendall was with us 2 minutes later and escorted us to his apartment. And this one is just so beautiful, cozy and inviting, you feel right at home from the first moment. In retrospect, we were really sorry that we only stayed for one night (we had a meeting in Largo).

My wife and I felt that our kids were safe and that Kendall's home was well sanitized. The linens were very nice and bright white and the beds were very nice and comfortable. Having access to a washer and dryer during our stay was amazing! The house had more than enough space and furniture to accommodate a family of four, but could just as easily have accommodated a family twice our size. Kendall was very easy to work with and was very responsive. It is nice to see a host that takes care of their property and goes above and beyond to make their guests feel welcomed.

We starred at the stars, sat next to their pond, and even started a campfire. Natalie was so nice and accommodating— actually, the whole family was.
From opening the gate to cutting firewood or getting us cookware, this was my favorite Air B&B stay I’ve ever had. It is truly a countryside paradise.

Definitely going back out and feeding the chickens.

2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"My children and i are going through a difficult chapter in our story, and Kendall and her family were incredibly accommodating and welcoming. The Barn was probably the coolest thing the kid's experienced as well as the disconnect from daily distractions like TV.
The coffee cake Kendall made us was probably the most delicious I've ever had- I'm absolutely sure its because she poured her heart into it. I hope to make this our escape! Thank you for hosting us. ❤️"

Can’t wait to return!!
Thanks Kendall. 🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼"

A couple spiders but that’s what you get for a rainy day in rural Florida LOL Everything was spotless clean, well decorated and had everything we needed and more. There was even a cute little book with notes from previous guest we enjoyed flipping through. Bed was a comfortable hard, we slept great. Mildly humid during the storms but the dehumidifier came in handy! The espresso bar was yummy and a nice little perk as well."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Loved the area. Kendall and Rhonda's Cinnamon coffee cake was exceptional. The quaint downtown area is nice to walk and for antiquing. The shop owners were so friendly it was amazing. Every 4th weekend the downtown area has extra sidewalk vendors. We will definitely visit again.

Will definitely be back when over in that area."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Grovehouse was far superior to accommodations we have used in the area in the past. Kendall and Rhonda anticipated our needs and made us feel so welcome and secure. Their lovely space is sparkling clean and inviting. You will love it!

2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay! These folks went above and beyond to take care of us.
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a lovely time at the Grove House. Kendall and his wife were excellent hosts and the home was perfect! My husband and I traveled with our 2 teenage boys and they absolutely loved their room upstairs. The espresso machine was a hit and the unique decor was a fun touch!
The bed in he master bedroom was so comfortable and we really enjoyed the large kitchen.
Outside we enjoyed bumping the volleyball with each other and wandering through the orange grove.
Oh, and the coffee cake was delish! If we are in the area we will definitely stay again. We had such a fun and relaxing time."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"The hosts were very responsive and helpful at all times. We arrived late night so it was dark to get to but they left the outside and some inside lights on for us. Getting into the house was very easy, the parking spot is super close to the entrance. Once we made it inside, there was a nice handwritten note along with freshly baked coffee cake on the table for us. That was the cherry on top, what a sweet gesture! The house was very clean, they literally had everything we needed, they were very accommodating as well. In the morning we went out to walk around and see the area, a golden retriever came to us (from a neighbors house, I assume) and was so friendly! It was a great surprise.
Overall, the place was great, comfortable, peaceful and everything we needed for our stay. We definitely wish we could’ve stayed another night. Amazing hosts, thank you for being great and loving what you do!!!"
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We had a great stay at the Grovehouse! What a perfect spot in Arcadia. When we arrived, we were greeted with a warm cinnamon coffee cake on the kitchen table. It was delicious! The 2-story apartment/house gave us plenty of room to spread out. The upstairs area was perfect for our 2 teenage boys with twin beds, 2 sofas and a foosball table. (The stairs are steep and probably not suitable for small children.) Downstairs we enjoyed a very comfortable queen bed, beautiful kitchen, full size washer and dryer, and clean bathroom. It was very quiet and peaceful the entire time we were there. We enjoyed dinner at the outside table. Each morning a group of beautiful peahens would come through the property foraging for insects. We really had a great time and would stay here again next time we are in Arcadia!"
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Lovely stay in a beautiful, quiet place. We came out here for fossil hunting and the Grove house was a perfect place to lay our heads down after two full days of digging in the river! We will definitely be back to play more fooseball! Thank you!"
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was my first time visiting Central Florida. Now I know where all of the Oranges and Beef comes from. There are miles of farm land in this area. The location in Arcadia is a little remote but did work for my visit with just a 40min drive to my weekend destination. The apartment was very clean and modern. Exactly as described and just like to photos. There is no TV...which at first I was not sure about but didn't effect my stay as I was able to catch up on much needed sleep in the peace and quiet of the surroundings and the super comfy queen size bed. There were way more amenities in the apartment than I needed for my short stay but I really appreciated the coffee bar and the nice home baked cinnamon coffee cake waiting for me when I checked in. Thanks Kendall, if I get back to this area again I will certainty try and stay at the Grove again."
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"A great little spot in an orange grove in DeSoto county. We came to the area for a few days of work. And the place was perfect for the 2 of us. Kendall was so nice. The place was quiet. Well furnished and clean. The kitchen area is a little tight for relaxing, but the upstairs loft bedroom area was great for chilling out. We enjoyed our time sitting on the patio outside and listening to the sounds of nature. Thanks Kendall!"
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Thiis is a gem of a find! Kendall's place is such a cool spot. It was perfect for my family fossil hunting trip. Kendall was super responsive, very friendly, and overall such a great host! They even left us a homemade treat for when we arrived and it was delicious! the location is great. I can't say enough good things about this awesome place!"
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Hands down the nicest Airbnb we’ve stayed in. Was super clean- looked brand new. Beds were comfy and the coffee bar was a hit. We had a blast searching for fossils in the Peace River and driving to the gulf for sea shells. Thanks again for the awesome home away from home!

2023-01-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was a great find, very peaceful and immaculately kept. The only couple of things worth mentioning is the beds were a little hard and the WiFi wasn’t great but they resolved that immediately. I think adding a TV would be helpful for sure. We would’ve loved to relax and watch a movie. It was super convenient having a washer and dryer, everything was clean and the upstairs was fun with the games. The steps are a little shallow so be careful on those middle of the night bathroom runs but overall the place was great. We left a small BBQ for the next family to enjoy!"
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We were working in the area and it was so convenient and comfortable for our time there. They were flexible with our check in and check out and even made cinnamon coffee cake!

2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,It’s a great place nice and spacey clean. The only thing that did not work was the Wi-Fi password did not work so he just didn’t have Internet and my phone would not work in the house. I think they were trying to get that fixed

I do wish I had brought a chair and umbrella in order to sit outside. There’s no where to really be outside other than in the ant infested yard. (No porch) Don’t forget to pack books and board games. I understood there was no tv before check in but there really isn’t anything for entertainment, so bring your own.
I would describe this place as a not-so-quiet country get away.
I would prefer being out that far in the country to be alone and not be sharing the building/ yard with other people. Or the feeling of being surrounded by people which this place very much has."
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Amazing location. Quaint fun and absolutely stunning. The hosts are super attentive and so friendly. You gotta try the bread. It’s to die for.
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Perfect country get away for a time of rest and relaxation! Very clean and homey atmosphere!
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Can I leave more stars? This was a fabulous gem. While it did not have a tv, the foosball table provided entertainment instead. Kitchen was well stocked with all the essentials."
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Easily one of the best places we’ve stayed at, if anyone is looking for a quiet place to stay this is what you’re looking for. The owners are very welcoming and helpful, the place was clean and stocked with almost anything you could need. Our night spent here was amazing and we can’t wait to come back!!! (quick note, the cake is to die for, I had to bring some home for the fam!!!)"

2022-05-01,5.0,Group trip,"Awesome place! Great hosts! That coffee cake is no joke! My wife thought it was really cute and as she puts it ""Pinterest Worthy"". Came with friends and we ate that coffee cake in one go! If they shipped out that cake I'd order it. ☕🍰"

2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Wonderful place to stay! We enjoyed it very much. We would definitely recommend it to anyone wanting a quiet place in the country!
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Absolutely amazing place. The pictures do not do it justice. You’ll have to see it in person. They’ve done such a great job Turning this space into a home away from home. It’s very cozy and they have everything you need to be comfortable. And the coffee cake was amazing. Don’t overthink this place just book it you won’t be disappointed.
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is excellent and brand new property. The owner is very friendly and communicative guy oriented to do everything for you. You will find water, fruits, oil, cheese, selection of sauces in the refrigerator and signature cinnamon pie on the table so if you arrived without visiting a store you will survive. The first floor is traditional with top quality of everything: from refrigerator-washer/dryer to lines and mattress. On the second floor you will find a sort of sophisticated country style design. Have you ever seen chandelier made from old spring mattress? :-) You will also find kids corner on the second floor and table football to play. The location is 1 h drive from beaches of crowded Sarasota and not very far from Orlando and other destinations in Central Florida. Perfect peaceful retreat both for businessman and family tired from big city."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Miss it already! We loved everything about the Tiny Home. The home was very clean and well taken care of.

2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Had a wonderful time!!
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is a cute and peaceful little place. We did cut our trip short due to the beds being too firm for us to sleep on. This was our first tiny house adventure and we ultimately decided we are not tiny home people. Kelli was a great host, extremely helpful & responsive. The property is beautiful and the stars are so bright in the night sky!! We also were able to build a nice fire in the fire pit. I also appreciated the sharp knife in the drawer, as most knives in airbnbs are very dull. Although we would not stay here again, we would definitely recommend it for tiny home lovers who are also okay with a firm bed and can climb a steep ladder (if you’re needing the upstairs beds) and get yourself down backwards. Thank you!"
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Wonderful spot in a beautiful private location. We used this for overflow sleeping for a party we were having in the area. Highly recommend this and the host!!!!

2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"What a hidden jewel! We had such a lovely time and I would definitely want to stay there again if I’m ever in the area. Very clean, cute, homey, good a/c (which was on and ready for us), no pesky bugs, every detail covered. We lacked for nothing. I just wished I’d had a pen so I could sign their guest book! This is a charming place to stay and you won’t be disappointed."
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Great relaxing moment in the middle of nature and animals.

2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Was in the country for some bird watching and this was the perfect place to crash for the night. Especially enjoyed getting to feed the chickens and heating the cows moo!
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Cute and quiet little place. Definitely a nice place to stay if you are looking to get out of the city and enjoy nature for a few days. The owner is very responsive and was helpful with everything and anything we needed. My daughter and i especially enjoyed all of her animals. We did visit with the goats and chickens and fed them. A few things to note:
1. The shower is located outside. I personally did not mind this, especially because we were enjoying a lot of nature activities so we were probably better off getting cleaned up out there. My daughter is quite bashful on the other hand, so she was a little nervous about it. It was little chilly too because of the cold front. There wasn't mention of the outside shower so i couldn't warn her of it before hand.
2. the upstairs beds are a little tough to get to, so i would say you need to be a bit agile if you intend on sleeping up there. I expected this so we had no issue."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Very cute place if you love the outdoors like we do! Quiet and peaceful place to go relax ! Host is fast at responding messages! Everything went so smooth, we hope to come back one day! Thanks"
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Kelli reached out to us very quickly to ensure we had clear directions. Great stay and our toddler loved feeding all the farm animals. Kelli left us food for fish, goats, and chickens."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We wanted to stay a night at Kelli’s beautiful tiny house. We didn’t think she’d answer that quickly, because we made the booking at night, but she did! She reacted really fast and was very communicative, helpful. Thanks to her and her cozy house we could spend a night in a wonderful and peaceful place which’s felt just like home. We arrived at night and we could find the house really easy. Self-check in, and privacy was really good. When we woke up and stepped out of the house we just saw that we’re surrounded with many animals like cows, goats, dogs, chicken. Even with a little lake in front of the house. Felt like that good place to be!
Thank you Kelli, we really enjoyed our stay.
Dora & Zsolt"

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We absolutely loved this tiny home and didn't want to leave. We found joy in so many aspects of it; goats on 1 side and cows on the other. cute little pond in the front, we loved just sitting on the porch that morning that we were there. Also, a great sitting area on the cow side and an outdoor shower, fire pit, and a hammock on the goat side, lol. There was plenty of coffee grounds and sugar and creamer, even little snacks were left for us- which we really appreciated as we didn't get to this place until 4am because we just got MARRIED the night before. I definitely saved it in my maps! thank u again, Kelli!"

The kids enjoyed the property, animals, fire pit, making s'mores, the outdoor shower, sitting in the surf shack at night looking at the stars and didn't miss the TV lol. We would stay again."
2023-07-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,.
2023-07-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"Atypical accommodation that matches the photos, very cute, clean and well-equipped tinyhouse for 2 people . We loved the outdoor shower, the funny toilet. On the other hand, be careful: access to mezzanines is not easy (Meunier ladders with wheels)with very reduced ceiling height. We were however disappointed by the exteriors that did not correspond to the photos: almost empty pond and its surroundings seemed to be under construction. On the other hand, very beautiful view of the neighboring farm and its herd. As far as the animals we only saw 2 goats in a pen. Peaceful place."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Beautiful place

The Host was respectful, helpful.
I would stay here again We plan to make this a get away for years to come.
If the host was ever to sell this I WOULD TRY AND BUY IT!
WORTH the money, very rare find!"

2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The perfect mini home!
My friends and I stayed for a night and had the time of our lives. It was the perfect size for the three of us and the atmosphere was top notch. We sat outside in the quiet countryside and had much needed time away from the hustle and bustle of the world.
We woke up to complete peace and quiet and said good morning to the chickens, goats and the cows next door. I didn’t want to leave.
We will be renting again and again for a little getaway!"
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The most important part of staying at an Airbnb, for me at least, is privacy. Kelli's place gave me that 100%. I never saw anybody, only cows, goats and chickens. From her listed pictures, I was dying to get into that paddle boat as it was an extremely hot day. But the size of the pond was too small for a paddleboat. Easy check in. The tiny house was adorable and had everything I needed. The cold outdoor shower was perfect after a long hot day seeing the sights of Arcadia. There was a hot plate and a small fridge. I slept on the downstairs daybed because I couldn't make it up the ladder stairs to the upstairs beds. In town, I ate at the Yellow Deli which was perfect. I biked Morgan Park along the Peace River and then went out to Soloman's Castle for a 2 hour tour of the property. After checking out, I drove 1/2 hour to the Peace River Sculpture Gardens in Punta Gorda. Nice trip, nice private stay. Thanks Kelli!"

2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,My daughter and I love tiny house's! This is one of our faves and close to home so BONUS! The goats and chickens added to the country feel we live so much! The fire pit was awesome and she had plenty of wood for us to use! I want to go back with my nieces and nephews because the loft really makes the place spacious. The outside shower was wonderful with the sun shining down! We will definitely back! Kelli is an excellent host!
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This place was perfect for what we were looking for. Sooo cute. Kelly was very responsive and everything was in place when we got there.

2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"If you need an escape from city life to find some peace or if you want to write that novel without any distractions, then you won't find a better location. However I will say you will need a car to get to and grocery store, restaurants etc.
Also, if you love nature and wildlife, it's outside your door. The house is equipped with a fridge and hot plate. I would definitely go back again but with a car."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Place was great and clean

Karen and David were an absolute joy to talk with. Wish we had been able to spend more time getting to know them!"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Karen and Dave were awesome people! If you’re looking for a place to relax and unwind this place is a must.

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Karen was very helpful making it easy to get in since my flight was delayed and I arrived after midnight. Although we haven't met in person yet she was very responsive to any texts and offered to help while I was there. It is a beautiful setting - peaceful and I enjoy being out in the country.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,I was glad to come and rest in this house
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I really enjoyed my time there. I was even able to bring my aunt, who has dementia and lives in an assisted living facility, out to spend the day. We were able to bake cookies and feel like she got to be ""home"" Since I live in Ohio I really appreciated the chance to provide a meaningful visit for my aunt.
And the water lilies were just gorgeous!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great stay. Wouldn’t be surprised if I make it back there again.
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Property was beautiful and peaceful. The hosts were extremely friendly and we felt right at home for our stay. Will most definitely stay there again next time I am in Arcadia!!

2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"A friendly place with friendly cats and dogs outside. Karen and Dave provide a very nice place for you stay, and are there if you need something."
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Staying at Karen’s and David’s was very relaxing. Unfortunately Karen wasn’t there so we didn’t get the chance to meet her but David was very accommodating and was very enjoyable to talk to! I really appreciated they’re flexibility with us and letting us and my friends enjoy their beautiful property!
2023-03-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"A beautiful, tranquil location overlooking a lily pond/lake. Karen was welcoming and could not have been kinder or more helpful when my husband fell ill during our stay. We slept really well in the country air. The only problem for us was the standard of cleaning, which we shared with Karen on arrival. I won’t list details here, it does not feel fair to do so. The kitchen lacked basic equipment- an oven tray for example and glasses. (There were jam jars instead.) Karen put most of this down to ‘being in the country’. Overall, we enjoyed our stay. If you are looking for a beautiful location and peaceful getaway, you will find it here."
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My husband & I, and 2 cousins just ended our weekend at David & Karen's 2 bedroom Country Home in Arcadia, Florida. We went there to help another family member nearby whose home was almost destroyed in the hurricane. We spent a lot of time helping & visiting them. But when we were at Karen's home, we absolutely LOVED it there. It was a beautiful home, just as described, and was in a beautiful country setting. There were very friendly dogs & cats living on the property, and It was so peaceful to sit out on the porch when we were there. It also had a beautiful pond in front of it. Next door was a horse & cattle ranch, and it was awesome to sit and watch them. It had everything we needed to feel just like we were at home relaxing! David & Karen were very friendly, helpful & inviting! We would definitely stay there again! Definitely a 5-star choice!! Thank you!"
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Karen and David were friendly and available.
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"If you're looking for a quiet getaway in this part of Florida, you've come to the right address. It's a cozy and sufficiently spacious place, with front porch overlooking a little pond within a large property. Great for relaxing and unwinding. The hosts, David and Karen, are wonderful and will help you with ideas about local attractions and anything else you need."
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very homey! Karen was super friendly and we were greeted at the gate! Very friendly animals it felt like home!
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My wife and I were looking for a private, peaceful and out of the way place without the hustle of the city and full of crowds, and we found it in David and Karen's two-bedroom cottage. This place is a gem hidden in the countryside of Arcadia, away from the bustle yet close enough to get to Sarasota and surrounding areas without a problem. Surrounded by horses, enjoying morning coffee out on the porch, fresh air, great way to start your morning. The cottage is equipped with all the amenities you will need for a short, or an extended stay. The hosts live on the premises and the cottage is away from the main home, with lots of privacy. Although we did not have the pleasure of meeting Karen who was away while we were there, she was extremely responsive in communicating throughout the entire time we were there. Her husband David was on the premises and could not have been more helpful throughout our stay. If you are in this area, and want a peaceful, quite escape, this is the place."
2023-02-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Nice private with a pond. Not quite as nice as pictured inside, furniture drab and cabinets could have been cleaner. Host was friendly and all in all we enjoyed the serenity. Loved that it was in the country and private and serene."

2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This is a very comfortable place to stay. Inside had all I needed and a nice set up. The yard was interesting. I loved the cats and dogs roaming around. There is a good sized Lilly pond with fish and benches. I enjoyed the swing too. The location was on the Fort Myers side of Arcadia - an easy drive. I would definitely stay here again.

2023-11-01,5.0,Group trip,"Our family loves this place! This was the second Thanksgiving family reunion we have had there. We have been blessed with beautiful weather both times. We love the beautiful, natural surroundings. Some of our family enjoys fishing and most of us did a little kayaking and canoeing on the calm, peaceful river. This place appeals to our family members because we all live nearby so some are able to run home to tend to animals. We brought our own firewood and had great times sitting around the campfire at night telling stories, reconnecting, and roasting marshmallows."

2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Oh wow! This was one of our favorite Airbnb experiences ever!The home was nicely set up with the bedrooms around a central living room. It was clean and the rooms and bathrooms were nicely appointed. The thing I want to rave about is the property! It's right on a small river with kayaks, boats and canoes provided. Canoeing down the river was a magical experience! We hung out on the dock, enjoyed the wildlife and even had a campfire one night. So many memories made! :)"
2022-02-01,5.0,Group trip,"The building is clean with lots of space. I would recommend swapping a few of the bunk beds for full or queen beds and add better seating for meals. The building sleeps 16, but the only table to eat at seats 2. Overall it's a great place to gather a family."

2022-01-01,5.0,Group trip,Very clean. If you’re looking to get away from the city and the daily routine this would be a great location it is very secluded.
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,The whole experience for us and our children and grandchildren was amazing! From plenty of space for sleeping to the quiet river complete with kayaks and canoes we enjoyed every minute of it. We roasted hotdogs and marshmallows at the fire pit for our cozy evenings. Perfect place for a family Christmas!
2021-11-01,5.0,Group trip,"Marc & Meagan are true Super Hosts! Our family of 14 spent our annual inter-generational Thanksgiving reunion at their cabin. This place is perfect for nature lovers. Our family enjoyed kayaking, fishing, and evening gatherings around the firepit. Marc and Meagan were quick to respond to any questions we had and were more than willing to accommodate our special requests. Our family is already talking about coming back next year. This is an excellent place to have a family gathering, a church retreat, or a club event. We recommend it highly."

2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Highly recommend this place it was awesome!
2021-06-01,5.0,Group trip,"A few friends and I booked this spot on a whim, looking for someplace close by to us where we could go and relax for a weekend and unwind. It looked like the perfect location on Airbnb, but the photos do not do it justice. We showed up in the late afternoon on Friday, and were greeted by Marc who gave us a quick tour and a little history of the property. The cabin has been recently remodeled and Marc and Meagan did a fantastic job! Everything was clean and comfortable, there was plenty of space for all of us to spread out and relax. The showers were hot, even after we all had showered after being in the river. The AC was cold, and each room had a fan and plenty of blankets to make everyone comfortable.
But the real thing that makes this place shine isn't the cabin, as great as it is, its the land and the river that the cabin is on. Marc and Meagan were happy to let us use the kayaks and paddle boards that they have, along with life jackets if we needed them. The property is on an offshoot of the Peace River, but its only a quick 5 minute kayak out to the peace river. You could easily bring a boat or your own paddle boards and have a great day out on the water! Marc and Meagan also set up a firepit right near the water, away from the other cabin that happened to have a family staying in it while we were there. The space around the pit had plenty of room for us to set up lawn games like cornhole and kanjam, and we were able to have fires both nights late into the night without having to worry. This was the perfect space for us to hang out and relax during our weekend! We will absolutely be coming back, and could not recommend this place enough! Marc and Meagan are perfect hosts, and even let us feed their goats while we were there! While we were there to hang out and relax, this space would be perfect for a family getaway, a reunion, or just a quick weekend on the water."
2021-06-01,5.0,Group trip,"Mark and Meagan are amazing hosts. Our family enjoyed kayaking, fishing and making smores at night. They loved petting and feeding the goats. We would definitely love to come back for another family getaway!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Jessica’s Airbnb was what we needed for a short trip to Arcadia! It was a very comfortable and clean Camper with plenty of amenities. The hot tub was perfect for relaxing after a long day of fossil hunting. We would definitely return in the future.
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"along with my star ratings, I just want to ask how respectful and helpful the hosts are, but the photos and entire experience is not really something I think I can put into words."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The place is exactly as described. Jessica's attention to detail is off the charts. Extremely comfortable along with the addition of pleasure amenities makes this place one of a kind. I would certainly reccomend to others as well as return.
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Wonderful, personally designed and a great vibe !!! We loved our stay, all the amenities and the COOL pool .... Great stay in Arcadia will return soon !!!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Incredibly warm space with a beautiful backdrop. Loved being able to walk the property and experience a little ‘farm life’ and watch the sunset close to the lake.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Very welcoming!
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,We chose Stephanie's place because it was only a few short minutes from the venue where my son was getting married (King's Crossing Ranch) and the property looked so beautiful. The home and grounds were perfect but am so sad that we didn't really have time to enjoy the beautiful and peaceful surroundings because of our busy weekend festivities. My kids at least got to pick some of the fresh blueberries before we left and said the area down by the river was beautiful. We'd really love to return when we can just relax and take it all in. Stephanie was an amazing hostess and I really appreciated the kind note she left upon our arrival. We will be back!
2024-03-01,5.0,Group trip,Great stay!

2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"My husband and I had the pleasure of staying at Stephanie and Jodie's amazing home for 2 months. We can't imagine a more lovely, peaceful and pleasant place to spent the winter months. The hosts and their families are literally the kindest, nicest, loveliest people you could ever dream of meeting. The property is absolutely stunning...we spent many a day out in the screened porch or down by the river. The kitchen is easy to cook in, the shower is wonderful, and the home is well laid out. It's close to Arcadia as well as Punta Gorda, Ft Meyers as well as close to Mayakka Park and many other amazing preserves and rivers.
If you are thinking of booking this place, just do it! You won't regret it!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Group trip,"I’m not good with reviews!
My crew went down to Florida for a Job that was more then a month stay and this place was by far the best place for my crew, it’s a very relaxing and comfy place to be at and Stephanie was awesome she communicated with us back-and-forth, and her brother-in-law was so awesome with the crew and very welcoming. I will definitely keep this place in mind if we go back down for another job."
