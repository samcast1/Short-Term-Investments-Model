The layout is nice, as the bedroom is in the back and away from the noise on the busy main street. We slept well despite how loud it was on the road. We enjoyed the comfy living room, and we utilized the kitchen to make a late night dinner when we arrived. I suggested to Brian that he add some baking sheets, and he promptly responded saying that he would. He is an incredibly responsive host -- he was even available at 10pm when we had trouble gaining entry to the apartment using the Yale lock. In addition, we brought our dog, and it was so nice to have him with us at Brian's apartment on our little getaway. We appreciated that accommodation and Brian's apparent love for animals. :) If we are ever in Albany again, we would consider staying at Brian's place again!"

Big apartment
Massive bed üò¥
Really good independent bar/restaurants within min walk"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This place was one of the nicest airbnb I‚Äôve stayed in. Only thing was the upstairs neighbors were extremely noisy and woke me out of my sleep a couple times but otherwise an amazing place to stay.
2023-09-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"The location is great: two blocks from Washington Park, a ten-minute walk to the Capitol and the Mall. lively scene and many restaurants"
2023-09-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"We had a very short stay but this was a nice place for what we needed. We enjoyed the decor, it had a nice ambiance. Comfy bed!"
2023-09-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Good value and proximity to Manhattan via Amtrak. Close to Upstate NY beauty, plus VT & MA via car (liked Enterprise‚Äôs Central location as a rental). We got a temporary resident parking pass from host but wasn‚Äôt tough finding parking in general. Walking distance to grocery, liquor, food (liked Nyx Bakery, Villa de Como - Brewtus is a 10min drive but best coffee in area).
Lark can be noisy (and the scene may not be for everyone) but back bedroom seemed quiet to us and there are many drink spots etc a short walk away.
Host responsive with some good recommendations on travel tips.
Internet was out part of the trip but he kept on the IP company until it was resolved (good cell reception there as backup).
Can‚Äôt speak to the kitchen it terms of cooking (we ate out) but would probably serve basic needs.
NOTE ‚Äì careful walking down to the front door ‚Äì hit my head on the concrete overhang under the stoop (and I‚Äôm short) - the sun was in my eyes and didn‚Äôt see it in time."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Great communication, clean, and flexible! Unit was cute and exactly like described."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,One of my favorite places to stay locally when I need to get inspired enough to write! It's on a busy street so it's super convenient to everything and yet it's private enough to feel like you're enveloped inside your mother's womb. Definitely staying here again.
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Brian was very helpful and helped arrange convenient parking which was great since my arrival was close to dark. I would stay here again without hesitation.
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place was perfect for a week in Albany. Super close to great restaurants and Washington park, but also Brian was super helpful and the place was very cozy, neat, and had everything I needed for my stay. I would definitely book this stay again."

2023-08-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,"Brian was a great host. Very responsive and helpful. The apartment is comfortable, spacious, nicely decorated and with comfortable furniture. We could see a garden like area out the back window but we could not find access to it. There was plenty of light, and the apartment was cool even without the air conditioning. We felt secure in the neighborhood, and it had a lot of interesting architecture and restaurants/bars. There is a beautiful, very large park nearby within easy walking distance. There was a fair presence in the neighborhood of people who seemed either on or in need of drug treatment but other than asking for small donations they were in no way threatening. Brian helped us obtain permit parking near the apartment and that was very helpful. We would recommend this apartment to other airbnb guests who are comfortable in an urban setting."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The unit is not a basement apartment, but just three steps below grade, the windows open to the outside should you want fresh air.

I felt right at home even while working away from home."

We had no idea what to expect about the neighborhood, not being familiar with New York, but were pleasantly surprised to find so many fun bars and restaurants within walking distance. Host was also very responsive and helpful throughout the whole process. Highly recommend!"
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Perfect spot for us. Walking distance to Everything. Great little spots on Lark st And Washingtons. Brian was Great to communicate with both before and during our stay. I highly recommend

2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We had such a lovely stay here! It was my first time renting an AirBNB and Brian was awesome with communicating all the way through with instructions or if I needed help with anything! The apartment was super cute, clean, and cozy! There‚Äôs a lot of different restaurants nearby that I definitely want to check out more when we come back next! Thank you for hosting us!"
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This place is nice. It‚Äôs a big apartment with a comfortable bed, full bath, full kitchen, and a separate living room. It‚Äôs in a great location with 10+ restaurants within 1-2 blocks. It‚Äôs also located close enough to walk downtown if you wish to do so. Parking was easy for me (free, and right outside the front door). It was pretty quiet throughout the night, so I slept well. The host was good about communicating before and during my stay."
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We had a wedding in Albany and this was a great place to stay. Very close to restaurants and Washington Park for close by activities!
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Nice place, clean, easy to get into, spacious"
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Brian's brownstone basement was anything but ""basementy"": bright, nicely decorated and lit, spacious, and clean--exactly like the photos! A few blocks from Washington Park (great for walking or running), Lark Street is filled with cafes, restaurants, and bars and only a few minutes from some other good eats: Shining Rainbow (be adventurous and try their beef and bitter melon), Cafe Cappricio (try their grilled octopus, their filetto di pomodoro, and a martini), and Copper Crow (order the pupusas with the aji verde to share and the street corn pasta--then put some of the aji verde on the pasta!). Oh, enough about restaurants: Brian's place has free streaming (I finally got to see SOUL on Disney+), a Keurig, excellent soaps, and everything you'd need to dine in if you wanted (but don't: got to Cafe Cappricio especially!). My only complain was, well, the ice tray has the TINIEST ice cubes ever lol. Enjoy your stay!"
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Great place for a quick stop in Albany on the way to Vermont. Clean, safe and Brian was a communicative helpful host. Bed was super comfortable."

2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This is a great place to stay in the Albany NY area. Brian is an amazing host who communicates with you before and during your stay to make sure the whole process is seamless and straightforward. The check in and out process couldn‚Äôt have been easier and the rental itself is accurate with the pictures. It is a very nice place to stay with a location offering many places to eat, drink, and shop all within walking distance."
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Very nice gem location in a great neighborhood in Albany, super close to everything you may want to do while here. Loved our stay!"
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"This place was a cute oasis in the middle of a beautiful city. The house was decorated to feel usable yet chic. The bed was comfy, the apartment was always cool. I loved being on the bottom floor as it gave us access to the action going on above us, people watching. Our dog also loved the space and enjoyed walking a little bit to the park. The type of people living in the neighborhood was diverse and accepting. Friendly.
Most important was the owner. He was so available to us to answer any questions or help us in any way possibly. I mean IMMEDIATELY. So customer service was impeccable. We came in with our luggage, and never once had to buy tp, paper towels, or even water or coffee. I would stay here again. The last best thing was the day we left all we had to do is turn off the lights and air, and leave. That‚Äôs it. No stress over closing rules. ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è"
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great location. There‚Äôs a lot within walking distance and even more a short drive away. Brian is a great host. Super responsive. And the apartment was cozy. It was just what we needed for our getaway.
2022-07-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Good location and cute basement apt!
2022-07-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is a clean and pleasant basement apartment in central Albany. Plusses: the living is large, and the bed is large and comfortable, as is the bathroom. The A/C (in the bedroom) worked fine on two hot nights. As you'd expect, while there are windows there is not lots of natural light. The least welcoming area is the kitchen/dining nook which is very small. There is a good sized refrigerator, an electric stove and oven, a tea kettle (yea!) and good selection of green (and a few other) teas as well as a coffee maker. There are glasses and tableware, but not a lot. The table is the tiniest table for two I have evmer seen at an Airbnb, and the kitchen has virtually no counterspace. (Drying dishes have to go in front of the microwave, blocking access.) When we had a takeout dinner (from an Indian restaurant on the same street a couple of blocks away) we had to use the stove burners (not hot!) as a serving area as there literally was not room on the table for two plates, two glasses, and more than a very small plate of food. This was inconvenient, but not terrible. The neighborhood has a lot of activity -- many restaurants (Indian, Chinese, Mexican, vegan, etc within a few blocks), bars, a Ben an Jerry's all within a couple of blocks. It is just over one block to the large and well kept Washington Park...great for walks or just sitting; there was a market there on Sat AM. Apparently parking can be an issue -- we had no trouble pulling in on a Fri. evening in July getting a spot on the block of the apartment. However, from what I saw on signs, there is a two hour parking limit during working hours on weekdays (M-F) so if you are there during those days (not evenings) you may need to move to a paid lot."
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great value. Very central location. Stayed one night to visit friends. Would stay again if we‚Äôre in town.
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Spacious, recently renovated basement apartment on a busy downtown street.

2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Such an amazing place! It is absolutely adorable and comfy! Brian has been the absolute best host I've had to date....he proactively checked in with me to make sure all was well....it was! üòÄ He also responded timely. My one recommendation to anyone renting this place is to plan parking at the Trinity Church parking lot right on Lark street. It's less than two blocks from the place. Only $6 for 10 hours....very reasonable. I would stay here again if I'm in the area.
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"This apartment was very nice, and Brian was extremely responsive and helpful! I don‚Äôt think we would stay in this neighborhood again, but that is just a personal preference - the Airbnb was perfect.

We were surprised how quiet their place was considering it is in the city. Their eclectic style and great use of space was fun. The cleanliness of the place was very much appreciated. We enjoyed their back patio area. The late morning/all afternoon sun was a great place to take a nap.

As soon as we entered the property we felt at home. Very serene and private. Lots of little touches, music playing upon entry, wine offering and if needed Todd was available for any questions and was friendly and professional. A gorgeous little patio, We had to travel to Albany for business and really did not have the time to fully enjoy the property and location. It is close to Lark St with many eclectic shops and restaurants. Close to the capital where we had business. Just a lovely homey private retreat to ""come home"" to after a day of advocacy at the Capital. We will definitely return!!! Thanks so very much Todd and Pan"

2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Everything was perfect! Such a cute, clean, and convenient apartment!"
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Todd and Pan's place was such a nice, peaceful, respite after my long days. I was in town attending a conference at the Albany Capital Center which I assume hosts many conferences and weddings. Their place was in a great location. Restaurants and bars are right around the corner and it was only a 15-minute walk from the Capital Center. It was so nice to walk through the Empire State Plaza every morning and even coming back late at night I felt safe as a single woman walking alone. The apartment is only a 15-minute bus ride from the Amtrak station and I'd guess less than a 10-minute Uber ride. There are bodegas right around the corner and a larger supermarket a few blocks away. Todd and Pan obviously put a ton of effort into keeping their place clean, cozy, and well-decorated. Higher-end finishes like newer stainless steel appliances and granite countertops really make this place shine! They have everything you could possibly need. I didn't use it much during my stay but the kitchen was fully stocked with pots and pans and the like. They have a mini ironing board plus iron, a mini 4-cup coffee pot, an Alexa for music to get ready to, a GIANT TV in the bedroom, and a smaller Roku tv in the kitchen/living area. Check-in was easy with the code they sent the day before I arrived, and the basement entrance was well lit. Todd was quick to respond when I had any questions. Such a lovely place! I will definitely try to stay here again for my annual conference!"
2022-10-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"Todd's listing is quite charming and just as pictured. The unit was clean, really nicely decorated, and the kitchen is pretty well equipped. The cute little garden in the back is a bonus! Parking was not too much of an issue - we stayed over a weekend and easily found a spot down the street. There is a grocery store, plus a few restaurants and bars within walking distance. Great place to stay if you're visiting Albany."

2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The place was just too perfect. Everything I needed was available to me and Todd was very quick to respond to any questions I had.

2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Clean and fully equipped, this apartment is just a short walk to a supermarket, great coffee, and lots of restaurants/bars. From the Amtrak station, bus #114 is practically door-to-door. The hosts are often working from home, which is right upstairs, and they respond to messages immediately. A minor battery problem was fixed very soon after I contacted them. I‚Äôve stayed here twice, both times over a week. Without doubt, this will be my go-to place in Albany."

2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Amtrak perfect. Besides 100% recommend and agreement with other reviewers (super clean!), the location is ideal for rail travelers. Bus 114 will take you from the Amtrak station to just a very short block from the apartment (cdta . org). It‚Äôs on a residential block, but great coffee, plenty of restaurants, and a decent supermarket are all within five minute walks. It suited my needs so perfectly, I‚Äôve booked the apartment for a return visit."

There are great local bars and restaurants on the adjacent blocks, and it's right up the hill from the free NY State Museum and very cool Empire Plaza. Washington park is also right there, perfect for us and our pups to stretch our legs. The space was clean, easy to access, full of amenities (including a hosts wine selection for purchase!) and communication was fast and easy. There is a reason this place stays booked. As a frequent AirBNB'er I highly recommend this spot!"

2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Todd and Pan were the best hosts! The apartment is comfy and cozy and had everything we needed for our stay. Todd and Pan were both easy to communicate with and the check-in/out process was exceptionally smooth. We hope to stay here whenever we‚Äôre in the Albany area!
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Great customer service, clean well kept apartment"
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This was such a lovely little garden apartment. Todd and Pan thought of everything, from a variety of coffees and creamers to fragrant flowers in the private garden! It was spotlessly clean and felt fresh as well as cozy and personal. The location is great, a couple blocks from the Capital Center and part of an historic brownstone neighborhood filled with hip little shops, cafes and restaurants. Todd responded instantly with my questions and was so gracious. Our experience staying here was the best of what one expects from an air BnB."
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Todd was an amazing host, going above and beyond to make sure I felt welcomed and comfortable.
The check in process is easy, with a keypad lock on the door for convenience.
The inside of the space is newly renovated, well decorated, well furnished, and clean.
I would recommend this place to any solo travelers or couples."

Palle and Laura"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Ed's place exceeded my expectations. My room was cozy with a workspace and armchair, blackout shades, and a queen sized bed with probably the most comfortable mattress I've ever slept on. The shared bathroom, which I had all to myself, was spotless and updated (the house is old but the fixtures and vanity, etc., are all new).
As a host, Ed was extremely kind. On arrival, he carried my bag upstairs and showed me my room, gave several suggestions regarding nearby eateries I could walk to, and offered me one of their umbrellas to use as it was pouring rain outside. Both Ed and his wife were wonderful hosts, and would definitely stay with them again!
My only caution to guests arriving by car: do take note of which days you can park overnight on each side of the street. I didn't realize it alternated (I stayed 2 nights) and ended up with a parking ticket the morning of my departure. Ow!"
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Anne and Ed have a lovely home and they made me feel very comfortable. The location is peaceful yet close to everything.
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Very nice, neat, historic house in a safe neighborhood. Ed is a good communicator, and has a nice family. Would recommend his place"
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Amazing value for the price! Ed and wife are very friendly and will help you with whatever you need during your stay. The room is larger than appears in the pictures, quite pretty and with plenty of light. Bathroom is shared but kept very clean and accessibility was never an issue at all. Highly recommend!"
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place.
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was a great stay. 15min walk to AMC and free parking. The house was very beautiful. The hosts communicated very timely and kindly. I was able to easily self-check-in and self-check-out. The room I was in was the right size for a single traveler. There was a TV w/ Roku and free WiFi. The bathroom was good too. Overall, a 5/5 experience for me. Recommend it."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Had a great stay at Ed‚Äôs. The room was comfy and cozy and the location is convenient. Always a pleasure chatting with Ed or his wife when we cross paths. I‚Äôd definitely recommend staying with Ed if you‚Äôre looking for a bedroom accommodation in the capital district.
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,If you are an Excelsior student visiting Albany Med for clinicals this is the airbnb. The hosts are use to traveling nurses and physicians. The home is clean and spacious. The home is a ten minute walk and about five minute drive to the hospital. Secure entry and exit throughout duration of my stay. If you don‚Äôt mind the hostel aspect of it great place to stay overall.
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We were warmly welcomed by Ed and his wife. The room was as shown in the picture and sparkling clean. The bed slept great! Nice shower and very nice that we were allowed to use the washing machine/dryer and were allowed to cook in their kitchen. All with nothing but praise for this host!
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Ed and Anne were gracious hosts in a quiet safe neighborhood. I had nice conversations with both of them separately as Anne was there for the first part of my stay and Ed was there for the second part of my stay. They also lived in the house which made communication much easier.
All the guest bedrooms were on the second floor and I stayed in room 2. I shared the bathroom with another guest in room 4, but that wasn't a problem as it was mostly free when I needed it. Since I've been traveling for awhile, it was nice that they let me use their washer and dryer. The kitchen was useful for heating up my leftovers as well.
I chose this home because it was affordable and right in-between two places that I needed to get to so that made it centrally located for me. There were a number of neighborhood restaurants to choose from about a 5-minute walk away and I ate at two of them."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very kind host and beautiful neighborhood. I would highly recommend.
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,I really enjoyed my stay here while I was visiting for a conference. Ed and his wife were responsive to my questions. It was very clean as well and in a convenient area. Would definitely recommend

2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"My stay was just what was needed, as well as where and when needed.
My husband was hospitalized at Albany Medical Center. I wish I had discovered the stay sooner. The home was a very short drive and a 15 min walk from the hospital. The cost was affordable for long hospital admissions, definitely a reasonable alternative to local hotels.
Ed and Anne were friendly, empathic and helpful. Their home was a restful, beautiful look into the past and a pleasant distraction from present circumstances."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Home away from home. The best place to stay. Close to Albany med. worthy of every penny. They are very caring, friendly and humble."

There were 2 friendly dogs that were so cute and quiet but they have their own space away from the bedroom area..
Parking is easy, the Smart TV was of a good use and the bed was so comfortable.
If you were interviewing for residency or MD interview at Albany medical center, that‚Äôs the place to go way cheaper than the Hilton and as comfortable as you get from staying at a 2.5+ star hotel"
2020-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I stayed at Ed's place when I came to do a second look at Albany Medical Center in January. I can understand the frustration of finding a place on where to stay. I highlighted Ed's place in a pros and cons list to make it easier as to why you should stay here.
PROs:
- Actually a 7-8 minute walk to AMC. A lot of places on AirBNB will say it's a 10-minute walk, and they certainly were not a 10-minute walk. Also, Ed's place is safe to walk to and from AMC as it's on the main road and is well lit.
- Ample street parking
- Super clean
- Quiet
- Two little dogs which are super playful. Don't worry about the noise, as I didn't even hear them the entire time.
CONS:
- None"

The room had a physical key, but was not where it was listed in the check-in mail from Thomas. (in a drawer, not in the door or closet) Again, Thomas was there quickly to help me find the key.

2024-02-01,2.0,Stayed a few nights,"Door lock was faulty & only locked from the inside from day 1-2 that left me feeling unsafe with my personal belongings exposed in my assigned bedroom, especially I was next to an inconsiderate guest who was boisterously loud and played her music so loud even past midnight. The 2nd night while I was trying to get some sleep, I knocked on her door to please turn her music down and she instead threatened me to shut up or else. I checked out the next night after."
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"It was a pleasant stay. I had a beautiful sunrise every morning outside my window. It felt home in the kitchen and dinning area, very tastefully decorated. Has an antic feel to it. Lovely wood work in the house :). Loved walking around the house in the mornings."

2023-12-01,2.0,Stayed about a week,"I had an OK time there. But always felt targeted. The host will pass by me and smile but the next thing I notice a negative review on my dashboard. I pressed for what may have happened to conjure such a review but they have no proof. All these started since I complained the Arctic was too cold. Only when some other guest and myself banded together on that floor to increase to 70F before we could sleep comfortably. And eversince, they run up to the app for the most flimpsy issues while smiling with me before writing the negative comments. This to me is callous and hypocritical. For example, I woke up one morning to see a review that I was loud overnight. I called Thomas and asked how could I be loud when I was asleep all night. I queried whether I was snoring and maybe that could be the meaning of being loud. He said it wasn't snoring that it was a ""hard"" noise. When pressed further, he couldn't explain but said guests told him.
As far as I'm concerned, it was an ok place"

Having the front porch was an excellent place to sit and relax, sitting areas and dining room very functional. Kitchen a bit small, but more than met our needs with relatively new and modern appliances - large refrigerator with ice maker and water dispenser, full-sized gas stove/oven, and a great Nespresso machine!!!!!! Full sized washer/dryer in enclosed back porch and very nice back entryway with easy access to off-street parking/driveway. Great for longer stays and when visiting family in Albany, will come back; along with recommend it to all our friends and family who need a very clean, convenient, and comfortable home!"

The ‚ÄúLittle Green House‚Äù was clean, comfortable and cozy. And it was well equipped with everything we needed. We especially appreciated the nice selections of tea and coffee. Ermenita is a great host, very communicative and helpful. Her place will be our first choice if our travels bring us back to Albany."

The kitchen was well equipped for cooking our meals and we appreciated having access to the laundry and driveway parking.

2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Such a gorgeous home! We were in Albany briefly for an early meeting at the Capitol building, and it was just an easy 10min drive away!

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,My sister and I had a nice 2 night stay. The house was spacious and had everything we needed. It's an older house but very charming and comfortable. Ermenita responded right away the one morning when the wifi needed to be reset and quickly got it working again. Great walkability to some nice local restaurants and a Stewart's convenience store.
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Ermenita's place is a little comfortable nest in between of the quiet city of Albany. It has been a short and pleasant experience for us as a guest. Ermenita has made sure that the place offers a very home-like vibe and has all amenities you may need for a short stay. The town is pretty quiet and laid-back with very few options to choose from to eat and do, but the comforts of the residence compensate for the shortcomings of the town. Thanks Ermenita, we will surely visit again!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Ermenita is absolutely the best. She answers so fast and if you have a concern about something in the house or need help her husband (also great) stops by as soon as they can which is very fast. It‚Äôs also so clean that if you try to look for dust you can‚Äôt! The sheets and bed are out of this world. It really feels like home. Will come back when in Albany.
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a great long weekend at Ermenita‚Äôs home. Check in was easy, the home was super clean and comfortable. We walked to a coffee shop and an amazing deli on the corner. The neighborhood was quiet and comfortable. Parking was great. Thank you for a great stay! We will definitely return."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We loved our stay at Ermenita's. It was a lovely home (and spotless), and there were lots of little touches that made our stay really comfortable - like a whole selection of tea and coffee, even oven mitts and tin foil which helped us to heat up the food we brought. Bathroom also had body wash, shampoo, and conditioner, and the towels were really fluffy. The neighbors across the street were having a party, which was a little bit loud, but the mattress was so comfortable that I felt right to sleep. We would for sure stay here again if the place is available when we come back next year. Ermenita herself was really responsive and helpful."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Ermenita was a lovely and friendly host and the house exceeded expectations. Every room was well appointed and the linens smelled delicious. We hope to make this our ‚Äúhome away from home‚Äù when we visit Albany.

The house is in a beautiful street and neighborhood, and just minutes away from restaurants. The host provided clear and easy instructions on how to get in. The minute you walk in, you feel at home! The kids immediately ran upstairs to pick their bedroom - which they both loved! The kitchen is very cute, clean and most importantly useful. Loved the small but private backyard! The host (Ermenita) was very helpful and responsive and gave some great recommendations. We can‚Äôt wait to come and stay at ‚ÄúThe Little Green House‚Äù again! Thank you for having us."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"I had the pleasure of staying at Ermenita‚Äôs Airbnb in Albany recently, and I must say it was great! First and foremost, the location of the Airbnb was truly outstanding. Situated in a prime area of Albany, it offered convenient access to local attractions, dining establishments, and shopping venues. Whether I wanted to explore the vibrant city center or take a leisurely stroll along the nearby New Scotland Ave everything was just a stone's throw away. The proximity to key points of interest truly enhanced my overall experience.
The communication with the host was exceptional.I traveled with two kids and we found the proximity to the local library, the Albany Art Room and the close by playground so much fun. The Italian deli right around the corner was a gun experience and the bus lines were right by the house too.
I cannot recommend this home enough and will surely return."

2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"John is a top notch AirBnB host. Great communication. Comfortable bed. Great location. His dog, a Golden Doodle, and cat, were very friendly and entertaining. If I had to stay in Albany again, John's place would be at the top of my list."

2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,John was an excellent host. His place is clean and very comfortable. He also took time to share with me suggestions for restaurants and shopping places. His cat Patches and new puppy Cookie were an added bonus for me. I was in town for a football game and it was conveniently located near the University of Albany. I would highly recommend staying with John if you are in the area.

2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Nice neighborhood, very quiet. Great communications with John. Simple room in his home, but super comfortable bed, small desk and nice shared bathroom that you would only share with the owner, who was basically invisible during my stay. Parking is on the street, but there is no problem with that as it is not well-traveled. I had a Jag and was not concerned at all."
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"If someone needs to go Albany, there's no better place to stay"

2021-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Lovely home
2021-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"John is a great guy. Really laid back and easy to get along with. The spot that he is in is ideal, if you have a car you can easily get around the Albany Area. The spot is close to Mass Transit but one would have to walk around. Overall if you are looking for a place to stay in Albany I would book with John. The location is within distance to the College of Saint Rose, which is great and also close to some places to eat. Highly recommend booking with John."
2021-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"John was a great host, he gave quick responses and was very accommodating with our check-in time. The location was a short drive to the downtown area and around 30 mins away from nice hiking spots. Definitely a good place to stay."

2020-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"John‚Äôs place was great. His ranch style home was in a fantastic, quiet location and was well taken care of. The bed was comfortable and the house was clean. The best part though? Patches the cat. That cat is an absolute treasure, I wish I could‚Äôve taken her with me. If you‚Äôre a cat lover, you gotta meet her.
Overall, staying at Johns place is well worth the price."
2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"It‚Äôs a really nice stay in John‚Äôs home, he is very kind, generous and friendly. The room is neat and cozy with king size bed.

2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,Had a great stay Allen was super hospitable flexibility and all around great host highly recommend a stay here if in the srea
2024-03-01,4.0,Stayed about a week,"Hi, Allen was very friendly and responsive. I used the place bc it was close to work however it was kind noisy with me hearing people argue outside. The building is fairly old so can't really blame him for that. It was rainy all weak and their was a leak in the barn doors of the room which woke me up from my sleep. I called and he was there right away. Barn doors aren't new so when pulling them closed light still came through opposite ends. I like total darkness so the light caused me to wake up early. Bring a long extension cord for additional outlets, I always pack mine so i plugged it from the bathroom to the bed. the layout of place is fairly old so the outlets are very few. The place got the job done for the week. Thanks Allen"
2024-02-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Allen was a responsive and friendly host! I would definitely stay with him again. The unit was clean and provided an easy check-in. The only unfortunate part of our stay was the smell of cigarette smoke in and around the bathroom. Allen explained to me it may have been previous tenants who broke the rules.
I think it may have been from people next door, but even with that unfortunate part of our stay our host was proactive with providing us candles to hide the smell. He even messaged me that he will be painting the unit after we leave to further rid the smell. In summary, it was our host that made our stay enjoyable!"
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great space clean love it I will book all the time
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Allen was a gracious host.
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Allen was very responsive, helpful, and friendly. The place was very clean and the kitchen and rest of the apartment had good amenities. The neighbors in the area were loud at times but it may have been because it was a holiday weekend and the semester just started. Otherwise, it was a very comfortable and cozy stay!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,Allen is the perfect host. We have stayed with him in the past and always exceeds expectations. If you are visiting Albany he is the first choice.
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Good stay, nice clean place."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great spot!
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Allen‚Äôs place is very nice, clean, new renovate, kitchen got what you need to make meals, 3 minutes from hospital which is fit our trip. Restaurants near by are great, the Y close by to work out. Allen‚Äôs responses and flexibility are exceed my expectation. Very impressed. We highly recommend Allen‚Äôs place."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"I loved it
He was very responsive and helpful
Definitely recommend staying here"
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"Allen was the most responsive, communicative and flexible host I‚Äôve ever dealt with on behalf of my husband! He was there on a business trip and had to extend the dates a couple of times, and Allen made it easy! Would highly recommend staying at any of his properties!"
2023-03-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Very clean, well kept. Never been to Albany, very old town and this neighborhood was like most in town. That said, good location to downtown for NCAA tournament so this worked well."
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Allen is a great host. Apartment was clean, spacious and centrally located. Will stay with him again."
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The place was perfect for what I needed it for. The Neibers were quiet and for being a busy street it was not that loud. The only inconvenience was the Thursday and Friday parking restrictions. Allen did inform me, so it didn't as a surprise. I would recommend his place to family and friends. He is a great host!"
2023-02-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"The host was very friendly and all the basic areas and linens were clean, but the place was pretty stuffy. None of the windows cleanly open and the screens were filthy and the fan blew dust when it turned on. Additionally, the mattress is so warped and lopsided, you can tell just by looking at it. Finally, there is a fire door that is taped shut that wasn't mentioned anywhere in the listing. It isn't actually sealed, just taped and the locks do not work. Although it doesn't seem to be functional from the outside, it kind of freaked me out the whole time. It would have been fine if there had been some kind of explanation about it and promise that it was sealed or something instead of trying to figure it out myself and assessing the layout of the building."
2023-02-01,3.0,Stayed over a week,Allen was a great host but the apartment wasn't that clean the refrigerator had things in it that expired two years ago he also has a no shoe policy in the house which is fine but as the host he should have somewhere to leave them other than the hallway my daughter had a pair of sneakers stolen out the hallway
2022-11-01,4.0,Stayed over a week,"Allen was a perfect host. We did have a circuit breaker needing reset a couple of times, Allen was very responsive to take care of it."

He always responds to messages immediately and checking in and out is handled very smoothly. The apartment is well supplied and spotless!... and it is right next a lovely park üòä
Enjoy your stay!"
2022-05-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Allen was a great host. He was quick to respond even at 1 am when we arrived and had trouble with the lockbox. His place is very spacious and clean with a big, comfy bed! Loved the high ceilings and crown molding. Had everything in the kitchen we needed. Great water pressure in the shower.
Only issues we had were the steps going up to the apartment...a bit uneven. Careful if you're not sure-footed. Also, the noise level in the area, as mentioned by others, was bothersome. Not sure how often they shoot off fireworks at midnight like they did during our stay. We didn't have a car, but street parking could be a bit challenging from what I could tell. And I personally wouldn't have felt safe as a woman walking alone past dark. I never, however felt unsafe in the apartment."
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"really nice place that I used for a month. had everything I needed, great location, comfortable bed, nice kitchen. Allen was also great and communicative. would stay here again for sure"

2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"Great apartment, excellent host. Got a little loud on thurs/fri nights since it‚Äôs a college town, but it wasn‚Äôt bad"
2021-10-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Host was very attentive and took care of everything! Check in was a breeze. Street parking was tricky on Wednesday and Thursdays due to time restrictions‚Äîbe mindful where you park (we got a ticket for parking on the wrong side). Slippers are needed as it‚Äôs a no-shoe policy in the apt and the floor can be a little chilly to walk on (even with socks on). Good access to restaurants and entertainment.
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,Allen was a wonderful host! He was very quick to respond and was super accommodating. I would recommend his place to all my friends and would stay there again in a heartbeat
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Allen‚Äôs place is a cute shotgun apartment close to the park. Comfortable bed and enough space to work from home comfortably. I unfortunately had to cut my stay short due to a loss in the family. Great communication and flexibility from the host that I really appreciated.
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Allen was a great host: kind, hospitable and easy to get in touch with. The Air he hosted us in was GORGEOUS. It was a renovated older house, the high ceilings make it look massive when you enter. Everything was modern but homey at the same time. I will say the street can get a little noisy but that was not a problem at all as the bedroom is in the back. The location is great as it's close to eveything, but I will say (having lived in this area) I would be cautious and street smart if walking alone at night as it is a diverse area in the city and can get rowdy on weekend nights. This was a great stay, would recommend the host and the beautiful BnB!"
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Allen was a great host and also the place. Great location and the apartment had everything you need.
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Clean apartment with all necessities for a nice stay. Comfortable bed, Keurig machine (bring your own pods), smart TV in the bedroom, and clean bathroom. We will stay again."

Near Washington park and lark street. Referred Crave(burgers) and definitely would eat again. 10/10. Thanks, Allen !"
2021-04-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Self check-in went exactly has instructed and the host answers questions very quickly.

2021-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This apartment is great for for any travelers needs! Great kitchen if u want to cook ur own meals. Flat screen TV if you wanna watch a movie. Clean bathroom with a great shower. A huge comfortable bed. And a host that response right away.

2021-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great place! It was in the single digits and the water pipes froze, but Allen was right on it when I messaged him to let him know the water stopped running, and it was back up within an hour!"

Wish I was about to spend more time in the apartment, so I am hopeful I'll be able to book it again sometime!"
2020-10-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"Pretty much exactly what is listed. Stayed for 3 months during a travel assignment at Albany med. Allen was incredibly attentive and provided a clean, warm home."

2020-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Wow wow wow. Allen‚Äôs has place is perfect for an Albany getaway. I don‚Äôt usually return to Airbnbs but this one is definitely my favorite.

2020-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Allen‚Äôs place was clean and provided us with everything we needed for our stay. He had that hotel touch! Very happy with our stay and we met Allen and found him to be very nice! We will return!

2020-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Apartment was nice, clean, with very nice touches- I brought my own towels but the ones provided were very soft but still thick. Allen communicated articulately and efficiently, and overall my stay occurred smoothly."
2020-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very comfy place. Close to restraunts/bars. Close to highway
2020-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Place was very spacious and clean! Allen‚Äôs communication skills are through the roof because he makes sure the guest is always satisfied and I didn‚Äôt have to wait for him to respond once! There‚Äôs a lot of good spots to look at and to travel too around the area it was a really fun week! Definitely gonna come back again:)
2020-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Nice space. Had everything we needed as far as amenities, way better than staying in a hotel. The location was pretty central from places we were visiting. Easy to access apt and Allen was available before, during and after visit if needed. Will book again in the further if needed!"

2020-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The best
2020-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Allen‚Äôs place was very spacious and it was very cozy.
2020-05-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,The host is great and accommodating. This is located in the city so if you are not from a city be aware there is noise.
2020-05-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"The perfect place, just when we needed it. There was a little problem with the tub drain and Allen was right there to fix it. Thanks, Allen!"
2020-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful place and close to stores and restaurants. I definitely recommend Allen's place!
2020-04-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,"There was only 1 bed in the bedroom unlike the explanation on the app. Tho the bed was really big and host said he could provide extra mattress if we wanted.
There were two TVs and one in the bedroom provided netflix.
We saw more than 5 ants and 2 bugs while staying here for 4 days.
However the kitchen was perfect. There were a pot, pans, knife, and various kinds of sauces including ranch, mustard, ect. There were also a coffee machine, tea and cocoa."
2020-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Nice stay
2019-08-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"The space is clean and spacious and Allen replied promptly to our responses. Location is a little close to the U of Albany, so there was a lot of loud partying at night, but otherwise, everything was fine. Thanks!"
2019-08-01,4.0,Stayed one night,Allen was a great host and great with communication. His space was perfect for what we needed. Thanks for having us!!

2019-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Allen‚Äôs place was a great find in Albany! The bed especially was super comfy and the place was clean and updated.
2019-08-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"The host is great, communication is easy and the apartment is, overall, really beautiful and practical. However, it has to be noted the neighborhood is very active, even at nighttime. Also, it seems to not be the richest neighborhood of Albany, so sometimes you'll meet beggars, it's just something to be aware of, especially if you're not used to it. Parking is pretty easy though so that's a plus for the location.
For the apartment in itself, the setting was comfortable. However, the shower is a little narrow, the AC makes the apartment a little humid and the bed was a little sketchy (it should be fixed from what we heard from the host though). Also, bring some keurig pods if you want coffee as it's the only machine there is.
Overall, we had a great stay, we would recommend the appartment for alone people or couples."

2019-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The place was really nice and I really enjoyed my stay. Like a previous guest mentioned, the place was a lot larger than I expected. Very clean and comfortable - great place to stay. There were several restaurants in the area and it‚Äôs a straight shot from the downtown area. Allen was extremely accommodating and very helpful. Will definitely be back if I‚Äôm ever in Albany, NY."
2019-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Allen was a fantastic host. Check in was super easy. The apartment was super clean and bigger than I had expected. The exit door in the bathroom made me a little uneasy when I first saw it but I felt incredibly safe for my entire stay. Would definitely book again.

2019-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Allen was great to deal with and made everything easy. The place was very nice
2019-06-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,"Place is located in a decent location that is undergoing gentrification, walking distance to a beautiful park and good food. Part of the neighborhood on one side could look sketchy for those not used to that type of environment, but it felt safe.
The apartment is in an old building. Do not expect a modern structure, power outlets were not very accessible (none by the bed), air circulation could be an issue for those that like fresh air. The windows do not open. Lone window AC unit in bedroom. No exhaust fan in bathroom.
Exit door from bathroom to outside could be an issue for lone female guest.
Excellent host. Decent place for the price."
2019-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great place, great host, great value :)"
2019-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Amazing prompt check in on point clean place close to the park and a lot of stores .. I do recommend this place .. Allen is awesome
2019-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Allen was so kind during our stay and after. He was quick to respond, met us immediately upon arrival and gave us great local tips. The place was stylish and cozy.
I really appreciated having Allen as our host. We were in town for a wedding, and as my wife and I were rushing to check out to get to another family event, I managed to forget my suit in the closet! He messaged me immediately, but since I was on the road, I didn't see the message until we were over 3 hours away!
Allen was so helpful and gracious. He was willing to help me in so many ways to get it back to me, and I can't tell you how much I appreciated his kindness in the midst of my mistake.
My parents were still in town, and he was willing to drop the suit off with them! Happy ending!
Allen, thank you so much for your hospitality and be blessed!"
2019-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay....close to everything. Wonderful places to walk.
2019-06-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"The apartment was as-described, and in a great location. Parking is relatively easy, just pay attention to the street signs. We always found a place within less than a block of the apartment during our 5-day stay."
2019-05-01,4.0,Stayed about a week,Good value.
2019-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Modern where it should be (amenities) lots of character throughout the apartment that made it a really neat place to stay

2019-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Very beautiful, spacious place with lots of attractions and things to do while you‚Äôre on vacation. Would definitely recommend this if you need a getaway!"

2019-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place. Looks better on the inside than the outside!
2019-01-01,4.0,Stayed about a week,"The apartment is a good value. The kitchen included everything I needed to do my own cooking. On nights when I wasn't in the mood to cook, there were good places to eat within walking distance."
2019-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We were in Albany from Brazil visiting family, and this was the perfect accommodation for us. It's a spacious shotgun apartment, bright thanks to a huge south-facing window. It's spotlessly clean and comfortably furnished, with a nice bathroom and a well appointed kitchen. Allen, the host, is super-responsive. Highly recommended."
2019-01-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Warm, great value, comfortable, spacious, accommodating, safe, appealing."
2018-12-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,A good clean place to stay centrally located at a very reasonable price

2018-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Allen was very communicative and the apartment was clean and cozy and just what we were looking for! We had a great time
2018-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This apartment is very clean and cozy we really enjoyed our stay. The Location is nice and close to everything too!
2018-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The place is just wonderful... great privacy, great location, clean, affordable, and much more comfortable than any hotel I‚Äôve stayed in. Allen is quick to answer messages, and provides a great full apartment in a good location."
2018-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Allen was an amazing host! He made sure that we were comfortable and that he was readily available for any problems. He was super nice about giving a check in tour to my boyfriend and allowing us to check out later than we were supposed to! Definitely worth the stay and Allen made it so much better!
2018-10-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,Nice centrally located with close walking distance access to SUNY-Albany downtown campus and Washington Park.
2018-09-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Clean, accessible, simple place in a rougher neighborhood of Albany. Very comfortable bed and all the necessities. Great place to stay if on a budget!"
2018-09-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"Allen was great! He was willing to meet me late at night on a Sunday, and he was very quick to communicate via text. The place was very clean. The place is also a really good value for a two-week stay. Parking was a little hard to find some nights close to the apartment, but usually parking could be found several blocks away. Because of the value and Allen's responsiveness, I would stay again if I needed a place to stay."
2018-08-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,"The location is ok, walking distance to many places. The neighborhood is definitely below middle-class but did not seem unsafe to walk at night. There is free street parking however trying to find a spot in the evening was a challenge. It should also be noted that there are days of the week you cannot park on certain sides of the street 9am-2pm (Th, F) due to street cleaning, there is some street signage, so be aware or you will receive a $50 ticket.
The layout of the rental is good and spacious. The bed is comfortable and the place was clean. We were surprised there was no place for quick dining for two people nor was there a ""Laptop friendly workspace"" as described in the listing.
Also be aware that the self check-in as mentioned in both the listing (""Building staff - Someone is available 24 hours a day to let guests in"") and the email received 3 days prior to our stay (""This listing has self check-in. Instructions on how to access will be visible in the itinerary 3 days before check-in date"") are not accurate. There is no building staff. We questioned the host regarding this discrepancy yet he insisted on meeting us to provide the keys and show us around, the latter not being at all necessary. Trying to keep in contact with host upon arrival into town, timing a meeting in between evening plans and waiting for keys was inconvenient and really not good use of our time. If airbnb hosts insist on meeting guests that's their call but the rental should be advertised as such.
We would recommend the place for location, cleanliness and price. The host was friendly and responsive. However, be aware that some of the information in the listing is misleading."
2018-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I really liked the place. The bed was great, there was internet, and it had smart tv. I would recommend showing the guests how to work the busses for transportation!"
2018-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The apartment is more than you can expect. It‚Äôs in the vicinity of a huge park, supermarket, delis, restaurants, and night life. The bed is beyond comfortable so please set your alarm when it‚Äôs check out date, you will not want to get out of bed. Trust me. Allen met me in person at the apartment and showed me around. He is very quick in responding and helpful if you need anything. Public transportation is a 2 minute walk for those who do not drive. There is street parking available. The apartment is super clean and neat it was like renting out a furnished condo. Allen‚Äôs place is a Gem"
2018-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"The apartment was beautiful and really brought back memories of living in NY that we miss so much...tall ceilings, double crown molding, open floor plan, huge windows, and the culture that surrounds. The apartment stayed cool on the hot days we had and walking distance to everything important that one would need. The Jamacian restaurant on quail down the street was amazing!!!! The front stairs are uneven so be careful walking up and down. The host has great response time when asking questions etc. I would definitely stay here again."
2018-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great stay , a lot of space & zen style feel . Would definitely recommend"
2018-07-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,"I think this is an okay place for the price - as you can see from other reviewers with high remarks. I would say if you are looking for a place to lay your head for the night it‚Äôs probably an okay place to stay. I think our expectations were higher than what the place offered - perhaps my fault for assuming. The location and cleanliness were our biggest issues, but Allen was a good host, check-in was smooth and the value was great.
The good:
The host - Allen was easy and simple
The price - can‚Äôt beat it!
Not a far drive from anything - downtown, restaurants, etc.
The not so good:
A musty smell within the apartment
The neighborhood was a little loud and less appealing for us
Not the easiest place to get in to, especially with luggage (awkward stairs with bushes overhanging)
Etc..."
2018-07-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Nice apartment, very comfortable bed, close to grocery stores and restaurants. Allen was a great host, very responsive and attentive. I stayed for a week and had everything I needed"
2018-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is a nice place to stay. Allen has it freshly updated and clean. It‚Äôs in a bit more lively neighborhood than I expected being in a student-dominated area. It wasn‚Äôt too noisy for us, but something to keep in mind. There is also not a ton of natural light, but this place is well-cared for and a decent value and it suited our needs just fine."
2018-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Allen's home is well located & exactly as described. Bed is very comfortable with lots of pillows. We stayed 3 nights but it is well equipped for longer stays. Would definitely stay there again if we are in the area.
2018-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The place was super clean, lost of amenities, lots of parking, and right off Madison ave so many access to restaurants and other things to do. Also conveniently placed on a bus line for those who aren‚Äôt driving. Bed was also super comfortable. We will definitely be back the next time we need an Airbnb!"
2018-07-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,This place is very spacious and comfortable! I stayed here for 10 days and had everything I needed. Plenty of places to eat within walking distance too.
2018-06-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,The space was clean and spacious. It gets pretty warm at night due to not having air conditioning but the ceiling fans were helpful. Definitely a space worthy of staying and would book again.
2018-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great space, located near everything. Overall great air b&b."
2018-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,A great spot for 1-2 people to stay for a few days. Well maintained /decorated space. Walking distance from the park and the restaurants and bars on Lark Street. Allen was easy to communicate with!
2018-05-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Very clean!
2018-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We stayed at Allen's place when we went to visit my mom for Mother's Day. The location was very convenient to my family, and I was grateful that parking was also convenient and easy (and free!). The apartment was comfy and clean, and Allen was easy to communicate with. I definitely recommend him and his apartment!"
2018-05-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Very nice home! very well located if you are planning on visiting the city.

2018-04-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Great place ! Comfy , clean and convenient to all places we had to go while in town. and we all ready booked our next stay. !"
2018-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The actual apartment was very clean, nice, and well furnished. Allen is also quick with responses. Our only issue was with noise and parking. The neighborhood seemed to have a lot of college students who threw house parties on the weekend and it was hard to find parking nearby during those times."
2018-04-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"Good price, very clean, very comfortable bed!"
2018-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place! It has everything and smart tvs are a plus. Super comfy bed. Overall great experience. I would recommend!
2018-03-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Huge space with wonderful bed. There was no good space to use as a desk and no alarm clocks or plugs to use a phone as alarm near the bed and this was inconvenient for me. Has a ""no shoes"" in house policy. Impeccably clean. Allen was available and considerate. He met me to let me in at a late and inconvenient hour on short notice."
2018-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Allen's place is great - very spacious, modern, clean and conveniently located. It was a lot bigger than what I thought it would based on the pictures. I stayed there for two weeks and I felt at home there. The kitchen is well equipped and perfect for a long stay. I highly recommend it.
It's a 20 min walk from the Rockefeller Plaza (there's also a bus that takes you there in 5 minutes) and there's a nice coffee shop one block away. Grocery shopping is easy too (Price chopper about 15 min walk) and laundromat is just round the corner. I will definitely come back here next time I'm in Albany.
Allen was very helpful and reliable, great communication and he even paid for my Uber ride from the Greyhound station once. Look no more for a place to stay in Albany, you've just found it!"
2018-03-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"Another great stay at Allen's, I still highly recommend it and will stay here again next time!"
2018-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,It was great! I was concerned about parking but there was plenty if street parking--even during a snow emergency!! Smart tv was great. Bed was super comfy and Allen was great about communication. Very happy with our stays and would return.

2018-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Starting with the apartment... amazing... The apartment was completely renovated.. The leather couch in the living room was just as comfortable as the pull out bed stored within it. The master bedroom sets comfortability was only outdone by its beauty. The place was sparkling clean, inviting, and trendy.... amazing is an understatement... Allen as a host sets the bar... his communication, willingness to help, and down to earth personality made our stay even better. We had a family matter at Albany Med and offered us early checkin and late check out, to assist with our situation. This place is A++++ and is made even better by its Host. Highly recommended. Thank you for everything Allen."
2018-02-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,I love Allen!!! He‚Äôs the best landlord legit ! Makes everything super easy and convenient. Only reason I tolerate boring Albany (sorry fellow residents of Albany) is because of my awesome apartment when I do come up there for my stays. Apartment is super spacious and cozy. Always warm and clean. Bed is major comfy as always and the smart tv is life ! It‚Äôs became my second home away from home! Look no further !
2018-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This place definitely felt like a home away from home. Very spacious and clean will definitely work with Allen again

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Keep this to yourself, but this place is a gem! Loved the tasteful furnishings, the well equipped kitchen, the welcoming common spaces (just call out for meeting some of the other guests), the hot-tub, and pool (wowaweeeewa!). I am coming back! Amazing how well the place works with other friendly guests. Good walk to local pond. Longer but worthwhile walk to state capital area."

2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Beautiful historic home with lots of luxury touches. Would stay here any time I am in the Albany area
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"A welcome change to try a new experience with Airbnb with private rooms in a house. The place makes you feel like you‚Äôre at home and is so cozy. I didn‚Äôt even have to interact much with other occupants since I think the rooms were not occupied then, so it felt like I almost had a whole house to myself. A tip would be just to write clear instructions for handling the front door lock on the app during check in, or maybe I missed it.
A very quirky, comfy, and organized place with all the amenities‚Äîreally fully stocked! Also I loved the Bath & Bodywork shower gels they had :)"
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Excellent accommodations. Clean, well furnished. How rare to find an airbnb with a sturdy desk and light coming in over my left shoulder!"
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"This was such a fun stay, with a dog friendly area and one of the most comfortable lounging areas ever.

This was also my first stay at a shared space and i would definitely do it again if they were all like this!"

2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"What I needed was a safe, close place to stay overnight. My room was perfect!
Having an entry code was confusing because I saw only a doorbell, no box in which to enter the code. But Justin came immediately to the door to let me in & helped me with my suitcase. Very sweet!
I felt safe, as if I were home. I‚Äôd stay there again in a heartbeat!"
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This stay is exactly as pictured! Room was spacious, clean, and comfortable. Bathroom was clean, well stocked and pristine!

2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,What a gem! This house is lovingly decorated and the hosts are very responsive and understanding of a guest who was not able to arrive until quite late. My pup knew instantly that the sofa at the foot of the bed was for her and slept so well that she was reluctant to get up when it was time to go. Our experience was so positive that we have already booked another visit. Thank you!
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Second time staying at Thomas' beautiful home, and honestly can't already wait till I come back!

Thomas and his cohost Justin are kind, hospitable, and helpful. Theres a great balance of solitude and opportunities to socialize.

2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I knew when I was booking this place it was going to be unique, but that was truly an understatement. The whole house is full of character and fun decor- my favorite was all the Jellycat collectables!!! I am a fan myself, but only have one, so it was fun to be around them all.
The attention to detail is seriously impeccable-right down to the presentation of the extra toilet paper- with a bow. I love little details so they were all appreciated.
The hot tub was perfect, it was March so it was pretty much the extent of the backyard for my boyfriend and I, however in the warmer months there's some cute spots to hangout.
And the hosts were awesome. Very personable, kind and accommodating. They were there for some time during the stay, but it never felt invasive or awkward. But great to talk to!

The bathroom was also spotless, which I really appreciated.

2024-04-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"The shower and bathroom in this apartment are amazing! It was a treat to start the day with a great shower and espresso from the Nespresso coffeemaker. The downtown location is in a historic, vibrant neighborhood, but it made for challenging night parking. We were able to move our car to street parking in front of the apartment the next morning. There was significant noise from young children playing in the unit above us during the evening, but it became more tolerable once we notified our host."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This is a wonderful small apartment in downtown Albany. Great for an overnight stay with a comfortable bed and great bathroom. Jason was very helpful and answered questions quickly.

2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I had booked a conference months ago, but a week before the conference, I realized that I needed to be a day earlier.
I secured Jason's unit on a short notice. His flexibility was commendable.
The visual representation of the space accurately represents its actual appearance.
My encounter with the bathroom was of such an exceptional nature that it has elevated my expectations regarding bathroom amenities and spatial accommodations while on the road.
Another positive aspect was the cleanliness of the unit, which ensured my tranquility was not disrupted. The area offers a range of amenities, including stores, entertainment options, and family-oriented activities.
If you have limited mobility like myself, there are three small steps leading into the unit. There are handrails on both sides that I used for support."
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Great place, cute and well kept. Jason was great and very helpful. Would recommend!"

We only stayed for a night as we had a late flight and had to leave in the morning, but Jason made sure we had everything we needed for our four-month old baby. We will definitely stay here again if we make our way back to Albany."
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Jason‚Äôs AirBnB is exactly the comfort and luxury I‚Äôm looking for when I‚Äôm away from home. The beautiful bathroom with stunning tile and fixtures, perfect amenities for some casual cooking and an extremely comfortable bed. My go to when I‚Äôm in Albany."

But once we got there, the place was clean, and looked exactly what picture said. Kitchen was equipped with your basic kitchen items. I was able to bring my own dinner from home and microwave it there. Coffee and the fixings were available. Bathroom/shower very clean. Bed was extremely comfortable & modern looking. Was able to go for a walk before settling down for the evening and the neighborhood has a lot of history. I would definitely stay there again if I'm in the area"

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Initial confusion about the keypad/key box. The keypad on the door is actually a blank black space until activated, and for someone (like me) who hasn't seen one before that led to some confusion about getting in. However this was relatively quickly cleared up.
Once in, the place was very comfortable (great mattress) and well equipped. Location is superb - a very short walk from the State Capitol building and from there to all the downtown attractions. Highly recommended."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,I stay here often when I travel to Albany for work. Great location and amazing host!

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place was on a quaint tree-lined street in Albany...it is a garden apartment so it was partly below street level...but it does have two windows. All the homes on the street are very old...but the apartment had all the modern conveniences. The street parking was not an issue...we were able to get a spot close to the apartment. The apartment is priced spot on for the area. Jason was very responsive when we had a question. Overall, our stay was very good."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Just wanted to thank Jason for both an amazing stay and his outstanding communication throughout the entire experience. I know the stay in Albany was all the better with his help!
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I came into town for a conference and Jason's place was perfect for what I needed. A little kitchen space, desk space, and so walkable to the conference center/downtown Albany. There were plenty of streets with available residential parking. I had a little bit of a hard time finding the correct entrance coming into an unfamiliar city after dark, but it was well lit and easy to find again once I knew what I was looking for. Jason was also a very responsive and helpful host."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"A great stay, two blocks from on the capital, easy access, clean and comfortable, walked to dinner (excellent around the block), recommended!"

Looking forward to my next visit!"

2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Jason's place is perfect for anyone traveling to Albany. It's in a very central location and is easy to access. Jason was very easy to communicate with and went above and beyond expectations for us. He noticed that we were traveling with an infant and offered to put a Pack n' Play in our room before our arrival even through it wasn't included on the listing when we booked. I'd definitely stay here again next time I travel to Albany!
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"My husband and I had a great stay. The studio is located in a beautiful neighborhood. We were able to walk to great restaurants.

The bed is very comfortable and we slept great. We would definitely stay again when visiting our son at SUNY Albany."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Jason was incredibly responsive and took care of our questions and concerns promptly. Good location near downtown attractions, easy check in. Street parking was a bit tough for us to find after 8pm, but possible after circling the neighborhood a few times."

2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This is the second time that I've rented from Jason... did not actually get to stay there because of the last minute emergency that caused us to cancel the trip, but Jason was very communicative and understanding and even refunded us back the initial clean up and holding fees, which was not expected but very much appreciated all the same.
Would definitely stay there again, and would definitely recommend without hesitation."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Nice overnight stay in Jason's garden level apartment. Very clean. Quiet street in downtown Albany. Found street parking nearby.
2023-09-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"It is a small basement apt. Has a air conditioner and dehumidifier, but still feels like a basement apartment not a lot of light"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Jason‚Äôs place is great. The studio is spacious and it‚Äôs in a great location with lots of restaurants within walking distance. The place is in a beautiful neighborhood and we never had an issue with street parking. Definitely recommend Jason‚Äôs place!

2023-08-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"The location was great and Jason was a very responsive host. The inside was as described. Parking was a bit challenging but we were able to find a place each time.

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Highly recommend Jason‚Äôs place! Very central-located and a lot of nice restaurants nearby. The room is a spacious studio in the basement level, very private and clean. Jason is also a very nice host, always responsive and help to solve our parking ticket problem. Will stay with Jason again if revisit Albany."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Overall amazing and would recommend!
It was a lovely garden/basement unit in the heart of the city. Street parking was a breeze. The house is a lovely bright yellow and easy to spot. The door for the unit is below the house of the front door; a little creaky to get through the gate, but to be expected when going down from the sidewalk. Location 5/5 - It was walkable to anything you'd need.
There are two doors for entry to the unit, the main door and one that goes to the house. It was a little disconcerting that the door to the rest of the house was locked from the other side and we had no control over that. There were small children upstairs and very noisy stomping on the floor starting at 8am. No problem if you are a heavy sleeper or early riser.
Inside clean and kitchen appliances are all retro & fun! The dehumidifiers and A/C unit are all easy to use. TV also easy; we watched a little when we got into the very comfy bed, with great pillows. Overall you can't get a better deal!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Host was very communicative and helpful with my needs and I was able to check in early, the place was located near lots of restaurants and had plenty of options to choose from. Photos matched interior would highly recommend"

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Jason's place was nice and as pictured. He was very responsive when communicating with him.

2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We came to Albany for a short visit & Jason did not disappoint! Not only was he responsive & kind ‚Äî but he was flexible as he let us check in earlier than listed AND check out later due to bus schedules. The place was clean & in a cute neighborhood next to lots of places to eat. It‚Äôs a short walk to the downtown area as well. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay & will definitely stay here again if we ever find ourselves in Albany in the future.
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Jason is a great host. He was friendly and very easy to reach out to. The apartment was nice and cozy!

2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This was perfect for our weekend visit for the Tulip Festival. Walking distance to great restaurants. Super comfy bed!
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,always a great deal for Albany and location. have stayed here many times. had a minor issue and Jason fixed it quickly. highly recommend
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This tucked-away apartment was the perfect spot for my quick weekend in Albany. Everything was clean and neat, and check-in instructions were very clear. Certain parts of the apartment connect to their home above, but it truly felt separate and very private. I was traveling solo and felt comfortable the whole time in the neighborhood and in the apt. I had some questions on transportation prior to my trip that Jason was very responsive about. After ending up needing to rent a car at the airport, I did find street parking to be a little tricky to find, but I also got in Saturday close to dinner time.
Getting around was simple once I got my bearings, and I grabbed Rosanna's for dinner - per the recommendation list. What a good choice -- amazing food!! I also ended up walking to Stacks Espresso Bar in the AM and then down to the capitol and walked the Empire State Plaza. Seems like there were lots of great spots to explore nearby!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I would not trying to walk from the Amtrak Station for a variety of reasons...The #114 bus goes within an easy 10 minute walk to Jason's from the Amtrak Station but it doesn't run that often. I checked on an Uber and it should be about $10, well worth it. Jason's neighborhood felt safe within a few block radius with many residential brown stone homes and tree lined streets. Many, many, small restaurants, a number having vegan selections were scattered within a few blocks.
Jason's place is a ground floor apartment that is clean and neat with a nice kitchen and bathroom. The bed is kingsized and very comfortable. I had a short one night stay and it was pleasant."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Jason was an incredible host with a perfect place to make you feel right at home. Reading his local recommendations, a delicious restaurant was right down the block. He was very communicative and the space was welcoming and comfortable. Will certainly return for future Albany stays!"
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Jason was very attentive to the check-in, and always available, responsive, very nice. The studio is clean and perfect, very well equipped.
personally I don't like being in the basement and I understood that we were at ground level. we are at the garden level for the owner's part. the studio is on the street side and the window we only see the sidewalk. the street is quiet and the studio is perfect"
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great spot in a great neighborhood, clean and comfortable space."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Would stay anytime. Comfortable bed and very clean.
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Jason's place was cozy, comfortable, and right in the center of the city which made getting around (especially on foot/via public transport) extremely convenient. The studio had everything I needed, and the bathroom was especially cute and clean. Jason was friendly, responsive and considerate; he let my drop my bags off way before check-in time, and offered great restaurant recommendations. Everest (his cat) was super adorable!"

2023-03-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"Jason was a great host. He was very helpful and responsive. The space was very clean. The bed was super comfy. My only complaint would be the parking situation. Obviously, it's not something that be controlled, but something to take into consideration when booking."
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"If you have business in downtown Albany and enjoy a little bit of walking, this is the place to be. It‚Äôs a straight shot up State Street from the Capital building; 10 min walk. Parking was easy, access was simple and the place pristine. Jason helped a lot with logistics for my personal situation. I‚Äôll keep this place in my back pocket for future visits."
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The apartment (suite) was exactly as described. Clean, cozy, and had everything I needed. It was a short walk from the capitol and super close to lots of dining options. This will definitely be my first choice whenever I need a place to stay in Albany. Highly recommend it!"

The historical house is located in the heart of Albany, steps away from the main street (Lark st) with a bunch of eateries/coffee shops, public transportation, shops, major attractions, Washington park and governmental business. The apartment is very charming, freshly painted and nicely decorated. The place is spotless including little details in the bathroom (brand new shower curtain, new white towels), kitchen (stove, garbage can etc) and rugs. It had all amenities you would need for either a short or long stay (including steamer, hair drier, toiletries). The host provided clear directions prior to my arrival, therefore, the check-in process was smooth. Josh is very friendly and responsive, replied to all my questions within minutes as well as checked on me a few times during my stay. One of the highlights is the bed, super comfy! I've been traveling enough across the US and I have to admit that Josh's apartment is the best so far.
