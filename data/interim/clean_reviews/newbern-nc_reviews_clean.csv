2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We loved our stay! The check in instructions were very clear and it was easy to find the space. We had plenty of room and the place was very clean! Everything we wanted to do was walking distance from the location so it worked perfectly. Would recommend and hopefully will be staying again!
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Maria's place was better than pictured, and one of the better airbnbs we've stayed in. We were able to walk everywhere we wanted to go, and when it was too wet to go out, we enjoyed listening to the sound of the rain from inside. We had everything we needed, loved our time in New Bern, and look forward to staying at Maria's place again!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,One of our favorite Airbnb stays so far. Maria is a kind and gracious host. The apartment is in the perfect location and walkable to everything in downtown New Bern. Right above ice cream and coffee. The space is great and has everything you need.
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Great stay while in New Bern - could not be more convenient to restaurants and shops, and staying here was an absolute pleasure."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,great place to stay
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Perfect spot for exploring New Bern and surrounding areas. You can walk to all of the downtown area restaurants, shopping and points of interest. Great location if you are looking to ditch your car and walk everywhere. The apartment is in a historic building above a downtown business but I heard no noise from downstairs. High ceilings and wood floors. The kitchen is fully equipped with everything you could need and some things you didn't know you needed (even a crockpot!). Foil, wax paper, cling wrap and various Tupperware containers. Bakeware, cookware and utensils look new. The kitchen was SPOTLESS. The bathrooms SPOTLESS. The bed linens were dreamy and the bed firm but very comfortable. Great light and energy. Washer and dryer were not smelly, again SPOTLESS. This is a clean, safe and comfortable place. I would definitely stay here again. Thank you Maria! 😊🙏"
2024-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great location. Everything was better than expected. Would definitely book this again if i ever find myself down there. The businesses below close early so dont be afraid of noise keeping you up.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great location! Everything you could want from restaurants to shops to parks was in walking distance. The property itself was quite spacious.

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We did several tours...we were looking for a great small town to explore with a lot of history....bot did we find it!
The nook was placed in a very private space right in the middle of downtown...a walk from attractions, food and other amenities."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Maria’s place was in a fantastic location and exactly as described. It was clean and well appointed. It was perfect for the 3 of us! Would stay again.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Loved Maria’s place! I live locally and my husband and I wanted a date night in New Bern. The apartment was fabulous. It was clean, tidy and the location was awesome. It’s a cute upstairs apartment within a short walking distance to all the wonderful restaurants and shops. You get a private assigned parking spot that is just steps from the door. Maria was very responsive although we had no issues and did not need anything during our stay! If you are looking for a stay that is clean, spacious and in a great location, THIS apartment is it!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Everything was wonderful. The apartment was cozy and Maria was great at answering questions in a timely manner. We would definitely stay there again.

2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Maria’s place was absolutely perfect for our first visit to New Bern! Prime location for walking to our numerous activities within the town (from the Palace to Persimmons on the water). And the place was much more spacious than depicted in the photos! Maria was extremely attentive to my questions and never made me feel like I was bothering her. We will definitely be looking to stay here again, thank you Maria!"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Our stay was really great. It was everything we were hoping for - close to restaurants that we wanted to explore and near the convention center. The keypad check-in made both check-in and check-out a breeze. The bed was comfy and the kitchen had coffee (always a necessity) but there were also the little things like q-tips and the make-up wash rag....
Maria was also wonderful at the end of our visit to clear up a situation that saved us some money. I don't know if anyone else would have went the extra mile like she did. We highly recommend this location to anyone wanting a great experience exploring New Bern or just to have a home-like atmosphere for events at the convention center."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"The location and the area of Maria's appartment in Historic Down Town New Bern is ideal. We were provided with everything we needed and more for our stay. The stairs to get to the appartment are a bit of a workout, but not a big issue for us. We would most certainly book a stay with Maria in the future."
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great location, cool place and very clean! Maria was attentive and we would definitely recommend!"
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This rental was perfect! The location couldn’t be any better for downtown New Bern. Short walk to all of the restaurants and bars. Apartment was roomy and very clean. Maria was very helpful with any of our questions.

2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"What a great location. We were able to easily walk to restaurants and local attractions.
The kitchen had everything we needed to cook the food we had brought with us.
Some basic items were there such as oil, salt, etc
Nice little coffee corner to get us started in the morning!"
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This property was right in the midst of town…convenient to everything! The unit was clean and spacious, and Maria was a warm & responsive host. The parking spot was right out the back door!
Although it is noted in the listing, I didn’t focus on the fact that you need to carry your suitcase up 20 stairs on the external staircase. I managed just fine, but it could be an issue for others.
I had a lovely stay, and enjoyed New Bern."
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,The place was clean and exactly as posted. Would definitely stay again.

Place was clean"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,We enjoyed our stay here. The hosts were very flexible when our schedule was changing and completely out of our control. This was a PCS transition and they were super easy to work with while we dealt with issues we couldn't control.
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"My wife and I enjoyed staying at this place and loved the fenced in yard for our dogs. The house was very clean and comfortable. The neighborhood right next door has a nice walking path around a small lake that we used to walk the dogs.
The location is a little further from downtown New Bern, but you can get there in about 10-15 minutes and there are other places to eat and a number of grocery stores that are even closer.
Overall, this was a great place to call home for a few days."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,Great place in a great location. David and Patricia were always communicating and letting us know when they wouldn’t be available but how to reach them. They were wonderful hosts!

Overall, would 100% stay here again if the need arises"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"David and Patricia, thank you for a lovely stay and you’re very keen attention to detail. The notes that you left us in the house were perfect.

Thank you again."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"I came to see my family in New Bern and really wanted to stay in a near by area. The home was perfect. Accommodated my entire family including our 2 yr old.

I appreciated the off street parking - directly in front of the cottage, the silent/effective air conditioning, the fast/dependable internet; and the full size kitchen. Brenda is a super host - friendly, hard working, and gracious. I would describe this as a ""hidden gem,"" but many people have already given it a 5-star rating. Well deserved!"

2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I've rented 18 places on airbnb. You know how when you buy a house it has a price per square footage equation? Well, you will not find a better square footage per dollar than Brenda's place on Airbnb. Furthermore everything you could possibly need is there. You could live there for a year. I think I want to. Quiet, peaceful, comfortable and well furnished. What else does one need?? Do not, I repeat, do not hesitate to rent this unit. You will not be disappointed but rather you will wish you stayed longer!"

Brenda made our stay unforgettable as she had the place lit up for Christmas with lighted decorations on the front porch and a tree in the living room. The little house even had the beautiful smell of scented candles about the place which made us feel right at home! We would definitely stay there again if we find ourselves in the New Bern area at some point in the future. Very kind people. You can't go wrong!

We would stay again if our travels brought us to the area. Thank you
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Oh my goodness!! This place is your home away from home. It’s SO cozy. It’s the perfect place to stay if you don’t want to stay in downtown New Bern.

The place itself literally has everything you can ask for and more!!

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This pretty little cabin set on a wooded property was just great. We loved the front porch and felt the size was just right. Brenda made us feel very welcome and answered any questions promptly and completely. We were in the area to visit our grandson and his wife and newborn baby, so were happy to have a place in the area where we could have them over for a visit and a quiet meal. If you love a peaceful location, check this out!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,The place is very clean and very quiet for a pastor it is a better place to stay than a hotel would love to come back and bring my wife for a getaway weekend
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Brenda is a wonderful host! She was very responsive and flexible with the check-in time to accommodate us getting ready for a friend's wedding. The cottage is in a peaceful and private location, not too far from downtown New Bern."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Brenda is the ultimate in super hosts. She is very caring and thoughtful. Her husband Mike is a great co-host also. They are very hands off and respectful of privacy but the contact that we did have was very friendly and enjoyable.
We certainly would not hesitate to stay with her again when we are in the area. Hopefully the cottage will be available on our next visit to New Bern."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Brenda was very responsive to all my messages. The cottage was very clean and well stocked, comfortable. I enjoyed many things about this place, but REALLY enjoyed the walk to the river and the serenity of being there. I hope to return."

2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The cottage is truly home away from home! Please, when you stay, read the notebook!! The notebook was such a lovely touch! It’s great to see how consistent others enjoyed their stays and where they are from! Thank you, Brenda and Mike!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"It was a pleasure to stay at Brenda’s. The cottage looks small on the outside, as shown in the photos, but inside it was quite spacious and homey.
It was a relaxing stay and I wish I could have had a few more days, lol. Brenda was very nice and helpful, and very responsive. :)
It was the perfect distance from downtown New “Bear”… quick and easy to get to and I loved driving over the river on those bridges. I don’t think I ever realized just how expansive the Neuse River is!!
If you get the chance, go to Bicentennial Park or Union Park. Both are riverfront and have a sidewalk that’s a good little workout - plus breezes, views, and sounds from the river. It’s well worth it!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Exactly as advertised and perfectly peaceful! A great place to stay. Thanks Brenda.
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I loved the cottage, felt like home :D

I highly recommend this property and will definitely be staying there again when I visit the area!
Brenda thank you so much!!! ☺️"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Amazingly clean cottage style airbnb home! I am very picky about a home being clean so when i say it was spotless, I mean SPOTLESS! Cleanest airbnb I have ever stayed in. Brenda is the best host too. Providing anything you might need plus snacks drinks, extra things. You could literally just bring some clothes and be good to stay there. I always bring towels and washclothes because I hate using someone else's but honestly those were the cleanest looking towels and washclothes I have ever seen. I would HIGHLY recommend Brenda's place. She even put out some stuffed animals on a chair that my daughter loved. She definitely knows how to treat guest! Above and beyond expectations! This home has a special feel to it like if your extra clean Grandmaw had a guest home and wanted you to feel as welcome as possible. Thats the best way I can describe it. Thank you Brenda!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Beautiful cottage in a quiet wooded area. Super clean. Everything you need for your stay and more. The only downside is the mattress. It probably will be fine for one person, but for two people a little uncomfortable. But it's such a nice place, that I would return."

2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I have stayed at a lot of Airbnb's, and this cottage was one of the cleanest we have been in. The space was attractive and welcoming, plenty for two people. It was also very comfortable and user-friendly, with a well-supplied kitchen; snacks, OJ, and water; and plenty of towels and linens. The TV had Netflix and Amazon Prime, which we appreciated. The place was situated in a quiet, wooded spot with its own driveway, which made it easy to come and go, and a pleasure to come back to as a retreat. It was very convenient to New Bern, as well as other small and interesting towns like Aurora."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Brenda’s cottage was a wonderful experience. The home was spotless and very welcoming. The fresh fruit and morning snacks were a highlight. We were able to spend some time on the front porch and relax after a long day of sightseeing. We rode in on a motorcycle and felt very safe overnight leaving our bike outside. It was a pleasure to feel at home and enjoy her beautiful surroundings. Thank you again Brenda your cottage is a gem around New Bern. Will definitely stay again on your next trip to New Bern no need to look any further.
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Everything about my stay was great. I do plan on staying again when I'm in town for work. Thank you so much Brenda for everything I only wish I could have stayed a little bit longer.

2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Perfect little woodland hideaway cottage tucked off the beaten path but actually close to everything - maybe 10 minutes to downtown New Bern, yet feels like a thousand miles from anywhere when you’re there. Absolutely quiet & calm. Sweet little touches everywhere from coffee & breakfast treats to toiletries for what you might forget. And pristine cleanliness."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Brenda is a wonderful host! You can feel right at home in her beautiful cottage. It is located close to food and entertainment venues but far away from all of the noise and lights of the city. It is a great location to unplug from things for a while. I highly recommend Brenda to anyone staying in her area. She had everything you need to feel right at home.
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was my second visit to Brenda's cottage and I enjoyed it just as much this time as I did the first. I was traveling for work and it was so nice to feel at home and have everything I needed to settle in after the work day. Brenda is excellent at communicating with her guests and when she knew I was going to be arriving after dark, she made sure to have the porch light on for me. I will choose Brenda's cottage every time I travel to New Bern!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Brenda was an exceptional hostess. Her cottage was immaculate. As soon as you walk through the front door you can see the care she gives towards her cottage.

My wife and I will definitely be back."
2023-05-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Very cute country cottage that is peaceful. I love the small touches like leaving breakfast basket with snacks & fruit on the counter. The kitchen had coffee & tea options. The fridge was stocked with bottle waters, coffee creamers, & orange juice. The place was immaculate. There were plenty of clean towels & washcloths in the bathroom. This place is for good for both short & long term rentals. It is also good for anyone that works night shift!!
During my stay, there were unforeseen weather conditions & the power went out. However, Brenda made sure that she kept in contact with me & that my stay was comfortable. It is tucked away from busy metropolitan areas, so there are some bugs 🐜. These minor things would not stop me from coming back!!!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Brenda offers a spotless, quite homey AirBnB to travelers.
It is the cleanest AirBnB we have ever stayed in, and Brenda was always a quick text or call away for questions. Location is peaceful and quite yet just a few miles from everything New Bern has to offer. Highly recommend Brenda's home. We will definitely be return customers!"

2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Her home was like a Safe Haven in every way the moment we arrived I just felt a weight lift like i was safe there. Being from Houston Texas 1500 miles away I felt right at home when I arrived at her home. Her and her husband were very hospitable and understanding. Great place to call home away from home.
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This was an absolutely incredible stay. While I was only there for roughly 12 hours, Brenda was incredibly responsive, and I can’t say enough about the space. If I’m ever back in the New Bern area, this will be the first place I check for availability! Thank you, Brenda!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"One of my favorite visits - the home is so clean, cozy and comfy. I could do a weekend vaca there just to relax.

Wonderful host - I arrived super late and they had it all ready for easy access and the WIFI is awesome for work. I look forward to visiting again for sure!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This little cottage was perfect for us! Just the two of us in our 70s on a two-month long vacation.

2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Brenda’s place was the perfect spot for a quick overnight. The cottage is fully stocked, and quite cozy. The mattress is perhaps a bit dated, but overall we both slept fine. It’s a lovely, quiet neighborhood, and I would certainly stay here again."

I’d love to live here if I could I didn’t want to leave lol"
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"10 stars if possible. Spotless, exactly as described and very comfortable. Met Brenda and her husband briefly and seemed like really good people. Shopping and restaurants are a bit far but DoorDash delivers. Bring what you need or 10 min drive back into town. Worth it for the beautiful, peaceful location. Just not walking distance to anything. Still 10 stars 🤠"
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This is the second time staying at Brenda's. We love this charming cottage and will continue to choose this as our place to stay when visiting New Bern.
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,This place was absolutely wonderful and Brenda and Michael were so kind and helpful but not intrusive.

2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Our 4th or 5th booking bc I have lost count! Lovely place and we will return again.

2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The best AirBnB experience we have had! Brenda has truly thought of everything in case you happened to forget to pack something and even stocked coffee, water, and breakfast snacks.

We were impressed with the cleanliness and the festive fall decor which made the cottage feel so cozy and inviting. We truly enjoyed our stay and hope to come back again!"
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Me and my friend had an amazing stay here, the cottage was super clean and Brenda kept stocked with everything we could have needed or wanted!"
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This is a hidden gem. Everything you could need is there, but more. We were welcomed by a herd of deer and then a battery operated candle was lit on the table. This little home was comfy and charming, right down to children’s books in the cabinet and playing cards and Halloween candy. Little notes left by the host keep you well informed. Brenda was quick to respond and gracious. Apparently she has thought of everything. There were ample towels and everything was spotlessly clean. Who wouldn’t love caramel creamer for your morning coffee? But if you prefer tea, there’s a tea bag plate there for you and a selection of sweetener. The orange juice, water bottles and snack basket with bananas was a treat.
The Firestick on the TV offered a great selection. We chose to play music that filled the cottage, but the main house was enough of a distance that we knew we weren’t disturbing them. The bed had just enough firmness for a great nights sleep and the pillows were perfect. We wish we could stay, but will certainly be back!"

2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is a great little cottage located out in the country about 9.5 miles from downtown New Bern. The cottage is very comfortable. The owner makes sure the guests have everything they need while staying. The kitchen is well stocked - having everything you need to make a meal. The breakfast offering is fantastic and the ""just in case you forgot something"" toiletries came in quite handy! The owner is very quick to respond to questions and is super helpful.

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great location! Bed slept comfortably.
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Loved this place. Definitely a place where you say, ""Next time we go back to New Bern, we need to stay here!"" It is right downtown so you can walk everywhere easily. Loved having a reserved parking spot. Small thing, but there was soap and a sponge to wash dishes. So many Air BnBs have dishes but don't provide a way to clean them. My only note is the place is little echo-y. My wife has a hearing impairment so the echo made it a little difficult to communicate across the room. Not a big deal at all, but I felt worth noting if that is a consideration of yours. It is also located around businesses so there is a little noise from that, but minor and was never bothersome. Overall, great location, clean, great price, with just the right amenities you need for a stay. Highly recommend to anyone; we will be staying here again!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great place. Super clean and like new. Easy walk to food and beverage. Great getaway for a couple for romance weekend. Would not bring kids in this studio apartment style. Pullout sofa worked fine for our 15 yr old but ideal for the couple.
Nice walking area around downtown. People were friendly and there are things to see and do.
Friendly host and easy checking in. Would definitely stay again. Smart TV made it easy to view"

Everything was walkable, and coffee shop right next door. Hosts were responsive, and friendly. Wish there were more windows to bring in more natural light, didn’t expect the only window to be covered in vines. For an extended weekend it was great!"

2023-12-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"Cute AirBnB tucked away in the middle of downtown New Bern. Apartment was very spacious, had everything we needed, and even had two rooms that separated the shower and sink/toilet, which was actually pretty convenient! You can walk everywhere in downtown because it’s all right there. Highly recommend Bella’s Cafe next door as well as Big E’s food truck (chili dogs) that parked right outside our door for two nights, delicious! Host was very responsive and friendly.
Some things to note: There is a bar right there by the apartment and sometimes people would sit out in the patio area at night and we could hear them a little late but nothing that kept us up or was bothersome. What did wake us up at 4am, however, was the garbage truck. But that only happened one morning. Otherwise, the place was great and I recommend as a nice stay in New Bern"

I only wish there was a king bed instead of a queen. But the bed was so comfy.. made up for that . and the place was super quiet too. Bella’s Restuarant was perfect way to start every day.

2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a great time during our stay in New Bern. We came in from out of state and only had one car so the location in downtown was perfect. One of us could drive around to see friends and family in neighboring towns while the other stayed in downtown New Bern shopping, dining and meeting local friends. It was perfect! The place itself was exactly as shown in the photos, lovely and spacious. It was well appointed with linens, towels, dishes and any other amenities you might need for your stay. It was a lovely trip for us and communications with our host were excellent."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We loved it! We made a couple of minor suggestions to them. One thing we had a problem with was finding it. You have to go in the alley to find it.

Many restaurants within a 5-7 minute walk, 10 minute drive to the wedding at Amelia Grove, 40 minute drive to Atlantic Beach or Fort Macon, 5 minute drive to Walmart if you forget something or need to stock up. Would definitely rent again if the need arose."

2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Bella's BnB was a great place to stay for the two of us. Just as described. Plenty of essential items were available to us. Location for downtown activities was really nice. Nice to have dedicated parking a few feet from the unit's door. Be aware that the unit faces a parking lot behind several restaurants and businesses - and there was some noise in the evenings and very early morning - typical for these kinds of businesses. Definitely not a deal breaker for us.
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I visited New Bern for business purposes for 2 nights and we chose Bella's place. I am so happy I did. Everything was perfect and clean. I was able to prepare meals for my husband and I in the well equipped kitchen. The parking was perfect, right outside of the unit. I travel to New Bern often, I will definitely rent Bella's unit again."
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The studio apartment was lovely. Located in the old historic district of New Bern, it was prime location for walking, for what we needed. ABC store a block away, gas station a block away, and many shops and restaurants. The waterfront was beautiful to take a walk. We have enjoyed more sites if we had more time. Driving distance not far from the isle."
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,What a Beautiful place!! I felt right at home! I didn’t want to leave ! I am definitely booking this spot again.
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The area was awesome lots of stuff to do.
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,This place is in the PERFECT location! Everything is in walking distance. My son and I really enjoyed our stay. I recommend 100%.
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Looked exactly like pictures. Very clean and nicely decorated. Could not ask for a better location! Within walking distance to some great restaurants and shops. Would definitely recommend and would definitely stay here again.
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Love the place and the perfect location!!! Had everything we needed!!!
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Amazing! I will never pick another Airbnb in new Bern! Thank you for an amazing stay!
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I loved staying here for two weeks while in town for work training. The location was unbeatable - you’re seconds from Bella’s coffee shop and minutes to tons of unique bars, restaurants, shops, and the waterside. I walked home alone from dinner after dark several nights during my stay and felt surprisingly safe in New Bern. I’ll definitely be back to this spot!"
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Second full week staying at this Airbnb for work. See other review for full thoughts, but in short - I loved this spot and it’s location. I’ll be back here every time I’m in town."
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We loved this space and the amenities. So cozy. Loved being able to walk 2 steps over to the local cafe/coffee shop in the morning for breakfast and coffee.
My only suggestions-
In the check-in instructions be sure to add that the entrance is on the back side of the building. Also, add that there is a parking pass on the table inside that you need to put in your car. Things that we figured out, but would have been nice to know to make arrival a little easier.
The parking lot light shines right through the window above the entry door and reflects the address number on the wall by the bed. For us, it was just a little too much light shining in on us. There are plenty of throw pillows though, so we covered the window the second night with those.
Both very minor things and not at all game changers.
Thank you for such a fantastic stay and accommodations! I’ve already told so many people about your space. 😀"
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We came to New Bern for a family member’s funeral. Sandy’s place was exactly as described & very clean. It gave us the perfect place to go back and relax and refresh after some very long days!
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Sandy’s place was absolutely perfect for my short business trip to New Bern. Super clean and such a cozy apartment. Great location as well! The hosts were extremely quick to respond. I had an issue with the thermostat, and Sandy remedied that the very next day. Highly recommend and would love to stay here again!"
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Five stars all around! This was the perfect Airbnb for downtown New Bern! It is conveniently located in the heart of downtown, with a private parking space right in front of the entrance! The space was very clean, beautifully decorated, and had everything we needed for our extended weekend. The location was awesome; if you want to have a spot to walk to restaurants and shops while still feeling very private, this is for you. We brought our toddler and baby with us, and the apartment was perfect for our family of four. We had our pack and plays + slumber pods with us, and even with both set up, the space was still very large and accommodating. The host is wonderful and very responsive! We thoroughly enjoyed our stay. We plan to rent this place again in the future!"
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Sandy's space was absolutely fantastic. From the location to the actual space. Open floor but yet cozy and privacy where needed. Brand new everything and beautiful upscale decor. I'll definitely be staying again.
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The space was meticulously clean and in the best location possible for walking to the rehearsal dinner - wedding and reception . Ubers were easy to get for further away activities . The few things the Airbnb did not have were easy to get and host was beyond quick to respond for our request for more towels . Would definitely recommend and would stay there again in a heartbeat .
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Very nice home, clean and had most of the amenities you would need. There is a menagerie of birds across the street that made is a very unique stay."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay while visiting Craven County! Wonderful indoor and outdoor space - great for a family get together!
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,We went up for a girls weekend and had a blast. We loved getting to see the animals (we are big animal lovers). We were able to take out the kayaks and have a bonfire. It was the perfect space for us
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,This was a great find for us while visiting family in the local area. The house was immaculate. The animals across the street and the river boardwalk provide a great atmosphere. I’ll definitely try to use John’s properties in the future…hopefully the two story loft above the converted garage /workshop will be next!
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"This stay was wonderful. It was a unique setting , it was quiet & the home was clean. It was a large property, with the host living nearby.. The beach area was a short walk with a beautiful pier & bench, with chairs on shore & kayaks .We really had a sense of feeling safe at this location, in a private setting .There was several animals on the property, it was fun to see them everyday..John was a great host & took care of anything we needed. . New Bern was minutes away & beaches in Emerald Isle was a short drive , also check out Macon State Park, there is a Fort. We would definitely stay here again."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We stayed in John's place for Spring Break while visiting family. We were able to have our family over for a dinner one night and even with 20 people, there was still plenty of room for everyone to be inside. Everyone, especially the kids, loved all of the animals and the beach, as well as the fenced in back yard to run and play.
If we're ever back in the area, we will definitely be staying again. Our 8 year old didn't want to leave."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,We had another great stay! John is a great host. The house is very clean and we absolutely love all the animals on the property.
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,this is the second time I've stayed on his property and it's just wonderful every time. thank you so very much for making this stay wonderful!
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,The animals on the beautiful property along the water were so fun to visit. We will definitely return to this enchanting place on our future visits to see family in NC.
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We've been here so many times, it is like a home away from home! Always look forward to seeing John and staying at this lovely location. There's something magical about the peace you feel when sitting down at the water.... Highly recommend!"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"In area visiting my daughter & son-in-law who are stationed nearby. Great location. Very peaceful. Very clean. Perfect size for our adult son and my in-laws to join us for a night. Also perfect for our daughter and son-in-law to come over so we could all visit comfortably. Loved walking down to the water and visiting the animals each day. Next time I hope to try kayaking! If the other rentals on the same property are available at the same time, this would be a great place for multiple families to vacation together but still have their own space and privacy! Great hosts!"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Great place surrounded by wonderful animals like emus, ducks, chickens and ducks right on the river. Spacious house with a great backyard. Owner was super friendly and helpful."
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Had a great time! Very relaxing location and plenty of stuff to do in New Bern!
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,This was a great spot. The house is right next to a cute little farm and water access. It's also near the town which was super convenient. This is a great spot for dogs too as the big back yard is completely fenced.
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"This was the second time my Black Labrador and myself have stayed on John’s property. I would go back again if I want to return to New Bern. I love the atmosphere and the animals that are there. John is very helpful and very quick to respond to your messages, needs or requests. The property worked great for me because I could let my dog in and out of the fenced in back yard through the laundry room and use the utility sink to have water to feed her."
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,John was the perfect host? Have already made reservations for our next stay.
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"This place has beautiful surroundings. The waterfront is absolutely gorgeous, easy to get to, and clean. John has done a lot of work to the waterfront area to keep it clean, beautiful, and very accessible.
The house itself is clean with lots of open space and a very comfortable couch. There is a large, fenced-in backyard for your dog or children to play and be safe."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful family and pet friendly house located on a charming property at a great price. Really suited our purpose to gather family members from across the country have a quiet, peaceful, place to relax and enjoy our time together."
2023-12-01,5.0,Group trip,"I needed a place for my family that came out of town to stay for the weekend, to attend our baby gender reveal. We did not have a lot of time to go out due to having to prepare food, other things for the celebration and did not want to be on the road too much. The only time we left the home was to go to the store, eat-in lunch, and on the day of the event. Johns place was perfect for spending the weekend in because there was plenty of space in the living room for us to hang out and play games, the outdoors were beautiful and had a variety of patio seating and the walk to the waterfront was scenic and peaceful. The property was clean inside/out and there were extra towels, pillows, and blankets provided if needed. John even lit a bonfire for my guests & I, unfortunately I did not see his message until the next day. Overall, it was a memorable and unforgettable stay and we would happily visit again."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"great place to stay, will stay there again next time we're in town"
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"John’s place was in an absolutely gorgeous setting! The animals were a pleasant surprise for my granddaughters, and the private beach and dock were amazing!!"
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"My second stay at Dot's Place and my FOURTH time at one of John's places -- we are so appreciative of an airy, open, affordable, dog friendly spot to stay. And emus this time!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"we love this place , it's so relaxing being here and John is wonderful, we love talking with him."
2023-10-01,5.0,Group trip,The property was beautiful. We enjoyed fires on the beach and fishing from the dock. John was very responsive to any questions we had.
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Clean, comfortable, and convenient in a peaceful setting... John is an excellent host. Not our first stay here, and we will be back !"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"I can't say enough about this place! This house is THE perfect spot for a weekend getaway or week vacation with family or friends. Relax on the beach, watch the sunrise, lay in the hammock, sit by the fire pit, .... take it all in. There are 2 other houses on the property so if you need more room for larger crowd, check out those listings too. My dog loved the fenced in back yard and I didn't have to worry about him. The home is only a quick 8 minute drive to downtown New Bern and 30-40 min drive to Emerald Isle. I highly recommend eating at Cypress Hall, MJs, Lawson's Creek, and Sea & Soul. I spent an entire day in New Bern - shopped (all located on Middle & Craven Streets), walked the historic district & water front. I also loved the animals on property. This hidden gem feels like being at the mountains, the river and farm all in one. John is a great host, quick to respond. I will be back!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"John was so flexible about our stay! We were in town for my daughter's wedding on Saturday and a family birthday breakfast the next day and weren't sure how many people would need a place to sleep for the weekend nor how quickly we would be able to check out on Sunday. John was super easy to work with and we had a fabulous weekend. The animals at the location are so much fun and since we were getting up earlyish each morning we didn't mind the roosters. If you are coming to sleep in, you might want to bring bring earplugs. 😂"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,John was very responsive and answered all questions. Beautiful area and river/beach area. Close to New Bern. Would definitely stay in one of his homes again.
2023-09-01,5.0,Group trip,"Not a big deal that the ice maker went on the blink, that was only a minor glitch, very enjoyable stay!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,This is our fifth time staying at one of John's properties and it's always a lovely retreat. The growing menagerie is a kick and John is a great host and a nice guy.
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This was our 4th year in a row at John’s property and it won’t be our last. In past years we have enjoyed the private beach, grilling, sitting out on the dock, and watching our kids endlessly kayak around. This year we changed it up and went down to the ocean beach at Pine Knoll Shores for a day and another day rented some kayaks in Cedar Point to go out on the salt marsh. It was fun discovering even more nearby activities! His location is just fantastic from the property itself, to New Bern being right there, and the ocean only 45 minutes away.
John has 3 houses on the property he rents out (which are nicely spaced out and landscaped for privacy) and we love that Dot’s Spot is positioned right across from the goats, chickens, ducks and emus. Nothing like drinking your morning cup of coffee watching the animals and then meandering down to the dock on the water! PS- I am allergic to dogs but have never had an issue staying in any of his houses. Very clean. Highly recommend his place!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,What a wonderful home. Had everything I needed to enjoy my stay. John is so kind and responsive. Will definitely add to my favorites and return whenever I can.
2023-08-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"My family and I loved the homey feel of this place. It was so peaceful and relaxing. We were able to have a campfire on the beach every night, we fished (only caught small fish - bait is very hard to find in the area!), and we were able to use the grills on the property and the kayaks. Lots of fun things to do and incredibly beautiful views! The only thing we were concerned about was the amount of broken glass on the beach. Make sure you have water shoes and be careful walking your dogs by the water. Other than that, the place was perfect and we made some wonderful memories."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Everything was great
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,This place is truly a hidden gem. The house is beautiful and the whole property is amazing. The private beach area on the river is such a huge bonus. You will not be disappointed if you choose to stay here.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Very nice location. The site is perfect. We went for a family and the beach a short walk away is splendid. A little piece of heaven. There are 3 houses on the site, but each is quite distant from the others, so very intimate. Finally, there are even animals, the kids loved it. We were about 55 minutes from the sea, so often we spent a few hours at the sea to come back and enjoy John's location. Thank you ☺️"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place! Loved the easy beach access
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Perfect space!
2023-06-01,5.0,Group trip,Enjoyed our stay. We brought 2 dogs and they were able to be in the back some which was nice.
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We keep coming back whenever ee can! We love this gem of a place & John is a gem himself! Such a wonderful & attentive host! Best airbnb ever!
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Excellent place to book if you have younger children and pets. Too often we struggle to find places that accommodate both our children and dogs. They absolutely loved the house and the animals across the driveway! Big fenced in backyard for dogs was a life saver. If we are ever in the New Bern/Beaufort area again we will definitely book again.
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Absolutely love coming here ! Enjoy every minute ... whether sitting on the pier ... sitting in a chair on the water edge ... We saw fish jumping , dolphins swim by ... John helped set up a burner and pot so we enjoyed a low country boil for mothers day ! I have stayed at several Air BnB's and this one is the best ! Watching ducks,goats, emu,s chickens and the dog and cat is an added plus !!! .would give 100 stars if possible !! ( hate to say too much good because it will be over run with guests lol)."
2023-04-01,5.0,Group trip,"This place is amazing ! My stay was more than I had even hoped it would be ! From the animals, to the awesome ""beach"" , to the quiet area .. It is everything you could want in an Air BnB ""Home away from Home"" .. John was so responsive and goes above and beyond to make your stay enjoyable !! Will be back and it will be a destination place to stay for sure !! Thank you John for the awesome time at Dots Place !"
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"This is the third time we've stayed at one of John's places -- we'd been in the older cottage twice before, but I wanted to take advantage of the huge fenced in back yard at Dot's Place, as I had a friend who brought her dog, and I had our young spaniel. It worked beautifully. John is easy going and friendly, the site is beautiful and well maintained. And Dot's Place was spacious and comfortable. We will be back in late June!"
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Came in for a wedding and this was the perfect spot to crash at the end of the day. 10 minute drive to downtown and lots of cute restaurants/bars.
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This place was just wonderful! So peaceful and you felt very safe. Great for family and small ones. Everything was as listed. John made sure we were good. Kitchen was stocked with what you need. The private beach area was beautiful!
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Friendly! Wildlife and good walk down to the river. Beautiful find tucked away.
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Amazing place … definitely the best Airbnb we have ever been to.
House was very cozy with fenced in backyard for pup. All property was very pet friendly we and we loved all the animals. Had our own private beach and fishing pier to enjoy fishing and water time .
John’s was very friendly and available at all times for any questions and information about area.
We enjoyed all our chats and enjoyed everything about his property.
Already planning a trip for next year and hoping to find a date to rent all houses with family.
We definitely found our retirement area ."
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We have stayed here on John’s property many times and it never disappoints. John is a lovely host who lives on the most beautiful property and shares it so graciously with others. We have stay at each each house and you can’t go wrong with picking any of them!
Thanks John from all of my family! Maria"
2023-03-01,5.0,Group trip,"We had such a great stay at Dots place! The home was extremely spacious, the beds were soft, it had all the amenities you can imagine and very clean! We loved the outdoor setting, the walk to the beach and dock was so beautiful. Everyone loved seeing all of the animals, definitely a feel good vibe. We are already planning our next visit!Thank you for a great weekend!"
2023-03-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"this was a great place to stay loved being by the water atmosphere was wonderful only issue was the cute Great Pyrenees’s dog barked all night, which was not idea. Lots of cute goats ducks chickens roaming property."
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Our stay was perfect! We Will absolutely be back. Our host was wonderful too!
2023-03-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"The house was very open and welcoming. We opened up the doors and enjoyed the breeze and the sunshine that came in through all the windows. The goats, chickens, ducks, cat and dog were all super friendly. The chickens and ducks came right up to the door. The lake was beautiful and we loved sitting on the dock and watching the sunset."
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This rental was a delight for a girls weekend! Close to stores and restaurants yet private, safe, and quiet. The animals were so much fun and the river property was stunning."
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Great host and a really neat property. Will definitely go again!
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"John was such a great host. I needed a super late checkout, and he accommodated this with no issue. His place was quaint. Check-in was easy. It's an older house but has been remodeled nicely. The kitchen was great and had everything you could need. The fenced in yard was a plus for our dog. The location provided plenty of privacy but was still in close proximity to stores, restaurants, and downtown. The only con about the house is that it did have a noticeable musty smell throughout. Other than that, John's place was very functional for the week we were there. Would recommend!"
2023-01-01,5.0,Group trip,everything was nice
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Our stay was very nice. John was a great host.
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I fell in love with this place!! The house is adorable, the animals were one of my favorite things over all! The location was 8 miles from our daughters new house. Close to everything but quiet. We plan to come back again this spring! Can't wait!! John was awesome with communication."
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place was adorable, and we really loved the private little beach his property gave us. If I ever find my way back to the area I hope I can stay here"
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Great place to stay! Exactly as described and host was extremely helpful. Answered all questions immediately. Extremely clean and well furnished. Property was lovely and relaxing. You can walk to river and enjoy. Highly recommend this property!
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We had such a great time!! John is a very good host!! The house is totally comfy, tastefully decorated and has everything you could possibly need!! Next time we will spend more time down at the river!!! Beautiful dock and sand bottom riverside beach. Our dog also loved running around the fenced in yard!! We will definitely be back!!!"
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,John was so helpful and the place was exactly what we needed . Very peaceful. Love the Ducks .
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Great stay and the yard was great for our dog. John has many animals and we loved the goats and ducks! One of his goat was so friendly it followed us all the way down to the dock. He was adorable!
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,This was an amazing place to stay! Strongly recommend to anyone staying in the area.
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"This is the perfect place for a quiet and relaxing getaway, while at the same time the location puts you only minutes from everything the New Bern area has to offer. The house and grounds are spotlessly clean and comfortable. Just a short walk through the property will take you to the waters edge of the Neuse River with chairs and a dock provided to make for a fun afternoon or a nice evening.
We look forward to our next stay at Dots' Spot."
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"This was a perfect place for us to stay for our son and his fiancee's wedding at Amelia Grove. The property is gorgeous, especially the walk down to the river. A huge fenced back yard was perfect for our two pups to romp around without much supervision. And we loved the adorable goats, the chickens, the ducks, the little white cat and the cute white dog. The house is elegant, with a spacious living room and comfortable couches. We would stay here again in an instant whenever visiting New Bern."
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"This is a beautiful Airbnb nestled in a quiet, wooded area with access to a private beach and a dock. It is absolutely lovely and quiet. It is well worth every penny. My family and I stayed here for a week and we highly recommend it. The host goes out of their way to make sure your stay is enjoyable and pleasant."
2022-10-01,5.0,Group trip,Great place next to the Neuse river and very close to downtown. Johns place is clean and he is so easy to communicate with. We especially loved that is was located close to the venue where our daughter was married.
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Nice home! No coverings on windows in common areas and there w we are lotsss of windows so it was a little nerve wracking at night.
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Our stay was the best stay we’ve had visiting New Bern and we come every year! The description of the house and grounds was accurate, the house was clean and well stocked, the grounds were clean and spacious and the animals on the property were fun to see and interact with! We had a toddler with us who loved the ducks, chickens, goats, cat, squirrels and rabbits! The lit path down to the private beach was easily accessible, an easy walk and so beautiful! John was easy to interact with and very polite, professional and friendly! Will definitely be back!!"
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"John is an amazing host. Dot's Spot is well maintained and very clean. The location is convenient to downtown New Bern.
The house is spacious and plenty of parking.
We enjoyed walking the beautiful property, meeting Gizmo, the doggie and of course the roosters!
We will definitely rent with John again!"
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"My family& I love staying here , the house is very clean , it is in a great location and John responds in a timely manner."
2022-08-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,"Very nice vacation spot. Owner is most accommodating. House was as described. We & our pup brought my elderly parents for their annual vacatIon. The house suited them well. Only wish we had been closer to the river. We thought it was actually in ""our"" backyard. Enjoyed the chickens visits. One thing to remember...roosters don't like the color red. Lol Thanks for the hospitality. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay!"
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"It was a wonderful place to stay, loved the home, the river and New Bern, too. I would come back sooner but such a long drive from our home in Michigan."
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We enjoyed the walking distance to private water. Our dogs loved playing on the beach, jumping from pier and swimming. House and yard is spacious in a quiet area. Barn cat and chickens are friendly."
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We’ve been going here a few times a year for the last couple years. It’s seriously one of our favorite spots!! So beautiful and relaxing! John the owner is also amazing!!
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Excellent stay, the house was immaculate, modern, and tastefully decorated. The check in process was super simple with friendly owner. The beach was nice and had kayaks and a beautiful dock. We loved little kitty outside!"
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Third year in a row at John’s awesome property on the Neuse River. The kids look forward to it every year and it’s fun that they can now canoe along the shore on their own! We loved staying at Dot’s Spot this time- the big open kitchen/dining/living area was perfect for hosting our friends who rented the 40s cottage the same weekend we were there. It’s awesome that he has 3 houses for rent on the property! The place was clean and comfortable and even though he allows dogs (and I am allergic) I’ve never had any allergy issues or even seen any dog hair really. The beach is spacious, perfect gradual slope in the water (ideal for kids), and we love the new dock that extends out with a bench overlooking the water. Always a highlight of our year!"
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Great location right out of New Bern. Our family had a great time and John was a great host, he even brought us candles during a short power outage. River is a short walk away and the pups had a fenced in back yard to play in. Give them a shout if you are going that way!"
2022-07-01,4.0,Group trip,"overall really great experience; location, accuracy of the listing, etc were perfect for our little group of six! beds are super comfy and having a closed in backyard was perfect since we had a pup with us. only suggestion is that it’s a little bare in terms of supplies, not very many dishes, toilet paper, etc so be mindful when packing or doing your shopping haul :)"
2022-07-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,We had a good stay! John is an excellent communicator and was very helpful
2022-07-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,This is just a great little spot for a getaway. Our kids enjoy the river and pond and various animals on the property. Plenty to keep you busy or just chill on the big couch. We will be back!

2022-06-01,5.0,Group trip,John was amazing! The water was so relaxing!! Such an amazing place to spend time with family and relax by the water. Just heads up if you’re planning on cooking a lot you need to bring your own pots and pans and large bowls to store food in refrigerator since there very few at the house but other than that it’s a perfect place to vacation!! Most definitely will return
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Great place! Very relaxing and all around great time.
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,This was the perfect place for five of us to stay while we attended a wedding. It was so nice to be near the wedding venue. We enjoyed every bit of our stay. We couldn’t have asked for a better place. (:
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Awesome vacation spot. River with private beach, dock for fishing. The walk from the cottage to the river is lit at night and is beautiful."
2022-05-01,5.0,Group trip,"Dot's place is amazing , immaculate , peaceful with a great private beach , host John responds right away . We will be returning !"
2022-05-01,5.0,Group trip,Great place to stay!
2022-04-01,5.0,Group trip,Great place for our family. The fenced in back yard was really nice for our dogs. The accommodations worked really well for our family and good space. Next time we will plan to have enough time to spend at the waterfront.
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"John's place exceeded my expectations! The house is just as pictured and everything was clean and comfortable. The outdoor pictures did not do it justice. The fenced-in backyard area is HUGE and perfect for my dogs and my son to do a lot of exploring. The sand beach area is just a few minutes down the driveway and made for many fun hours of wading, playing in the sand, and trying out the paddleboard. We had a wonderful time and would not hesitate to stay here again!"
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great rental.
2022-04-01,5.0,Group trip,Nice place! Great location and well maintained.

2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,John's place was absolutely perfect for us. We were traveling with young children and a pet. The open floorplan and minimal knickknacks made it so easy for us to completely relax with our toddlers. It has a large fenced in yard and is very private. John and his wife are so kind and helpful. We look forward to coming back!
2022-03-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"Dot’s Spot is a great place for a weekend retreat. The house is very nice with tons of natural light and comfy beds. It’s a short two-minute walk to the waterfront and there are plenty of chairs and picnic tables for enjoying that spot.
Things to be aware of: There are no curtains/blinds in any common areas of the house, so it does feel exposed at night. Also, if you’re cooking for a crowd (more than two) you’ll need to bring some of your own kitchen supplies (big pot, 9 x 13 pan, large skillet, etc.).
Those things didn’t deter us from having a great weekend getaway, just something to be aware of! Overall this was a great little spot."
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Wonderful house in a quiet neighborhood. Nice big back yard for the dogs also.
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very clean and nice place. Location is very quite and relaxing.
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"House was as advertised. Very clean. Spacious living space. Perfect for relaxing weekend away. Less than 10 min drive to downtown new bern, very easy. Some restaurants and a full grocery store within 5 min. Would definitively stay here again."
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,John was such a wonderful host! He gave me encouragement on the hot real estate market as I am shopping for a new home. His property is very dog friendly with a fenced yard and hardwood floors. Having coffee in the mornings at the sand beach by the water was a special treat . The hospitality of the folks in New Bern makes it a great place to visit.
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"This house gave us everything we needed and I recommend it to anyone who wants a place that is quiet, yet relatively close to town. Clean; nice kitchen and comfy beds!"

2022-01-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Nice place, I recommend this house."
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Dot’s Spot was a great getaway. Very quiet nestled back in the woods off of the road. There are two other cottages that can be rented on the same property if you’re a larger group.
The property includes a pier and a private beach for relaxing and bonfires.
The kitchen has the basics of pots and pans, silverware, and cooking utensils both for inside and for the gas grill outside.
The owner John was very helpful and responsive with any questions and is nearby should you need anything, but stayed out of sight.
Overall a comfortable and relaxing space that is well cared for and a very good value."
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great vacation home and location for couples and families. Many amenities and close to New Bern tourists places.

2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Amazing stay!! Beautiful home 100% recommend
2021-11-01,5.0,Group trip,This was such an easy and great place to stay while we were in New Bern! The house is easy to find with plenty of parking for a couple of cars. The house was bright and updated and very clean. The one thing we found a bit lacking was the linens. There were only three bath towels for the entire house (and 6 guests) and the bedding was minimal and definitely for warmer temps. We had a bit of a cold snap while there and the house didn't get warmer than 65 so we were definitely chilly at night. But it was still a great stay and we'll happily be back. Having the back yard for our dog was also wonderful!
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The host John was great. We would definitely stay again the house was very clean and very roomy. It is a great value.
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a fantastic stay at John’s place. The house is very big inside, very clean, and has a large fenced in yard.
We were able to enjoy the water on the private beach area for lounging and fishing and even get the kayaks out for a ride. Our dog also felt very at home and was able to enjoy our vacation with us.
My elderly mom went with us and we were able to access the home easily and the beach area with her wheelchair.
If you’re looking for a quiet place to enjoy the outdoors and relax, this is the place.
John was a great host and responds quickly to any questions.
With the 3 houses on the property it would be a great place for a family trip."
2021-10-01,5.0,Group trip,Loved staying at Dot's Place!!! The entire family had a great time!!! Beautiful place! Definitely will be staying in the future!!
2021-10-01,5.0,Group trip,Awesome couple day getaway. Moved to new bern and stayed here while house was getting finishing touches. Would highly recommend!! Dog friendly with huge backyard !!

2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"John is a great host. Lovely, comfortable home. We wouldn’t hesitate to rent from him in the future. :)"
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Amazing trip and stay!!! Very clean and everything was exactly as described. Will be back for our next trip!
2021-08-01,5.0,Group trip,"We very much enjoyed our stay in John’s newly remodeled three bedroom home.
The open floor plan was lovely and there was great natural light. John was friendly and helpful…getting us a large pot to boil lobsters tails in when we needed it.
My husband and son spent many hours fishing from the dock and would have made great use of the kayaks if the weather would’ve cooperated.
We definitely look forward to renting from John again!"
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is a very beautiful house to stay, super comfortable, close to everything and pet friendly! We absolutely loved our in this place!"

2021-07-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"This is a great spot for a family getaway. My young kids loved playing in the river and on the beach, we definitely want to come again!"
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Dot's Place is a wonderful renovation of a 1940's -era home. John has kept the character of the home with the original real wood floors and doors, while updating the home with modern conveniences & style. The home is spacious enough for 6 people, but intimate enough for a smaller group. However, the biggest win for us over the Independence Day 2021 holiday was the beach - private, warm & shallow water (4ft deep out to 30 yards) for the kids, and calm! The fire pit, kayaks, and fishing dock were extra bonuses - an amazing time was had by all!"
2021-07-01,5.0,Group trip,We had an amazing trip!! House was better then we imagined and John was an excellent host and very responsive!! The private access to the beach was our favorite part!! We will definitely be coming back!!
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"John was a superb and gracious host. The pictures did not do the property justice. The house was not only beautiful but immaculately clean. The property was absolutely gorgeous and offered so much for our family to do. John made us feel welcome and had excellent communication. You can tell that he has poured his heart and soul into this property and it’s upkeep. We loved that we could bring our golden retriever and he had lots of room to run and play as well as a fenced in yard. The private beach was so beautiful and we loved that it was only a few steps from the house. John has thought of everything, right down to sand toys for the little ones. We will definitely be back again and we cannot recommend this place enough!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I asked Page if she had a background in hospitality because everything she did to make our stay more appealing suggested it. The cottage is charming without a single need overlooked. I noted the smallest of details, from the coatstand with canvas shoppers and an umbrella to throw rugs, a pour-over for my coffee, and sunscreen in the bathroom, which we forgot when we packed. Page went even further to personalize our experience with a kind note and a treat in the fridge. She invited me to use her outdoor grill and help myself to the herb patch growing right next to it. There was literally no stone overturned to make our experience memorable. We would gladly return!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful lodging in a great location
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Page was very responsive to our needs. Her place is so cute and cozy! She allowed an early check in.

Thanks so much Page!"
2024-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"If you're looking for a darling little getaway in the heart of New Bern, look no further! This cozy retreat is as charming as it gets. The space is not only clean and welcoming, but it's also thoughtfully decorated to make you feel right at home from the moment you walk in.
The location couldn't be better—it's within walking distance of everything New Bern has to offer. You can take a leisurely stroll through the historic downtown area, explore the quaint shops, or enjoy the many restaurants and cafes. Being able to walk to local attractions like Tryon Palace and Union Point Park is such a treat, making it easy to immerse yourself in the local culture and history without needing to drive anywhere.
The host is delightful, always ready to offer recommendations and make sure your stay is as enjoyable as possible. Whether you're visiting for a weekend getaway or a longer stay, you'll find this spot to be a relaxing and convenient base for all your New Bern adventures. Highly recommended!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,We had a wonderful stay! We enjoyed being able to walk downtown and not have to worry about parking. The place was quiet and secluded. Check in was a breeze and Page was great answering any questions we had. We hope to be back when time allows!
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We spent 4 nights in Page's cottage and it was fantastic! Cannot recommend it enough. The cottage is small but so well thought out and filled with anything you might need. An added bonus was the fully fenced in yard for our dog. So awesome!

We will definitely be back!"

2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This sweet cottage was everything it was listed as and more. It's beautifully appointed and incredibly peaceful. You walk down a small path to what seems like a fairytale cottage. The loft is just beautiful, and the bed and bedding are amazing. So comfortable, you just really don't want to get out of bed. The shower is small but mighty, and again, you just won't want to leave it.
The location could not be better. A short 3 block walk, and you are in the middle of a beautifully revitalized downtown. History, great restaurants, and shops to satisfy any shopper.
Thank you, Page, for sharing such a cozy and peaceful home away from home. We hope to come back for a revisit."

2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This home is an absolute gem and Bruce was a kind, communicative, and considerate host. The deck and dock alone are worth a stay. I spent nearly half a day there peacefully reading while bird watching and being hypnotized by the beautiful river. The space inside is full of surprises and you can tell how much love Bruce has put into the place that he built. There's a dozen interesting things to look at in every direction, while still managing to feel uncluttered and clean. It was comfortable, relaxing, and fun. We will definitely be back!"

Small space comfortable for 1 or 2. climb to upper bed is steep, bed comfortable with its own river view . neighborhood walkable, as area lovely country and roads are quiet. Be aware many of the neighbors have loose dogs that treated me politely. The peaceful place with a grade A view of nature that I hoped for.
new bern restaurant recommendations: Annabelle's for american fare, Chelsea for fancy. both very good food! i went to Aurora Fossil Museum and dug for fossils in their open pit, which was fun."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Bruce created beautiful place for visitors to escape the day to day grind, and is designed to unlock your imagination and tap into the child within us all. We will definitely recommend staying here for friends. Bruce is an excellent host with a kind heart and always willing to accommodate. It's quite a thing ....to wake up and watch the sunrise on the river, it makes you want to lay in bed and relax and make a cup of coffee and sit on the dock at the same time. I could go on and on this place has a personality all its own, and New Bern is a charming place that seems frozen in time in the best ways imaginable. DO NOT pass on the opportunity to imagine living like this everyday!"

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Words cannot express how awesome Bruce’s airbnb is! Let’s just say it was so awesome we added a day to our trip! It is nestled in the woods with a stunning view of the river. It will take your breath away! Nothing beats waking up and having a cup of coffee on the dock and enjoying the views! Bruce was super accommodating. Before we booked we let him know we have a rescue dog, Bandit, who doesn’t handle new people or other animals well, to make sure that was okay. Bruce said it was not a problem and the whole time we were there he kept his sweet pup on the leash and let us know when they were going to be out and about to make sure not to upset Bandit. This was our first time traveling with our dogs, so with him going the extra mile for us kept my mind at ease. If you are traveling to New Bern, Bruce’s airbnb needs to be the place you stay!"

2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Bruce was an amazing Host! More importantly an even better human being. Despite Tropical Storm Ophelia literally raining down on us he made us feel safe and checked in on us even in advance of arrival. He truly went above and beyond to ensure our stay was great. He even had a bag of tea candles hanging on the front door knob when we arrived so we would have light if we experienced a power outage-which we thankfully did not. Can’t thank Bruce enough and we will definitely be back‼️ Storm or no storm….nothing can keep us from coming back to the River House 👍🏼
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The River Watch is a real insider tip if you're looking for peace and relaxation. The veranda with direct access to the river invites you to linger and with the associated boats, the Trent River is great to explore.
Bruce is very accommodating and helpful, but still gives his guests a lot of space. It's hard to notice that he lives right next door.
We thoroughly enjoyed the stay, and highly recommend Bruce's place."

2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Charming cabin tucked away on a quiet inland river. Bruce is a friendly, accommodating, responsive host who gave us privacy but was also happy to talk and give us helpful pointers about this or that. The cabin is thoughtfully decorated and worked well for our little family, two adults, our college daughter, and our two dogs. The futon was comfortable and the fold-out couch worked great for our daughter. Nice linens and touches throughout. I especially appreciated the vintage/outdoorsy vibe. You don't have to leave the cabin interior to feel a sense of being near the water, but the dock and canoe are even more immersive. I took a walk around the neighborhood loop road and enjoyed the wildlife and solitude-lots of birds, geese, deer. Great space and New Bern was a fun place to explore too."

2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Our stay was amazing. Bruce is extremely accommodating and friendly. We had a relatively long stay so Bruce left us some extra linens and towels. He even brought over some equipment to help me fish. The place itself is super cozy and very inviting. The views of the river and surrounding area is to die for. I would highly recommend you stay here whether you plan on just hanging out by the dock or plan on spending your time driving around New Bern and the surrounding area.
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Bruce’s River Watch Retreat was a perfect place for a weekend getaway. The space was quaint and cozy with a breathtaking view of the river below. We felt right at home and will definitely be recommending this place to friends and family.
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We had an incredible time on the water at Bruce’s place. His photos don’t do it justice—it’s absolutely gorgeous.

We saw osprey, geese, Turkey vultures, as well as an owl right on the property. We also came across several turtles crossing the road to the property, deer, and a black bear cub right in the neighborhood!
Bruce has done a great job with the place. It’s very updated and clean. The fun and cool details in and around the cabin were the best part. The big windows were amazing to look out over the river from any spot in the cabin. It’s quaint and comfortable. We were surprised by how restful the futon in the loft and the pull-out-couch were for sleeping.
Bruce was an excellent host and was easy and fun to talk to. He was accommodating and laidback. He also always has a dog treat in his pocket for the doggos. Our pup loved playing with his sweet dog, Finn, and the few neighborhood dogs that would find there way over.

2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is our favorite Air BNB ever! It was the perfect relaxation retreat for my son & I. Once we were there, we never wanted to leave. There was so much to do & the views were breathtaking! We watched magical sunsets & sunrises every day that we were there. Even in a passing storm, the place was heavenly. My son played guitar on the dock, we grilled & ate dinner by the water, we played late night darts, we painted & read books & wrote poetry & song lyrics. It was much needed restful tranquility. Bruce was the perfect host & was so helpful in getting my son set up with the kayak, which he loved in exploring all that the area has to offer! I appreciated him taking the time. He was so friendly & fun to chat with, along with his sweet rescue dog. We were impressed with the work he has done himself to create such a gorgeous retreat & could have talked for hours just about the unique VW Van that he is restoring! Such a fantastic work of art! So grateful for this getaway & hospitality!"

hoping to be back!"

2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,PHENOMENAL! Want a secluded weekend away? Look no further. Bruce has thought of it all when it comes to this magical place.

Bruce met us and made us & our dogs feel at home. He explained how do you say heater. Later he answered questions about the TV too. Bruce told us about the ISS viewing possibly at dusk as the sun was setting and we appreciated the information.
Bruce made sure we were satisfied with our stay and it was open to any suggestions that we had to make the state better.
If we pass this way again, we would love to stay here again!"
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,A perfect setting for a relaxing last minute trip to New Bern with my two pups. The retreat had all the amenities needed but the uniqueness and eclectic artistically designed decor elements were what really made this spot stand out...in addition to the tranquil surroundings.

Bruce was extremely responsive and eager to assist in ensuring we had a wonderful stay. I will definitely be returning for more time at the River Watch Retreat!

2024-06-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Despite the house being dusty, everything was very neatly organized. The bathroom was not as clean as we expected. The bed was squeaky, which kept my husband and I awake at times, and the front door did not lock properly.

Overall, we enjoyed our stay."

High ceilings with some impressive overhead modern lighting fixtures in the splendid kitchen, great library seating area, cozy bedroom and deep bathtub,.. plus a greeting by the cats who seemed to have been queued to complete the postcard beauty of the cottage. And in the morning as we were leaving, the train lumbered by on the tracks that bisect the street (never saw or heard it until then),.. walking to the main street and back for our dinner accentuated the pleasantness of the entire stay. We felt our experience of the town was enhanced by staying at such a historic address rather than at a hotel. The rules were easy to follow.

Very glad we chose to stay here.
The description was spot-on and the place was more spacious than we had anticipated.
The decor was well-chosen to align with the historical nature of the house, but modern and uplifting.
Most everything we wanted was within walking distance and this encouraged us to “get our steps in.” So much to explore.
We got to see a train go by & were surprised how quiet it was.
The house is private and comfortable.
Communication was great and check-in/out was easy.
Additional points for labeling the light switches :-)
The water was hot and pressure was great.
We did not need to do laundry, but yeah, they have that too.
With so many modern upgrades, you almost forget the house has a long cool history.
So yes, definitely recommend!"

2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Place was great!
I'd recommend this to anyone and especially to those that like to walk the places they visit. Everywhere downtown is within 4 blocks. Tryon's palace, historic spots, museums, good food, shopping... it's all easily found close by! lots of great looking, historic buildings. A park and riverwalk also near enough to walk to.
If I was more observant I would have looked for tickets to the theatre that's across the street from the cottage.
If/when we come back to New Bern we'll definitely be staying here again!"

2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Wonderful stay.
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"A one bedroom one bathroom historic cottage and this place is relaxing. Whether your walking barefoot on the original plank flooring, taking in the views of historic houses in the area or walking along the Cape Fear. This place is located to do something or nothing at all. Your minutes from shopping or a leisurely drive down the coast. Jessica has outfitted the cottage with assorted pamplets and flyers of local businesses and if its just a weekend getaway she has a variety of books to read. Except for clothes, food and personal items needed, Jessica has really put the work in to make this place feel homey. I will definitely be wanting to come back this Spring."
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Jessica and Matt were great hosts. Very friendly and clear with instructions, tips and accurately described their homestead (they live next door with their children and pets).
The cottage was charming, clean and had many amenities. It was an easy walk to the historic downtown with shops and restaurants.
The train ran by twice when we were there. We heard it roll slowly by when we were outside and in the front living room. Never heard it when in the bedroom.
Will be back for a longer stay!"
2022-11-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Charming cottage stay in a quite location in New Bern for shorter stays.
Pros:
1. The cottage living room and kitchen area are bright and roomy
2. It was very clean and no smell of old wood furniture or boards even though the cottage is of heritage class
3. Easy to locate and it is within walking distance (under 10 mins) to New Bern downtown
4. Host is very responsive
Cons:
1. Size of the bathroom is a bit challenging for a comfortable use, not convenient for longer stays
2. Water drain speed in the shower tub was not quite right and needs to be rectified, the cleanliness of bathroom could be better overall
3. Was lacking equipment to iron clothes, this is a basic necessity if the place is more of a house setup offered to guests, it wasn't show stopper for us as we bought along our iron after enquiring with the host
Overall a charming place to stay with a unique cottage stay experience, minor challenges which can be overcome/rectified"

The place was super clean and exactly what we expected. While it is located right next to the families main residence, you still feel like you are in your own little world and there is a great sense of privacy.
