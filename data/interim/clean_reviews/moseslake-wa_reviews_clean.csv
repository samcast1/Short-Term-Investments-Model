2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,A nice cozy house!!
2023-09-01,5.0,Group trip,"This Airbnb was perfect for our vacation at Moses Lake. Gladys’s place is extremely clean, well put together and it felt just like home. We were even provided free breakfast which was a huge plus. I would definitely recommend this place if you are staying in Moses lake and which is roughly 5-10 mins from everything."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Perfect, is the only word to use. The listing was located so that it's easy to access everything Moses Lake has to offer. There was not another thing that we needed to feel safe and comfortable. The home is beautiful."
2023-08-01,5.0,Group trip,My friends and I absolutely loved our stay here. Gladys provided breakfast for us throughout our entire stay and we felt right at home. The home was absolutely beautiful and we had so much space to relax and get ready in the morning. Everything went smoothly and I would definitely stay here again.
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We had a great stay. Such a cute house with a lot of nice touches and included a ton of extras! Thank you for the hospitality during our stay

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"One of the cleanest houses I've been too. Everything smelt great, and we felt right at home. Enjoyed sitting on the back patio and relaxing. The beds were comfortable. Great location in town. Very quiet and peaceful. Not to mention what a great host. Just when I think a host couldn't get any better, they just took it to the next level. Thank you so much, would recommend to anyone looking in the area."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"The house was prestine and clean. It was the whole house, but several room where shut and locked due to this also being the house that host live it. There are camera's INSIDE the house which is a little weird. Great house to stay in, everything we needed for our stay!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Clean, cozy, lovely, thoughtful"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Nice place to stay.
2023-06-01,3.0,Stayed with kids,"I drove by the day before my rental. The outside was cute and clean except the back yard was torn up and under construction. When communicating with the owner the next day, I found out that the construction wasn't going to be finished in time for my rental. I felt it was going to be unsafe for my 2 year old granddaughter so I canceled the reservation. It was unfortunate that this happened, I was looking forward to my stay."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"probably the cleanest air BNB we have ever stayed at. beautiful home and environment. the free breakfast was extremely helpful due to how late we arrived, we didn't have time to stop at the store prior to check in. would 100% recommend."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Coming from staying in Seattle, Gladys’s home was a welcomed change. The house was so clean, spacious and warm. The bed was so comfortable and we really enjoyed having a place to relax before and after our concert at The Gorge.
Location was very convenient. We would recommend if you need a place to stay in the area.
Gladys was also very responsive and friendly, which made us feel right at home.
We couldn’t recommend it enough!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Group trip,"This airbnb is one of the cleanest ones I've stayed in! We traveled from Chicago, IL to catch a show at the Gorge and celebrate a friend's birthday.
It had all amenities listed available and the host was very responsive. Spacious and convenient. She even assisted in getting a surprise cake for our friend! Also, it includes complimentary breakfast during your stay.
Would definitely recommend this place if anyone is ever in the area. Thanks again for hosting!"
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Beat host I've ever had. The place was perfect and Gladyss was ultra responsive and helpful. We would not have had as good of a weekend as we did without the place being sonperfect and Gladyss making sure every detail was taken care of. Book this place immediately!!!
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,This was the most amazing stay we’ve had! Gladys made sure to put a lot of thought into the listing and it really shows. The little treats left for the kids and adults were so kind. The house was very comfortable and welcoming. The beds were very comfortable and the house was very clean.
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I highly recommend this home! We stayed here when visiting the area for a concert at the Gorge Amphitheater. I’m not a camper so this house was a comfort and had literally everything you’d need and then some! They thought of everything and even left little things to make the stay more enjoyable! A large kitchen for making meals, washer, dryer, comfortable beds, bikes, golf clubs and even stand up paddle boards. Way over the top with everything!
I also recommend the Saturday farmers market which is about 10 minutes away for souvenirs and fresh flowers.
It’s next to a fun water park. We took the SUP to Blue Heron Park about 15 minutes away and ate at Michael’s on the Lake which is only about 10 minutes. I also recommend that place. Everything you need is all within a mile and the Gorge was around 41 minutes away. There’s a lot to do in this little town and Gladys was extremely accommodating leaving everything to make this a stress free trip!"
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Amazing home! Gladys made us feel very welcome with all of the personal touches. She even provided a few local treats and sundries. We felt right at home! It’s a great area - very quiet and safe. We utilized the bikes and iSUPs - we biked from the house to Montlake Park and back and we used the iSUPs at Blue Heron Park (just a short drive from the house). We asked to have the golf clubs available to us as well, but didn’t have time to go to the driving range - next time for sure! Gladys was easy to communicate with and responded quickly. The house is close to plenty of restaurants (fast food or otherwise), grocery stores, gas stations, and is a quick drive to Downtown Moses Lake. I highly recommend staying at this place when you visit Moses Lake! We look forward to staying again sometime in the future!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Love staying here when we visit Moses Lake. such a cozy house and the view is spectacular.
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We had a blast at Darla's house. So much room for people and things, we were very comfie! We cooked every meal there, all of the basics are available and then some. The lake view is beautiful and the sunsets were breathtaking!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Great location. Wonderful view. Really great house. Definitely book again in Moses Lake.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Was easy to find perfect location to get to park where our kid was racing hydroplanes.
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Darla was a great host very freindly and helpful. The house was amazing beautifully put together. Clean and spacious. When we first arrived there was some soothing music playing and it was very welcoming. I would definitely stay here again.
And hats off to house keeping they did a phenomenal job preparing the house for us."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This was my second stay at Darla's beautiful home and I'm already looking forward to my next visit! Darla is a wonderful host - very communicative and friendly; and her home is perfect (with the most amazing view) if you are staying in the Moses Lake area.

I would highly recommend staying at Darla's if you want a quiet relaxing time with the most beautiful views. We will definitely be back.
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My family was in the area for a weekend of concerts at the Gorge Amphitheater and Darla’s house was a wonderful place to return home to each night. We enjoyed mornings on the deck and patio watching all the boats and jet skis on the lake, and appreciated the ease of arriving home to a peaceful place after several late nights. Would absolutely stay again next time we’re in the area."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Darla’s home was super clean, comfortable, and spacious. The lake views from the deck & living room picture window are gorgeous!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Group trip,"Darla’s place was perfect for our family. We were in town for my Dad’s graveside service. Darla was aware of the circumstances of our visit and was so kind, responsive, and accommodating. We wanted a place that would serve as a landing pad for all of us. The most wonderful part was the location, as we have extensive family history in that neighborhood. It was so special to be together with that familiar and breathtaking view! The beds were very comfortable and the layout provided opportunities for multiple groups/generations to gather in different spaces. The extra refrigerator downstairs made a big difference for us. Everyone agreed that we will absolutely gather there again, next time for happier circumstances. A million thanks, Darla!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Group trip,"From start to finish, Darla was an extremely friendly and responsive host. Darla allowed for flexibility of head count, finalized at check-in, as well as flexibility of check-in time to accommodate the start of the event we were attending at the Gorge Amphitheater. A remarkable step up from camping for events, I highly recommend Darla's spacious and homey abode."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Darla was very helpful and responded quickly to our needs. The place was a great place to stay. We loved sitting out on the deck watching shooting stars, the lake and sunset. She has plenty of comfortable indoor and outdoor seating to enjoy and there’s a tv in each room throughout the home. The home is in a great neighborhood."
2023-08-01,2.0,Group trip,The upstairs ac doesn’t work. And there is a nail on a bed. Very poor condition.
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Wonderful stay
2023-07-01,5.0,Group trip,"Great comfortable house with an amazing view. Lots of space for 4 adults and 2 teenagers. My nephews loved the upstairs room with the two queen beds and balcony. We enjoyed grilling and eating on both patios enjoying the beautiful view and sunsets. The bed we were in was comfortable and all the AC kept the house cool. Close to town for any grocery shopping and close to the park to check out the water. Darla was very responsive, the place was easy to find and check-in was easy."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"This place has THE best view of the lake. It had everything we needed to be able to make meals, spices and oils and well stocked with other essentials. Darla was also so lovely and accommodating for us to extend really short notice. Also a 1 minute drive down to the lake to swim and paddle board."

2022-08-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"Definitely a nice view! We were overall happy with the house. The deck off the master bedroom is fun, and the downstairs bedroom with the king and the seating area is really cute. Having two living rooms is great also. The house wasn’t quite as new as we expected from the pictures, but nice enough. Host was super responsive and accommodating. ☺️"
2022-07-01,5.0,Group trip,Darla is so incredibly nice and the property is beautiful. The views from the living room and some bedrooms is stunning overlooking the lake. The house was well appointed with everything we needed. It’s a great setup for a group. We had 4 couples and with 2 bedrooms up and 2 down it was a perfect setup. We even had a bed we didn’t use. I would 1000% stay here again.
2022-07-01,5.0,Group trip,The views really are as good as the description says!! It was nice to have our Air B’n’B match the description so well. Our expectations were definitely met and more. Bring some sun block if you plan on enjoying that upper deck as the PM sun can get pretty intense. This house was perfect for our relaxing adult only get away. I could easily see bringing our kids with us if we were to stay again in the future. We were in town for a concert at the Gorge. This was a great spot for us and our group of 6 enjoyed being able to comfortably relax and enjoy our time together. Thank you Darla for sharing your home!!

Communication was quick and professional.
House was amazing. Clean, roomy and amazing sunset views!

2021-12-01,5.0,Group trip,This house was so perfect for our trip here. We came for a RC race at the Grant County Fair Grounds and it was a 1 min drive. Can’t beat that! The house was spacious for the 5 of us and the view was amazing. Thank you Darla for being such a great host
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Beautiful home with a beautiful view. So impressed with the home and also with the host. Darla was very kind, caring, attentive, and communicative. We would love to stay at this home again. We only stayed for one night, and it wasn't enough. I can't say enough good things about this home and about the host. Highly recommend both!"
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"Darla was very accommodating for our large corporate group that required a long stint (4 months) of housing during a project in Othello. Coming from Eastern Canada, she made it very easy for us to trust and ensure we had a good stay without the ability to see the property before we arrived. She goes above and beyond to make you feel at home and get familiar with the surroundings. Would definitely stay again if ever in the area."
2020-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The house is conveniently located near the fair grounds in a quiet neighborhood. The view of the sunset is gorgeous and the deck issues lovely place to watch it. The lake was also lovely in the mornings. Darla was a great communicator. The bedrooms are on two levels with a bathroom on each level. Thank you Darla
2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We cant recommend these rentals enough!!! Everything was so perfect! Darla was such a blessing and went WAY above and beyond to make our getaway fantastic!

2020-08-01,5.0,Group trip,"Absolutely stunning. The house was absolutely beautiful with sweeping views of Moses Lake. Darla was the most kind and gracious host, going above and beyond to prove that spectacular hospitality is not dead. We will be back every time we are in Moses Lake."

2020-07-01,5.0,Group trip,House was great. Beautiful views and felt like home away from home. I'd recommend this place for sure.
2020-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Our second time to Sunset dreams & it was even better than the first! Always a pleasure to stay at our favorite spot on the lake. Can’t wait to come back again soon for more gorgeous sunsets on the patio & cruises on the lake. A++++
2020-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Has everything you need! Definitely recommend to anyone who wants a place to stay!
2020-07-01,5.0,Group trip,"The house was beautiful with all the needed things in place for visitors. Everything nicely arranged and planned for incoming guests, host response was prompt. Sunset view in evening was amazing. The house is very near to lake so if you are looking some water activities it’s a great location.
One issue we found was if guests move anything around the house like a blanket to maybe living room area, she does not take that well, we received a call claiming you have taken her blanket without looking around the house or asking her cleaning staff, as later they told her it was right there in the house itself, which is not something visitors should be worried of when they are actually looking for fun times. Due to this confusion we stop after couple of miles trying to help her locate a blanket due to which missed out, on joining a planned surprise birthday.
Overall, I would say our stay was perfect and Darla was great apart from the above event. I would still book at her place again if get a chance to visit Moses lake again and will recommend other guests as well as, confusion may happen sometimes :)"
2020-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Sweeping hilltop vistas might seem like a tall order in Moses Lake, but this house ranks with some of the best view houses I've ever stayed on. Perched on a high bluff directly above the lake, with panoramic west-facing views all the way to Rainier and spectacular sunsets. Ample back lawn to enjoy the view from, plus a balcony off the master suite and a covered patio for outdoor dining. And our daughter especially loved the swingset."
2020-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"It was a great experience for us. The house is beautiful, specious and clean. Darla is a wonderful host."
2020-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Darla’s place was absolutely amazing & we LOVED our time there! So much space to spread out & the view off the deck is wowza. The home was clean & cozy & the beds comfy. You will really feel at home & cared about by your hosts. Our family had a wonderful time here & will definitely be back again!! A++

2019-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We are currently trying to come up with excuses to have another vacation towards Moses Lake because this is an incredible place to stay for the price. The beach decor makes it feel like a get away home, the location and space is incredible, and the photos are not kidding about the view! Our group showed up and decided to delay plans a bit just so we could sit on the back porch and enjoy the sunset over the lake. Incredible- would stay again."
2019-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"The house is wonderful! A king bed overlooking the lake or the master bedroom with it’s own porch. Other than the multiple large rooms, tasteful decorating and wonderful views, Darla was an amazing host. She took care of everything and was extremely accommodating.amazing home, amazing host!"

2023-12-01,5.0,Group trip,We met family for Christmas and Dave’s place was awesome! So much better than a hotel would have been to spend time with family members. Dave was hospitable and was helpful for our first Air B&B stay! I totally recommend!
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We're already talking about how we hope Dave's place is available when we return to Moses Lake. Everythingwe needed, and then some, was under one roof. We also appreciated the location a short distance from the freeway, yet incredibly quiet. Beds and linens were perfect. Loved the fans in both rooms (Unit 2). Having an ensuite in each bedroom was very convenient. The air conditioning was efficient and quiet. Kitchen had all we needed for meal prep. Ice cube trays were appreciated. Sliding glass doors upstairs and downstairs were great for fresh air. Dave was a fabulous host who answered questions promptly and was immediately helpful and a pleasure to communicate with. Hope to have a chance to stay again one day."

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"If you’re looking for an immaculate, quiet, comfortable, well-priced place to stay, this is it. The a. c. was great and the acoustics made for restful sleep and quiet time. We’re a married couple and two friends, but a family of four to six would work well, too. We highly recommend Dave’s condo."

(We left the fan for the next guests)

2022-08-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,"I wish I could give 4.5 stars because it really was a great stay. The homes is just as stunning in person as shown in the photos. Each room was really spacious that not having the master didn't mean you'd be sleeping in a small crowded room.
The AC does take time to cool the home, so keep that in mind on 100+ days. Never hurts to confirm that the AC will be on when you arrive. Once it gets going though, you and your dog(s) will be so happy you booked this property with Jessica.
We were able to reach Jessica when we had any questions and she was very responsive. Her home was a great spot for those of us that work remotely. Sometimes I would need to step outside to take a work call which could mean excess background noises from neighbors. However, that wasn't an issue. Even at night no rowdy neighbors.
House rules are located in a binder. They were reasonable and easy to follow.
Great area with local breweries, state parks, lakes, amazing hiking trails and more. Dog friendly property. The backyard trees are great to keep a portion shadded and cooler even during warm days.
Jessica is a great host. No hesitation to book this property again in the future. We would recommend this property to others. Thank you, Jessica!"

Very easy check-in and I’m grateful they had soap dispensers in shower. Amazing bathroom!

2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Christie and Dustin’s place was exactly as described and such a peaceful stay! I had the best sleep here out of all of the places we stayed on our trek from Ontario. My partner used the bed in the loft and said it was comfortable too! Beautiful neighbourhood and we felt very safe. Bonus points for being so close to I-90!
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,It was so wonderful to come to their little cottage in a very peaceful setting after a very long drive. I am an amputee so things are more difficult for me than for most but I knew that I wouldn't be able to get into the shower ahead of time and didn't need to shower the one night I stayed there. I loved the small touches and the obvious care they take of the place that showed forth throughout. It was a very comfortable bed and you could adjust the air temperature easily. I would highly recommend this place but would say that it is not the best if you are a wheelchair user and need to bathe.

I messaged a few weeks out from our stay and requested early check in as we were attending a nearby festival (note - only 30 minute drive from gorge amphitheater) and wouldn’t get in til late. They were super kind and allowed us to check in as early as we liked as no one was staying the night before. They were quick to respond and the place was clean and tidy.

We spent a lot of time at the venue, but always looked forward to coming ""home"" to the AC and a hot shower. The house had more than enough space for two couples with three bedrooms, two bathrooms, a large living room (with comfy couches!), kitchen, dining room, and a cute covered patio. The entire place was very clean and just about everything we needed was provided (towels, soap, hair dryer, dishes, coffee, etc). While it may seem like this home is in the middle of nowhere, the location is actually pretty convenient. There is a Wal-Mart, grocery store, gas, and local restaurants about 10-15 minutes away."

2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Such a beautiful home with a great view. The house has 4 bedrooms, and each one has direct access to a bathroom with a shower / tub which is a great thing when you're sharing this house with other families. The bathrooms were spotless, soap, shampoo, conditioner, and shower gel dispensers were full everywhere. The master bedroom had a king size bed, and one of the largest bathrooms I've see. Two other bedrooms had queen size beds and one had bunk beds that were perfect for the largest family of the group. The mattresses were too soft for my taste, but no one else in the group had any complains about it.
The living room had a large TV with a home theater attached that made watching movies super fun.
The kitchen had very nice appliances, and was full of cookware and utensils.
We didn't get to spend a lot of time outside because it was sub freezing, but that made it perfect for some sledding activity in the huge backyard.
Finally, James and Crystal were super reponsive and friendly."

2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"The house was clean and well decorated. Using the dock in front the house was so much better than launching the boat everyday or leaving it in public moorage.

2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"My parents (almost 80 years old), my aunt, my husband and our dog stayed for a long weekend at Rene's place. My brother lives in Moses Lake and he was hosting a family get together.
The home was perfect for us. 3 separate bedrooms, with comfy beds. Our dog sleeps in a crate, which was easy to get in and out of the house and bedroom. I loved the clean and private hot tub with some therapeutic jet options. The fully fenced backyard was perfect. The neighborhood was great to walk the dog in too.
We also enjoyed the large kitchen. It is shown in the pictures, but there is not a traditional table and chairs. the kitchen island is large and seats 3, plus there are additional stools you can add. We utilized the additional fridge in the garage, it was helpful getting items together for the event at my brother's.
it is a quick drive into downtown Moses Lake where you can pick up supplies. I would stay at Rene's again."

2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place was 1000% worth everything I spent, down to it being absolutely beautiful. To Rene being very responsive and helps with anything if you have a problem. We had the WiFi go out the first night I was there, I messaged her the next morning not even 10 minutes & she was on top of it. She is very sweet & same with her husband. I had my service animal with me & usually he’s anxious when we aren’t sleeping in our homestead. But he felt right at home also they do have a dog food & water bowl there for if you do bring your furry friends. I highly recommend staying here & I most definitely plan on staying again in the future."

2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Gaylene's place was very adorable and the perfect size for me and my son staying there. We've previously had some not so great experiences at other Airbnb stays, but I can't think of a single thing I could complain about staying at Gaylene's. Honestly, I wish I could teleport her place to some other places my son and I take road trips to. We were just here for my son to take his SAT so I doubt I'd have a chance to stay again, but if ever I'm in Moses Lake, this would definitely be the first place I check! You won't be disappointed!!!"

The recommendations for nearby activities was great, so my boys and I decided to head to the lake and the sand dunes on a whim and had a wonderful time.
The Wonder Hut was clean, beautiful, and fully equipped with what we needed—it was even nice to see some oatmeal proceed for breakfast! When it was time to leave after our stay, my boys didn’t want to leave “Mom, can we stay? I’m so comfortable here!”
Thanks for a great stay!"

There was alot of storage, in case you would like to store your bags out of sight. there's a large laundry room and a kitchen with full size appliances. The bathroom was large too, with lots of storage. This place was great for us. it was about 30-40 minutes easy commute to the gorge for a concert.

2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We .ares last minute reservation on Friday of Memorial Day weekend and asked for an early check-in. I run an Airbnb myself and I know how difficult accommodating this request can be. We were in Moses Lake visiting a dying friend so we really needed some kindness. The motel we stayed in the night before was more expensive, not as nice or as quiet, but was already full the second night. Gaylene was a real life saver. I highly recommend Gaylene as a host. Her place is sparkling clean and well stocked."

The trees on both sides of the house provided some nice shade in the afternoons. It is well-located and close to downtown. Parking right outside the front door made unloading and loading easy. It's very private. The bed and sofa bed are very comfortable. The AC unit kept the place blissfully cool. Everything's spotless. The shower is nice and had great water pressure. Checking in and out were a breeze. Thanks so much for having us, Gaylene!"

2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Wonderful place, very clean and accommodating. Good lighting and use of space.
For what it's worth, when I put in the given address into my iPhone's Maps app, it sent me to the fire station on the corner. The place itself is about a quarter mile further down the road, towards the water tower. This is a heads up for other who might encounter the same issue, this obviously isn't within the Host's control."

Thanks so much, Eric and Chastity."

They had a generous lot of pantry items to fill in for things we didn't bring. The Keurig was well stocked. Plenty of extra towels and anything you could possibly need was there. If you are nitpicky and we are not, I suppose you could critique that the cabinets were golden oak and maybe that's not your favorite color. wonderful stay."
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Beautiful house, great location. It had pretty much everything we could want or need with the small & very inconsequential exception of a hairdryer.

She let us check in early because we can all the way from the western part of Washington and let us check out around 12pm. The beds were really comfy, there were labels for where everything in the kitchen was. They also had a binder with the wifi password, the door code, the gate code, activities to do around Moses Lake, and pictures of Mose lake. Everything about the house was phenomenal, the rooms are super spacious, and I love how everything was organized and labeled. I would definitely recommend to stay at this home!!!

Sincerely,

We were only passing through Moses Lake and had never been. It is set in an industrial area but don""t let that dissuade anyone from booking. The community is gated, well lit and very quiet. Very close to Blue Heron park and jumping back onto I 90. The fireplace worked perfectly, my sons enjoyed as we came in late from the snow. Your place was a diamond in the rough. Thanks for a great stay."

2021-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"As other reviews have mentioned, this place is sparkling clean! New, modern furniture and very stylish decorations. It is one of the cleanest places including hotels that I have ever stayed in! The kitchen has everything you need for cooking except a toaster, we used the oven but not as convenient if you are cooking other items. Due to Covid, there was no indoor dining at restaurants so we decided to use Door Dash for delivery. Even though this house is in a gated location, we had no difficulty getting delicious, hot food delivered! Since it was a cold and snowy, we were looking forward to using the fireplace but upon arrival it wasn’t working. The owners quickly responded to my text and even FaceTime to see if they could help us get it going. We couldn’t get it working but I appreciated the owners help and quick response. Highly recommend this rental!! I think this location would be even more amazing in the summer."

The back yard is just a stone's throw away from the lake, what else can I ask? The house is large, clean and well furnished. The owner left extra snacks and drinks. Netflix, Prime Video and etc. make it feel like home.
We didn't have a clear plan where to go when we left home. We had been to Moses Lake more than once. So we ended up spending most of the time in the house doing nothing, and that turned out to be one of the best vacations!"

The appliances were newer, clean and upkeep. A fully stocked linen closet was a very nice bonus. Located in a quiet neighborhood meant we had 0 disturbances during our stay through the nights. Luckily for us it was very close to where we were. If you Plan to visit the fairgrounds this is a perfect place as the commute was 3 minutes or less. It was also outfitted with a nice living room TV and couch for watching your favorite shows or movies if you have some down time. There are quite a few restaurants nearby, and you are also not far out of town. I would recommend this location to anyone traveling into town!"
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We booked for one night with our baby and dog. As we arrived, it appeared such a basic little house on an OK street, but once inside we were very pleased with how updated and welcoming it felt. It’s indeed very tiny, but the kitchen and living room felt spacious. There was a cupboard of coffee and tea and a bookshelf to browse. I liked the big mirror on the wall in the bedroom, my baby like the chic light fixtures in the bathroom, my husband liked the kitchen which had everything we needed. The backyard was great for our dog to run around and the location was a very short drive to a dog park, too."

Driving the I-90 to the Gorge was a breeze each day! There is also a local Walmart to grab any last minute food and supplies for our trip which was very convenient."

Their home was located in a great neighborhood away from lots of noise yet still very close to the city, Moses Lake, making everything close when getting food and groceries. Although our stay was super short, I wish that we could have stayed longer. The home was very comfortable and I felt right at home. Robert was a very good host. He was flexible with check in and I loved how he was able to accommodate my dog. I loved the decorations inside the home too. They were simple and not too overwhelming. I enjoyed looking at his decorations, and his backyard was a nice added feature. Thank you for the snacks! I would stay again!"

Great location for any event being held at the Grant County Fairgrounds!"
2023-06-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"We loved our stay here! It was a perfect location to drive back and forth to the Gorge, where we were attending a three day festival. We preferred Moses Lake to any of the other surrounding towns because the drive home had no twists and turns, and was so easy to navigate even in the dark after the shows.
Robert’s home had everything we needed and was very clean. I’d say it could use a little bit of TLC to really stand out, with more attention paid to the smaller things that would go above expectations, but nothing that hindered our stay in any way. We’d certainly come here again if we find ourselves back at the Gorge."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Nice little house in Moses Lake. Huge fenced yard my dog enjoyed

2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Loved this Airbnb!!! It felt so cozy and welcoming. It was as if I never left home!
The living/dining room is so spacious. There's a big tv and sound bar for watching shows/movies and listening to music (we definitely utilized this A LOT during our stay!!). The kitchen looks newly remodeled and very clean. One thing to be mindful of is the low water pressure in the kitchen sink but this didn't hinder anything for us all! We used the dishwasher to clean our dirty dishes and the water faucet by the stove to heat up large portions of water.
Bedrooms and bathroom were nice, clean and comfortable!
Will definitely be staying here if we're ever in Moses Lake again! Thanks Bob and Bonnie! :)"

We had our husky/ lab mix and our chocolate lab with us that thoroughly enjoyed the fenced big back yard. The yard was secure and safe for them to run around while we were able to lounge outside on the deck seated at the outdoor table.

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We booked a last minute trip to stay at Scott & Alyssa’s place and it was wonderful!

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We stayed for 2 nights, had a group of 13 people who were a mix of ages from 53-9 years old and EVERYONE had a fabulous time. The house was well-equipped with plenty of activities, i.e. board games, ping-pong, nerf guns and all sorts of balls for outside for all to engage in. Scott and Alyssa were responsive and helpful all throughout. We had to reach out to them once during our stay because the jacuzzi stopped working, but they came out as soon as they were able to and tried to fix it. Funny thing is after about an hour, it turned back on on it's own.
I highly recommend their home. Thank you, Scott and Alyssa for helping us create new memories."
2024-04-01,5.0,Group trip,"This has been the most beautiful home and location that we’ve had the privilege of staying at.

2024-02-01,5.0,Group trip,"The house was extremely welcoming, cozy and gave a true feeling of home. This get away was to celebrate my daughter’s 16th birthday with 4 of her friends. They had plenty to do to keep entertained (ping pong/pool table, hot tub and basketball court). During the warmer months will add even more adventures to enjoy. Scott was very accommodating and did many things to make sure our stay would be memorable for all of us. Each area of the house was well thought out, the beds were amazing and if you enjoy a good soak the upstairs claw tub is definitely where it’s at. 😊.
I would absolutely recommend this house for all types of stays and couldn’t imagine any person leaving disappointed.
Thank you both for helping me create some great memories for our daughter."
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"It was what we were looking for. There was exploring on the lake front,basket ball,nerf guns,indoor games. Lots of fun for boys and adults. We've stayed in several but this was probably the cleanest and our host was probably the best we've had."

Nicky has all of the linens, cleaning products and extra touches we needed to have a comfortable stay. All we had to do was show up! The little deck is a great place to unwind and relax with each other. The pool area is very clean and comfortable as well and we saw some beautiful sunsets from the property. Nicky was quick and friendly with a couple of questions I had and she was respectful of our privacy. I highly recommend Nicky's Lakeside Layover!!"

The condo looks brand new- so much thought went into furnishings and it was so well stocked with kitchen appliances and dishes. Comfy beds and immaculate kitchen and bathrooms.
We love to hike and Nickey directed us to an urban trail right outside the condo. It was a great suggestions and we walked for about 4 miles.
I highly recommend the Paradise Bar and Grill. You can walk there and it is right on the lake.
We will definitely be “laying over “ here again on our way to Spokane or Idaho. But we found Moses Lake is a great destination too. Especially if you like fishing and hiking."

Place was very clean and had so many extras! Yummy coffee, tea, cold water and candy. The candy hit the spot when my friend had a hypoglycemic event.
The patio was delightful and what a view!

Would definitely recommend."

2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This place was clean, comfortable and affordable. I was solo on this trip but this place would have been so much fun with a group of people to use all of the games provided. There is plenty of parking for your truck and boat, or whatever you might be hauling. I had a little issue with the keypad on the door but only because the sun was at the perfect angle to make it difficult to view the screen. The host noticed I was having issues and was quick to try and help via the Ring doorbell. The beds might be the most comfortable I've ever slept in, not kidding.
For the price, this place can't be beat. I will stay here again next time in out this way."

Our two kids were with us and they kept busy playing pool, shuffleboard and of course they loved Pac-Man 😍 The beds were comfy and we slept well. The rest of the apartment was just as comfy. The bathroom had lots of little extras on hand which was a nice added luxury. We appreciated the snacks they had in the kitchen with us getting late after a 3-hour drive. Norm and Lisa have done a beautiful job with the apartment!! We would definitely stay again whenever we're in Moses Lake. Hopefully it will be in warmer weather so we could take advantage of the pickle Court in the backyard!!"

They were thoughtful in offering great toiletries, games, art supplies, and snacks. This was one of the best airbnbs we have stayed at. Thank you Norm and Lisa for exceeding our expectations."
,,,"If you enjoy being discriminated for your legit service animal AND having cameras hidden all around your rental, this place is perfect! Though clean and comfortable, we will never book here again for complete invasion of privacy and rude hosts."
,,,There was a rat running through the living room and a rat shit on the pillow in the master bedroom. We brought a small dog and left him in the truck which there’s no rules of saying he can’t stay in the truck called us all ours through the night from 1am-4am making us leave asap. Hospitality was horrible.
