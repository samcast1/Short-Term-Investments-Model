2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was a great place to stay for a quick weekend vacation. The location was great - close to Grand Haven and Holland - and there was lots to do! Very cozy and nice place, with lots of special touches. Would definitely stay again!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Perfect, clean, quaint place for a solo work trip (and within walking distance to a great coffee shop/lunch place). I'll be back!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,Jill's loft was very nice. The space was clean and had everything you need. It is in a good location to walk to many coffee shops/restaurants as well.
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Just returning from a wonderful 2 night stay at Lee & Jill's loft. It was easy to find and access and from the moment we walked in, had a great vibe to it. One of our favorite stays to date!. Everything was spotless, the loft was wonderfully decorated featuring a fantastic TV and kitchen that had everything we needed to cook a few meals. Their were detailed instructions and rules, tips on local eateries and a nice history of the loft and the area. Felt very safe, the neighbor across the street introduced himself. Very nice man. All in all, we just loved this stay and the areas we explored from Muskegon down to Grand Haven and Holland. Thank you Lee and Jill!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Perfect Place!
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very cute place and worth the money! Everything you need for a great stay. Close to downtown and various restaurants. I would definitely stay here again! üòä
2024-04-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Thanks for the great apartment. I was in town for work and needed someplace to just collapse once I left the jobsite. This fit the bill. Super clean and and a quite neighborhood.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"We have a great stay at Jill‚Äôs place. The instructions were very clear and the place was wonderfully stacked. However, the only thing that was a little inconvenient was the mattress. I have back pain problem and the mattress doesn‚Äôt requisite support for someone with back problem, so if you don‚Äôt have back problems, no need to worry at all. I would recommend the stay."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,Gorgeous place! It was perfect for a little getaway!
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I had a lovely stay at the loft. It was super cute, well stocked, and comfortable. Parking was simple, and getting inside was straightforward. I would stay here again."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,great host
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is a wonderful location, walking distance to restaurants and other amenities. View of Muskegon Lake. Description and photos are accurate. Comfortable and spacious efficiency. Jill and Lee did a wonderful job designing this space, with lots of thoughtful touches and generous amenities."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My stay was wonderful! The place was so cozy and clean, I felt right at home. Perfect for my weekend get away, I would recommend to anyone looking for a great comfortable stay in this area!"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,It is right in the middle of lots to do. very peacful and quiet neighborhood. Jill and Lee were quick to respond to the only issue we had via the description we though access to loft was through the back porch door but it was and is through the front porch door located on the right hand side of the driveway. Parking for the loft is on the left side of the house. Other than that the loft was fantastic. Hosts were very responsive and on our departing day we got some snow and the driveway and footpath where we were instructed to park was shoveled. The place is great and the hhe hosts were fantastic. If you are coming to Muskegon to enjoy the great outdoors this loft is a great spot to kick back and enjoy after a day's adventure.
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I enjoyed my stay, Jills place is so comfy and cozy. Very quiet neighborhood. I was thoroughly impressed!"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed over a week,Second time staying here! It‚Äôs great! Close to everything!
2024-01-01,5,Stayed one night,Will most likely be back because of the comfort provided! Great little loft just the right mood for a getaway. Highly recommend this gem!
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"One of the best stays I‚Äôve had on air bnb. Awesome unit! Very clean with everything you would need to make it feel like home. Quiet area of Muskegon, just blocks from downtown."
2024-01-01,5,Stayed over a week,I enjoyed another great stay with Jill! Such a comfortable place to enjoy some time away. Thank you!
2023-12-01,5,Stayed one night,Great spot.
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"JILL‚Äôs place was exactly what she said it would be and more. It was very easy to find and to enter. Upon entering, she had turned on some lights for me and even had a cute little Christmas up in the space. The kitchen was functional and she provided a cute little baskets of goodies, bottle of wine and a thank you note for staying there. I would definitely book this again."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Lee and Jill were great hosts! The place was very cute and cozy.
2023-11-01,5,Stayed one night,Clean and easy to find little pad in the heart of Muskegon. Walkable to downtown bars and restaurants yet still quiet enough to get a good nights rest. Very reasonably priced.
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Perfect place! Awesome, in fact! Loved the location, the view and the amenities were more than expected! Will be back!The hosts are the best! This place is warm and cozy! You will love it!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"A very cozy and quiet loft. Perfect for a Mom-cation or quick getaway for a couple to relax and recharge, (we are local, just 15 minutes south), but if your coming from out of town you won‚Äôt find a better place! Enjoy historic Muskegon, just blocks from Muskegon lake and the downtown area. Due to uncontrollable circumstances, I was not able to be there as much as I wanted to, but my wife absolutely loved it.
10/10 will definitely book again!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I was in need of a few days retreat and coming back ‚Äúhome‚Äù to Muskegon and Jill‚Äôs place was exactly what I needed. The space was so cozy, uniquely decorated and so purposefully situated. Everything I needed and didnt know I needed was taken care of. The basket of snacks in the kitchen was such a nice touch! The spot is located about a block from a beautiful coffee shop, as well as to the Muskegon Lake trail. Book it! Explore! Enjoy!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I felt right at home when I walked in. It‚Äôs charming and comfortable. I needed a place that day and they were responsive and welcoming. I‚Äôd definitely stay with them again.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Really enjoyed the space. The bed was comfortable and liked that they left snacks and wine for me.
The view from the office space is really nice as you are getting work done. Very good space."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Cozy place for two people with everything you need. The kitchen is adorable, the water pressure in the shower is fantastic, and everything was as clean as can be. Close to everything that is downtown Muskegon, and a perfect spot for me and my daughter."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Love an upstairs, 3 room secluded walk up studio apartment ? This is for you- plus a workspace mini loft - keep business separate from the fun! Details and character are everywhere- the push button light switches and the rattan stair step covers were so fun, then add cool sinks and faucets and views of Muskegon Lake from each northern window‚Ä¶ coffee shop around the corner, specialty sandwiches st the corner- so much to enjoy at you abode- then you get to move on and around town too- as a former resident of the city, I truly enjoyed this location and comfort ability of the neighborhood."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Loved my stay here! I was in Muskegon performing at a music festival, and Jill‚Äôs place was perfect ‚Äî clean, quiet, and Jill was quick to respond to any questions I had. Highly recommended!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Loved the place.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I really enjoyed staying in this gorgeous historic house. There was a booklet left to show the history and show different things going on. The host was so understanding and amazing because I had issues flying in due to weather and was still able to get in the house and sleep that night! A great place to stay if you're visiting the area worth every penny.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great little place..Met all of our needs while in the area for a family reunion. Easy parking, easy stairs to walk up to, comfortable bed and linens, nice cold a/c, good wifi, good water pressure in the shower and kitchen. Nice kitchen area with the basic stuff. Two things that I wish the unit had , 1-an ironing board (hard to iron in the bed a dress shirt) and 2- wish it was dog friendly so I can bring my little one with me but other then that it is FANTASTIC place to spend a couple of nights."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great hosts and a cute, cozy loft, perfect for a couple. Lots to do at the lake too."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Jill was a super helpful and responsive host. She went out of her way to connect us with a captain friend of hers so that we could have a ‚Äúsunset on the lake‚Äù experience, (Aquastar wasn‚Äôt available the two days we were there.)
The place is adorable and convenient. We slept comfortably and had great hot showers in the mornings. There was a Keurig machine, but no coffee pods provided, so be sure to bring your own or plan to go out. There is a wonderful coffee shop right around the corner called the Coffee Factory.
We had read good things about Pere Marquette beach, but we found the food at the Deck average at best and the music a bit loud for our taste. The portions are gigantic and a lot of food gets wasted. The beach itself was beautiful, but crowded and it took us a long time to snag a parking spot. We had a much more pleasant beach experience when we drove up to Pentwater. That town is gorgeous and quaint. The town of Muskegon is a bit run-down with dilapidated buildings."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We had a great stay! Everything was as described and it was perfect for a get away weekend. She‚Äôs super responsive and easy to communicate with! Everything I‚Äôd want in an Airbnb!
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Jill gave perfect instruction on check in and check out. She let us know when the power was out while we were out and it was on before we got back. No bathroom light or overhead light the last night, but everything else worked great. Very nice place."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Fantastic coffee shop a block away, definitely check out the Coffee Factory! A great location with easy walk downtown and to nearby park."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Jill was an awesome host! The cozy area was great for a two night stay while visiting the muskegon area for an event. We are glad we were able to find a more reasonable priced place to stay during that weekend as prices are very high during that time. We will look into coming back next year.
The reduced cleaning fee is appreciated although it does come with a few reasonable cleaning tasks upon checkout. Would probably perform those anyway so we enjoyed the classic AirBnB feel."
2023-07-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"We had a great time at Jill and Lee's place! Easy to find and walkable to bars and restaurants in town. The WiFi was a little unreliable, unfortunately, so we couldn't get as much work done as planned - but there were plenty of other things nearby to keep us busy!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This space had great vintage charm with all the modern updates we needed, including a lovely kitchen and bathroom and a large TV. It was clean, cozy, and quiet, conveniently located to the beach and downtown Muskegon. The perfect place to crash in-between our vacation activities! Perfect for a couple. We will definitely be back!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,Jill was a great host and personalized our stay to match our needs! She is extremely responsive and very helpful. The place is also very beautiful and well decorated!
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Jill's place is a cozy loft. We were only there for two nights, so it was perfect for our needs. Check-in/out was a breeze. Jill also had a great guest book with all kinds of information on places to see, restaurants to try, and local attractions.
Muskegon has many wonderful spots to explore and is close to Grand Rapids and Holland."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Jill and Lee has a lovely Loft. Very clean. Jill and Lee checked it with us every day. We had a great stay and we highly recommend their facility. Very close to Muskegan Lake and downtown. We will be back
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Absolutely fantastic stay. Very close to downtown and the beach. The Coffee Factory around the corner was an awesome little spot that makes a mean french soda. Would definitely stay again!
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Jill and Lee's place was the perfect home base for my weekend visit! I spent most of the days away from Muskegon, but having a comfortable bed and peaceful neighborhood to retire to at night made my visit incredibly relaxing and provided just the reset I needed for each day's activities. I had numerous delays flying in to Grand Rapids, but as I kept Jill updated on my changing arrival, each response was prompt as well as sympathetic and I had no problem getting in once I finally landed. The bed was VERY comfortable, the A/C kept the space at a great temperature, and the water pressure made each shower totally refreshing. The kitchenette is accurately described as such, so your best meals will be outside of the unit, but it's perfect for snacks or preparing anything simple that won't generate a lot of food waste. I especially appreciated the welcome note and the bottle of wine (which I unfortunately never got to enjoy) they had set out for me - a welcome greeting after nightmare travel!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Jill and Lee's place was perfect for our short stay - located centrally to everything we needed to do and every place we needed to be. The loft itself was cozy, the bed and couch both wildly comfortable; the AC and all amenities easily kept us comfortable.
Jill was on top of all communication: super friendly, helpful, and above all, very quick to reply. 10/10 would absolutely stay at Jill and Lee's properties again!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Such a nice place to stay. The bed was comfortable. Very close to bars and restaurants and Lake Michigan. Jill was very responsive when I had a question. Would highly recommend staying here.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Jill was super communicative and so accommodating! The apartment was clean and cozy and they left us a sweet note and made us feel so welcomed!! 10/10 would recommend. Jill and Lee are certainly super hosts! Thank you two!!
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My friend and I felt right at home! It was super cozy. Also, the host was very responsive and welcoming. Overall a great experience and I hope to come back!"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,I loved the location of this unit!! Private and cozy. Its a very nice spot to go to and relax. Also the bed is so comfy!! We really had a hard time leaving so there are plans to go back for sure!
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This was a great place to stay. Very cozy and comfortable!
2022-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This little cozy apartment by Jill and her husband truly felt like a home away from home. Even the little details were great. A great selection of pots, pans and utensils along with bathroom toiletries and a comfortable, warm bed. Jill and her husband were great and make a little booklet of all the rules, recommendations of the area and a little about them. Truly a great place to stay and will visit again, if you're thinking about staying in Muskegon I'd definitely recommend Jill's apartment ‚ô•Ô∏è"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This rental was clean and comfortable. The water pressure and temperature was delightful. A coffee shop was within walking distance as well was the lake. I hope to come back in the summer.
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,It was the perfect weekend getaway
2022-10-01,3,Stayed a few nights,Comfy beds.. worked well for what we needed..
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The place was great. Clean and a great location. Lee and Jill were very welcoming. I would definitely stay again if I‚Äôm ever in the area.
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We stayed here for the Irish Music Festival. It was clean, close, and a great deal! The mattresses were super comfy. The walk to downtown was relatively easy. Off-street parking was great, too!"
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very relaxing place to stay. My family and I enjoyed it very much and would definitely come again.
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We had a great weekend away here! The location was perfect for all the things we wanted to do. The place was accurately listed and exactly what we were looking for. And the extra touches/candy left for us was greatly appreciated üòã
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Nice spot, close to lots of nice spots near the lake! Comfy beds, nice AC, host was very responsive, thanks again. Only thing to note is that the stairs to the loft are pretty steep so just a heads up for older ppl"
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,A great location to stay at. Reliable communication with hosts. Was very comfortable
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The cutest loft with such comfy beds and a nice place to stay for a weekend getaway to Michigan. Its hard to find spots near the lake in the lower part of Michigan during the summer and for a good price! This spot has it all. Plus the hosts are very welcoming and left surpirses and a check list to make your stay seamless! 100% reccomend this little loft!
2022-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,We loved this location. It was perfect for a quick trip over to the beach and close to a lot of good restaurants!
2022-07-01,5,Group trip,Great location. Very clean and great communication!
2022-07-01,2,Stayed with kids,"The place was not too bad. the location was okay. however keep in mind if you stay and there is any issues what so ever your host will be very rude.
I stayed for 2 days with 2 toddlers and felt absolutely disrespected upon check-out and the hosts made me feel very unwelcome. Also keep in mind that the hosts live downstairs to the airbnb and the directions upon check-in were confusing and not very descriptive.
All in all I have been to Many airbnbs in many different states and I know this airbnb is new to the platform so there is always room for improvement however with never having any serious issus with hosts in the past I will highly have to reccomend to stay away from this one unless you are ok with not feeling welcome with your stay!!"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,It was the perfect location and price.. it was a little oasis while away. Perfect
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Cozy loft in great location.
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This was the perfect spot while we were visiting the Discover Muskegon Festival and visiting the beach for the 4th!!

2024-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Nice home, very clean."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Nice clean space, exactly what we needed"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Jessica's place was very clean and comfortable. they had plenty of toys to keep my daughter occupied, so that was a great plus. the kids also enjoyed looking at the marina. excellent home. we would definitely stay again."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful house and immaculately clean!! Additionally there were tons of little extras, a play space for kiddos and lots of games. I would happily return to the home again!"
2024-04-01,5,Group trip,It is a beautiful place to be with your family. It is very close to the lake and the neighborhood is very peaceful.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,Perfect for a family getaway-really enjoyed the game room basement!
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,stayed here for 3 nights with the family. great value. fun basement. quite neighborhood. lots of supplies at the house to use. host is very responsive and was kind enough to take care of a small issue immediately.
2024-03-01,5,Group trip,Our stay was great! We really enjoyed!
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,was like home away from home. plenty of space & anything u needed was provided.
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"I enjoyed my stay. Hosts worked with me and I was able to extend my stay. The home was exactly as described and felt like home, suited in a quiet neighborhood. I would highly recommend for family travel! Great communication and follow up!"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This place was great! From the fully stocked kitchen that I cooked breakfast, lunch and dinner in for 3 days, to the game room basement, we all enjoyed Jessica's place! The decor was beautiful. The furniture was very cute but needs a love seat or a little larger/comfy seating in the living room. The downstairs bathroom was awesome and roomy! The house was well stocked with games and toys. Being able to use the garage was nice to keep our rental vehicle in for 17¬∞ weather. 2 TVs was a plus! All in all, a great place for a single couple or large family!"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Loved staying at this beautiful home! The listers were extremely nice and friendly. I recommend for a good get away. Worth everything!
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,How‚Äôs was amazing for the price! Very clean and the games downstairs were a blast!
2024-01-01,5,Group trip,"For 7 adults there it did not feel cramped at all, plenty of space! The firepit was a great bonus too!"
2023-12-01,5,Group trip,"My family and my sister's family stayed there while visiting relatives for Christmas. The place worked out perfectly! The kids loved the game room in the basement and we had lots of room upstairs for board games and visiting. My niece already wants to book it for next year, lol!"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place in a great location. Owners were very helpful in that I had to cut my stay short and they made the process very easy and painless.
2023-12-01,5,Group trip,"It can be hard to find places for semi-large group stays and so when you find a good place, you try to get it as often as you can. We've stayed with them before and it was great this time too. We stayed for a little while and never ran out of resources like towels, soap, bags, tissue, etc. It's a kid-friendly location with plenty of toys, games, and open space. (Perhaps the location of the microwave emboldens little kids to push buttons). There is an office listed in the amenities description but I wasn't prepared that even in the office there was room for play!
I experience consistent and fast communication. Host were accommodating when needed to clarify group size during the booking process and when I opted to extend the stay a bit. And also were very understanding that upon check out we missed checking the microwave.
Would recommend, especially if you have a semi-large group which includes some younger kids who light engaging in play without screens."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,beautiful house with everything! fun downstairs play area. great host.
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very nice place to stay. Paul and Jessica were both polite and helpful.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,A great place to stay! Would stay again in a heartbeat!
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The family had a great time here. The location was great for anywhere you wanted to go just took a few minutes to drive. We were here for a few nights and with a toddler and teenage boy were VERY grateful for the little extra things the home had; such as toys, games, books, dishes, extra cleaning supplies, spices and 2 bathrooms. Everyone had a little spot to chill or hang out. The game room, and office were a fantastic way to utilize their space! The home was so beautifully decorated and designed. We look forward to being able to rent again in the future. Thank you so much again Jessica and Paul!"
2023-10-01,5,Group trip,Nice and clean comfortable beds all I could ask for and more
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,The AirBNB was a great place to stay at for the weekend. It was cozy and comfortable.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Place was absolutely amazing. loved it would highly recommend. was there with three other guys to paint a speedway. It was an excellent experience. Everything was so well thought. Definitely well thought out and pristine. Great place to go with kids. Thank you so much for such an excellent experience
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Would definitely recommend. Will be looking to book with her again on our next trip. House was clean, had plenty for the whole family to do while there, and close to lots of local activities. Great experience"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,Had a good stay. Surrounding area was a bit sketchy.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great place! Had everything we needed including Foosball, air hockey and arcade games"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I wish the video games were adult size lol. Great place you have there.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We brought a 2 year old. The house was perfectly equipped with everything to keep her entertained, utensils, plates, sleeping, etc. The house was perfect for us all. Nice walk to the beach."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Highly recommend, specially for families with children, the arcade games would keep them busy most of the time"
2023-08-01,5,Group trip,"Inside the house looked new, clean and organized. I liked the amount of dishes, utensils and decor in the kitchen. It made you feel like going to the beach, which is Muskegon‚Äôs best attraction. The neighborhood was quiet, just not as clean and organized looking as this house. I thought the beds were great but my husband who has had back surgery found them a little hard feeling and the chairs in living room small. I think a larger bed in one of the rooms would have been nice because it was a little small for us coming from a king bed at home. I would personally stay by myself here again or with a friend, or kiddos. They did a nice job with the rooms and they were very inviting!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Jessica And Paul‚Äôs place had everything we needed, lots of space, very clean, good location. The kids had a really fun time with the air hockey and the arcade games! Thank you again!"
2023-08-01,5,Group trip,"Brand new remodel with plenty of room for our family of seven adults. Located minutes from Lake Michigan. Very neat, clean, and organized with nicely provided amenities. We enjoyed our stay!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Mom and daughter took three boys (ages 13, 10 and 8). Our main destination was Michigan Adventure which was about a 23-minute drive from the house. The boys were thrilled with the table hockey and arcade games. Clean, well-equipped, plenty of beds for all, easy to find, loads of fun!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great Airbnb! Super clean with lots of space and a great location! Family friendly and close to many beaches! Highly recommend
2023-08-01,5,Group trip,"Great place to stay, highly recommend!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This home is wonderful, clean and beautifully decorated. Our family of 8, which included our daughters, son in law and 2 young grandsons, was very comfortable here for our vacation. The hosts provided so many amenities and so many things were family friendly. From the air hockey, arcade games, books, toys and baby furniture, they thought of everything to make our stay very comfortable. This home is close to the beach, lighthouse, Silversides Submarine museum, several ice cream shops and lots of restaurants near by.
Thank you Paul and Jessica for letting us use your lovely home !!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Jessica and Paul‚Äôs house was wonderful for our family. We had everything we needed during our stay, and the toys/kid items included with the house were absolutely perfect for our 3 young children. The house is in a quiet neighborhood, very clean, and close to local restaurants and attractions. We would definitely return to this house during our next trip to Muskegon!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Attended a family wedding in grand haven, and had a great time at the property. Will definitely stay again when in the area. great job Paul with everything. from booking till checkout everything was a breeze!!!"

2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,For a family of 6 with 4 small children this placd worked out perfect for us. The board/card games were great and the arcade games helped us entertain our kids between adventures. Jessica and Paul were extremely helpful and we would return if back on the area.
2023-06-01,5,Group trip,"Our family had a wonderful stay at Paul and Jessica‚Äôs. The kids enjoyed the downstairs games. I personally enjoyed jogging the neighborhood in the mornings which always led me to the lake. Super close to everything. Clean on the inside, comfortable beds and everyone loved the water pressure of the showers! Highly recommend this home for your stay in Muskegon."
2023-06-01,5,Group trip,House was amazingly set up for children and infants!!! Hosts were extremely accomodating regarding baby furniture. House was ADORABLE!

2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"It was exactly what the pictures looked like that they had listed! First impressions are used for everything and I was a little worried when we pulled up as the yard had not been mowed and outside (yard) could look nicer. My kids were like MOM!!!!! But inside looked brand new in everything, no carpet, which is not a bad thing! I wished it had offered like a recommendation lists or a binder with menus ect. First time in the area and we would of loved recommendations to great places to eat, go to things to do. Ended up loving the area (beach) ate at Deck on the beach and Dockers and then last day headed to Grand Haven for the Toasted Pickle and corn dog stand and beach. Across the street is another Airbnb so we asked them about things in the area. First time doing a Airbnb, I see the pros and cons. I took pictures when we first got there and then when we left, just in case there was discrepancies. I was told to do that. Overall, my kids were happy with the inside and felt comfortable."

Our stay was preceded by some unexpected weather and the hosts were proactive about being in touch about it and offered helpful ways to proceed. The stay was well marked by their overall positively communicative and accommodating nature.
The stay was doubly elevated by some cool additions (an unmatched favorite being the fun games/toys of varying types for a wide range of ages!) that, if given a chance to stay here, I encourage folks to take advantage of.
I can‚Äôt speak much to the surroundings as we pretty happily stayed in the majority of the time. Seeing all the doggies getting walked was a welcome bonus if that matters to anyone :)"

2022-08-01,5,Group trip,"Great stay overall. No carpet anywhere which isn't a big deal but it can be noisy if there are a few of you that go to bed at different times. Also note, there aren't enough place settings for 6, missing a plate and cup. Also note that there are no dressers or tables in the rooms (there are small bedside tables with lamps) but nothing for clothes or anything else. Great communication all the way until the last full day and then we didn't get a response until after we left which isn't a big deal but we were curious on what should be done before we left (checked out). Overall a great stay..."

I am an older nurse who was training for a new employer in the area, and after some intense workdays, it was a pleasant and soothing retreat for me. Paul‚Äôs housekeeper went out of her way to rescue me when I locked my keys in the house (so embarrassing!). Fantastic communication! Highly recommend, especially for older adults such as myself."

2022-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,We stayed at Paul's place becuase we wanted to go to the Michigan Winter Adventure center with the Luge. However it was closed due to weather. The location was very close to that place (about 15 minutes) which was great. We ate at Rad Dads tacos (about 3 minutes from his place) and it was super yummy. His place was super clean and well equipped. We were able to make breakfast every morning and enjoyed coffee with the well equipped K-cups and Kurig maker. We are a family of 5 and everyone had their own bed which was wonderful. Would definately stay here again if we try to go to the Luge again!

2022-01-01,5,Stayed about a week,"AMAZING place! I think one of the biggest compliments you could give a host is that ‚ÄúI would live here‚Äù or ‚ÄúI would buy this house‚Äù and both apply to Jessica‚Äôs house. Very, very nicely decorated. Very nice, comfortable furniture. Very, very nice kitchen and appliances and quality cookware, silverware, cooking utensils, knives, etc, etc. Very comfortable beds and nice linens. Very nice bathroom. I really appreciated the little things like new, soft, fluffy towels, quality toilet paper, good soaps, coffee, organized kitchen, nice laundry setup and games in the basement (very nice surprise with the N64!) etc. Outstanding communication from the hosts with quick replies. I can‚Äôt recommend this place enough if staying in Muskegon. One of the best I‚Äôve ever stayed in‚Ä¶no, I‚Äôd say best, and I‚Äôve stayed in some nice ones!"
2022-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very nice clean place communication was great
2021-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful house in Muskegon! Very clean with great hosts!
2024-06-01,4,Stayed with a pet,"The good:
Beds were comfortable
Master on the first floor was wonderful for my elderly in laws
They had done some beautiful renovations to the kitchen and bathrooms. It was nice having a bathroom on both floors, which isn‚Äôt always the case for older homes. The claw foot tub upstairs was so cute!
The bad:
The neighborhood was run down
There was no yard space
There was broken glass in the gravel drive
Nit-picky things, but potentially worth mentioning for someone:
The house is very noisy and echo-y
There is only 1 tv.
We were unable to lower the temperature of the thermostat below 70. I get why they do it, but we keep our house at 65-67 year round. Also, being an older home, the upstairs was much hotter than the 1st floor."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,Recomand

2024-05-01,5,Stayed one night,The house is located in an old neighborhood that is experiencing a tremendous amount of revitalization and new infill construction.

2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,it was a beautiful home in a great location. the only thing I disagree with is them asking me to wash my own dishes pull the sheets off the beds and gather the towel.

Close to everything within a few min by car. Will definitely go back to her place if in Muskegon!
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a great stay at Jessica‚Äôs place. It looked just like the pictures. The location is right in between downtown and lakeside. Very convenient. We were not able to adjust the thermostat, not sure if it‚Äôs fixed at 69 or if it was operator error."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,Great experience. Everything was just as described. Worked out great for an out of town wedding.
2023-09-01,5,Group trip,"We loved our stay here, we are hoping to book at this location again when we come visit. The house is decorated really good, made us feel at home. They have everything you need (game activities, toiletries, kitchen supplies). Everything was perfect for our group, we all highly recommend!"

2023-08-01,5,Group trip,"Great house to accommodate our party of six. Everything as stated in the description. Close to beaches and hiking. Had a fun evening at the Deck listening to live music and at a local escape room. Hosts didn't give suggestion of things to do in the area when asked but we found our own fun. If you plan to use the small upstairs bedroom with the twin bed, you may want to bring your own fan because it doesn't have a ceiling fan or seem to get much of the central AC cooling."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Very clean and updated. We loved the playground and field across the street. Location is also close to everything. Beach, downtown, lakeside. We would rent here again."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,Updated contemporary feel inside the house - bright and cheerful. The kitchen is very well-appointed with very nice appliances. We very much appreciate the well stocked paper products and supplies. Thanks so much for your availability when I called because I was wrestling with the keypads! üòÅü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Easy 10-minute drive to Lake Michigan beaches and Pere Marquette Park. So beautiful!

2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This is an older house with personality, located in a middle class neighborhood with lots of walkable areas around it. The inside was recently renovated and tastefully decorated, and equipped with all the amenities one can expect away from home. There are generous amounts of useful items, from bathroom toiletries to paper towels and Keurig coffee, making the stay worry free and enjoyable. The only issue we had was with the cleanliness of the floors, to which our attentive hosts responded by sending the housekeeping lady for another floor sweep. We enjoyed our stay overall and would come back. Thank you for hosting us."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The house was a nicely remodeled older home and was very clean. It was equipped with all of the necessities. The beds were comfy and we all slept well. Directions had us drive past a very large abandoned building which concerned us for a moment. Don't let that deter you. We later found out that parts of the building are renovated and it houses The Coffee Factory and Lofts.
This rental was in a quiet neighborhood with people out walking their dogs and some kids playing. Overall, this is a great place to stay with a lot to do in the area."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I would highly recommend this house! We loved it! It‚Äôs located in a great, quiet part of the neighborhood. 1/2 mile from the Lakeshore Trail and about an 8 minute drive from the beach. This house was very clean and has excellent amenities. You can tell it is kept in really good shape. Plenty of space to spread out along with a great front and back porch. If you are traveling to the Muskegon, are looking for a good deal, and want to be near the beaches and trails, rent this house! You will not be disappointed. Jessica and Paul are awesome hosts and make everything very easy."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great house! Exactly as described. Quick drive to lots of activities, the beach, the dunes, the zoo! Lots of amenities provided, nothing was missing. Beds were comfy, room darkening shades would be helpful as we were traveling with teenagers but we all slept in. Overall, great house and would stay there again if in the area."

Definitely will stay again on our next trip."

2023-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Great place to stay in Muskegon. Kid friendly, plenty of room for everyone and super comfy beds. Would totally stay here again."
2022-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This home was the perfect stay for a family traveling with children. I had a 13, 7, and 3 year old with me and the small touches that the host added for kids were lifesavers. They offered: kid friendly dishes, baby shampoo, stools in both bathrooms (potty training lifesaver!), and even a small box of toys.
The house was spotless and had all the amenities you would need plus extras like hot chocolate, shampoo/conditioner, and extra blankets.
One note for families that travel like me which means leaving at 5 or 6 am: upon check-out you have a short list of things to do but one of them is stripping the beds and putting all bedding in a pile. Make sure you build that into your expectations or it will be an unhappy surprise. None of the requested check-out chores are difficult but it is an extra step that should be taken into account for your traveling plans."
2022-11-01,4,Stayed with kids,"lovely house, my kids loved it. There was lots of room for them to play. Only down fall, twin bedroom was really cold. You can feel the cold draft coming through the window. Also, the mattress wasn't comfortable. I'm just not memory foam person."

We'd definitely stay here again!"
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Paul & Jessica were perfect hosts - super informative about local spots & detailed regarding house rules/check-in. The house was clean & well supplied for a weekend stay.
2022-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We have stayed in many rental homes. This home stood out in cleanliness and amenities. The kitchen was fully stocked with utensils, storage items, and basic spices. The TV had access to several streaming platforms. The secured back porch was great storage for our bikes and beach gear. The washer and dryer in the basement had everything we needed. The beds were comfortable, and the rooms and home were spacious. Everything was delightful and positive. We enjoyed being a short bike ride from downtown Muskegon. And while the house isn't on the beach, we visited 3 different beaches, ranging from 12-20 minutes drive away (two in Muskegon and one in Grand Haven). Overall it was a lovely place to call home for the week and would definitely return if vacationing in Muskegon again. Thank you."

2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is a very comfortable and beautiful place to stay! Plenty of space and comfortable bed/bathroom. But, if you‚Äôre wanting to cook a full meal, this kitchen is not equipped with a stove. It has a small hot plate (and small pot/pans to fit). There is a combination microwave/air fryer that came in handy but we weren‚Äôt able to make a large home cooked meal. I think I should‚Äôve gleaned this from the photos but still was a bit surprised when we arrived! We made it work and were still very happy with the rest of the space."

We strongly recommend staying here in spring and fall to wander out to the local sights, or in winter to stay curled up in the remarkably comfortable bed."
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This was the perfect place for our stay in Muskegon! The location was great and was close to a lot of trails.

We loved the clean, modern decor and enjoyed the big bathroom and shower. The place was spotless and comfortable. Unfortunately there were some folks staying in the unit below us who were not respectful of the quiet hours. I let Samantha know about the late night disturbance and she was quick to respond and was so sweet, she dropped us off a couple of coffees and cupcakes in the morning which was a great way to start the day! We were also super impressed with downtown Muskegon and all it has to offer from the impressive theater and museum to the bars/brewery and places to eat. We will certainly be back again.

2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,Didn't end up staying as our plans changed. Jera was extremely nice and accommodating. We would recommend her to anyone.
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,great location. lovely place.
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My daughter and her husband enjoyed their stay. They said the accommodations were clean, and very comfortable with easy access to parking. They would recommend the Airbnb, and happily stay there again. Mariann"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,The room was a beautiful industrial reboot. Amazing style and close to downtown fun. I would highly recommend.
2023-04-01,4,Stayed one night,Enjoyed the stay.
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a nice stay, we loved the tall ceilings and original wood work in the room. It blended well with the modern bathroom. The room was comfortable and is close to downtown and fun things to do on Western Ave."
2023-03-01,4,Stayed one night,"Overall comfortable stay once we aired out the room (it smelled like marijuana smoke when we came in). I‚Äôd recommend bringing some cleaning wipes as the bathroom needed some wiping down & sanitizing. Keep in mind, the road noise is pretty loud as it‚Äôs right on a main road. The beds were comfortable. There‚Äôs a mini fridge & coffee pot, no toaster. This place IS right by downtown so if you‚Äôre a fan of Muskegon, you‚Äôll like the fact that you‚Äôre within walking distance to downtown. Our host gave us some local recommendations for Muskegon since it was our first time. After exploring a little, we realized it‚Äôs pretty unimpressive & many buildings downtown were closed. The architecture & buildings are all over the place, some are big/industrial looking, others are smaller/historical. Not much to do unless you go north to Pentwater or south to Grand Haven."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed one night,Great little spot right at the edge of Downtown Muskegon.
2023-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,Enjoyed our stay! We will be back in the future for longer stays.
2023-03-01,5,Stayed one night,Great location close to many great restaurants & activities. Highly recommend!
2023-03-01,5,Stayed one night,We were in town for an event and this Airbnb fit our needs perfectly. Had everything we needed. Would stay here again!
2023-03-01,5,Stayed one night,What a beautiful and unique place! Converted old train depot was super cozy and modern with a historic feel. Short walk to very cool downtown area. Loved it!
2023-02-01,5,Stayed one night,Easy check in and gorgeous space with a great view and easy access to downtown restaurants. Would definitely stay again!
2023-02-01,3,Stayed with kids,"While aesthetic and fun because it was a converted train depot, the lack of extra linens for the pullout couch and any utensils to stir coffee were cause for a bit of disappointment. This is a room with a small fridge, coffee maker, mugs and glasses, only. Be sure you understand that before booking. Also, the bathroom door does not lock and is not secure or private at all. It is a rolling barn door attempt that made privacy with my husband and our daughters very hard. Finally, the ice was very dangerous for us to navigate to get to the room. No say or sand had been laid to make it safe."
2023-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"It was a lovely little place, wish there‚Äôd been more parking. If I were Jera, I would also advertise the drink fridge! That was a great surprise!"
2023-02-01,4,Stayed one night,"Loved the location. Would love if there was a blow dryer, scissors, etc."
2023-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,Beautiful little spot! Cozy and perfectly located for the wedding we were attending. Highly recommend :)
2022-12-01,4,Stayed one night,"Super cute little studio with boho modern feel. Right downtown, so easy to walk to since Muskegon doesn‚Äôt do much Uber yet."
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Nice, clean and unique stay at a renovated train depot building. Comfortable beds, cozy space and close to the social district of Muskegon. Would stay here again absolutely."

2022-10-01,4,Stayed one night,The room was adorable. High ceilings and very loft-like. It was clean and comfortable. Very unique re-use of the depot. Walking distance to a nice little night-life district.
2022-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Beautiful room! I was there just a very short time, but I really enjoyed it!"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Jera was an amazing host!!!! She helped me remotely with the tv issue. The space was so cute and cozy. She really did a great job with the space. I can‚Äôt say enough wonderful things. Plus Muskegon has a cool downtown area that had a lot of great bars and restaurants. I would definitely stay again.
2022-10-01,4,Stayed one night,"A cute and convenient place! Easy to drive or walk to lots of things. We especially liked that streaming services were provided and that the bathroom was really roomy. The decor was cozy and we felt at home. Despite the location being downtown, parking was a breeze as well."
2022-10-01,5,Stayed one night,Wonderful unique stay! Perfectly cozy.
2022-09-01,5,Stayed one night,A nice place in a very central location. Very unique space if I‚Äôm in town I will stay again. The host was very responsive and made for a nice trip.

2022-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"The depot was beautiful and conveniently located. The room was very clean and extremely comfortable. The host provided excellent instructions and was quick with communications. We throughly enjoyed our stay, and highly recommend it to others."
2022-09-01,3,Stayed a few nights,Very nice place
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,My daughter and I absolutely loved this place for our girl‚Äôs weekend! It was very unique and beautifully decorated! It was also walking distance to many restaurants and shops in downtown Muskegon!
2022-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Old train depot turned into a charming room. The decor, comfort, location was perfect for me, husband, and 5 month old infant!"
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was our second time staying at the Depot ..and it was just as cozy and warm as last time. There is an old-fashioned vibe that makes you feel like you are in the ""Somewhere in Time"" film - only with wifi, a mini-frig and really comfy mattresses. Everything is immaculately clean and cozy and make you feel like it was lovingly prepared for someone's favorite relatives to visit. The brick interiors, high ceilings and original wood floors make for a nostalgic ambience that is seamlessly and tastefully complemented with a variety of modern conveniences that make it a truly unique and memorable experience to stay here."
2022-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Very clean, very comfortable, beautiful historic place to stay."
2022-08-01,4,Stayed with kids,Very unique and beautiful room. It was updated and comfortable. Location was central but on a pretty busy street.
2022-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Wonderful place to stay. Very clean, good location and host was quick to communicate!"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place was perfect for the weekend get away my sister, friend and I took. I would definitely recommend. The space was really nice too, different then you normally see."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This was such a great find! It is in walking distance of the social district and an easy drive to the beach. The hosts were very responsive and helped us out with recommendations of things to do near by. We wish we could have stayed longer!
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,What an amazing vacation! We appreciated Jera‚Äôs attention to every detail. Staying in Muskegon was the perfect balance to visiting Grand Haven. Thanks again!
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Adorable little studio.
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"First and foremost, The Depot is gorgeous. It‚Äôs a small building and very unassuming - and inside the room we stayed in, it was gorgeous, spacious and relaxing. We enjoyed sitting outside both nights of our stay and watching the sunset over Muskegon Lake directly across the street. Jera was super responsive for two minor things that came up. Will absolutely stay here again on future trips to Muskegon. Highly recommend!!!!"
2022-07-01,3,Stayed a few nights,"Three stars only for this place. Minus one star for a tricky lock on the front door. It required jiggling the key around to get into the unit and to lock it. One time it took me ten minutes to get into the unit. Minus one star for limited parking options and no clarity for parking pad spaces. Only two pad spaces for three units. No signs posted that spaces are for residents ONLY. If there is a busy event going on that week-end downtown the pad parking will be full and street parking will be difficult. On Saturday night someone claiming to be the owner told the other renter that he could not park on the parking pad. He did not have a car and it was his friend's car. Threatening to call the cops on a renter for parking on the ""available"" parking pad is extreme. If only certain units are paying more and get parking pad rights that should be explained to all the renters and made clear. With two spots and three units, on a first come and first park basis someone will not get parking. In addition a sign should indicate that only residents can park on the pad. Unit is not really designed for four people. There is a towel hook but not a towel rack for example. Unit is small for four people. It is a meduim sized room with an attached bathroom. Pillows are flat and could use replacing as could towels. Unit is near a very noisy road that is busy till late in the night. Owner did provide good advice on restaurants nearby. I did like supporting an owner who rehabbed a historical building."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This place was amazing! Cute, clean, and had a beautiful view. There was a lot of traffic but we couldn't hear it at all from inside. The towels and beds were so cozy, and my kids already asked if we can stay here again when we come back next year."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"It looks exactly like the photos. The area has a lot of businesses nearby. If I came back to the area, I'd definitely consider staying here again."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is an adorable little studio Airbnb in the perfect location. The view of the water is beautiful and it is close to many restaurants. The only downside was the mini fridge did not have a freezer. Besides that, it was perfect for our stay!"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,Awesome place and well decorated. When we arrived it was very clean and a comfortable temperature. Walking distance to downtown makes this location ideal.
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very clean!

2022-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great stay!! Room had all of the amenities we needed and was so cute. Also nice that you could control the heating and cooling as needed. Has 2 sinks, one in the bathroom and one in the main room which was very nice. Parking was in a small paved inlet which was nice because I didn't have to park on the street. Street is a little loud at times but it didn't bother us too much. Thank you Jera!!"
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Wonderful place ! Interesting and well done. Jera was understanding and helpful when we had a question. We hope to return soon.
2022-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"Jera‚Äôs place was exactly as described- full of classic 1905 railroad depot charm, clean and beautifully updated. Wonderful, quick communication was a huge plus since we rented last minute!!"
2022-05-01,5,Stayed one night,Very clean and pretty. loved it
2022-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"A fabulous, unique place! An instant favorite. My family had a great overnight stay at the Depot. (My mother-in-law was talking about how comfortable the bed was days later.)
There are so many thoughtful details here. We loved the view of the water and watching the sun set over it. Also loved how easy it was to walk over to the downtown. Check in was a breeze and parking was super easy.
Will absolutely stay here again when we're back in Muskegon!"

2022-02-01,5,Stayed one night,Such a cozy spot with beautiful decoration! Got an amazing night of sleep. The host is super caring and willing to help with anything. Definitely recommend!
2022-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,An absolute gem! The downtown location is perfect for exploring Muskegon. Right across the street is Muskegon lake with a nice park and pavilion. Lots of trendy restaurants minutes away. The place itself is charming and bursting with character! The space feels open with tall ceilings throughout and exposed brick. The woodwork around the windows and on the floors is original and exquisite. The beds and bedding are cozy for a good nights rest. Shower works great and has floor to ceiling tile for a luxurious feel. The space was extremely clean and had everything we needed. Will absolutely be returning and have already recommended to friends. Thank you!
2022-01-01,5,Group trip,"This place is awesome, if you didn‚Äôt get that from the description. It has something for all as it is very chic and the architecture is just so neat. Jera was a great host and provided everything we needed. The beds were very new and comfortable. Nice sized bathroom. I was blown away at how they transformed an old train depot into a great space."
2022-01-01,4,Stayed one night,Just as expected based on the listing. Cute place!
2022-01-01,5,Stayed one night,Beautiful little place to getaway. It was perfectly located to downtown Muskegon. Walking distance to all the wonderful places to explore in the area. I‚Äôd love to stay here again.

2021-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"Absolutely loved this place! We were lucky enough to stay in 2 of the rooms during our stay and each were equally adorable and accommodating. Comfortable beds, gorgeous decor, spotless. A must visit!"
2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very beautiful. My partner and I enjoyed our stay.

2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We LOVED our stay at this truly unique air bnb. Amazing value. Everything is exactly as listed. Close to downtown - we walked to the restaurants (so many GREAT places to wine & dine).
My husband and I like to book stays that are unique and budget friendly. Jera‚Äôs place at the train depot was that and much more. The vaulted ceilings of the room make the quaint space feel grand! The bathroom and shower rival any luxury hotel. Jera is an excellent host. Very clear instructions and directions for check in/check out. We also appreciated a later check out time compared to other stays.
This was our first visit to Muskegon and we loved our experience!
Favorite eateries:
18th Amendment
Burl & Sprig
Aldea coffee
Pigeon Hill Brewing
The Brunch House
Lake House (had our anniversary dinner here - EXCELLENT!)
Don‚Äôt be intimidated to look for the local Speak Easy, ‚ÄúCapone‚Äôs‚Äù. Wow!
It was chilly while were in town (October) so we didn‚Äôt enjoy the beach as much as we would have liked. We hope to return during the summer to experience more of what Muskegon has to offer!
Don‚Äôt pass this listing by! It‚Äôs a gem.
Thank you, Jera!"
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Super cute room! Close to the road but wasn't loud at night.
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place was awesome. My wife, our teen daughter and her friend absolutely loved the d√©cor of the place. Room was clean and well stocked for our needs. It is actually well located for getting around town. Short walk to downtown and easy access to main roads. Jera was quick to answer any questions we had, would definitely recommend staying here."
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This room feels like youre staying in fancy friend's loft in the West Village in New York. Check in and out is super easy. I think someone was in the room next to us, but we didnt hear a peep....so either good thick walls, or the people next door didnt talk. This is on a busy street, but we put music on at about a 3.5 out of 10 and didnt hear a thing. Also, traffic noise doesnt bother us, but it could be a thing for light sleepers. So nice to have a little semi-private outdoor space for coffee in the morning. Easy walking distance to everything. Felt very safe. Overall, will 100% stay again."
2021-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This place is awesome! The room was so cute, cozy and inviting. The location was perfect and close to everything, especially downtown. I can‚Äôt wait to stay here again!"
2021-08-01,4,Stayed with kids,"We really enjoyed our stay at the Depot. The location was perfect for our long weekend in Muskegon, and it was great to be able to walk to many of the places we visited. The on-site parking was great, too! The historic building is unique, interesting, and nicely decorated. The shower is fantastic. Our queen bed was comfortable. The queen bed our daughters shared had a broken box spring which sagged in the middle, but we pointed this out to the owner and they will hopefully take care of it soon. The love seat sleeper sofa was perfect for our son. Overall, a very nice, comfortable place to stay!"
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,It was a great room and close to Lake Michigan and other surrounding areas like Grand Rapids and Grand Haven!
2021-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,The details in the room and the room itself are amazing. The communication was superb. We enjoyed our stay and can't wait to book again!
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is a great place
Best place we have ever stayed!!"
2021-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We had a great stay in Muskegon, thank you Jera!"
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a great weekend staying here! The beds are so comfortable, the shower has great water pressure, and the views out the window are amazing in the morning. Everything was clean and we were provided with everything we would need. The location is perfect because we were able to spend time at the lake and not have a long drive back, and it is close to eating spots for breakfast, dinner, and ice cream shops üòã"
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"the host communicated great about check in and the place was beautiful. super close to all the big attractions in the area like Michigan adventures, lakes, and jet ski rentals. worth the money."
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We really enjoyed our stay. It was so easy to check in and out. The beds were so comfortable! Would definitely stay here again.
2021-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This was just as advertised- a really cute place that was renovated into beautiful and well appointed rooms. Everything was super clean too. Location is walking distance to the up and coming downtown area and just under a 15 minute drive to the beautiful state park.
Some reviewers mentioned the traffic noise and I have to agree that it was loud, but I‚Äôm a light sleeper. My kids slept just fine. If you are a light sleeper like me, bring ear plugs.
Would recommend (with ear plugs)!"
2021-07-01,5,Group trip,Very cozy and we'll designed room. Hostess is great and communicates well if needed. Highly recommended!
2021-07-01,5,Stayed one night,This was in the perfect location to where we wanted to be! We were here for a competition on Pete Marquette Beach. It was very clean and I loved the vibe. We would definitely stay here again!
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great location and place. Great communications! Will be back.
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful room with so much to enjoy. Very comfortable bed and clean. Location is right downtown Muskegon.
2021-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,The CUTEST room and the comfiest beds! We loved staying here and Jara was very accommodating! Highly recommend!
2021-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We had a comfortable stay at the Depot! This was a repurposed train depot that was renovated into a charming, boutique hotel. From the moment we walked in our room, we loved the decor, exposed brick, barn door, high ceilings, and lighting fixtures. We were looking for a quick getaway and we liked the uniqueness of this location. It was easy to find with convenient parking and we had a nice view of the lake.
It was our first time traveling with our infant baby, and Jeera was quite thoughtful by offering us a crib. The bed and comforters were so soft. We appreciated the cleanliness of the room. We had a great stay and would recommend if you're in the area."
2021-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This was our first visit to Michigan but we absolutely loved it! Jera‚Äôs place was in a great location- close to downtown but also close enough to the beach. We were able to walk right downtown for coffee and lunch and the beach was just a 10 minute drive for us. It was clean and the beds were very comfortable. The street was a little loud/busy at night but that didn‚Äôt bother us, if you are a light sleeper pack some ear plugs. Overall, we enjoyed our stay and would definitely stay again!"
2021-06-01,4,Group trip,"The decor was beautiful and the beds and bedding were great! It is a bit small considering it is advertised to sleep 5. The location is within walking distance to several restaurants and Saturday night fun downtown. It is, however, located next to a busy street, but the traffic noise did die down after 11 pm. Overall a nice place for a weekend visit!"
2021-06-01,5,Group trip,Room was clean and beds were super comfortable. It ss close to the the sound of traffic as described but nobody had issues sleeping. Clear and prompt communication. We would stay again. Very cool place to stay.
2021-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,Great and unique place to stay.
2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We had a wonderful time and the place is beautiful! We loved how they combined the old with the new!
2021-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"This is a great find! This remodeled train depot is a cozy, spacious, and comfortable place to stay in Muskegon. Everything is sparkling clean and in excellent shape, and it‚Äôs in a really convenient spot near downtown and overlooking the lake. Jera did a great job communicating with instructions.
One tip for travelers: there can be traffic noise, so if that bothers you, consider packing earplugs. However, don‚Äôt let that keep you away from this great place. We live near a busy road, so hearing a little bit of hustle and bustle made it feel just like home. This was an excellent experience!"
2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The room was homey and comfortable. The sitting space outside was a bonus. I can‚Äôt wait to come back again.
2021-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,Great clean and stylish place. We arrived late and Jera quickly and kindly responded to a question we had. We would definitely stay again. We wish we had more time to enjoy the place and the area as we were on a 1 night trip. The bed sheets were amazingly comfortable!
2021-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"Jera has taken an old historic building, thought outside the box, and made it a lovely Airbnb."
2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This place is the coolest stay my husband and I have been to thus far. It‚Äôs tucked away on a small street right on the outskirts of grand Haven. Old train depot turned-Airbnb this place is a unique stay unlike any other. We felt cozy and comfortable and were kicking ourselves for not staying longer.
2021-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Sweetly decorated and very clean place to stay near downtown Muskegon. Beautiful sunset views. We loved it!
2021-04-01,5,Stayed one night,This room was so quiet and cute! Check in and out were a breeze with the hosts easy to follow instructions. It was so clean!! The beds were very comfortable. Convenient location to everything in Muskegon!
2021-04-01,5,Stayed one night,Great location and super cute place to stay!
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,We had the best time here! The house is beautiful and the view is stunning. It‚Äôs a short 4-5 min drive to the beach. Highly recommend.
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Very comfortable and well-appointed, beautiful view, spectacular sunrises over the water. A great place with a great host!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Lynelle's place was just what we were looking for; a quiet and peaceful weekend away from the city life. Lynelle was a wonderful host and her home provided us with all the essentials and even more than anyone would expect from toys and activities for the kids, to all the amenities and toiletries needed in a bathroom. Her home was spotless and definitely gives you that peaceful vibe as soon as you walk in her home. The view from her home to the lake is amazing! Definitely adding this to one of my favorite locations as I know it's a place I'll definitely want to come back to when I know my family and I need a break from the hectic life of the city!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Nice stay good location walking distance to lots of places and good responsiveness from host
2024-06-01,4,Stayed with kids,"Everything was spectacular. The only reason it is 4/5 stars is due to the high cleaning fees that after booking we were told could get even higher if we didn't do a list of chores before leaving. I totally understand the need for a cleaning fee, however if the customer pays a cleaning fee they shouldn't be told they have to clean at the risk of incurring even more fees.
The space was very clean! Nicole was kind and very responsive. Close to a few restaurants and has lots of nice amenities. I would definitely suggest this stay to another person."

2023-08-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Drift On Inn Room 5 had a clean modern look with everything we needed for our 2 night stay. The bed was comfortable with plenty of pillows. It was very close to a grocery store and a few restaurants. The hosts quickly answered the couple of questions we had.
The only downside was how small the bathroom was and how loud the toilet flushed."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,will definitely come again! it was a perfect spot to stay when attending The Unity Christian Music Festival!

2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was our third stay at the Drift On Inn! Everything we needed was provided and it is close to restaurants, gas, grocery, and a dollar store as well as the bike trail. Even though you access the property from a busy street, it is easy to come and go and is quiet. We see and have talked to the owners during every stay. We also had to change our travel itinerary at the last minute and Nicole was great in accommodating us and ensuring that all details through Airbnb were updated seamlessly. We will be back again next year!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We picked this location because it was the closest to our daughters home whom was the reason for our visit

2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Lovely little place.
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"i really appreciated the thoughtfulness with which the rooms were designed. i was also impressed with the comfort and isolation of the rooms, considering they‚Äôre close. they felt worlds away. i wasn‚Äôt quite sure what to expect - is it an apartment, is it a hotel room‚Ä¶ but it‚Äôs like a very cool other experience all together. another thing worth mentioning is the location - right by a major intersection so you don‚Äôt feel too far from civilization and you‚Äôre very close to the beautiful woods and waters of michigan. really wonderful. side note - i was a bit wishy washy on whether i wanted to stay two nights or one, and then whether i wanted to stay at all . and the entire time i knew that this place had a really generous cancellation policy that gave me until quite close to my stay for a refund should i have needed it. all in all, from management to amenities, room comfort to location, the unique experience and beyond , this is a magical place to get away for a minute."
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The Drift on Inn is the perfect place to stay in the greater Muskegon area. Close to downtown Muskegon and the highway if Montague or Grand Haven are in your travel plans. The place was SPOTLESS and smelled like brand new construction. Comfy bed and very clean linens, towels, etc. Safe and easy access to the building and individual unit. Room #5 is on the second floor and requires you to climb one flight of stairs. Entry is well lit both outside of the building and as you make your way upstairs. Definitely recommend checking out Brooklyn‚Äôs across the street for breakfast or lunch. Overall, great stay and great value. I would recommend staying here and may even stay here again in the future."

2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The Eagles Nest was just as amazing as advertised. Heidi and her sister are great hosts.
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Loved our stay at Heidi‚Äôs place! When some of the amenities weren‚Äôt working correctly, Heidi went above and beyond to fix the issue and make us feel at home. Love the views and how the space is set up. Very cozy and we enjoyed being so close to both Muskegon and Grand Haven. We will definitely be back!"
2024-06-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Heidi has a beautifully renovated home. The beds and furniture were so comfy. She has well stocked the kitchen with appliances,
dishes, utensils. There are a few minor fixes still to be completed, but those did not affect our stay. We appreciated the goodie basket too!"
2024-06-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"This place was truly beautiful and we had a very nice time. The only bad thing, someone was living downstairs. Not that that is a bad thing, but I was hoping to be alone in a house. I felt like I was bothering someone the whole time I was there because you can hear everything between the floors. Other than that, it was great. We saw an eagle and hung out on the beautiful deck for most our time. If you rent this home, def bring food to cook the kitchen is gorgeous and you will want to!"
2024-05-01,5,Group trip,"Cute cottage, and comfortable bedding! Great location."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Heidi's place was exactly what I needed. I wanted to wake up to the lake every morning for a week and that's exactly what I did! Heidi was very responsive and friendly and provided everything I needed. Loved the kitchen too. The place looked exactly like the pics! Thank you, Heidi!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Would most definitely stay again!:)
2023-12-01,4,Stayed a few nights,The place is clean and well-kept even during the renovation. The lake is beautiful. The only downside was that it wasn't communicated before the reservation period that someone else just moved into the basement unit. There was noise stemming from that. Would've probably reserved even knowing that in advance. Just didn't meet expectations based on the listing which caught us off guard.
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great place, beautiful view, comfortable bed! Highly recommendüòä"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Heidi was a great host! She was thoughtful and decorated the place beautifully. I found her easy to talk with, and always willing to be accommodating. my wife and I would definitely stay there again."

2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Heidi‚Äôs home was great! The space is large inside and the patio and lawn/sandy beach was perfect too. We enjoyed kayak/paddle boarding, bonfires and were able to explore the town of Muskegon. The house was clean and had comfortable furniture and beds. There is space for a family, even though we came as just a couple. The kitchen was stocked with things to cook with and grill with. We definitely will come back!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,Heidi‚Äôs home was the perfect escape from life. It is everything our family was looking for. Privacy with beautiful scenery and a home with warm welcoming accommodations. Heidi was perfect and super responsive with all my questions from the minute i booked until we were checked out. It was the perfect relaxing escape.
2023-08-01,5,Group trip,"Heidi's home was lovely and nicely renovated. Still a little of a work in progress, but the home was lovely. The deck, sunroom, and little beach area was especially lovely."

2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Heidi's place was absolutely beautiful.
It was beautifully renovated and met ALL of Our Expectations. We spent most of our time in the morning and evenings enjoying the view of the Lake from the deck.
It was located in close enough proximity to visit Holland and Grand Haven on Day trips.
Overall our Experience with Heidi and her Lake House was Wonderful.
Thank You So Much Heidi"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place was perfect for our needs. It‚Äôs recently remodeled, so it‚Äôs nice and clean. Very quiet and peaceful. We didn‚Äôt use the lake but it appeared very clean and not crowded at all. We will definitely be back again! Thank you."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful and quiet spot overlooking a private lake. All new furnishings and living area. Beds extremely comfortable. Great deck provided a lovely way to start our day. Very clean and tastefully decorated. Recommended!
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Most spectacular host I have ever encountered. I can not say enough how incredible my interactions with Heidi were from the beginning of the booking process to the end.
When we choose to book this stay the location was advertised as being under renovations. We were unsure if it would truly be ready in time. Heidi was quick to answer my questions and explained that there was a built in cushion in case construction ran behind.
On the morning of our flight out, my dad experienced a major medical emergency on the way to the airport. After letting her know, Heidi reached out and offered to help us rearrange our travel schedule.
We arrived a few days later and could not have been more pleased with the house. Perfectly appointed and a kitchen well stocked with all the equipment you might need to whip up a dinner. Very comfortable beds, living room and huge deck to watch the stars from. Tons of games for the family, walkable clean beach, quiet neighborhood. Perfection!
Thank you!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Heidi was great! the view was amazing! I came for a quick girl's trip. Every question I had, she was very quick to respond. the view and deck were amazing! we can't wait to see how she continues to renovate this location. we're planning on coming back next july!"

2024-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,I totally enjoyed my stay!! The location was near every event that we had planned. The cleanliness and decor were very impressive. You can tell when a home is taken care of and this place was it. Everything that we possibly would need was made available by the host. Truly earned ‚Äúsuperhost‚Äù title. Will definitely stay again if available.
2024-06-01,5,Group trip,This stay was amazing would 100% come back and do it all again
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"it was the perfect, cozy little house for my trip! the stairs are killer but as long as you‚Äôre willing to make the trek, it‚Äôs definitely worth it!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"a lovely cottage great view in the forest üå≥ got to enjoy ,and got to see a family reindeer‚Äòs. I really enjoyed the fire place thanks Evan , it only took us a 5 min walk-to the beach üèù it was so nice my mother and kids definitely enjoy it I will definitely recommend üíØ will come back again! üëç"
2024-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"Hard to find at night and definitely a few steps up to house. But clean. Quiet and easy access to roads. Good value, comfy bed"
2024-05-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Beautiful stay close to the beach. We would definitely enjoy staying here again in the future.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed about a week,Evan is one of the best hosts I‚Äôve ever experienced. He responds quickly and was accommodating to last minute travel changes. The property was perfect and my husband and I refer to it lovingly as ‚Äúthe cot‚Äù (short for cottage) and he can‚Äôt wait for the two of us to experience it together. The property was perfectly clean and comfortable. The neighborhood was quiet and the neighbors were kind and welcoming. The deer were fun to watch. Thanks again for the top notch hospitality!
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Easy clean and beautiful stay
2024-04-01,2,Stayed a few nights,"I always want to be fair to host, but also want travelers aware when things aren't what's represented!
PROS: it might be a gem if not for maintenance/cleanliness issues; cute d√©cor but not as in pics; rain showerhead; firepit; it was quiet; 12 deer in yard; plenty of flatware & towels; clean beds!
CONS: few dishes; prints/smudges on most doors, mirrors, windows; grime/hair on sm appliances & tile; broken kettle, freezer drawer & backdoor lock; wobbly chair; warped shower door; floor fan, kitch light, window sills & ceiling blades dirty; no curtain on bathrm window or porch bdrm door, broken rollershade, no lock on master=privacy issues; stains on rugs/sofa; dirty frig & freezer; food on info sheet & book on coffee table; splinters in lower handrail. I sent Evan 19 photos. He said sorry, offered new kettle, & had housekeeper come for 60+ min to clean the 19 areas. I had 24 other pics unsent, those remained dirty/broken during our stay. 1st time this ever happened to us. Disappointing."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Superb house, very pleasant and well-equipped. The plus: deer and squirrels in the garden!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed over a week,We loved this place. We enjoyed watching the squirrels run around. There were about 8 deers in the back yard that were friendly. The house was well stocked for the time we stayed. Got my daily workout with going down the 55 stairs. That was a good thing haha. The place is in a very quiet location and close to the lake. Very satisfied.
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Evan was a great host. Check in was easy and he was very responsive throughout my stay. The property is as advertised and is truly a very peaceful place to stay. The house was very clean. I definitely would stay here again if I am back in town.
2024-01-01,5,Stayed one night,We had a wonderful relaxing stay! Thanks so much Evan!
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was my very first time staying at a Airbnb. I must say I Loved the location and the house was Absolutely Adorable it was super Clean and Cozy and the decor was very modern and up to date. Should I ever need a great place to stay in Muskegon, Mi again when I visit I will definitely contact Evan to book his house if its available. Thank you again so much for making my first Airbnb stay a success Evan God Bless you and your family Happy Holidays"
2023-12-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"We enjoyed this little get away. It was close to work and the lake. Two things that were a must for us.
Thanks for being so responsive and getting us in so quickly!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"A really cool spot. The trek up the stairs is well worth the privacy atop the hill. There were deer directly outside the window at dawn, grazing and grooming each other. That was cool. 10/10 would recommend!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"Thank you so much to Evan for accepting our reservation at such short notice. The place was spacious, clean and in a lovely peaceful area."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,It was such a cozy place. My friends and I loved it and had a great time!
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Evan‚Äôs place was very neat and tidy. Despite the off and on drizzle we enjoyed our stay. The house was cozy and perfect for a quick weekend getaway. We found ourselves driving a lot to the parks, shopping and to get food; which meant climbing the many stairs multiple times. It would have been nice to have a list of suggested favorite food spots or grocery store locations. FYI: the closest convenient store had crazy high prices. The house served its purpose for us and we had a nice stay."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Absolutely beautiful house with an amazing location, we even saw some deers in our backyard! As a food-loving family we would have appreciated better equipment for cooking (such as better knifes, more spices or bowls) but other than that it was perfect to be happy!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Overall great place to stay. Whether you're staying as a couple, family or other, the following might
Getting there: Look for the teal mailbox, you'll pass by it if you're driving too fast. At night, the entrance is not illuminated, but I agree with some reviews that it should be lighted. Solar lights would be great here. With this house on a higher dune, it provides privacy and limited/zero sound from the road below. Bedrooms: 3 cozy and well decorated with AC units in each. Bathroom: 1 full bath/looks recently upgraded. Living area has a mounted/good size TV/comfortable L shaped sofa. Kitchen: Appears to be brand new appliances/countertops. Washer/dryer. I took the liberty of buying new knives for the next occupant. Basics are there: toaster, coffee maker (5 cups) pans, cooking utensils, plates/utensils, 5 mugs and glasses, ice cube trays. Still needs oven mitts, foil, dishwasher pods, extra trash bags and laundry pods. The home had a great energy and I would like to stay again."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great place, responsive host, everything as advertised! Amazing experience"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,Very nice house and location. Evan was a friendly and responsive host.
2023-08-01,4,Stayed one night,"We enjoyed our stay. The location is a five minute walk to the beach, which is a plus. We were able to book it last minute, which was nother plus. The place was clean enough. But, the couch is dirty/stained, towels need updating, and shower could use some work. It was good for a last minute stay."
2023-08-01,5,Group trip,"Had a nice stay at this Airbnb! The place was clean, and I loved how airy it felt. The location was also convenient. Can easily walk to the beach from there. Saves you $7 parking fee. I would highly recommend this place to anyone."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The place was just what we expected. Very nice. It was missing a sharp knife to cut veggies (extra), but I brought one. Also had a linen issue, but Evan was quick with a response and had an extra. Great host. Great place to stay. Will be back next year. Thanks"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,We had a great experience. It was such a cute place that fit our family perfectly. We really liked that so many rooms closed off from the main living area. It has been hard to find an inexpensive place for our family that doesn't require someone to sleep in a common area. It was perfect for us.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Place was great. It‚Äôs right off the main road going to the beach and only a 10 min walk away.
2023-08-01,4,Group trip,"We had a wonderful long weekend at Evan‚Äôs house. The house was super clean and cute. Close to the a very nice beach. AC was a plus, first afternoon was a little bit too warm for my preference, but opening rooms to allow AC to run through the house and kept it fresh. Although our stay was wonderful a few things that could have make it even better would be having a grill available , and few more things on the kitchen like meat cutting knives, some plastic bowls for mixing etc."
2023-08-01,5,Group trip,Amazing weekend!
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Great spot. If I had to complain it would be about the 40 steps to get there. Close to the beach, a donut/ coffee shop and great dinner spots. I would come back again"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very nice place!
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Fun find for a beach weekend! We walked the 10 min stroll with our kids in wagons and strollers to Pere Marquette Beach to enjoy the soft sand and beach waves. This house is on a sand dune, which is super cool! There are quite a few stairs to reach the top, but even with 2 sets of parents and 2 infants we were able to get everything to the house we needed. The bright turquoise mailbox was the best landmark to spot the driveway. Check the amenities listed to make sure you bring what you need. Overall, it was a great place to stay and we would love to visit again!"
2023-07-01,5,Group trip,"Evan‚Äôs place is decorated very nicely and has that cottage feeling. We booked this airbnb on the day of, and Evan was able to accommodate us. The stairs definitely need to be kept in mind because my grandma struggled a little bit. Beach was walkable (10mins) which was a plus. Overall a good stay."
2023-07-01,5,Group trip,"We stayed at here for my bachelorette weekend, and it was so perfect! The house looks even more beautiful than in the pictures, it was cozy, clean, and just so perfect! Thank you for such an amazing weekend!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Excellent and beautiful place, super close to the beach. Clean and comfortable, the only thing lacking is more kitchen supplies. A set of knives would be a great addition. Would definitely recommend and book again."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,Wonderful stay! We loved sitting outside watching the deer wander through. I‚Äôve had a great stay. It was clean and beautiful and the nature was amazing.
2023-07-01,4,Stayed with kids,"Evan's place is beautifully decorated and clean. It was easy to find (although it should be noted that there are a lot of stairs to climb with luggage, bags, coolers, etc.) and a great location about half a mile from the beach. The only suggestion is that the kitchen was not at all equipped for a family that plans to cook meals together. There were no serving bowls or bread knifes, and only 2 pots and 2 pans. Very few plates and bowls."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We had a wonderful time at Evan's place in Muskegon. It's close to the beaches and has a great cottage vibe. The house also provided us with front row seats for watching two baby deer and their mom wander through, which our kids absolutely loved!
We enjoyed the beaches at Pere Marquette Park (around the corner) and Muskegon State Park (around the lake). We also had a great time visiting the USS Silversides Submarine Museum. Touring the sub may have been my favorite part of our whole trip!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,Nice and quiet
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Lovely property atop a sand dune. The pictures do it justice, very comfortable beds and clean space. Evan was helpful with installing three ac units prior to our arrival upon requesting due to the temperature. It was well suited for our five guests and we loved being walking distance to the beach. The aqua mailbox was very helpful to spot the house in the day time, I would suggest having a post light on the mailbox to help in the dark. The property was easy to find, and has a nice neighbor next door who let my girls know where to find the baby deer wandering the yard in the mornings.
I would definitely visit again! Thank you so much!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"We just stayed for one night before heading further north on our trip. The home was cute and quiet, the only thing I wish we would‚Äôve known before staying in the summer heat was no air conditioning available. It was a steady 80 degrees all day and night, I never thought to check the amenities listed for no air conditioning as I‚Äôve never experienced this. Wish it would‚Äôve been a disclaimer in the description, but it‚Äôs on me for not digging further into reviews and amenities listed. For that I will still give this stay 5 stars because the place was clean, located in a beautiful and safe area, and the host was very responsive to my questions. I‚Äôm sure any other season this wouldn‚Äôt have been an issue, so I would likely stay again in the fall/winter time. Overall very pleased."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,we loved the location being close to the beach on lake Michigan. probably a 2 minute drive!
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We have stayed in several of Evan‚Äôs properties while working in Muskegon area. His property is always as advertised and he is a great host!
2023-06-01,5,Group trip,Very nice place to stay. Lovely neighborhood
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great stay!
2023-06-01,3,Stayed with kids,"The description adjacent to lake is not true. Adjacent means shares a border. You are NOT adjacent to any lakes here. You cannot even see a lake from this property. There are 47 stairs to get to the cottage, that's over 3 flights of stairs to carry up luggage, food, cooler, etc. Not great for those with knee problems or other mobility issues. Being my first ABNB, I did not realize you need to specify you want AC, it was 80 degrees when we tried to sleep. Fans help but don't prevent one from perspiring in the bed, and with air quality alert issued or allergies, sleeping with windows open is not a good option although we did. The cottage was clean, beds and pillows comfortable. Evan is a good communicative host. The kitchen could be better equipped."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"It was a really cute place, very close to the beach and The Deck. The stairs are a bit of a workout but the location and home itself is amazing, would love to come back!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great quality place in a peaceful setting convenient to biking, hiking, and walking options. Would definitely stay again."
2023-05-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Nice cabin, there are a few stairs to climb, but nature galore once you get there. Very nice, cozy cabin."

2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,great great
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Clean and peaceful -just like the pics! Great spot to leave stress behind and enjoy Lake Michigan just a few steps down the road. Close to everything you could need during your stay.
2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,Great place to stay. Beautifully decorated and bright! Most definitely a place I‚Äôll stay again.
2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,Evan was super helpful and he made my stay that much better if you get a chance to dill with Evan you are in great hands we wanted to extend our stay but the place was book and Evan got us right in to another place right around the corner and made are vacation very nice well definitely be back

2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Evan‚Äôs place is absolutely amazing, personally have stayed twice because I like it so much. Very comfy vibes with an at home feel. Not to mention Evan is a great host who is very attentive and quick to help out when needed."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great spot in Muskegon. Well placed.
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Would highly recommend your stay here. Beautiful location right by the beach. Very clean and comfy. Everything we needed
2023-03-01,3,Group trip,"We had an enjoyable stay overall. We found this place last minute for a girls weekend. The ‚Äúbedroom‚Äù on the porch was quite chilly, but better the 2nd night when we kept the heater going all night. The steps are quite a bit especially if you have a lot of luggage/coolers/etc. to get inside. Kitchen was a bit bare - no ice in freezer, one sharp knife, few coffee mugs, no spare trash bags, tiny space for multiple ppl to prepare food. Smart tv was nice to have. Overall we had a great stay though and would recommend for a small group of people."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"For the price, it was a great place to get away for a few days. It would be fantastic if you were headed to Muskegon to go to the beach since it‚Äôs so close."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,I had a very nice stay
2023-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,The place is so beautiful. It matches the pictures and the description.

2023-01-01,5,Group trip,"Cute and quaint. Everything as described, very tidy . Would be amazing during summer months as its in walking distance to water ."
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Cozy
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Cute cozy cottage. The I structures for arrival were extremely easy. Great place near the beach. Woke up to a doe laying down in the back yard both mornings.
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My boyfriend and I stayed here as an annual pre-Christmas-time staycation to visit some areas around the state, and we had a really lovely time! The place felt very cozy which was important as we spent most of our time in the home itself. As other reviewers said there are deer that come wandering around and hanging out in the neighbor's backyard. We saw them each day! We ended up going to the beach briefly when it was less cold, and we didn't realize how close it was--4 mins. This place would be a really great for the summer. We were also there in the down season, so it was very quiet and peaceful. The kitchen equipment was only essentials (no kitchen knives, or salad bowls) but we had no trouble working with what was available. We would totally come here again. I wish we had been here for a season where we could swim, but this worked perfectly for what we were looking for--a cozy place to relax and visit a new part of Michigan."
2022-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The house is beautiful and perfectly located, close to the beach. Evan is very responsive and was available when we had issues."
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I had a wonderful stay for the weekend with my mom. The house is beautifully decorated, comfortable, cozy, and warm even in the winter. The stairs can be a bit precarious, especially when icy, but they weren‚Äôt too bad if you take them slow. We saw a family of deer each morning which was really special.
Evan was a very responsive host when we had a small issue, even very early in the morning, and he helped us solve the issue as quickly as he could, which was greatly appreciated! I would certainly stay again."
2022-11-01,4,Stayed with kids,üëç
2022-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,Needed a place while in town for the loss of my father and this house served just fine. Thanks again for hosting my family!
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We loved the place and would definitely stay again! Location and home were both 10/10
2022-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"Host was very kind and great to work with. The house was very clean, modern, and felt incredibly welcoming. We got to see some deer waiting out the rain as well !"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"Evan‚Äôs place was perfect for us. Super cute, great location and Evan was very easy to work with. We would stay there again!"
2022-10-01,5,Group trip,This was a cool little house. Comfortable stay
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Evan was great to work with and very responsive. Unfortunately we could not stay as we had to cancel at the last minute but the house looked lovely and it‚Äôs in a great location.
2022-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"Our check-in went well and everything about the overnight was just perfect. We enjoyed the recommendation for dinner. Great Italian food! The beds were amazing. Loved the atmosphere and we survived the trek up the stairs. Good for us seniors a little extra work for our knees and our hearts. Never hurts to push your limits. The house was just spotless and up to date decor! Deer outside the window was an extra treat for us in am and evening. We will come back when we are in the area again. Thanks, Evan for a lovely stay!"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Loved our stay! From the cute little kitchen, to the bedrooms, to the living areas it was perfect for our long weekend. The location was great for being close enough to downtown but also to the lake and canal. Very quiet and relaxing atmosphere and we even got to admire the deer hanging out in the neighbors back yard."
2022-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Very cute place. Clean and renovated. Worked well for a quick overnight stay, even with three small children. Beds were very comfortable and I loved the towels. Just cute and well-appointed all around. Not sure it would have worked for the size of our family longer term, but overall a great place. Note to anyone with accessibility issues, there are a ton of stairs to walk up to get to the actual house."
2022-10-01,5,Stayed one night,Overall 5 stars. Great place to sleep and enjoy the beach.
2022-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"This is a super charming little beach cottage! The pictures really don't do it justice, it's beautifully remodeled and clean. It's small but feels spacious inside and was stocked with everything we needed. The beach is right around the corner and gorgeous, make sure you catch the awesome sunsets. Beds and couch are comfy, big fluffy towels, and a big smart TV. Very relaxing. Nice little fireplace outside too and a great neighborhood. We'll definitely be back! Perfect for a little getaway or a beach date night."
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great, quaint little beachy style cottage! Perfect for a little getaway."
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Super easy to access, and the instructions were very clear. Everything was really clean when we arrived and it was a wonderful place to stay, especially for our short turnaround. Definitely worth it!!"
2022-09-01,4,Stayed with kids,"Nicely remodeled cottage in a great location. Love how close to the beach it was. My husband and I stayed with our 14 mo old and we were able to make it very toddler friendly with a few quick adjustments. The outdoor area privacy fencing is nice but there is no barrier to keep kids from running toward the edge of the bluff. It wasn‚Äôt a problem for us but something for other renters with kids to be aware of. The house could have used a better deep cleaning but overall worked really well for us. Very comfortable beds and pillows. The mudroom entrance and laundry was awesome for brushing off sand, dropping groceries and bags."
2022-09-01,5,Stayed one night,Beautiful home and very clean. Woke up to deer standing 5 feet from the back room windows. Location is perfect too. Right around the corner from the deck bar and restaurant as well as the beach.
