2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I'd highly recommend staying here! Beautiful location on the river and close to bike trails. The place was clean and spacious, and I loved the pool/ping-pong/air hockey table. It gave us something to do when the weather didn't cooperate with our plans! Tracie was very responsive and accommodating. I'd definitely stay here again if in the area!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Once again, another great stay at Tracie’s place. We cannot wait to go again!"
2023-07-01,4,Stayed with kids,"We usually come to the area for a weekend in the summer and decided to stay here this year. We arrived on a hot day and it was very hot in the house. We quickly turned on the 2 window units, but they were not enough to cool the whole house. One of the bedrooms stayed very hot and uncomfortable. There are several fans around also. One bedroom has a window unit and the other one is in the living area. The second bedroom really needs a window unit or portable air conditioner.
Other than the heat, the house was as described. It has an interesting layout. My kids enjoyed the games and the game table. The kitchen is well stocked. The outdoor area is wonderful. We enjoyed overlooking the river and the fire pit was nice. I wish we would have had more time to use the kayaks, that would have been fun. The dock is nice also. There was plenty of room for 6 of us to sleep comfortably. Overall it was a nice place to stay."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We enjoyed our short stay here, especially using the pool table and kayaks (including a two person one). The river depth around this area is quite shallow, some spots under a foot deep, and it was possible to also fairly easily to go “upstream” since not much current. Enjoyed sitting on the deck and enjoying the nature, including watching a heron. The cottage has quite a bit of room and we encourage others to consider staying there as well."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,Great place to stay. Will stay there again.

2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This was all we imagined and more. The peace and tranquility of this space is amazing. The space was extremely tidy and there was an abundance of amenities. I have read the reviews of others and thought this place seems great. To be honest it exceeded all our expectations and words can not describe how happy we were with our stay! Tracie has been the best host! If we are back in the area again we will definitely want to stay here! We highly recommend you book here before everyone finds out how great it truely is and there are no more vacancies!!
2022-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Tracies place was perfect for what we needed!

2022-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We had such a nice stay at the Sleepy Willow Cottage. The cottage was spacious and nice. Had everything we needed and more inside. There were tons of things to do with the kids outside and the lake was a perfect place to relax and throw out a line. Come prepared for some big fish though, we lost our line twice to a big ol pike. Great memories for me and the kids! Thanks Traci and Chad for an awesome stay! We'll be back next year!"

It’s so peaceful and it was almost silent outside (other than the geese) the whole time we were there. Highly recommend getting up early to hit the hot tub in time for the sunrise. The place was clean, Johanna is great and responsive. The smoke alarm needed batteries and she brought them over right away. We hope to be back!"

2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My husband and I had a wonderful, relaxing time at Joannah's cabin. The cabin is cozy and well kept. Everything was well thought of. We enjoyed the hot tub very much!
Joannah was so easy to communicate with and made us feel very welcomed. We got a great video and photos of the eagle on the river! That just made our stay even better. We will definitely plan another stay in the future."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What a cozy little cabin, and such a peaceful, beautiful location. We absolutely loved the deck and the screened in porch. We sat out there and drank our coffee every morning and even saw a bald eagle fly over the river. The perfect little cabin for a weekend getaway"
2023-10-01,3,Stayed a few nights,"If you are tall you may want to reconsider this location. The main bedroom has a very low ceiling and the door nob to enter the cabin is very low even for me (5ft1) I had to squat to reach. It's definitely a cute cabin with a few add ons to give it a nice atmosphere. The fireplace upstairs is controlled by the thermostat so you'll definitely want to use the heater downstairs to help regulate or you will get very cold. Be careful with the shower in the basement they do have a note that it tasks a while to heat up but when it's where you're comfortable you'll want to be diligent so it doesn't burn you. Only two of the jets worked in the hot tub but due to the rain we were only able to use one of the jetted seats because that area of the tub isn't covered. There's a few areas in the carpets you'll want to be careful there's some tacks that are poking up. They did have champagne, glasses, and chocolates ready for us for our anniversary weekend which was nice."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Perfect couples getaway! Close enough to Big Rapids to go to dinner but far enough away to feel secluded. Very quiet and peaceful. Hot tub was nice it sit in at night. Bring binoculars if you like to watch the birds- there are a lot on the river! Comfy bed and blankets. Screened in porch was cozy and the perfect place to read a book. Highly recommend for a relaxing trip.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The cottage was very clean. The area was quiet and peaceful. we enjoyed watching all the birds on the water. The hot tub was clean and very relaxing. It was the perfect getaway for me and my husband. The host was responsive and friendly.

2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a great stay. The cabin is really cozy and the river view is amazing. We really enjoyed the screened in porch and the hot tub. We went kayaking and saw a bald eagle and egrets. We also rode our bikes around the neighborhood and hiked the White Pine trails. It was a great stay, exactly what we needed."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had such a wonderful stay at this cabin!The host is excellent. The cabin beautiful and fully stocked, even with things you wouldn’t expect, like coffee, paper towels and toilet paper. My husband and I really enjoyed relaxing in the hot tub overlooking the Muskegon River. We gifted the last couple days to my daughter and son in law. The enjoyed the paddle boat and kayaks!

2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This little cabin on the river was everything my boyfriend and I were looking for to celebrate our one year anniversary.

2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The home was absolutely lovely. We went out for my wife's 30th. Sadly it was cold and rainy the whole time but we were able to spend the whole trip enjoying the peace and quiet on the river from the hot tub. Bird watching was great. The one thing I will say is that the pictures do not do the place justice. Would love yo return later in the summer time to enjoy outdoor activities in the area.

Would definitely stay here again, good for 2 people or 4-5 people with all the space and great space use in the basement."
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place had everything we wanted for our anniversary getaway. Lovely wooded area, quite neighborhood and picturesque lace. It felt nice and secluded, but only a few minutes from downtown Big Rapids. Also, the outdoor hot tub with lack view was wonderful."
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Staying at Joannah's Lil' Log Cabin was such a nice getaway for my husband and me. We were able to incorporate his business trip with some fun without staying at another boring hotel. The cabin was accurately described online and it did not disappoint. For a cozy little cottage it had everything we needed to relax and enjoy ourselves including the comfy bed, fireplace, beautiful river scenery, fire pit and other well thought out amenities. The host offered quick response times and very helpful check in and out information and also additional details for places to visit and eat in the area. The restaurants recommended by the host that we tried were equally outstanding! Our favorite part of the stay was the hot tub overlooking the river and the wildlife. It made for a spectacular way to start and end the day! Thank you, Joannah! We would definitely stay again if work or play brings us back to Big Rapids in the future!"

2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The cabin is perfect.... cute, clean, comfortable..great views.... the bald eagle loves to hunt in the shallows right behind the cabin... we saw it every day... magnificent creature!!! We were able to access the river easily from the back yard .. the kayaks were great. We could paddle upstream without any difficulty and then float back.... it was fantastic....
We had a small issue of our own doing, but Joannah responded immediately... it was a fabulous weekend!!!"

2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My wife and I had a nice few days at this cozy cabin with river-front access. First of all, the 4-person hot-tub with river-view was fantastic - new, hot, and clean. The cabin has most modern appliances that were clean and worked, just a bit outdated. Standing functional shower in the basement - nothing fancy but was clean and the water was hot. The bedroom is very small but more importantly the bed was very comfortable. Comfortable couch and chair in front of the gas fireplace/TV. Full kitchen except for dishwasher. Screened-in porch and small front deck with beautiful river view- saw the local osprey catch a fish right in front of the property! Great bird-watching besides the osprey - saw a bald eagle, woodpeckers, swans, herons, ducks/geese. Kayaks/accessories were provided - the water front is fine for kayaking and fishing but not great swimming access.
Besides the cabin itself, the location is fantastic as it is in a quiet wooded neighborhood with no highway noise, yet a very short drive to Big Rapids. Besides all the restaurants and stuff in Big Rapids, there were also several parks, trails, and a nice winery within an easy drive. All in all, if you don't mind an older outdated cabin, it is a great, clean get-away option!"
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great little house with great views. Check in was easy and it was close to Big Rapids with good food options. Would definitely recommend.
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What value! Charming, cozy, clean and well appointed cabin. This place had everything we needed to feel like we could relax in peace and quiet without breaking our budget but with the addition of the hot tub we got to feel like our stay had been upgraded. We have decided we would like to return in the winter and maybe hope to get snowed in!!"
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great little cabin. Beautiful setting. Hot tub was wonderful to unwind at night even in the cool temps. Robes were a nice touch. Fire pit looked great, unfortunately due to windy weather we were unable to use it. Joannah was very responsive to questions . Would definitely recommend."
2022-05-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Great little cabin
2022-04-01,5,Stayed about a week,stop looking ...book it now!! This is possibly the best Airbnb in Michigan. the hot tub is perfect for all time but even better on chilly night then you come in to a nice warm fire. if your into fishing your in a pretty good spot. croton and tippy dams are within driving distance bot to mention rodgers. the river in the backyard also has some good fish. perfect getaway for couples cant recomend enough.
2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My boyfriend and I loved our stay here. The hot tub on a chilly night was amazing. The sun rise over the river was an incredible view glowing through the windows in the morning. Joannah was incredibly accommodating, kind, and had amazing and quick communication. I hope to come back when it’s warmer to enjoy the sand bar and kayaks. Check in and out were both very easy. The house is a great distance from town. Out of the way, but convenient enough to get what you need and grab a great bite to eat :)"
2022-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Our second stay was just as good as the first. Super cozy, everything we needed, great communication, and the hot tub let us enjoy the view and being outside even though it was snowing in April!"

The hot tub is clear and overlooks the river, which was a relaxing way to end each day. Have coffee on the back deck and watch the sun come up, or play cards on the screened in porch. We never wanted to leave, and can’t wait to come back!"
2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We feel like we've discovered a secret! This place is just that awesome. How can it not be booked an entire year in advance? It's a perfect place to just tuck away and ignore the world.
2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"All of the thoughtful amenities provided, a cozy fireplace, robes for the hottub, coffee and kitchen supplies, make this the perfect spot for a carefree getaway, any time of year"
2022-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We very much appreciate all the little touches like the robes and slippers, also the willingness to provide wood and fire starter. This place is THE perfect little get away."
2022-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a wonderful and relaxing two day stay at the cabin. It was super cozy, warm fireplace and the hot tub felt amazing! We would love to visit during the summer months to take advantage of the kayaks and river."
2022-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,Our family loved it. The host even left some cars out for our kids and a little treat. The hot tub was immaculate and the whole space was just as cozy as could be.
2022-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Perfect for a romantic weekend. Loved the hot tub and fireplace. Would definitely consider returning for a summer getaway too.
2022-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Lovely little cabin to enjoy a few days escape with the wife. Stayed here during the winter, but would definitely look at coming back again in the summer to fully enjoy the space and location, despite being 6'5"" and having to take care not to crash my head into a few of the tighter spots :)"
2022-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Perfect little get away to be cozy and relax. The little touches were perfect and appreciated!
2022-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Cute, cozy, and clean little cabin on the river. Loved the hot tub. Nice little getaway! Also appreciated how warm it stayed in the cabin. Would definitely stay again!"
2022-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Perfect couples getaway with a private hot tub overlooking the river! The hosts were super helpful with providing info on local amenities, though you may find it hard to want to head into town. Perfectly cozy for two, be aware that the fireplace is electric, and that half the fire pit is inaccessible due to its proximity to a cliff. We will be back!"
2022-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Extremely clean and cozy spot! Well stocked with everything needed for a great riverside getaway in any season. Hope to return again sometime :)
2022-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The check in and out process was so easy. The cabin was very cozy and we loved the fireplace. The hot tub was a fun added bonus. We just went away a a couple in the winter time but you could have a lot of fun with kids also.
2022-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Myself, my husband, and a couple friends had a blast during our stay. The cabin had so much adorable character, and the view of the river felt like a winter wonderland. We LOVED the fireplace, plants, welcome chocolates, robes, and overall feeling of our stay. A majority of our time was spent in the four-person hot tub, which was easy to operate and perfectly warm. Overall, our time at the cabin was extremely cozy. We had everything we could’ve needed while we were there. Not to mention - the host’s communication with us was incredible. It was easy and fun! Thanks, Joannah and Mark! We look forward to staying with you again."
2022-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"If you're looking for a rustic cabin with modern amenities, this is the place for you! Joannah went above and beyond as a host to provide a comfortable stay. She checked nearly every box of things I look for in an airbnb: HOT hot tub (with robes provided!), fire pit, gorgeous views, quiet neighborhood with privacy from surrounding neighbors, super plush towels, well-stocked toilet paper/soap/a variety of kitchen utensils, gas fireplace (which was easy to operate from wall thermostat), smart TV, comfy couch, firm and comfortable bed. The shower head could be updated, but the water was hot so it was fine! Joannah responded to messages quickly and offered excellent suggestions of things to do in the area. Parking and check-in were easy and the property was well-lit (we arrived after dark.) We enjoyed our winter getaway very much!"
2021-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"beautiful little cabin surrounded by nature! An amazing stay during the winter, and just the place I want to be when the weather is so cold!"

2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Absolutely perfect stay. The cabin was toasty warm, easy to find, and super clean. Host super responsive and kind with helping us with the gas fireplace (silly thing on our part!). Perfect blend of rustic getaway but modern amenities. The hot tub was AMAZING. Great restaurants nearby in the cute college town about 10 minutes drive. Absolutely cannot wait to go back."

2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had such a wonderful time at Joannah and Mark’s cabin! Cozy and warm, with beautiful views of the river and wildlife. Close enough to town to make a supply run or go out to eat; yet far enough away to feel like you’re in a cabin up north."
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We have been to many little Air B & B cabins and cottages and this ranks among top. Lovely, cozy, charming, there has been so much thought put into utilizing the space. Loved the screened in porch, deck, & hot tub; would make a peaceful retreat in the winter months as well. Lots of wildlife on this particular part of the river. Great internet & TV options, well stocked kitchen. Really nothing overlooked by the owners."
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"amazing location, great fishing, beautiful home away from home. already looking for when we can make another visit!"
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay at right on thr river. Owners are very nice and helpful. Perfect little cabin to get away.

2021-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,All the amenities qt the cabin kept us there all weekend. No need to venture out. The river was beautiful! The wildlife qnd it was the cutest little cabin.
2021-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Amazing stay! Quiet, cozy, and the view of the river is beautiful! Stocked with everything we needed for a weekend getaway with our three kids. Having both the river, and hot tub kept our kids very busy & happy. We loved being able to use the kayaks and get out to the sandbar where we were able to swim and look for clams! Very clean, it felt inviting as soon as we walked in. Joanna was absolutely wonderful with communication and made everything so easy. Would definitely recommend!"
2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We could not recommend this place more!! Small but spacious, nestled into a quiet lake community. Perfect getaway place!"
2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,great place
2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Super cute cabin with a beautiful view of the river!
2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,It was very wonderful and beautiful and quite and we really enjoyed staying at the cabin and kayaking and fishing and the bonfires and the walks it was a great vacation
2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The cabin was so quaint and a bit rustic. It was the perfect romantic getaway. The cabin was very clean and had everything that we needed for our weekend stay. The best part was waking up to watch the sunrise and having coffee on the screened in porch. I would absolutely return in the summer months to enjoy the water.
2021-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place is exactly as described. Really nice location, beautifully quiet when we stayed here. The river walk in town is a nice place to visit."
2021-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This little cabin is the perfect getaway for a couple or a family! We had a wonderful stay and there was no need to even leave the cabin! The view is wonderful and the hot tub is the perfect extra bonus! Highly recommend
2021-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had an amazing stay at the Little Log Cabin, which was full of wonderful little touches and had anything you would need, from cooking essentials to bathrobes for the hot tub to a cozy blanket by the fireplace. The weather was great and we went out on the river in the kayaks and the paddleboat. The hot tub has an excellent view of the river and the grill was perfect for cooking burgers whole overlooking the water. We highly recommend it!"
2021-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This cabin is everything you want for a getaway. The deck upstairs overlooks the river (more like a lake!) which is perfect for your morning coffee. Big rapids has great trails and Joannah & mark have kayaks for you to use. They also have a hot tub that overlooks the river! Every detail, down to the robes and pancake mix, are so kind and welcoming. Cannot recommend enough."
2021-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The pictures and descriptions do not do this little cabin or location justice at all! Our family of four (we have a teenager and a 4 yr old) enjoyed the cabin for 3 days and we did not want to leave. Joannah went out of her way to ask about the kids ages and interests and had recommendations for us and even left games and cars for us and the little man. The recommendations for local activities were spot on but really we could have spent every second at the cabin. We spent the majority of our time in the kayaks paddling around the river. The cabin was welcoming, cozy, and I loved the plants. The space was clean and comfortable. The hot tub was a nice addition for the adults, and the wifi helped with keeping the teen entertained while we had some time to ourselves. If you are thinking about booking this for a family, do it. It was perfect for our family getaway!"
2021-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My husband and I really enjoyed our stay at this little cabin - the space itself was cute and cleverly designed, and the hot tub was a PERFECT addition to the wonderful view of the river. Joannah was very prompt in communicating with us, and she gave us some great tips ahead of our stay about different places to eat, shop, and things to do in the area. We especially enjoyed Raven Brewing and BBQ, and taking a walk along the river starting at River Street Park. We would 10/10 recommend this Airbnb!"
2021-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great communication from the host
2021-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Cannot recommend enough. Right on the river! Everything you could ask for (hot tub was fantastic) You simply will not find better hosts!
2021-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very relaxing and enjoyable stay. We loved using the hot tub and drinking coffee on the patio in the sun in the morning!
2021-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The cabin was a quiet retreat with a lot of extras available for use, we would stay here again if we’re in the area"
2021-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We had the perfect getaway weekend. The home is so cozy and the hot tub on the river is incredible.
2021-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The location was great! They had some great tips on Hemlock Park and some local restaurants. We loved the park and will be back to kayak. The local restaurants were amazing (Ravens Brewery, Blue Lake Tavern and Nawal's) The view from the cabin is breathtaking. I love water and being able to enjoy the views was great. I would love to know the history of this cute cabin. My husband is 6'9"" so it was a little challenging for him in some areas,but nothing he's not used to. The hot tub was wonderful and the views at night looking up at the stars, so peaceful. The bed was very comfortable, we slept in longer then we do at home (ok, maybe that's because our kids and dogs weren't with us!) Thanks for a nice peaceful getaway."
2021-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Super cozy top to bottom, great views from the cabin up and down the river, very comfy bed, and a super attentive hostess. Worth it all day long. We will most likely return."
2021-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We really enjoyed our time at the cabin, I highly recommend visiting here. Every aspect of our visit was enjoyable, Joannah is a lovely host and very thoughtful about every detail."
2021-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Joannah’s little log cabin was exactly what we needed. It was easy to find and had everything we needed.
2021-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,this cabin in the woods was better than advertised. had an amazing stay and will be back.
2021-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,they are amazing. and the place is so cute!
2021-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Such a quaint cabin! A bit rustic, but that added it's charm. The hot tub iswhat sold us on the place, but I think we would come back in the summer to enjoy the outdoors and river without going in the hot tub.
Joannah was very thoughtful in getting the cabin ready for our stay with our 2 sons (ages 7 and 5). She left toys and games that they enjoyed and even installed extra locks so they wouldn't get out without us knowing.
She had a lotof recommendations for us on things to do in the area including a great sledding hill!
A fantastic stay!"
2021-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Very small cozy cabin. We visited in the winter after a huge snowstorm and it was the perfect setting! We absolutely loved enjoying the hot tub in the frigid temps. This cabin will not give you the feeling of luxury, but it is definitely all you need for a quaint Michigan getaway. Water takes a very long time to get hot, and there isn’t central heat but the heaters keep it warm enough. Heaters are hot to the touch so maybe not great for little kids in the winter. Beautiful view and super convenient location with excellent hosts. We would definitely visit again!"
2021-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful views! Joannah was very attentive and caring. Would love to come back
2021-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,great place with an amazing view. the hot tub was perfect and made for a great winter getaway

2021-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very cute and cozy rustic stay on the river. Perfect for a winter getaway and we really enjoyed the hot tub! The owners are extremely accommodating and communicative if any issues arise.
2021-01-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"We took a mini- honeymoon in this cute little cottage! We had such a good time taking a step away from all of the business, and just spending time together. Such a good time! We will be back!"
2021-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is such a nice cozy cabin! We came in the winter and had so much fun, it must be a blast in the summer! The cabin is a little quirky, but it is very charming and its quirks never got in the way of a great trip."
2021-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,A very nice place to stay.
2021-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Had a really great time! Cabin was very cozy and had everything we needed. Great view and fantastic communication with Joannah. Thank you!
2021-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,An adorable cabin with a stellar view of the river! We felt right at home in this cozy space!
2020-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"It was an adorable place to stay. Cozy, thoughtgully decorated, perfect for a winter escape. We loved watching the river change as the snow fell over our stay. It was very clean and provided plenty of extra blankets or fans depending on the weather. We wish we could have stayed longer"
2020-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Joannah's place on the river was a perfect getaway over our holiday break. There are some nice trails nearby (NCT - North Country Trail) and White Pine Trail and there was also plenty to keep us busy around the cabin as well. Thank you!
2020-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"You can expect a relaxing and thoughtful stay in a cozy cabin with touches of home. The space inside is really much bigger than it seems, you could bring a whole family in the summer or have a romantic getaway any time of year. The hot tub is a nice touch and Joannah was very prompt with communication and answered all of our questions. Would recommend!"
2020-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"A lovely, cozy little retreat on the water. The cabin is so neat and comfortable and really well maintained. So cool watching the bald eagles flying over the water from the deck! There’s also a screened-in porch facing the water, I imagine it’s so perfect in warmer weather. And the hot tub was the perfect touch :)
Check-in and communication with Joannah were super easy as well. Would definitely recommend staying here!"
2020-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The cabin is very nice. The space is set up for small groups to mid size groups. Very clean with beautiful setting on the river. Nice fire pit out back. Very easy to find and close to the city for any needs. The host was very quick to respond to any questions
2024-06-01,5,Stayed about a week,"We planned this as our 30th wedding anniversary. Zachary was always quick to answer questions before we arrived. He went above and beyond to prepare for our arrival. It was a wonderful week as we were treated by rose petals on the bed, a dozen roses on the table with candles lit. Combine that with some wine and chocolate covered strawberries from the local shop and we had a memorable 30th anniversary. The home was immaculate and well stocked. Plenty of room to cook or eat out. Zachary even offered up several great places to eat. If you want peace to relax, get away, and have tons of room to spread out, this is the place.
There was one negative- we did not pack for the weather. It was a cold snap getting down below 40 at night and we were not prepared for the week. Good thing Zachary had extra blankets for us warm weather people. Thank you again, Zachary."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The home was very clean, but inviting. Everything was easy to locate and the the view from the deck is absolutely amazing!
The tub was very much appreciated and there was plenty of hot water.
Upon arrival there was romantic music playing, lit candles, and fresh flowers! Zach’s home really is a perfect romantic get-away! I was really pleased to find plenty of local restaurants available for delivery!
Zach has even mailed us a few forgotten items! We’re really looking to be able to stay again!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Zachary goes above and beyond to make guests feel special and welcome! The house is very private and peaceful. We loved sitting on the porch in the morning and we appreciated the kayaks and life jackets; it was so peaceful to paddle on the lake. We used the house primarily as a landing spot to explore Michigan, so we didn’t spend much time there during the day, but it is extremely well equipped. You can’t really see the lake from couches, so just know that. Beautiful view from the table, kitchen, and porch, though. The bed was extremely comfortable and the kitchen was perfect for making breakfasts, coffee, and cocktails."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The house was spotless and really comfortable, and the view from the deck is hard to beat. An easy drive from Chicago, I’ll definitely be back!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My Girlfriend and I thoroughly enjoyed our stay at Zachary's property! It was beautifully decorated, had every amenity and was very clean. Zachary was extremely helpful and made our stay very easy. We loved the private waterfront views off the back deck, the beautiful kitchen and kayaking/fishing in Rogers Pond. We would highly recommend this property to anyone looking for a relaxing private getaway. Thanks again Zachary!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Zachary’s communications were excellent and he was available if needed, but not intrusive. There were so many extras: beautiful fresh flowers, coffee, creamer, sweet treats in the fridge, and music playing when we arrived. We search for vacations homes with well appointed kitchens (I have celiac disease) and we were not disappointed! There were plenty of areas to venture out to see (Frederik Meijer Gardens and Sculpture Park was amazing and about 45 miles away)."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place was wonderful to stay at. My partner fell under the weather on day two, so we spent a lot of time inside the house relaxing, or sitting out on the amazing deck with a beautiful view! The bathroom is a dream, it has a great kitcken set up, and it has all the amenities you could need. Zack was super responsive and helpful. Very accommodating when I mentioned I wanted to leave a night early just because I was missing my kitties. Would love to come here next summer!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed about a week,Nice place with every you need and it is kept very clean.
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very awesome place to stay! Beautiful area and some fun places to explore. Would recommend staying

Zachary is such an amazing host!
Such a beautiful, clean, welcoming home with a absolute breathtaking view!
Super romantic for a getaway, i can’t wait to be back !!
Thanks Zachary!"
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The house is a perfect romantic getaway for a good value. The views of the waterfront are so calming. Plenty of good restaurants, beaches, and hikes to go on near by. Would recommend."
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Zachary's home was absolutely amazing. from the moment we walked in, it was very clean and spacious. very private for a romantic getaway or if you need some space to get away from the city."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed about a week,Zachary's place was inviting and accommodating. The extra touches and state of the art appliances made it feel like your home only fancier. Relaxing and close to many attractions and citie.
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Absolutely gorgeous, clean, updated home! Zachary went over and above with little extras for us and just all around nice guy. Thank you 😊"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is our second time here at Zach’s place. It was just as amazing as the first time. Spent the weekend celebrating my significant others 30th birthday. Zach’s personal touches is what keeps us coming back. His place is very spacious, clean, and the view is beyond spectacular! We will be visiting again soon! 10/10"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed about a week,My girlfriend and I had a very nice time at Zach's place. It was clean and comfortable and spending time on the deck was pleasant and private. It is a great couple's getaway spot. Thanks Zachary!
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Absolutely wonderful place to stay for a romantic getaway. The lake house is far enough from other houses that it gave a cozy and private atmosphere. Our favorite part was eating our meals outdoors on the picnic table while looking at the lake. The kitchen is well equipped, the grill is easy to use, and there is coffee/tea/spices stocked (big plus!). The host responds very quickly, so it's easy to reach out if there are any issues.
There are some many parks and outdoor areas around, but the hiking trails we found were not super well maintained. We still had a lot of fun, so this wasn't a big issue."
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Zach’s home is beautiful with a gorgeous view. It was such a relaxing stay. Zach went above and beyond in adding all the extra special touches for us and was very attentive.
2022-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We really enjoyed our stay at Zachary’s place! The view was amazing, his home was warm and comforting , and the vibe was just right for the néw year. We will be back in the future!"
2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a lovely stay at Zach's lake house. Zach is an incredible host, stellar communication throughout the trip, and we could tell he really cares. We loved the surprises and nice touches he added to make us feel welcome and cozy (a welcome gift basket with local snacks, a bottle of rose in the fridge, music playing as we walked in, a nice rose petal decorations in the bedroom,...) – when I say that he cares, I mean it! The house itself is very comfortable, well taken care of, and the view is absolutely stunning. The only thing we were a bit disappointed about was the bathroom, as we had some issues with the hot water for the bath (there wouldn't be enough hot water to fill the tub and we'd have to wait for it to heat up again) and the low water pressure made it tricky to enjoy the rain shower (though we never had any hot water issue with the shower!). But these were really small things amongst an absolutely lovely stay, Zach was as always super quick and proactive in communication with us, and we would 100% love to stay there again! Thanks Zach for sharing your beautiful place with us!"
2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful home!! This property will not disappoint. Everything in the house is clean and comfortable. The bed is a quality mattress and the home is well equipped for anything your planning to do.
Zachary is a very gifted host and goes above and beyond with personal touches. This was my best Airbnb experience so far. Can't wait to come back and enjoy that amazing view!"
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great couples getaway with an awesome view and nice amenities
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Zachary was great with communication and the place was beautiful. Perfect getaway for couples and we hope to come back again.
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is our second time at this house. It has a very nice view, and is very close to downtown. The treats from Kilwins are a nice added touch. It's a great spot to get away for a long weekend. We will probably be back in the future."
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great stay!!! Had a wonderful time. Zachary did a very good job at setting everything up like walking in to music playing, candles lit, and the flower petals on the bed was a nice touch to set the tone for the stay!! Also Zachary had a quick response time as far as answering any questions we messaged him. Will definitely be back in the future!!!"
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The lakehouse is a fantastic stay. The views are amazing and the house is modern and well stocked. Zachary is a great host who went above and beyond and communicated very well throughout. We would definitely recommend staying here.
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Amazing time at a very clean and cozy getaway. We were very impressed with the attention to detail, and the effort that Zachary put forth to ensure we had a memorable weekend. The view was great and Kayaking was very enjoyable! The home was updated, clean, and well laid out. We will definitely recommend this to our friends and family!"
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Awesome stay with the best waterfront view! Zachary was a great host.
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Zachary’s Airbnb is exactly what we needed. Amazing place to stay and unwind. If given the option get the kayaks. You won’t regret it! Thanks again to Zachary- Cristal & Oscar
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"A beautiful home on a spectacular setting. From the moment we walked in we felt the relaxation. Zachary knows how to set the mood. Soft music was playing, candles were lit, fresh flowers in vases. Plus we mentioned it was our anniversary so Zachary had some special things lined up for us. The inside is tastefully appointed and the kitchen is super high end quality. Beautiful home. We spent most of our time relaxing with cocktails on the gorgeous deck just mesmerized with the beautiful view. So peaceful. Zachary thanks!! We will be back for certain."
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Zachary goes both above and beyond just his magnificent home. He gives a personal and intimate touch for you and your partner to arrive to, in a house that by itself is beautiful and when you add in the views as well is just stellar. We felt at home and were actually able to shred the stress of life for a few days and both enjoy the company and give ourselves the mental break we needed from life. 10/10 would absolutely recommend just for the house and location alone, add on top a stellar host and you couldn’t ask for better."
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is the perfect couples get away. Zachary is a host with the most.
The property is beautiful, well kept, and had everything we needed for our time away.
I highly recommend!!
There isnt much to do in the town, but the serenity of his home makes up for it."
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Absolutely 100% as advertised! Took our time stopping at delis and fruit stands on the way to the cabin and then settled in for several days of doing nothing.
The home was clean and very well appointed. Everything we needed was there. A totally adult space and awesome for a romantic getaway.
Zachary thought of all the smallest details and made us feel like welcomed and valued guests. No surprises and worth every penny. We will be back!"
2021-07-01,3,Stayed a few nights,Great view in a not-so-good location. Deck should be better taken care of (flower pots are only in pictures) and better furnished. Host asks guest to wash sheets and towels - how do you guarantee the previous guest did this in a proper and hygienic way?
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful Airbnb!! Zachary was an amazing host, and went above and beyond in setting up his home for our arrival. The views of the lake were perfect, and there was plenty of things to explore in the area. One of the best Airbnb's we have stayed at!! Highly recommend staying here"
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place is amazing. You can’t beat the views and the home itself is amazing. Top notch kitchen appliances, the decor, and the general comfort of the home made for the perfect romantic getaway with my love. Zachary is an amazing host and his thoughtfulness really made our stay special. Highly recommend!"
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Zach's place was a perfect couple getaway. The view was amazing and it was peaceful. The house had everything we needed plus some things we didn't think about! I can't wait to try to book again next year.
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,A great place with a beautiful view. Peaceful. My husband and I sat on the deck on the Fourth of July weekend and listened to the birds singing in the trees. Peaceful on the Fourth of July is extremely rare on any waterway. Great find for us!
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was property is great for two people looking for a quiet getaway on the water. The deck was private and the view was amazing. The house has modern amenities and is clean, comfortable, and well kept."
2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Zach is a wonderful host. He went above and beyond, answering any questions we had thoroughly and quickly, even built a ramp into his home to make it accessible for us. He had little surprises all over to make it feel special. The house was spacious and had an amazing view. It was super clean when we arrived and we loved the kitchen. It was a great experience that makes us very eager to come back."
2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"A great weekend getaway! Great experience as soon as you open the door, music playing, candles lit, and a nice welcome basket. The house has great amenities, the bath is great, 5G WiFi, lots of streaming options, and the lake view is beautiful. We hope to return someday!"
2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Zach is an excellent host . He really strives to improve your experience . You will have great communication with him . Thank you Zach !
2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Everything Was excellent!
2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"You will regret not booking this. It was amazing. Beautiful scenery. Driving distance of many attractions. Beautiful pond for kayaking. The house was beautiful too. Great time, great vibe, great price!"
2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,What a beautiful home with many little touches to make it special. The view was breath taking. The kitchen was well stocked with everything you need. Definitely would recommend and will visit again.
2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Are you looking for a place to unwind, relax, and maybe even deepen the connection between you and your significant other? You should look no further. Zachary puts in all the work, details, details, details! Roses? Check! Flowers? Check! Romantic mood set? Check! Amazing tub? Check! Great view of the water? Check! Nature right out the window? Check! Bald eagle dipping down and grabbing a fish right in front of us? Check! Kayaks? Worth it!
We were most definitely pleased with our choice to get away at this lovely little place, and we’re confident you will be too! The great communication with the host was really appreciated as well!"
2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My husband and I came to Zachary's home for our honeymoon and it was super relaxing and stress free. Zach was very communicative about every question we had, and was a superb host giving recommendations for food and activities in the area. Upon entry we were greeted with fresh flowers, candles and music! A complete surprise for us, and it really set the mood for a nice relaxing couple of days. The kayaks were an awesome addition as well, even though it was a bit chilly while we were there. The view was incredible. We watched a few sunsets on the back deck with a glass of wine in hand! It's a bit tough to get down to the water access, but we did a bit of fishing from there. There are some logs relatively close to shore that took some lures from us, but that's how it goes. This home has everything you need and the soaking tub was one of our favorites. We definitely took advantage of the updated high end kitchen. Five stars all around and huge thanks to Zachary for making our honeymoon perfect!!"
2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My husband and I really enjoyed our stay at Zachary's house on Roger's Pond. He was a fantastic host that went above and beyond to make the trip extra special. The music, candles, flowers, and champagne created the perfect romantic vibe for a relaxing getaway. The view from the deck was beautiful and, if you're into birdwatching, it was an excellent location for spotting eagles, osprey, pileated woodpeckers, and towhees. Thank you, Zachary!"
2021-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Zach was a great host. Very communicative and added a lot of nice little touches to our stay. We were very comfortable the whole time and the kayaks were a lot of fun too. Cannot recommend this place or host enough!
2021-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Zach’s place was more than we could’ve asked for! We spent most of our time at the place soaking in the tub and making some delicious meals, enjoying the view of the lake. We enjoyed breakfast and mimosas on the dock, picnic style, and really felt like Zach’s spot was the perfect place to relax and reconnect. We did stop into town to check out raven brewery & BBQ as recommended- great beer! We shared the poutine & we were in foodie heaven! We also enjoyed a nice nature hike while we were in town. ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ Zach’s place is 💯 the place to book if you’re looking for little romance and relaxation."
2021-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This trip was a hidden gem. My husband and I had an amazing experience during our relaxing weekend getaway. Zachary made us feel warmly welcomed from the moment we stepped inside. Highly recommend! We were close to local favorite restaurants and everyone was nice wherever we went. Thank you for having us!
2021-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great hospitality, a great view and a cozy home."
2021-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This place is awesome. It exceeded our expectations. Zach’s hospitality and special touches puts this place above all the rest. Highly recommended.
2021-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My fiancé and I had a very romantic, relaxing time at Zachary's space. There were special touches that felt just for us throughout that made the first walkthrough a delight. If you're looking for a special weekend with your loved one, I couldn't recommend this spot more. Thanks Zachary!"
2021-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place is the best! We have stayed in many Air BnB, but never with an amazing host like Zach
He set up the place with romantic touches, music, roses, Champaign ect....this by far made the stay so much better!
We will be returning in the summer! For sure!!!"
2021-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We’ve stayed in a lot of Airbnb’s and Zachary’s place is one of our favorites. This was our second stay in his place. We came up for our dating anniversary in September and left engaged, so when we started planning another trip up from Indiana to visit family, we went right to this listing to see if it was available again. We were so pleased to find that it was, and we booked again without hesitation.
First and foremost, Zachary is one heck of a host. There simply aren’t any others out there like him. He goes the extra mile without being intrusive. He always leaves the place with candles burning everywhere, fresh flowers, and happy music playing upon entry, which really sets the tone for the whole stay. This time, we came in to find rose petals on the bed, and a box of chocolate covered strawberries.
Now, for the place itself—both living rooms are perfect for chilling. We always have a hard time picking which one we want to spend our time in. Both sofas are perfect for tv watching or curling up with a book.
The kitchen is equipped with modern conveniences that most don’t have at home, so it’s a great place to cook or make a snack.
The bedroom is cozy, and the bed and pillows are FABULOUS. Be prepared to have a great night’s sleep!
Now, for the bathroom. The shower is amazing but the bathtub is a dream. My husband and I both enjoy that the most when we are there. The closet is stocked with fluffy towels (and once you try that bathtub you’ll go through them quickly).
The deck with beautiful view of Roger’s Pond is the best. When we visited in the summer, we enjoyed opening the French doors up so we could have an outdoor feel inside. This time, the pond was frozen and gave the feels of a perfect winter wonderland.
If I could give this place AND Zachary ten stars, I would. If you’re visiting western Michigan, look no further for your perfect retreat. We will rebook every time we are in the area."
2021-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Zachary’s house is beautiful, spotless and has picturesque views. He went out of his way to make our weekend special and romantic. You will not be disappointed if you stay here!"
2021-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We were looking for some much needed downtime for a short weekend, and found the perfect location just for two. Zachary took those extra steps that many locations don’t to ensure we had a memorable and relaxing weekend together. Highly recommend this spot overlooking the Muskegon River for anyone looking for quiet. Thank you 🙏 we hope to be back soon."
2020-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful setting on a lake. Decor is sleek and stylish. Wifi worked amazing. Kitchen was well stocked and the only thing we missed was a can opener (thank God for Google hacks, lol). We had a very enjoyable time. Zachary made it extra special by going the extra mile and providing wonderful welcome gifts. Would suggest to anyone looking for a romantic getaway."
2020-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,A terrific host and a terrific setup for a beautiful weekend getaway!
2020-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I cannot say enough good things about this house, this location and most of all, the host. Zach's place is so beautiful and spotless - all new finishes, high-end appliances, bed soooo comfy, big and roomy home, big and roomy jetted-tub and shower, nice hot water - I could go on and on. And the view!? OMG - just A+. Easy to get to as well - right off 131. And Zach's hospitality is exemplary. Even though I wasn't coming for a romantic weekend [ :-( ] he still left candles burning for a relaxing environment and some delicious gift basket goodies! He always, always responded quickly and was always so helpful and kind. He even has food in the fridge he offers to you - while I didn't need any of it - it was nice to know there was butter or syrup or things like that had I forgotten to bring things like that. Lots of coffee choices and all the appliances/dishes/utensils you could ever need.
I am already trying to plan my next visit. And frankly, if and when he ever sells this place, I'd jump at it! LOL"
2020-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Zachary’s place is a 5 star place to stay we didn’t have to bring much with us he had everything we needed and more. Anytime you need anything message him and he will get right back with you. Everything you need is like 10 minutes away from the house. We would definitely recommend this Airbnb to our friends and family.
2020-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,My wife and I loved our time at Zach’s! Really nice appliances but we ate at all the cute restaurants in the area. Felt very safe everywhere. He made us feel so special! Looking forward to visiting in the summer. This is an amazing fishing location with a boat launch less than a quarter mile down the road. Thanks for everything brother man!
2020-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This was the perfect setting for our anniversary/birthday weekend get away. The water view was gorgeous. It was fun to cook in the kitchen with top of the line appliances. We appreciated having an outdoor grill as well. The gift basket and sweet treats that Zachary provided were a welcoming touch. This was a beautiful spot to hang out and relax.
2020-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,You can expect for Zack to be very attentive to your specific needs and also his communication is very prompt instructions are thorough and the home is clean anything that you need for your stay he thought of amazing choice I would definitely recommend this one nice romantic getaway for two
2020-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Would highly recommend this lovely house on the lake! Amazing views, modern and clean amenities, and so many thoughtful touches by the host, Zachary, that made the anniversary trip for my husband and I memorable and enjoyable. A perfect weekend getaway!"
2020-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We were very happy with Zachary's place. First, Zachary himself: Zachary was very communicative prior to the trip, sent restaurant recommendations, and was clear and responsive about check in, etc. Once there, he checked in multiple times to see if he could be helpful, and, although we ended up being pretty self-sufficient, he gave the impression that he would promptly respond about any issues we might be having.
The place: Fantastic view over the water, perfect for sunrise/sunset. Place was very neat and clean. Maybe we're just snobs, but it's somewhat rare to find a lake house with the kind of appliances this one has and that stood out. Enjoyed kayaking. Really first rate all around.
The area: I didn't get the sense that Big Rapids, the closest town, is all that interesting. But we did enjoy getting takeout from Schuberg's, one of the restaurants Zachary recommended, and the others he mentioned looked good as well. (The other night of our trip we cooked using the gas grill, which worked great.) We also spent some time hiking in the Huron-Manistee National Forest, which is a manageable drive away and was very nice.
Overall, would highly recommend, especially if you are looking for a well-appointed lake house to just relax at for a few days."
2020-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This was an amazing stay! Definitely one of the best AirBnb experiences we had. Zach was there to give us a warm welcome and show us around. Definitely take him up on the kayaks. We had everything we could possibly need and then some. He even put fresh flowers throughout the house which added such a nice touch. Would 10/10 recommend and hopefully we’ll return again one day!
2020-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"If you want a relaxing getaway, this is your spot! The deck was great for coffee, cocktails and reading! We enjoyed the house itself as well, very clean and spacious. The tub had a tv, bonus! The lake was calm, quiet and good for kayaking. Would definitely recommend!"
2020-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This location was the perfect setting for a 25th wedding anniversary get-away. Zachary’s thoughtful touches included lit candles, fresh flowers, chocolate covered strawberries, and a gift basket with wine and other goodies all waiting for us when we arrived. Everything was sparkling clean (my husband commented that you could eat off the floor lol), and all of the furnishings, decor, kitchen appliances and multimedia are almost new. We brought all of our own food and used the very nice gas grill on the patio to cook our meals. The kitchen was well stocked with dishes, glassware, cookware and utensils and we had everything we needed. The view over the water is glorious and the side fences offered privacy as I did my yoga practice each morning on the deck. Big screen TVs in every room and a Tv in the bathroom over the jetted tub were just icing on the cake. Some of the other nice details that Zachary has put into this property include His and Hers robes, plush towels, Keurig coffees, teas, bottled waters, pillow top mattress, and even inspiring books to read. In summary, we had a wonderful time and we would definitely recommend this location and Zachary’s excellent service, communication & hospitality."
2020-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Zach is a phenomenal host! Truly one of the best I have ever had. He put so many thoughtful details in place for our stay. The view itself is worth the trip! Definitely rent his kayaks and take them on the water, that was one of our highlights for sure!"
2020-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Very clean, the pictures doesn’t do it justice. Beautiful place, quiet, modern, great host, easy check in and easy check out. Great first Airbnb experience for me!"
2020-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I can’t say enough good things about Zachary as a host, as well as his place!
Zachary met us there and showed us everything at check in. He brought us an awesome gift basket!
Even though the house was in a vacation area and had other houses around, it felt very secluded, especially on the back deck that overlooks Rogers Pond.
First impression of the house was that it was far better than the photos looked. It’s so clean and newly renovated. We appreciated the extra touches, such as candles lit in every room, fresh roses, and soft music. Zachary did an excellent job of making sure we walked right into a romantic space!
We ended up getting engaged on this trip, so this will always be a great space for memories for us. Hopefully we can stay again sometime soon!
If I could give this Airbnb ten stars, I would. Everything was just incredible. You won’t be disappointed if you book this place! Zachary is the best host you could ever ask for, too!"
2020-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Phenomenal stay! What a fantastic vacation and relaxing weekend!
2020-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was a perfect trip! We were looking for a quieter place to stay away from the city, and Zachary's spot was above and beyond great for a mini vacation. His house was super comfortable with surprising high-tech touches, lovely bathroom, and lots of space. And the deck and kayaks really made it a memorable vacation overall. Thanks for a great trip!"
2020-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This is a wonderful place to vacation. You will not be sorry I promise.
2020-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We enjoyed Zachary's gorgeous lake house so much. The lake view was so calming and beautiful and the stars at night were something we haven't seen for a long time. We enjoyed the stay so much and hope to come back sometime in the future.
2020-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"If there is one thing Zach has nailed when it comes to his Airbnb, is his hospitality and his willingness to accommodate. He went out of his way repeatedly to ensure my fiancé and I had a memorable trip. It honestly was worth every penny and more!"
2020-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Wonderful house overlooking beautiful lake. What's there not to like.
2020-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This place was absolutely amazing for a weekend getaway! It was everything we could have asked for and then some! Couldn’t recommend it any more highly 👌!
2020-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Zach is a superb host who communicates throughout your stay. The house is clean, sharp and incredible comfortable."
2020-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We had an excellent experience and the place was amazing and very clean. Zach was a great host and the location was much better than expected. Being right on the lake was awesome! I highly recommend it!
2020-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My boyfriend and I had a wonderful long weekend at Zach’s place. The house had a great lakefront view, was immaculate, and the kitchen was well stocked with all you need for summer grilling. We took the kayaks that we rented from Zach for two days around the lake and up/down the river — the water was very calm so it was great to just hang out and not have to paddle all the time! Stairs down to the lake looked tricky but we managed. Check in was seamless — Zach was very communicative and put in some nice welcoming touches. Highly recommended for city folks trying to get away for a weekend!"
2020-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Spotless and stylish cabin right on a lake with a gorgeous overlooking views. Easy access down a stair case for kayaking and fishing. Zachary was very responsive regarding our trip, check-in was very quick but thorough, and we were even given a very thoughtful gift-basket (including bubbles) that really added to the romantic get away vibe of the cabin. Really enjoyed our cabin on the lake get-away, and would certainly recommend this place to everyone."
2020-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,You will love every moment.
2020-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,A great place with an amazing view! A perfect place to kick back and relax. The house was super clean and modernized. Zachary was a great host! The kitchen has all the little things you need to make meals. Kayaking on the lake was so much fun! We only wish we could have stayed longer... but we will definitely be back!
2020-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The view from the deck is amazing! The house was spotless when we arrived. Zach is a very enthusiastic and accessible host. He was very easy to work with and was very prompt to respond to any questions we had. This was a perfect house for my wife and I to escape to craziness of the big city and unwind for a few days. Zach even made sure to have wi-fi set up prior to our arrival so that my wife could work remotely, and he gave us a great deal on renting his kayaks!"
2020-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Zachary is an incredible host, met us at the beginning of our stay to do a walk through, and has an incredible place. Everything was as clean as could be, on top of lots of thoughtful touches, including a gift basket. On top of that, he rented us his kayaks for an amazing price, and filled us in with tons of local information and suggestions. He is quick to respond, and eager to help wherever possible. The water was fantastic and we truly had an wonderful time. Best Airbnb experience I’ve had, hands down."
2020-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We couldn't have been more pleased with our stay. This little slice of sanctuary conveniently tucked away within a short drive to all possible needs and amenities was exactly what we needed! We are already looking at when we can make our way back for another respite in luxury! Zachary went above and beyond and his cleanliness and attention to care and detail gave us exactly what we needed and more. Thank you from the bottoms of our hearts.
2020-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"A truly remarkable stay! Zack is a host that truly cares and wants his guests to have the best possible stay, and it shows from the moment you walk in the home. The pictures do not do it enough justice.
The space itself is gorgeous. It’s clear that it has been fully remodeled very recently. The kitchen has all brand new appliances that worked perfectly, and Zack has all the essentials stocked in terms of silverware, utensils, salt, pepper, olive oil, etc. We also used the grill multiple times and had zero issues with anything. The bathroom has an incredible shower and a tub that make them hard to want to get out of. The bed was very comfortable and there was plenty of living space to enjoy. Everything in the house worked exactly as expected, we had zero issues.
The main highlight of our stay was the view of the lake, and the access down to it. The house is tucked away on the lake, with it being one of the only homes around that have a lake view. The stairs down to the water are a little bit sketchy, but extremely worth it to venture down! If you’re able, inquire about renting Zack’s kayaks. He gave us a great price and we spent 6+ hours on them in 2 days. The view is absolutely gorgeous when you’re out on the water. There isn’t much boat traffic around the house and if you venture a little bit down the river you’ll run into a sand bar that is a must stop! Between the kayaks and the view from the deck, Zack’s home is one of a kind. We will absolutely be back!"
2020-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Zachary’s place is better than the pictures or descriptions can capture. The place is sparkling clean. The view and grounds are beautiful. This is an amazing weekend or longer getaway for couples. The jetted tub and massive spotless bathroom are well appreciated.
You’ll have everything you need to cook and the finishes are simply beautiful. We didn’t need anything from Zachary during our stay but he checked in just to make sure all was well and gave us that space to really take in this one of a kind property.
We look forward to coming back in the near future."
2020-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Highly recommend this place to any couple looking to get away and relax on the lake for a few nights. Zach is an awesome host and hooks it up nicely. Guaranteed to have a good time if you stay here. Big rapids isn't too far and there is a good amount to do there but honestly, if you are able to take advantage of the house being right on the edge of the water then you may not even have to leave! Enjoy"
2020-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Zachary’ place was perfect for our weekend getaway. The location was easy to find, very quiet and the lake was beautiful. The house was very clean and had everything we needed."
2020-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Place was amazing very beautiful an Zach was a great host
2020-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Zach was very friendly, and accommodating! He was there to show us a round when we got there, and was in communication leading up to and during our stay!
These pictures do not do this house justice!!! The view alone was worth every penny!!! It’s in a very private area on the water, perfect for couples trying to have a relaxing weekend away! This house was spotless!
10/10 I would recommend staying at this home if you ever get the chance!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This was our second stay at this beautiful hidden gem! My wife and I can’t get enough of the peace and comfort that this place has! Teresa and David are amazing hosts ! From the farm animals to the quiet woods and cozy cabin this place has become a regular stay for us!!
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Wonderful hosts for a wonderful stay!! David and Teresa were excellent and we loved our nights in the cabin
2024-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Absolutely loved my stay, wish I had booked another night! The cabin is perfect, better than the pictures and their property is absolutely beautiful. So many friendly animals, and a great spot to reconnect with nature and feel at peace."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"I wish I could give more than 5 stars. Teresa and David were an absolute pleasure to meet. They were friendly and helpful. The pictures don’t even describe how beautiful the cabin was. Just walking the property, we saw more wildlife than you can imagine. The cabin was very cozy, with amenities you wouldn’t even think to expect, such as slippers and fuzzy blankets. The view of the pond was absolutely beautiful. We will frequently visit this cabin. Absolutely perfect for a quick getaway."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Teresa was a very sweet and helpful host! Her cabin was even cozier than what I imagined. It was the perfect getaway surrounded by nature and cute farm animals.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Teresa and her husband were so welcoming and helped us get settled in. She gave us a tour of their beautiful farm and introduced us to the animals. The cabin itself is very cozy and comfortable and a great place to relax. We enjoyed exploring the property, feeding the animals, picking apples and pears, and admiring scenic views. At night, we enjoyed the fire pit, stargazing, and listening to coyotes howl. It was such a peaceful weekend getaway for us that it's a must that we go back. We are extremely grateful to our host."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"my favorite experience I’ve had so far on Airbnb. Beautiful property, amazing hosts, and the most sweet animals. Their cats are a real pleasure & it’s a great place for a relaxing stay. Would definitely recommend to others and even make a 2nd trip!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"It’s a great place to spend the weekend. The cabin was very clean and fully equipped with all the little details that might be needed during the stay. Teresa and her husband were so nice with us, she was very responsive to our needs. They helped us load our staff and drove us to the cabin, they showed us everything around, all the animals were friendly and we were free to go to visit them whenever we wanted. The location is great, the best place to have long late talks by the fire, the lake view was great to enjoy the morning coffee. Also there was a small boat and a zip line to have fun by the lake. This was one of the best stays so far, looking forward to go back!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"Give yourself the break you deserve and book this experience. I say experience because it’s so much more than an overnight stay. Not only does Teresa equip the cabin with everything you could think of needing (firewood, paper towel, extra blankets, coffee, cozy lighting, etc.), but it has things you may not have realized you needed (a cat that follows you like a puppy, the cutest cows you’ve ever seen, fresh apples & pears from trees around the property, a beautiful sunset over a freshly harvested field, monopoly by candlelight). This experience gets you back to the simple things in life, which in todays age I find to be extremely valuable. Thank you, Teresa!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"If I knew before I would definitely visit more often this place!
It’s amazing and very peaceful,it’s really perfect for someone who wants to have really nice vacation and rest!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,Beautiful cabin and location!
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Our stay at Teresa's rustic cabin was a refreshing two-night retreat. The property, with its tranquil pond and friendly farm animals, provided a peaceful backdrop, and Pauly the Cat was an endearing addition to our experience.
Teresa's love for Jesus Christ is evident not just in the serene environment she's curated but also in her actions as a host. Every corner of the property reflects her faith, and her warmth and hospitality were a testament to her deep-rooted beliefs.
Thank you, Teresa, for making our stay comfortable and spiritually enriching. We truly felt the essence of love and kindness throughout our visit."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,Charming location and wonderful hosts. Great stay and would definitely stay again.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Our stay was incredible!! Such a beautiful place with unreal scenery, weather, cute animals, an amazing cabin and hosts. The cabin was so well equipped, it had everything we needed and more. We also really enjoyed making a fire while listening to nature, cooking on the fire, walking around the farm and riding the boat on the little pond. Pauly the kitty was the best company too 🥰 Overall, it was beyond our expectations. Thank you so much!!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,This was an absolutely beautiful setting. Back to nature with all the essentials. It was easy to forget we were off grid. Thanks for sharing your slice of heaven.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Staying in a cabin with grandchildren is the best!
Many thanks for the lovely, rustic, but charming spot.
We loved the farm animals. And the welcoming family.
We'll be back!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Teresa and her place are amazing. From the warm greeting upon arrival to the lovely chat with her husband when we left our experience was better than we could have imagined. I know how trite that sounds but my 10-year old was wishing we had more time and wanting to plan a return trip within 10 minutes of getting to the cabin!
After loading our belongings onto the 4X4 we got a tour of the farm on the way to the cabin. The farm is so well cared for and beautifully kept. I cannot adequately describe the first glimpse of the cabin and surrounding area. The cabin is the perfect size, and Teresa has thought of absolutely everything. It's just beautiful and the personal touches are so very thoughtful.
Outside you'll find a covered picnic table, with well placed mulch underneath, an easy to use bathroom and sink, an excellent rock for wood splitting, and the best fire pit.
We wish we'd had more time to explore the farm and just enjoy being there. Thank you and we look forward to returning!!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,Teresa and Nick were absolutely wonderful host. Their place is absolutely incredible and it really was the perfect place for us to take our engagement photos. Teresa was extremely helpful and accommodating. The cabin itself is very cozy and private which we really appreciated. Overall such an amazing place. 10/10. We will definitely be back!
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This was an absolute JOY. Teresa, David and the whole family are lovely. The cabin was even better than pictured and you can sense the thought and kindness in the air. If you got to this page, don't keep looking, you've found the one- book it!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,My wife and I stayed here one night and wished we booked longer! Amazing setting in the perfect secluded spot away from the hustle! Teresa thought of every little detail when setting up the cabin and was awesome with communication! Bring a pole to fish the pond and apples and carrots to feed donkeys and cows ! We highly recommended and we will be back very soon!!
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,An absolutely lovely place to stay! All the animals are so friendly and fun to be around. Our favorite thing to do was walk around the farm to say hello to the donkeys and enjoy the wonderful views. The cabin is so thoughtfully stocked and has the best cozy vibe. We would definitely come again!!!
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Wow. I don’t want to write this review because I don’t want you to know how wonderful this place is. Small, private, nestled in the most perfect little clearing filled with birds and wildlife. I’ll be back!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"Don’t hesitate to book this beautiful cabin on a breathtaking property! Also, I encourage you to book for at least 2 nights. We booked for 1 night and wished we stayed for longer. Pictures don’t do the justice how beautiful and private this place is! Cabin is right next to the pond and there are trees, hills and farm animals surrounding from all sides. This is a perfect spot for relaxation and getting away from the city. Plenty to do since the property is so huge. Highly recommend!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"The hosts were very kind and seem to have thought of so many details that make a stay here wonderful and inviting. The cabin was private and the walk to and from the location from parking was a short and scenic journey. They are also willing to drive people from their vehicle to the cabin when they are around. We opted to walk a few times as the weather was perfect during the time of our stay and we had traveled light.
We highly recommend this location!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We stopped in for a one-night stay just passing through Big Rapids. Our 3-year-old had an absolute blast helping feed the chickens, brush the donkeys, and playing with the barn cats and dogs. The farm is just beautiful and has something for everyone! Fishing, walking, animals, bird watching, and even a trampoline, pool, and playhouse for little ones. The board games were a nice touch since our Sprint/T-Mobile devices got no service — it was such nice family time off the grid! And if Teresa offers breakfast — take it! $25 for the three of us and we could have eaten it for lunch too: delicious loaded skillet with toast and homemade jelly (that we got to take home!). Thanks Teresa! We’ll be back!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"We had a lovely stay in Teresa’s cabin. It was neat as a pin, clean, and relaxing. It had everything you could ever need. I highly recommend spending the extra $10 for breakfast!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Was very secluded and was very beautiful, had a nice relaxing stay"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Amazing place to relax, even just for a night! Thank you so much for such a wonderful experience!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Had a great stay! Lovely cabin and very nice host.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Genuinely had a great time here! Felt like a part of the family for the weekend, and seeing the dogs chase the four wheeler on the way back to the cabin was a highlight for sure!
100% recommend"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,Wonderful place to spend the night. So peaceful and such a great setting! Teresa and David were as nice as can be. And breakfast was amazing.
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"Teresa's place is an absolute gem. I wish I could have stayed longer. I went on a solo trip, but this would also be amazing for a couple or a couple of friends. Their farm is so beautiful, quiet, and walkable, and I really enjoyed the fresh air, nature sounds, and animals nearby :)
Teresa was very kind, helpful, and responsive. The cabin itself and even the bathroom are totally lovely, and so much thought was put into the amenities, decoration, lighting, and the little extras. It's inspiring to see what they've created there. I would highly recommend!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Teresa was absolutely amazing just lile the last time we stayed! If your looking for a romantic getaway i would highly suggest staying here!
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Wonderful cabin tucked away on their property. Feels private and secluded, but accessible. Near enough to stores and far enough from people."
2022-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"This tiny cabin has everything that guests may need during their stay and those stuff make it more enjoyable. This is proof of the hostess's hospitarity.
Certainly, the hosts Teresa and David are so nice, friendly, easy to talk to, and thoughtful. They know how to welcome their guests very well.
Their cabin is beautiful and super clean. It sat peaceful in nature.
This is a good place where we could recover from the frustrations of our daily busy life. What a blessed place it is!
We'd like to go back there again. Thank you."
2022-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"Booked for a quick one night getaway for my husband I and we both wish we would have booked the whole weekend. The thought that Teresa put into the cabin and hospitality are like nothing we have seen before, you can tell she truly enjoys pampering her guests! We are looking forward to booking another stay."
2022-10-01,5,Stayed one night,We had a wonderful stay at this farm cabin. The setting is gorgeous and Teresa was very welcoming to her property. We plan to return in the future.
2022-10-01,5,Stayed one night,We can not think of a better getaway for the two of us! We are already talking about coming back next year! The communication was excellent and Theresa went above and beyond to ensure that our stay was nothing less than perfect. She had the cabin fully stocked with anything we could imagine needing. Walking the property in the cool morning with a warm cup of coffee was the icing on top of an impeccable stay.
2022-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"Honestly, you cannot ask for more. Teresa and David were some of the friendliest and gracious people I’ve ever met. Their little cabin is an escape, tucked into the woods on their property, but it’s SO NICE! It’s rustic, but everything was so clean and perfectly set up for maximum comfort. Like Goldilocks and the Three Bears, this place is JUST RIGHT (and not a bear in sight to boot). It’s like you stepped into a dream. The animals, from the cats to the chickens to the donkeys to the cows were all wonderful and cute and hilarious it was hard to leave. Not only that, the apple trees were dropping ripe apples while we were there, delicious fresh apples! It’s a place you don’t want to leave and a perfect spot to recharge your batteries (especially since it’s a prime location for plenty of BEAUTIFUL hiking trails through Huron/Manistee Forest). We would go back every weekend if we could!"
2022-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"I cannot recommend this location enough! It was my first Airbnb experience and it was a great one. The scenery is breathtaking, and Teresa made the stay fantastic. The location of the cabin was the perfect mix of privacy and closeness, with the animals/farm/main house only a short 5-minute walk away. It was the perfect getaway :)"
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This place was amazing! Their cat Opie stayed with us the 1st night by the fire as we stared up into the stars. Theresa & David we’re amazing people and put together an unforgettable experience. 5 stars is not enough to describe this place and this app should be ashamed to not allow us to rate this place as 6 stars instead.
2022-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,Teresa and her family were so kind and helpful during our stay! She went above and beyond to make sure we enjoyed our time there. The farm itself is beautiful and well maintained and there’s so much to do! The cabin was clean and beautiful and Teresa really put so much thought into all the little details that made our stay that much better. My boys LOVED throwing sticks for the dogs and exploring the woods. We WILL be back. :)
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was everything and more that I needed for my solo retreat!
Teresa went above and beyond. The cabin was super cute and comfortable, the view was amazing, lots of beautiful nature, but super close to Big Rapids if you need anything.
Option of an amazing breakfast for $10 delivered to your door, both were enough for breakfast and lunch!
I hope to come back either alone or with my family!"
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very peaceful and serene! We opted for the farm fresh breakfast both mornings and were not disappointed! Teresa is a great host and a wonderful chef. Her husband Dave was very nice as well. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Everything was amazing. Cute cabin that feels isolated and remote, but is only a short walk to my car. Teresa was a great host."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This property was absolutely beautiful. The cabin was clean, cute and cozy! We loved a the cute touches! Teresa was a great host!"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great place! This was the best Airbnb my wife and I have stayed at. The hosts were very friendly and welcoming while the cabin itself was quant, perfectly located near a pond and the farm yet secluded for privacy. We couldn’t ask for anything to be different and will definitely be returning soon!"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"Charming cabin on a beautiful family farm!!! Everything was impeccable… rustic, peaceful with all the comforts of home! Especially enjoyed the animals and the fresh farm breakfast! Highly recommend and we will be back!"
2022-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"What an amazing gem to have stumbled upon! We had an absolute amazing stay, and actually enjoyed the simplicity of no electricity or wifi, (but with a jackery power station to keep our phones charged, and power a sound machine for help the kids is to sleep).
Teresa is super friendly and quick to communicate back.
We were welcomed to visit farm animals, and the kids helped collect chicken eggs and feed snacks to the animals. The kittens were the kids favorite!
The biggest thing that could have improved our stay was just having our things better organized and only having the minimal things, we had way too many things way under organized (we were in the middle of a move).
There was something for the whole family, my husband and son loved having a fire, all the kids loved the loft and seeing the farm animals and wildlife, I loved the quiet and bird watching, and we all loved going for walks.
The location is out in the country, but with a aldi and meijer 10 mins away! This is a place we would love to come back to! Thanks so much for having us!"
2024-05-01,5,Group trip,"We had a wonderful family weekend. We came to town for my son’s graduation from Ferris State University. Both sets of grandparents were able to come and were completely comfortable. It was a wonderful family weekend. We sat at the table together. We stood around the island in the kitchen visiting and watched movies in the living room together. We sat and visited on the deck, listening to some good stories. We could not have been happier!!!! Precious memories were created, and I am very grateful to have had this place for the weekend.
Crystal was an amazing host, very responsive and accommodating. Thanks for a great experience."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Beautiful place. Had everything that we could have needed and more. Crystal was kind and considerate. She was available if we had any questions or needed anything. The instructions for getting there and into the house were great. She had information about extras that we could use like kayaks, fishing, etc. so we felt right at home. Our granddaughters enjoyed every bit of our stay. Plenty of room for everyone and the kitchen table was large and could accommodate all of our family. Will definitely stay here when we return to Big Rapids."
2024-06-01,5,Group trip,This was a beautiful space inside and out. The private lake was quiet and relaxing.
2024-06-01,5,Group trip,"Our group had an amazing time at Hillside Hideaway. The house is beautifully decorated, the kitchen fully stocked, and includes a wonderful view. Sarah and Frederico were very helpful and gave detailed check-in instructions that made our arrival stress-free. Make sure to stop at Meijer to grab water for drinking as they suggest! Overall, we are very happy with our choice to stay here and will certainly come back if the opportunity arises!"
2024-05-01,5,Group trip,"Excellent Spring vacation spot with our family of 6. Beautiful Lakefront location. Really enjoyed the Hot Tub, Outdoor Fire pit and Kayaks ❣️ We'll be back😁"
2024-04-01,3,Stayed with a pet,"Lovely property and house. Very peaceful lake, comfortable furniture, and cozy home.
The tap water is very sulphuric, which was our only complaint. It was hard to shower with and the fridge filter was not strong enough to make it very potable. It still had a yellow color and slightly sulphuric odor. I’d highly recommend bringing in bottled water and this should be more communicated by the management company."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"An absolute gem tucked quietly away by the lake. This place serves as a perfect retreat from the loud city life and has a certain essence that just makes it feel so “homey”. I was here with my girlfriend and dog, but there was so much more room (including lots to do for children such as an outdoor play house and a little section upstairs in the cabin. Truly a blissful experience in Michigan."
2024-04-01,5,Group trip,"We were a group of church ladies visiting for a weekend getaway. Within an hour of being at the Hillside, there was a unanimous vote to visit again soon! The cabin was comfortable, spacious, inviting and relaxing. We found everything we needed and enjoyed sunrises and evening campfires overlooking the pristine lake.
Pros:
-The view is gorgeous!
-The coffee and drink stations were super fun and useful for a group.
-The fixtures and décor were fun to look at and well thought out.
-We loved how cozy the gas stove made the first floor feel!
-Communication from the host was excellent, friendly and timely.
-The location is almost completely surrounded by nature.
Cons:
-If you visit with a group of adults, the single beds on the 2nd floor are manageable, but don’t afford a lot of overhead space. They are fine for kids.
-If you use the driveway to unload (instead of taking the stairs) it is VERY steep and can be daunting for some drivers. It was not a deal breaker for our group"
2024-04-01,5,Group trip,"We can't wait to come back! The host was very responsive and even when we ran into trouble with the stove it was quickly and easily solved! any time I had a question or suggestion I don't think I ever had to wait for a response for more than a few minutes. The location is a little confusing at first (we didn't realize it was down the hill from the parking) but I wouldn't consider it a difficult place to find. Overall my party of 7 of us were all very impressed and loved the general atmosphere. Not to mention how conveniently close it was to food and groceries as we had to make a few trips for extra things during our stay. All in all, a wonderful and peaceful getaway!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Our stay was amazing! Everything was as it looked and was described online. The home was clean and ready for our party of 10. Very spacious and easily accommodated our group. The kids loved the upstairs and room with the two beds. Gave the kids some privacy from the adults.
The campfire and view from the hot tub are breathtaking. The hot tub was awesome and a highlight for kids and adults alike.
Our host was prompt in response times when we asked questions.
We would highly recommend this home to anyone with a love for outdoors and wants a getaway! We have a fabulous time!!!!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Hillside Hideaway was picture perfect. It was beautifully decorated, very clean and fully furnished! I loved all the extras that the hideaway offered. One of my favorite extras was the fur baby items - tie out, dishes and doggy bags! So thoughtful. I also loved that there were plenty of linens.
The house offered lots of games to play! Our kids were big fans of the “kids camp” area and outdoor slide. Such a great use of space.
We can’t wait to go back! Sarah did such a great job making it feel like home. 💗"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Very clean, very comfortable, and would absolutely stay again."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We had a lovely short stay in big rapids & this place was perfect for us and our pups!
Hosts responded quickly & location was beautiful.
Hot tub does not get super hot but would still book again!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,5 beam
2024-03-01,5,Group trip,"The owners were always willing to help us if we reached out, the house was beautiful, and well equipped will anything you’d need."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We came for an end of winter getaway, and what a perfect getaway it was! The home is beautiful, spacious, thoughtfully designed and curated, and very cozy! The view of the lake, and the hot tub under the beautiful stars was wonderful. We very much enjoyed how peaceful it was, and enjoyed going for scenic walks. Thank you for sharing your home and providing the perfect end of winter getaway for us! We hope to visit again in the future!"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Our friend group had a great, relaxing stay. We were also lucky enough to hear ""singing ice"" on the lake, as the conditions were perfect. We would definitely stay again."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Hillside Hideaway was beautiful! My group and I felt welcomed & made lots of great memories in the space. Communication was spectacular, very thorough and proactive. They were extremely patient and accommodating when we were having vehicle troubles upon leaving!"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Beautiful place, very quiet area and peaceful. Hosts were very friendly and responsive."
2024-02-01,5,Group trip,"Every year, for the last five years, my sister and I do a birthday trip weekend, where we go out of town and kind of do whatever we want to. A little escape from reality for the weekend. We get an Airbnb and get our family and friends together that we haven’t seen that live all over and we chill and watch movies, eat snacks and good food, play cards and just enjoy each others company. Nothing crazy. And this was by far the best agreed upon, within our usual group that comes, Airbnb rental that we’ve stayed at. Thank you so much for being so responsive and helpful and your home was absolutely beautiful. We for sure hope to be back!"
2024-02-01,5,Group trip,"Great host, great place, 2 thumbs up!"
2024-02-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Cozy woodland retreat. Best pillows we have ever had at an air bnb!!
Would be an excellent spot for large family gatherings. Just a short drive into Big Rapids."
2024-01-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Beautiful home and very comfortable, we hope to stay again in the future."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,My family and pup enjoyed our stay at Sarah's. We loved the setting and the house was cozy for our group. Thank you for having us!
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Our family had the most amazing Christmas here. We are a large family and was able to have all of are children and the grand kids there together with plenty of room for everyone. The kids just love the upstairs and the slide outside and all of us spent the evenings in the hot tub relaxing. Our host Sarah and her husband had a beautiful Christmas tree in the livingroom and the house was so lovely. We are already talking of are next trip we take here this coming summer. This home is a must for a great time spent with your family.
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,Amazing views and nature. Winter wonderland!
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I got some (unexpected) free days at work and spending them at Sarah’s house was the best way to do it. The hot tub and fire pit were my favs with that lake view. Beautiful location, perfect if you wanna take a break from the city chaos. I’ll definitely be coming back in the summer and bringing my nephews since there was this lil playground perfect for them.
Sarah and Federico were responsive and friendly. Willing to help at all times. Thanks!!"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Just a quick notes for those not familiar with the area. it's rather steep when you get down to their walk away down to the home, just a heads up and something to be aware of. also bring bottled water if you don't like hard water. they have a water softener but after fridge filter but it's still strong after not having it for a while.
other than that, great stay, great hosts, would recommend"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We had a great time at Sarah's place. It was 4 adults and 2 kids, and we could have easily fit more. The view of the lake is beautiful and peaceful, without a million houses surrounding the lake. We went in the off-season and really enjoyed the hot tub, all the board games, the gas fireplace, and the grill. My nephews learned how to play checkers and how to use a wafflemaker - lots of fun for them. We are discussing a return trip in the summer when we could enjoy time on the lake :)"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Wonderful stay. Beautiful home and hosts were super helpful! Even offered to arrange local support when my car died day of checkout. We had a wonderful time. Welcome tray of cookies, cider, and a candle was very sweet!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,It was perfect!
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Great location to get a view of the leaves changing for autumn. The home had a clean smell once we opened the door. Kitchen was fully stocked. There was a bar area with more than enough glasses, a coffee station also stocked. My family was able to enjoy the kayaks, jacuzzi and other amenities on the property which made for a great stay. I really appreciated how the home was decorated and seemed to have everything one would need on vacation."
2023-10-01,5,Group trip,We enjoyed our trip to the hillside hideaway! The fall colors were brilliant!! The area was quite and the hot tub was perfect!!
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"BOOK NOW! Our stay at Hillside Hideaway was AMAZING!!! When we pulled up, the warm cafe lights welcomed us and let us know we were in the right place! Clean, better than the pictures and there were beautiful fresh flowers on the table. The house was designed beautifully and we loved all the little details like beautiful lamps, tons of towels, a variety of games, the coffee bar that included a French press in addition to a regular coffee pot and even the nightlights in the bathrooms were cute! The kitchen was well stocked with everything we needed to cook meals for our family. We loved relaxing, staring at the lake, making s’mores by the bonfire, chilling in the hot tub and kayaking was the best! Sarah was a great host with excellent communication before, during and after our stay! Stop in Big Rapids at Meijer to load up on groceries because you won’t want to leave once you check in! We can’t wait to stay here again. Thanks Sarah!!!"
2023-10-01,5,Group trip,"100/10 stay. A beautiful lakeside house with a hot tub and perfect views. Everything in the house was cozy and comfortable, definitely not your ordinary Airbnb. Outlets everywhere, decor was thoughtfully executed and made us feel at home immediately. After the weather decided to not cooperate, the living room was the perfect place for us to get married by the bay windows overlooking the lake. Already thinking about booking for our anniversary next year. Owners are very responsive and hospitable, Sarah and Ethan thank you so much again for the card, champagne, and flowers. A delightful touch to an already special weekend."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,Everything was as described. The home was lovely! Cleverly designed and decorated. Responded immediately to questions.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This home was just what my family and I needed for a fall break. The house was very clean and as pictured. We brought all of our food for the weekend. I was able to cook all of our meals with no problem as the kitchen was fully stocked. There's even a waffle maker, which is not something we have at home, so my family was thrilled to have waffles. All the beds were comfortable. My 2 younger kids loved sleeping in the ""Kids Camp"" upstairs. There was plenty of space for my family of 5 to relax. The outdoor area was something out of an autumn calendar. At one point we were in the hot tub and it was raining multi colored fall leaves all around us. It was beautiful! The option to rent the boat is wonderful! We made some great memories taking the boat out to try fishing. We brought our dog. The property is dog friendly and there were 2 leads so we were able to let the dog out often. Sarah is super friendly and quick to respond to any questions I had. I would recommend highly this house!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Truly amazing place, would definitely stay again! Sarah and Frederico were super accommodating and responsive when we needed something. The place is super private, well stocked, very well appointed (one of the best interiors I’ve seen in the Michigan area) and there were so many things to do! 5-stars all the way."
2023-10-01,5,Group trip,This was absolutely exactly what we wanted and it’s was beautiful. We absolutely lived your home and enjoyed ourselves. We are talking about making it a tradition if the house is available next year etc. thank you
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,My husband and I had a wonderful time relaxing here for our babymoon. The house is beautifully decorated and we loved the attention to detail. We rented the pontoon and took the kayaks out and were the only people on the water everyday! The Fall colors are gorgeous right now around the property. Sarah was always quick to respond to any questions we had. Thank you for the peaceful getaway!
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with a pet,What an amazing place to stay and such an awesome host!! Great at maintaining communication even before the rental was purchased! The cabin was fully equipped with everything we needed and more. The cabin was even more beautiful and relaxing than anticipated! Would definitely recommend getting the pontoon as well!! Thank you so much for sharing this blissful space ☺️
2023-09-01,5,Group trip,"Sarah's was clean, updated and a beautiful place to stay. Nice Kitchen and excellent beds."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,The Hillside Hideaway home overdelivered! The home was spacious and cozy. The furniture was new and comfortable. The owners have done a great job reflecting vacation in Michigan as the rooms are decorated with all things we do here during the different seasons. There was fun for everyone and beautiful views! Looking over the lake and wooded undeveloped land across the lake reminded me of something you would find in a Hallmark movie. Our family made beautiful memories and can’t wait to go back!
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Lovely home! Enjoyed the winding back roads and beautiful view. Access to the indoor and outdoor games, hot tub, pontoon, and kayaks made this stay even more fun! Very clean and responsive host."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Sarah was a great host and there when we needed her to explain things.
We really appreciated how thoughtful everything was. From the leads for the dogs in the back, strategically placed throughout, to the stocked pantry so we weren't running to the store for extras. We had a great stay and loved the amenities."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Amazing home and excellent host.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Our group was 2 families of 4 and 1 adult and this place worked perfect! They utilized every inch of the house perfectly and the amenities they provided were impressive! They provide all soaps/ample beach towels/games and toys/coffee.. the list goes on!
I would recommend renting the pontoon as the house sits on a cove and isn’t very swimmable (at least for my crew) in front of the house. There is also a campground beach that is $1 a person right down the road that was great!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Great little weekend getaway! Everything was just as promised. It was awesome that our dog was welcome.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Amazing view and very comfortable inside. Tiny shower space. Host had great communication, fast and friendly. I highly recommend!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"A nice getaway with a pretty view of the river and surrounded by trees. The home is small but perfect for two people. Comfortable beds! Big plus that it was pet friendly, dogs enjoyed being able to tag along and the area had some nice walking trails nearby. Home is cozy. Easy to use the temperature controls and had no issues with warming the place up during cold weather.
Only thing to mention is that the river is not “usable”. The dock sits up high with some steep stairs down. There are a lot of trees and things that obstruct any fishing. Still a beautiful and peaceful place, but just a heads up for someone looking for water to dip toes into or do any fishing.
Hosts were very responsive and accommodating, a wonderful get away for some peace and quiet. Would definitely come back."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Quiet, riverside house. Great for a couple, two couples traveling together, or a small family. Very quiet. 10-15 minutes to Big Rapids with all needed amenities. Friendly neighbors."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Very responsive and welcoming hosts, we would stay here again"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great little place on the river. Very clean and easy to find. I had no issues and would stay there again. The host was amazing and it was a great stay.
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We really loved this place. It was a perfect getaway for the holiday & we plan on even coming back for just a weekend stay. The house was updated & comfy, the view while watching a movie was beautiful and the area/neighborhood was enjoyable as well"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed one night,Super cute place for a quick stay! Nice for a private get away where you want to stay at the cabin and play games.
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,No major complaints whatsoever. As described and very nice place.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Wonderful, peaceful, and very relaxing. Easy to find and had lots of great places to shop close by."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We loved our stay in Big Rapids, it was the perfect peaceful weekend that we were looking for. Lots of hiking within close driving distance, beautiful back porch. We loved drinking coffee and down by the river in the morning. One thing to note is that there is no central heat, it’s a wall unit so bring some extra layers in the fall and winter!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Beautiful area and peaceful we loved our stay. Our host was really great at communicating and helpful! Definitely recommend.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place was the perfect, quiet getaway for the weekend. Just as described and worth the price!!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,We enjoyed our weekend on the river! Nice cabin with all the amenities.
2023-07-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Overall we had a positive experience. The house has a nice layout and was comfortable. There were all basics that we needed to cook as well as towels/extra sheets. The bathroom could use a bit of an update but was certainly functional. This wasn’t a deal breaker for us but be aware the outside is a bit sandy so coming in and out can track some unwanted dirt in. There is a nice view at the bottom of the river. A couple trees could be removed to open the view up a smidge but it was a relaxing time to sit at the bottom. There isn’t any swimming at this property but there is a nice river access point about a mile over that we spent some time at and enjoyed.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Was exactly what we wanted. A quiet place for a relaxing weekend outdoors. The river was beautiful and our dogs had a great time. Would stay again.
2023-06-01,4,Stayed with a pet,"What a quiet, cozy little river cottage in the big woods of Big Rapids!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed about a week,Amazing experience. Exactly what we were looking for!
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This place was exactly what my partner and I needed for a weekend away. One of my favorite things was that we could bring our senior dogs with us and didn'thave to find a babysitter. The view was great, and the inside of the place was made to feel like home. We will for sure be staying here again when we get the chance."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,a beautiful cabin on the river. great communication. would definitely recommend!
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We were attending our daughter’s graduation at Ferris State University. The cabin is located off the beaten path from the campus, but it was a very short drive to everything we needed to get to for graduation and parties.
The cabin is in a peaceful location and looked just like the photos. The beds we’re comfortable and the cabin was cozy, clean and cheerful. The smell of pine trees in the woods, watching many turtles and blue herons and the full moon reflecting on the river were enjoyable and peaceful."
2023-04-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Very nice place with peaceful surroundings.
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Perfect place to stay. Close to the University but far enough to feel away from the college craziness.
My son plays football there so we spend a lot of time in the area. We will be back to this property."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Beautiful accommodations and gorgeous scenery. Thoroughly enjoyed our stay. The bed was super comfortable! Would stay again and again!!
2023-03-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Up north weekend cottage that your grandpa bought in the 1950's with his salary from GM. If you grew up in Michigan, you know. The cottage was very clean and comfortable. Kitchen was small but clean with everything I needed to cook for myself. There's a separate heater (controller pad by door to deck) and an EU style wall A/C with a remote (these cottages were not built with A/C ). The bedrooms are petite but the beds are soft, not too soft, making for a good nights sleep. W/D work great. Plenty of parking. Fast WiFi. Nice TV with lots of good options plus you're able to sign into all your streaming account. Check out chores are reasonable - strip the bed, put your dishes in the dishwasher and run it, make sure grill is turned off, and lock up. My only caveat - very specific and won't apply to 99% of you - is my husband didn't fit in the shower. He is 6'5 and, literally, a linebacker. I fit just fine.
Cottage is great up to 4 people. Nice river side decks. Quiet and safe."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We enjoyed the place very much! The location was close enough to town while still feeling like we were off the beaten path. Perfect for our family!
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great view and location
2023-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,This was a perfect place to spend the evening. the view of the river is beautiful and the home was cozy. I would highly recommend this place!
2023-02-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Willing to go above and beyond
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful, quiet location for a cute little cabin with everything we needed. The river view is stunning and the cabin was clean and spacious with a well equipped kitchen. Friendly and communicative host."
2023-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"Cozy, romantic, perfect! Will return soon"
2023-01-01,5,Stayed over a week,"Michael’s place was great, very responsive and cared about my experience."
2023-01-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Amazing place to stay! We will be staying again!
2022-12-01,3,Stayed with a pet,"Before checking in, I received a message that we would need to provide our own towels. I looked through both the Airbnb listing and rental contract and this was never mentioned.
When we checked in the cabin was set to 62 degrees so we turned it up to 68. The cabin remained very cold the entire time that we stayed besides one bedroom that was super hot.
Upon checking in there were many rules listed on the fridge for checking out. These rules are not posted on Airbnb or in the separate rental contract that is required to sign. The rules state that you must take the garbage to the end of the very long driveway, strip all bedding and towels (which is funny bc they said byo towels) and place by washer and put all dishes in the dishwasher. This was quite surprising and honestly ridiculous seeing how I paid $120 cleaning fee. It’s wild to require guests to practically clean the entire place when they are being charged a large cleaning fee.
Overall we will not stay here again."
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Clean, comfortable, great loacation and amazing view."
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We really enjoyed our stay. My son is a student at Ferris State University and we came out for parents weekend. The house and location were ideal.
The view of the river and the fall colors were incredible. This property is clean, updated and less than 10 minutes from campus and downtown Big Rapids.
We look forward to staying again. This property will likely be our go when visiting BR moving forward."
2022-10-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Relaxing River was a great place! It was very clean, the communication with the host was prompt, the location is SUPERB especially to catch the fall colors in Michigan!"
2022-10-01,4,Stayed with kids,"Overall the cabin was ok. The location was great...it was a short drive to the downtown area and amenities while still feeling far away and having privacy. The river deck was small but nice and I imagine it would be really awesome in the summer. The cabin itself is no frills but true to the pictures. My biggest complaint is they do not provide towels and I was sent a ""reminder"" of this two days into our trip so I went back and looked at the booking info and the contract they had me sign and there was no mention of this, so not sure how it was a reminder. Since we already left, we had to stop and buy towels and wash them before we could shower on the evening we got there. Very inconvenient and an additional cost for us. I don't think I would stay here again."
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The view of the river was gorgeous and we really enjoyed our stay!
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Wonderful place and the hosts made everything very easy. I highly recommend!
2022-09-01,4,Stayed with a pet,"This cabin and property was just wonderful. The cabin was equipped for almost everything you would need for your stay. The cabin was very clean and decorated nicely. The view from the picture window over looking the river was beautiful. Unfortunately, it rained for most of our stay, so we did not get a chance to utilize the gas grill and furnished deck. For those staying in the future, I would recommend brining your own pillows and extra cuddle blankets."
2022-09-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We had a nice weekend at this cabin, very quiet and relaxing."
2022-09-01,3,Stayed a few nights,Cute cottage easy check in and out
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very quiet beautiful location. Comfortable cottage
2022-09-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We had a great time at Micheal’s place. It’s cute, cozy and comfortable. Nestled between the trees, very private. Would love to visit again."
2022-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,We really enjoyed our stay! Cabin was perfect! View of river was great from upper and lower deck. Very relaxing and quiet. Neighbors were very nice also as they brought over some wood so we could have a great campfire. Communication was also great throughout our stay. Would definitely stay again if we are in the area. Thank you for a very enjoyable weekend.
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The cabin is adorable and looks exactly like shown in the pictures. The location is great, there are neighbors on both sides but not too close for comfort. (They were also very friendly! :)) The hosts were helpful and fairly responsive. The only thing that seemed strange is the requested cleaning. There was a posted list of what to do before checkout, such as stripping used bedding, taking out the trash, and loading the dishwasher. (All of which we did). However we had already paid the cleaning fee, so it felt odd to have to do these things. Check out time for the rental is 10 am, and check in is 4 pm. I feel this is more than enough time for the cabin to be cleaned before the next people arrive. Common courtesy when checking out is one thing, but having to follow a list of cleaning tasks is another, especially when a cleaning fee has already been paid. However, this is just my personal opinion and is a minor detail in the overall picture. We still had a wonderful time, and thought the place and location were great."
2022-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Great place and great location. Pretty secluded and not a lot of traffic on the river. My family really enjoyed the stay and as a first timer Airbnb, Michael and his team had the answers before I could ask the question. Very informative and helpful."
2022-08-01,5,Stayed about a week,We very much loved our stay. The place is tucked into the woods which was both beautiful and made it feel very private. Definitely would recommend staying here. The hosts were super helpful and so quick to respond to any questions or needs. 10/10 would stay again.
2022-07-01,4,Stayed with a pet,"Quiet, relaxing, comfy beds"

2022-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Quiet, relaxing, convenient to Big Rapids, golf, and fishing…. it was exactly what we were looking for! Thank you so much and perhaps we’ll be back in the area in the future. Jim and Darcy"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Cute place. Quiet, secluded and a great view. Loved it"
2022-05-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We had a wonderful, relaxing weekend! My favorite was enjoying my coffee on the lower deck every morning as the sun glistened on the water and hanging in my hammock over the water in the late afternoons watching boaters pass by and listening to the sounds of nature! Our two dogs had a blast exploring around the cabin and we took them swimming nearby where there was river access, they’ll surely sleep for days! We got some awesome photos of the property and views, even a couple to use for our pregnancy announcement which we shared during our stay! Everything was clean and as described… simple and all the basics included! Would stay again and would recommend!"
2022-05-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Everything about this cabin was exactly as was expected. The locations is very quite and feels secluded. The view of the river was wonderful. We would definitely stay again!
2022-05-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"My daughter and I enjoyed our stay. Just to be aware, you do need to bring your own towels, but it was very convenient to have the option to do laundry while we were there as it was the last place we stayed on our vacation. The cabin was very clean and the view was beautiful!"
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful location, great deck, quite a few steps to go down to get to river. Small closets."
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The best little weekend getaway you could ask for. So cozy and quiet. 💙
2022-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Super cute little house, was very clean and had great communication with the hosts. Neighbors are a lot closer than you’d expect. But it’s still a great location with a great view. I’d definitely stay here again."
2022-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Lovely view of the river! Even got to watch otters play and turtles sunbathe. The listing/pictures are accurate and communication was great.
2022-04-01,2,Stayed a few nights,"River shack in a poor run down area. Went to walk my dog and was chased by the neighbors dog they were just letting run free unsupervised. Area has only one attraction, the river. Bring your own towels since the owner is too cheap to supply them. 99 dollar cleaning fee, yet they want you to do dishes, laundry, and trash before you check out. I could go on and on, overall bad experience I wouldn't recommend"
2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Nice place, stayed here 2 nights. Very clean"
2022-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"amazing spot, great hosts!"
2022-04-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Great place with beautiful views! A little closer to neighbors then expected, but the overall experience was amazing!"

2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Cute place, quiet, and has everything you need. Would come back in the future!"
2022-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Split the spot with 2 friends, overall pretty affordable spot, beautiful view, super clean and comfortable sleeping even in the living room area. Appreciated the dishwasher, there was plenty of pots and pans for cooking, bring your own spices if you're trying to cook, towels and laundry detergent were also available there. Definitely recommend!"
2022-02-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Provided clear and quick responses and a very clean space.
2022-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My boyfriend and I are workaholics and have 5 kids between us both. So I wanted to find a place small and cute for 2 for our 6 year anniversary. I found this Beautiful, very quite place right on the River with an awesome over view of the river. With the big widows facing the river, we had the most beautiful sun rises every morning. I don’t think we couldn’t of found a better place in our price range to go and have a nice quite anniversary weekend together to get away from it all. Thank you so much for sharing your wonder place!!"
2022-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Stunning view of the river, comfy bed, and a great overall atmosphere!"
2022-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,My boyfriend and I needed a little get away! I found this place and it was so nice and relaxing. The cost was a steal! My dogs came with us and they had a blast in the snow! It was very convenient to go into town about 11 mins away and find a restaurant. There is a gas station about 4 minutes away that has a liquor store/ mini grocery store in it. It was snowing but the roads were kept up and felt safe. I had a few questions during our stay and the host was prompt with a response. There are 3 hosts and I spoke with Kim. She was very pleasant and helpful. There’s a large bay window in the front room which was facing the lake and back patio. It was a beautiful view. The place was simple and clean. The shower was small but plenty of hot water and great water pressure! I recommend bringing pillows if you have a certain preference. They were way to soft for me. There are hiking areas about 12 mins away. I believe there was 3-4 areas. The host recommended Raven Brewing and BBQ. We chose Schuberg Bar and Grill. Children can eat there. They make several kinds of burgers! A place called Bernie’s was near. They have donuts and smoothies! Our poor dogs were outside playing in the snow and started whimpering and holding up their paws because they were so cold! We took a quick trip over to Family farm and home and they had dog boots. They were able to enjoy being outside longer with those on. We are talking about coming back either in the summer or the fall so that we can enjoy the dock for fishing! I highly recommend staying here!
2022-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great place to get away for peace and quiet. Hosts communicated excellently and the expectations for checking out were very clear. If you do book this cabin in the winter, be careful of the hill that leads up to the house. If your car is not 4 wheel drive you might have some trouble, but it is still manageable."
2021-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"you’ll be so sorry if you don’t stay here….
honestly we ended up here by accident, never been to the area before but we saw this place and the photos were so pretty so we booked it.
BEST IDEA EVER.
great private road,
cool stairs to the river (totally doable even in the snow!)
super super nice inside, clean and modern. had salt and pepper- oil. coffee, paper towels the whole shabang.
great check in, the host him really made the whole stay better with her awesome communication.
we will definitely be back one day,
thanks for the great christmas vacation."
2021-12-01,4,Stayed with a pet,"Great and updated cozy cabin, beautiful views. Neighbors are close by, but a very tranquil stay."
2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Cute, cozy, great view and location! Fantastic communication with hosts. Will definitely be back!"
2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great choice, the house is very clean when we arrived. Our host were very accommodating. The view overlooking the river is amazing. There are some nice trails nearby and 2 breweries nearby both great locations."
2021-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,Great place for a getaway. Great location on the beautiful river!
2021-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We loved our little family getaway here and would absolutely stay here again! The views of the river from the decks are BEAUTIFUL! There is only one neighbor nearby, but it still feels very secluded. The kitchen was fully stocked with all the essentials. The bathroom was clean, but you need to bring your own towels. The shower was a bit small as someone reviewed earlier, but works completely fine and plenty of hot water. The beds are comfy and warm. Overall the place was clean and tidy.
Only Con: We understand this place allows pets, but the couch and pillows had a wet dog smell. Everything else was perfectly clean and odor free!
It was perfect for a small family getaway and it was driving distance to several places, trails, and activities in the Big Rapids area! We would definitely stay here again!"
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I enjoy and look forward to staying with ""Symple Lyfe"". This is my second or third stay, I believe in consistency and have not been disappointed. Check for yourself and I am sure you will enjoy your stay."
2021-10-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Michael undercharges for this place. It is more beautiful than the pictures are able to show. I had an awesome time with my brother staying there. There are no restrictions on indoor climate (although I never changed it (but this has been an issue at other places). Everything included in the amenities is there and actually works well. He made it clear he was available if I needed anything. It is mostly very secluded. You can see into the yard of the closest neighbors when you use the firepit (and vice versa). They were cool, and we were able to watch a movie outdoors on a projector. I would and hope to come back."
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is a great find if you’re looking for a relaxing stay! The place is newly remodeled (at the time of this review) and everything in this place is brand new. Very clean, amenities were great, and the view was beautiful. My only complaints were that the mattress we slept on was very firm, and my husband had a hard time fitting in the shower (he’s 6’2” and over 200 lbs). The shower is about the size of one you’d find in a camper or RV. Aside from that, this space was perfect for a weekend getaway. Very quiet and peaceful. And the hosts were super helpful! They let us know everything we needed, and checking in and out was a breeze."
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Decor is simple , clean and pleasant. Worked as a great base for us to visit friends and family."
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,What a great place to relax. Beautiful view and plenty of privacy. Relax on the deck while enjoying nature. The cottage is clean and decorated so cute.

2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We’ll be back! Loved the place! Big with a cozy feel.
SUPER comfortable foam beds.
Beautiful woodwork and windows.
Clean!! (Only thing we found was some spillage in the oven, noticed a burnt smell once we stared cooking, but we handled it and it didn’t hinder our stay a bit!) bathrooms, beds and kitchen were spotless. Super responsive and let us check in early.
Took a hike on the river walk and strolled around town, walkable to much of downtown!
We wonder about the rich house history, and previous old time owners. Built in 1880 we think it has some stories to tell!"
2024-02-01,5,Group trip,We had a wonderful weekend with friends. Everyone had their own bedroom and the common areas were very spacious. Loved being able to walk to some shops and restaurants. Very clean and loved seeing all the old woodwork. We will stay again soon.
2024-02-01,5,Group trip,This location and home worked perfect for us!
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Michael and his team were very responsive to my questions. This Victorian home was beautiful and perfect for my family.

2024-02-01,5,Group trip,"This lodge and property are heavenly! PERFECT. We had a blast. Every amenity and little touch was accounted for and then some. We hiked all of the trails and they were super wide and cleared out. The lake is stunning! We played games, sat around the fire, hot tubbed, it was an AMAZING weekend and we cannot thank Bob and his team enough. It was one of our favorite USMC reunions and we will definitely be back."
2024-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,The host goes above and way beyond to accommodate any needs. The lodge is so beautiful and perfect for our large family. We love the outdoors and this is the perfect place for our crew that ranges from age 2 to 67. 5 star accommodations!
2024-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We greatly enjoyed our return visit to the beautiful Grass Lake Lodge. This home and property is second to none - peaceful, private, plenty of activities, outdoor fun, lake, hiking trails, and all the upgraded amenities you could want. We love to visit this Michigan paradise, and we look forward to another stay soon. The hosts are very friendly, helpful, and easy to work with - always going the extra mile to make us feel at home. I highly recommend this property, host, and experience. You will be glad you did!"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place is beautiful and has many great amenities. The place was super clean and even smelled good upon entry. The home is gorgeous, very well designed and furnished. The kitchen is huge and very well equipped. The bedrooms are huge, have great views and the beds very comfortable. The fireplace is easy, warm and beautiful. Lighting is plentiful and well-marked. The bathrooms are very nice, one has a spa tub even heated floors. The hot tub is amazing and was very clean. There are several decks and balconies, a screened in porch even an outside bar which is so cool. Our boys work for a major builder and were very impressed with the construction. Despite the uncooperative weather we did use the boat and fished some. We chose to relax and just get away from it all, the place is very quiet. The communications from owner Bob and caretaker Sabrina were amazing, they made it so easy, we felt like we knew them. Summer here with the lake, beach, boat, firepits and horseshoes would be amazing!"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Robert and his team are very communicative and make the process easy with plenty of available features and customization for your trip!

We definitely recommend staying here, you won’t regret it."
2023-10-01,5,Group trip,Great property! Had an awesome time! House was in great shape with lots to do in the house and around the lake. Everything was clean and ready to go when we got there and I was in contact with the owners and the local crew if we needed anything at all. 10/10.
2023-09-01,5,Group trip,The space was amazing! tons to do just on the property. Very fun
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We stayed in this home last week for our family vacation. We had 6 adults and 2 babies. The house was just perfect! During the day, we kayaked, fished from both the dock and the boat and paddleboarded. The lake was beautiful, private and calm. Since there was no wake from other boats, the babies could wade in the water without getting knocked down. The sand on the beach was pristine and we spent hrs building sand castles. We also took advantage of walking/jogging on the trails through the woods. There was never a lack of things to do in the evenings as this home had everything.. games, pool, shuffleboard etc... And the view from the porch while eating dinner is just beautiful. We even splurged and had dinner brought in 1 night from Blue Cow. I would highly recommend this home if you are looking for a quiet, relaxing and beautiful vacation. Oh... Robert and his caretakers are fantastic to work with and VERY responsive."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"A phenomenal getaway place for the whole family or a group of friends. Everything was well maintained with the grounds and lodge. We added the Carriage House and that allowed the family with babies to have a private space for naps, etc.
The kitchen, bedrooms, extras were all wonderful and we can’t wait to come back!"
2023-07-01,5,Group trip,Grass Lake Lodge was awesome!! Perfect secluded nature getaway.
2023-06-01,5,Group trip,"We had an AMAZING stay at Robert’s home. It’s a truly wonderful property that was exactly what we were looking for and would highly recommend to anyone. Our group took advantage of the great fishing, fire pits, game room, and the ample amount of space that Robert’s home provides. Robert is also a fantastic communicator and made us feel right at home from start to finish. Can’t wait to come back!!"
2023-05-01,5,Group trip,"Great place, so much to do!"
2023-04-01,5,Group trip,"Amazing space with lots of amenities and beautiful surroundings. Fishing, relaxing, games, this place has it all. Host was outstanding with communication. Would highly recommend."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What a great place!!! It was neat to visit Ferris State where I have my degree from!!! Love those Bulldogs!!! The house is so peaceful and private, the basement was our favorite place because of all the great games like pool, shuffleboard, and ping pong plus they had horseshoes outside and the brand new hot tub was the icing on the cake!!! Can’t wait to stay again!!!"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Our family enjoyed the lodge! It was beautiful and had many things to do. My brother-in-law even caught a fish!
2023-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,The lodge was absolutely gorgeous and spacious. The hiking trails were amazing and we had a lot of fun in the game room. Beds were comfortable and bathrooms were very clean. Kitchen had ample space and a six burner stove plus all necessary supplies. The lake is gorgeous and the location is very peaceful. Everything was immaculate and the owner is great to work with. We cannot wait to go back!
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This property is absolutely amazing! We loved the peaceful and private surroundings, the beautiful home, the game room and hot tub were perfect, enjoyed the trails in the woods, and the hosts made us feel right at home. Robert and the home hosts are exceedingly friendly, helpful, and generous in their hospitality. This is a spectacular property, and one we hope to visit again! Thank you for a memorable sanctuary getaway!"
2023-01-01,5,Group trip,Beautiful home in a beautiful setting. Great hiking on the property. We loved the lower level rec room and the games. Kitchen is large and excellent for cooking family meals.
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Everything was fantastic!!
2022-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,We had an amazing stay. There was plenty of space for everyone and the house was comfortable and super clean. Beautiful property we would love to come back to!
2022-10-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We had an amazing time at our stay at Grass Lake Lodge. Wonderful communication by both the owner and the caretakers. It was such a relaxing weekend for us four couples. The house was clean, the view towards the water is amazing - especially in the morning; and the house is even better than the pictures show! It’s a huge house and very clean. Thank you!"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Outstanding ! We had a great time. GLL is the perfect place for a family gathering. We had a 5 star experience from booking to our departure.
You will not want to leave this spectacular home."
2022-10-01,5,Group trip,"This house was unreal for a family tailgate weekend. It’s less than 10 mins to Ferris State & that was only one of the best parts! The house itself was so clean and cozy and had everything you could ask for and MORE. The basement was so fun with ping pong, pool, shuffleboard, a putting green and so many other games. I wish we enjoyed the hot tub and boats which were available to us, but the outdoor bar was our spot. Thank you Bob, Damien & Sabrina!!!!! We hope to be back soon."
2022-10-01,5,Group trip,Incredible house and property! Beautiful fall scenery. So much to do on-site you never feel the need to leave. Absolutely perfect for family and friends to get together for an entertaining weekend. We will be back!
2022-09-01,5,Group trip,"Beautiful home, perfect spot! Had a great time with guy friends!"
2022-06-01,5,Group trip,"WOW!!!!!! This place is absolutely amazing.
My family (8 people) rented both the main house and coach house to celebrate a handful of birthdays together for the first time in almost 15 years. It couldn't have been any more perfect and was everything we were hoping for and more.
The house is tucked away on a huge property with beautiful views, lakes, (yes you can swim!) and tons of room to have fun. Our family took advantage of everything available! Gameroom downstairs was SO MUCH fun, hot tub was nice and hot, canoe/boat/paddle board on the lake were provided, and the kitchen was stocked with everything needed.
We took advantage of the private chef dinner (Caitlin is wonderful!) and the food was delicious. We had leftovers that we used for breakfast and lunch - well worth the $$$!!
Check in and out was incredibly smooth and easy, Bob/property caretakers were helpful and very easy to reach. It couldn't have been a better 3 days. We are so grateful for this wonderful place and the memories that were created here together. Thank you so much."
2022-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"I cannot say enough about the Grass Lake Lodge. The owner (Bob) and the caretakers (Sabrina and Damien) were all very informative as well as all around caring for their guests. They ensured everything was in order exactly as needed and continuously verified everything. Everything from location, seclusion, activities, cleanliness, and top notch appliances…. No detail is overlooked here. If you want an amazing getaway with all modern amenities, and a true sense of sportsman luxury, this is a perfectly beautiful place. Thank you Rob and family for sharing your amazing lake home to us! Ps.- The fishing is great too! Pss. - There are a lot of extras that can be directly booked through them as well. We did the private chef evening and it was completely amazing. The food was wonderful and so was chef Caitlin. Highly recommend it!"
2022-05-01,5,Group trip,"This was a wonderful experience; we felt so special to have enjoyed the beauty, comfort, activities, and family memories that come from being somewhere special. I feel so fortunate to have found this gem to celebrate my doctoral graduation from Ferris State University. While being with family, winning an award, and obtaining a terminal degree should have been enough - Grass Lake Lodge was a family blessing for all!
The owners have thought of everything! Excellent customer service, impeccable decor, gorgeous lodge placement with serene and beautiful views from every window.
There were so many thoughtful details - the groceries were picked up and put away before we arrived, allowing us to enjoy time with each other immediately. I spoiled the family with the private chef experience for brunch and dinner and it was incredible! Service, presentation, preparation (easy in a beautiful and large gourmet kitchen), and truly the most delicious 5 star food experience. Fine dinning in a what we loving called the “cabin/mansion” allowed us to enjoy each other’s company and feel taken care of.
We left feeling relaxed, pampered, and delighted that we created memories that we will all cherish forever. What a surprise Michigan and Grass Lake Lodge are for a family from the DMV."
2022-05-01,5,Group trip,"Expectations exceded! Our group of ten ranging in age from 21-81 had a delightful 3 night stay at the Grass Lake Lodge for an early Mother's Day celebration. We had excellent communication with the owners and caretakers prior to, during and after our stay. The weather did not allow for much lake time but the GLL offers many other actitities. We especially enjoyed the extensive trail system and hot tub. We are looking forward to future stays at the GLL and hope to partake in GLL extras. A+"
2022-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,We had a terrific time. The property was beautiful and the house perfect for us.
2022-04-01,5,Group trip,"This place is wonderful! Whether it is relaxing, playing in the game room, fishing, or hiking, there is plenty of space for everyone to enjoy. The house comes with all the cooking and cleaning products you may need, as well as extra bedding. Although we didn't bring any animals, they are welcome and we did not encounter any issues from previous renters. There are also extras that can be rented, such as the accompanying garage/house, a trolling motor, or massages!
If you are coming for the outdoor getaway, I do recommend warmer weather, however. Our stay was in early April, and fishing on the lake was a bit brutal with light snow falling. The lodge comfortably slept ten of us and we all had plenty to keep us occupied and entertained.
Communication from Robert was excellent and he was very quick on replies. The caretakers of the lodge were also very accessible and gave us complete space and freedom while we were there. I would recommend this lodge to anyone who wants a peaceful getaway!"
2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful home and location!
2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My business partners and I spent some time planning at the Grass Lake Lodge — perfect space for our meeting. It was a beautiful setting, the house was gorgeous, the host and caretakers were helpful, and there were lots of fun things to do aside from work.
I’d highly recommend this place; it’s even better than the pictures."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great newly renovated house with a short walk to the Muskegon river. The river was walkable big sand bars and deep holes to fish. The shared beach would be a great place to launch kayaks or for a relaxing day tubing. The home was an overall comfortable stay with most of what you’d need for a relaxing weekend stay. Would be helpful if there was a welcome/instruction book of things to do around the area and what to do before checking out.
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I cannot express how incredibly beautiful this property and home are. It was the perfect get away into the country life. We enjoyed cooking meals outside together and going for walks to enjoy the views and farm life. The love and care put in to the home, make the experience all the more worthwhile. The farm provided relaxation in our busy lives and we couldn't have asked for a better place to do it. Thank you Rose and family for a truly unforgettable experience."
2024-03-01,5,Group trip,The house was great and Julie was very helpful.
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Julie’s place was nothing short of spectacular! Beds were very comfortable and their were plenty of them for me and a few friends. Very clean and had all the amenities we needed. Hope to come back next year when we are in town again!
2024-02-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We enjoyed this scenic property. Beautiful rustic space, great view of stars amd we saw many deers walk through front yard. Great place for family to gather and visit with our Ferris State student. You wouldn't guess from country view, but its really close to campus."
2024-01-01,5,Group trip,Large and comfortable home on a wooded lot. Great place for family visiting Ferris State University.
2023-09-01,5,Group trip,"Julie was really helpful! She was flexible with allowing our group to drop off some of our belongings before check in, as we were in town early. Perfect spot and great for a getaway weekend."
2023-08-01,4,Group trip,"The large yard was nice for playing badminton, and the interior had plenty of space for our large group to gather. There were some things that weren't great, however: the smell of moth balls was OVERPOWERING. And, we had two seniors in our group that can't do stairs with ease, but the steps to get onto the porch or onto the deck were still a challenge for them. It would help if the home were more senior citizen accessible. There were a few broken chairs, but we still had plenty for the family to gather. Overall, we had a WONDERFUL time. We opened up the windows to get fresh air in, to try to minimize the mothball smell, and we would recommend the place to others."
2023-08-01,5,Group trip,Place was great. Looked just like the photos and there was plenty of rooms and beds for everyone. Everything worked as expected and the instructions/check in/check out were very straightforward and made the stay easier.
2023-08-01,5,Group trip,Great place to stay! Clean and exactly as presented.
2023-07-01,4,Stayed a few nights,The house had what our group needed. We wanted to be close to the Muskegon River for a tubing trip and we needed space for 12 to sleep. This place fit the bill. The space in the garage was nice too so that we could air out our tubes and clean them up to go home.
2023-07-01,4,Group trip,We really enjoyed our stay together with our family
2023-07-01,4,Group trip,Great quiet place to share a visit with a group of people for a weekend. Host was very responsive with messages.
2023-06-01,5,Group trip,"We stayed for the weekend with 8 guys and played golf around the area. Property worked great for us. Julie made our stay easy, would stay here again"
2023-05-01,5,Group trip,"Great location, great price, great house!"
2023-04-01,5,Group trip,Absolutely loved coming back here. The house is in such a fantastic spot and is very welcome. Julie is a great host! Would 100% come back here again.
2022-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Had a wonderful family weekend at Julie's house. It is very spacious and did very well for our family. The location was great! We were close to campus yet secluded and able to enjoy some peace and quiet. We would love to stay here again on future trips to Ferris.
2022-10-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We rented this house for family weekend at Ferris. The location was great for us. The house is essentially in the woods, and with the fall colors, the views were beautiful. We even saw a deer on the property. The house was pet friendly, so we were able to bring the furkids too. Tons of room, very clean. Will definitely rent again."
2022-10-01,4,Stayed with kids,"Check in was easy, the house is spacious and was great for accommodating our large family! It was a wonderful weekend."
2022-09-01,4,Stayed with a pet,"This is the perfect getaway for a large group of people. Plenty of space inside and outside! The homes are not close by so you don't hear any neighbor noise and you have a long driveway that fits plenty of cars and a basketball hoop for everyone to enjoy.
The house is stocked pretty well. This is not an updated house but it's clean and kept well. The town is close and has plenty of cute small restaurants and stores or you can go a 10 minute drive and find the large stores where you will find anything you need."
2022-08-01,5,Group trip,Great place.
2022-08-01,4,Group trip,"The house was very good for our golf group of 8 guys. The kitchen had everything we needed for doing steak and potatoes one night. It is difficult to find lodging options for a group of this size where everyone gets their own bed, so we were happy to find this house, and from what I heard, most of the beds were pretty comfortable (one guy said that his bed in the room with 3 beds was a little saggy in the middle). The upstairs bathroom is shared between 3 bedrooms with 7 beds, which is a little less than ideal, but with 2 full baths and a half bath, there wasn't too much of a traffic jam for showers, which were definitely needed after the hot, humid days of our trip.
There is a pretty private wooded back yard area with patio furniture and a fire pit and a gas grill. The grill is a bit old and has some cool spots, which made it challenging to cook 8 steaks, but we got it done. The patio dining furniture is a bit beat up, but functional. There are several adirondack chairs in the back area, too, which are basically all broken in one fashion or another--this is something that I would recommend that the owners remove/replace/repair, because they seem like an injury hazard, especially for kids.
The location was pretty good -- it's a quiet area without a lot of close neighbors. We didn't go into town, but it is very close to Big Rapids/Ferris State if you're looking to go there. It was about 25 minutes away from the golf courses at Tullymore/St. Ives and Canadian Lakes, where we played.
Communication with Julie was great -- fortunately, we had not issues with check-in or payment, so it was all a very smooth process from booking to checkout.
Overall, I would recommend this house to large groups, but a few minor things keep me from giving it a 5-star rating."
2022-07-01,5,Group trip,"Fantastic for large gatherings! Private, yet minutes from downtown and access to the river."
2022-07-01,4,Group trip,The house was good for a golf weekend with close proximity to area courses. The bedrooms were spacious and the kitchen and living room were large enough for our group.
2022-07-01,5,Group trip,"Perfect location! Minutes away from all the fun bars and shops! Nice quiet area, beautiful trees and wildlife! House is beautiful and large and can easily handle a large family gathering. Host was very responsive and pleasant! Great experience!"
2022-07-01,3,Stayed with kids,House was nice to stay in. Lots of room. House did seem to need to be restocked. Could not find indoor garbage bags anywhere. There wasn’t a can opener. Could use more dishes especially when you have larger groups staying in home.
2022-07-01,5,Group trip,"Nice and clean house, convenient location, our group very enjoyed our stay"
2022-06-01,5,Group trip,Worked out great for our buddies trip!
2022-06-01,5,Group trip,Second time staying in Julies space and it was everything a golf group could ask for. Kiddy corner from St Ives and Tullymore that were premier golf courses. I can not recommend Julie any higher
2022-06-01,4,Group trip,Comfortable beds and cozy living room. We loved the quiet setting with lots of birds singing and deer in the front lawn.
2022-05-01,5,Group trip,Wonderful home…spacious and exactly as described. If your looking for a place for big group this is the place.
2022-05-01,3,Stayed a few nights,"The house was okay. It was nice that the house was very close to Ferris State University. Overall, I give this AirBnB a 3 out of 5 stars."
2022-03-01,5,Group trip,Stayed here a couple of other times and it never disappoints! Beautiful house and great location!
2022-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Wonderful place. Great for larger family.
2022-02-01,5,Group trip,Served our purpose for a family gathering after a Ferris State University Basketball game. Lots of places to sleep and great game playing area.
2022-01-01,5,Group trip,"Julie’s place is the perfect spot for a weekend family gathering or a large group. Plenty of room for gathering in the spacious kitchen.
The use of the garage was a huge bonus; there are large front and back decks for a crowd.
We would definitely stay here again."
2022-01-01,4,Group trip,Our family had a great weekend stay. The house was perfect to accommodate all 10 adults. We were pleased with all the extras provided & available for our use. I appreciated how quickly our messages were answered. We definitely would stay again.
2021-12-01,5,Group trip,"This home was the absolute perfect place for our weekend trip of travel to Michigan. The host had everything we needed and the house was cozy, spacious, clean and well stocked! The rooms were super big, the beds were comfy and we had a wonderful time. I would absolutely stay here again if we come back into town in the future!"
2021-12-01,5,Group trip,"Great place! Great location, close to Ferris State campus. Hoping to stay again!"

2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great space. Enjoyed our time and the home is described perfectly.
2021-09-01,5,Group trip,Very clean.
2021-08-01,5,Group trip,"We stayed here with a bigger group of friends and had a blast. The back porch is prime for outdoor hangout time. Place is spacious, not too fancy but just nice enough to let your hair down and have a good time. We played golf at Clear Lake Golf Course which was a great time. Cheap, fun layout, pretty solid conditions for the price. I would 100% recommend this place if you are in the area and have a big group."
2021-08-01,5,Group trip,Great value
2021-08-01,4,Stayed with kids,Beautiful house setting was perfect for the family gathering we had. Great memories created!
2021-08-01,5,Group trip,"This was a great place for a large group to stay. We had 13 guys together for the weekend and were very comfortable with a few extra blow up mattresses.
They should advertise the basketball hoop, as it got some good use this weekend. I would definitely stay again if I were ever in the area."
2021-07-01,5,Group trip,We enjoyed our stay. House was clean and the location relative to Big Rapids was great.

2021-05-01,5,Group trip,This place was great for my group of friends to get together and spend the weekend after such a long time in quarantine. It felt like we were far from the business of the city but we still had everything so close by. I only wish we could have stayed longer!

2021-02-01,5,Group trip,"Great choice for multiple families to come together. The beds were comfortable, plenty of blankets. If you use more than one towel for your shower, bing some. We used it for a ski weekend and it was perfect."

2020-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The house is amazingly nice and clean. The living room is spacious and cozy; our three families fit in the kitchen table perfectly fine; the beds are soft and comfortable - we know they are new sheets because there were a few new ones in the closet. We loved the outside fire pit, and the yard games provided. We also had the chance to see a bunch of deers on the second morning. Overall, we enjoyed the peaceful and lovely stay."

2019-11-01,5,Group trip,"Julie's place is wonderful. It has lots of space and a beautiful property setting. It can easily accommodate 2 families. It is very close to Big Rapids and the university. The next time we are in that area, we will definitely try to stay at Julie's house again!!"

2019-09-01,5,Group trip,"This place was wonderful! Close to town but far enough out to be peaceful and feel secluded.
The back and front porch were awesome to watch the deer, squirrels and chipmunks play.
We had 8 adults and had so much room. The bedrooms were large, double sink bathrooms, plenty of hot water, and great kitchen layout. Very clean too."
2019-09-01,5,Group trip,"We had a labor day weekend at Julie's place! The house is in a very quiet neighborhood, surrounded by trees and animals, perfect for a get-away from our busy life!

2019-07-01,4,Stayed with kids,"Terrific place sfor a family weekend. Super clean, modern decorating, comfy beds, close to a park on the river, large driveway, spacious back patio, yard games included and more.
The only negative thing was the A/C stopped working upstairs during our stay in July and it got up to 80F in the bedrooms. I communicated with the owner during the stay about the situation but we were unable to fix it during our stay. They apologized and said the A/C will be fixed for the next guest. So, you’re good to go!"
2019-07-01,5,Group trip,"Julie's property was perfect for our golf trip in the Big Rapids area. The home had plenty of space for 8 adults (and could have accommodated more) and included nice touches like yard games and a big garage. The only downside we found was that the AC unit was having trouble keeping up with the hot weather, but it wasn't too bad. I would definitely recommend checking this place out if you're staying in the area."
2019-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Julie’s place was perfect for our cozy weekend we were looking for. She had everything you could possibly need within the home which was beyond appreciated. The fire pit at night was awesome. We saw deer 2/3 mornings. Very peaceful place to stay.
2019-07-01,5,Group trip,Very nice peaceful
2019-06-01,5,Group trip,"House great, location great, very quiet. Enjoyed watching deer walk down the road and around the area."
2019-05-01,5,Group trip,"Absolutely beautiful house, in a recluse location but not too far from any place or adventure! Close to parks and the muskegon river, great for large groups or family outings!!"
2019-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The house was perfect for our needs. Julie was easy to communicate with and made sure we didn’t need anything. We will be back.
2024-03-01,5,Stayed over a week,Susan was an excellent host! She was so kind and was constantly asking if I needed anything to make my visit more comfortable. I would highly recommend Susan to anyone thinking of visiting Big Rapids.
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Susan was such an amazing host, very communicative and caring."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed over a week,Susan was a delighful and accomodating host. I would highly recommend Susan and her dog Pearl. An overall wonderful experience
2023-10-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Comfortable bed and private room. Shower is ok and the floor creaks a lot. It's perfectly fine for staying a night or two
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Susan is a very good host. She is extremely helpful and attentive to her guests.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Susan is a wonderful host. We stayed at her place for more than 10 days. Everything is very good. Shared areas such as living room, dining room are very spacious. There is a large garden in the back. The area is very quiet and airy. Very convenient to go to FSU as well as downtown Big Rapids. Susan was very friendly and helpful. She helped us a lot. I strongly recommend her to everyone. I will definitely stay at Susan's place on my future visits to Big Rapids"
2023-08-01,4,Stayed over a week,I enjoyed staying at Susan’s. Just be aware that if you’re sensitive to strong smell this might not be the place for you.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed about a week,Stay was nice! Close to eating places. Susan was there if you needed anything!
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Things important to me are enough room in the fridge, comfortable firm bed, nice shower. All those boxes checked and the best back yard with patio to enjoy meals while observing nature. Susan is a very nice person with a big heart. She is perfect to host a Airbnb because her profession is taking care of elderly and others w/physical challenges. Every day she asked me if there was anything I needed to make my stay more comfortable. I will in all likelihood be scheduling with her in the future when I visit with my daughter who lives 15 minutes away. It’s a wonderful experience to meet someone and get to know them in a short time and part knowing that I have made a new connection/friend."

We had subs from Fatbelly Deli & Creamy and they were amazing! Thank you for the great stay Arturo!"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Arturo was a great host and was quick to respond with requests. He was very flexible for our stay. The home was very comfortable for me and my family.

2023-10-01,5,Group trip,"This place is truly “Home Away from Home”
The furniture is above what you typically find in rentals with plush mattresses for a great nights sleep and power recliners for enjoyable TV viewing.
Speaking of the TV, many apps available (Premium) which is never the case in rentals. There is also an Alexa for music enjoyment and an ambiance multi-colored heating element to add to the honey atmosphere.
In addition to the usual kitchen amenities, the unit has a Ninja Bullet , Air Fryer, and 2 coffee machines.
The automatic lighted entryway for entrance after dark, bidets in both bathrooms, defog mirrors, heated floor tiles, and a spa bath really add extra and make the “Home Away” title true!
The house is located in a very pleasant suburban alcove which is great for walks during the day. The town of Big Rapids is about 5 miles away, with a convenience store about 1 mile away for a quick trip.
The host is quick to respond to any questions and I wouldn’t hesitate to stay here again."

2023-02-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We live in Kalamazoo and lost power due to an ice storm. Decided to rent a place in Big Rapids where my wife is from so that she could visit friends. This place was extremely comfortable. It was like visiting your grandmother’s house. The area has hard water, so be sure to bring your own drinking water. The place was clean and comfortable. Arturo was kind enough to let us check out late as our power didn’t come back on until late afternoon. We hope to come back to visit family for the holidays."
2023-01-01,4,Stayed with kids,"We had a great time. The house was very complete. It had everything. The only thing was that the beds are kind of small. My wife and I are used to sleeping in a KING bed, and we had to sleep in a very small bed."
2022-08-01,5,Stayed about a week,Very enjoyable! Truly a home away from home.
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Very convenient to Ferris. Nice, quiet location. Wooded backyard with full deck and comfortable outdoor seating. Ample parking.

2022-02-01,5,Stayed over a week,great place!

2023-08-01,4,Stayed with a pet,"The property is beautiful as described and a peaceful place to stay. We loved checking out the architecture and the grounds. My only qualm was that we got a little lost since the GPS took us to the wrong side of the ""street"" (seasonal road). Once we got to the intersection as described in the directions we found the way. Beware, the terrain is rough since its a seasonal road in the forest."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Rob’s sanctuary inspires a peaceful release, internal reflection, voluntary solitude, connection and creativity. If you are looking to reconvene with yourself, be surrounded by unruly beauty and engage in conversations beyond compare…book here…"

Robert has created an incredibly beautiful and peaceful oasis for people who are looking to get away, unplug, and be surrounded by nature. The property is stunning. It is so magical at night, too. The room was comfortable and clean. The hiking trails are amazing. Robert’s art is an absolute marvel to look at throughout the main house and in his gallery. What Robert has created on the property is art in nature, and it was incredibly healing for my soul. I left feeling rested and revitalized. We will definitely be back. I didn’t want to leave!"

Robert’s gardens are all extremely beautiful and have unique pieces in them and they’re all equally interesting to look at and explore. Robert and his assistants were friendly and helpful, answering any questions we had and great to chat to. I literally cannot think of a negative thing to say about the people or the place, it is a lovely time even if you’re not a nature hike type of person. 💕"
2021-06-01,5,Stayed about a week,"One of a kind hospitality!!! Rob is truly a kind person and lovely host. His assistants are also some of the sweetest people I’ve met. They took special care of me when I had personal issues during my stay, which is so appreciated. This is a beautiful place to relax and unwind. All spaces are shared except for your cozy room. The bed is also very comfortable. You can’t lock your room from the outside, but you can while you’re inside. I trusted my things were safe, and enjoyed my stay very much."

Enjoyed chatting with host to learn more about the property and the architecture behind it, the surrounding landscape, and the concepts behind the interior spaces.

2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The pictures truly do not do justice for how beautiful the place is on the inside. It had a beautiful backyard where the kids were able to run around and there was a whole room of Mickey Mouse that the kids slept in. The living room was comfortable and large enough for everybody to have a place on the couch. She was extremely responsive when I had any sort of questions about having a bonfire or having a cookout. She was truly amazing and if I ever had to do an Airbnb there again, I would pick this house again."
2023-07-01,5,Group trip,The house was a great escape for our girls weekend. The house had a big kitchen with plenty of space for everyone. Large sectional couch for watching movies and a room and bed for all. The house is nice and secluded on 10 acres with bonefire pit and enough room for a kickball field.

Thank you for having us!"

2023-05-01,5,Group trip,The place is unassuming on the outside. Nice private yard and campfire ring. Inside is beautiful and roomy.

2022-12-01,5,Stayed over a week,"When I arrived I was overwhelmed at how spacious and amazing this home was. Beautifully and tastefully decorated. It is hard to tell how magnificent the home is from the photos alone.
There are 2 queen beds, and 4 twin beds. There is one bathroom, the water pressure and temperature is AMAZING. There is ample space in the kitchen for storing food and a large living room. Karri also provides 10+ board games for family fun. The driveway can be a bit dark at night but the house is well lit.
Karri was very responsive and hospitable. She got back to me within 30mins any time I reached out and was incredibly kind and understanding of my circumstances.
If I could give this bnb more stars than 5 I would! Peaceful, beautiful stay in Michigan. I highly recommend. I stayed during November and it was a winter wonderland."

2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My sister and I loved the way the home was decorated and the comfy beds. It was a beautiful place. It was very spacious even with all of the furniture in the living areas. The kitchen was small, and, as advertised, no oven, but we took advantage of the hotplate to cook on and of course, the microwave. Tracie was super friendly and provided multiple suggestions on things to do in the area. And she made herself available if anything had come up. We really enjoyed out stay. We will definitely consider renting again if we are ever in the area."

2024-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Tracie was absolutely amazing and communicative with us. She checked in prior to us arriving to ensure we knew where to go, checked in again to make sure we arrived on and if see if we needed anything, and checked on us one last time after we left. The space was amazing and very roomy. She had the softest throw blankets in the living room. We also loved all the wood furnishing. It has a rustic cabin feel. We were on town visiting family and needed somewhere to relax and sleep and this space was exactly what we needed. If/when we come back I will definitely see if this space is available."

We will definitely stay here again the next time we are in the area!!

The space is beautiful and peaceful and very comfortable!"

2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Tracie is very easy to communicate with and is always responsive.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,Tracie was nice and easy to talk to and was very accommodating with check in and check out times. Her home was super cozy and far more spacious than what it appeared in pictures. I arrived later in the day to have enough time to enjoy the fire pit in the yard but would definitely love another chance to come back to visit again in the future. Highly recommend this place to anyone who's considering!
2023-08-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Our stay was very pleasant. Our hosts were very nice and responsive. The place matched the photos perfectly. It was knotty pine all around. Bed was comfortable. Everything was very clean.
We only had two minor concerns. First, we arrived in a pickup truck and it was a little tight getting into the space between the trees, the brush, and the garden fence. We managed though. Second, if you aren’t used to well water you may be a little surprised. I grew up with relatives with similar water so it didn’t bother me.
I’d stay here again without any hesitation."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"Stayed here for one evening during a through hike. The place is even bigger than it appears in the photos. Comfortable living area and bedrooms. Very pleasant. Just what I was looking for. Tracie was great. She reached out ahead of my stay, and was available if I needed anything. She even gave me a ride the next morning, which was much appreciated (and over and above the call of duty)."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,peaceful and quiet. lovely atmosphere
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,Our stay was wonderful in beautiful Northern Michigan! The space was clean and comfortable. Tracie was responsive and flexible with our late check-in.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"Very beautiful and peaceful place to stay. Host is very friendly. However, it is better to give enough signs on the way to show how to get into the room (downstair)."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"Tracie’s a fantastic host. The living space is very good size, comfortable sleeping arrangements, and peaceful outdoor space. Good for a one night stay like we had, or many days/nights."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,Beautiful place. Close to highway and surrounding. Comfortable beds. Will definitely stay there again!
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,Another great stay here :-) Tracie has always been attentive to messages etc especially since my schedule for work and travel can be very fluid. They have always been very accommodating and understanding with my timing. This is a perfect place to find yourself relaxing and taking time to unwind.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Tracie was a great hostess and our stay was wonderful. Our accommodations were just what we expected based on the description. The space was VERY clean, spacious and the furniture in the living area was extremely comfortable with a large screen TV. The area was beautiful and we were close enough to many great places to explore, hike, shop and marvel at God’s creation. I would highly recommend this listing."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,Tracie is very kind and her house is beautiful!
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"WOW… this place is BEAUTIFUL. It’s so quite. It’s the lower level of the house. It overlooks a small pond. I seen deer tracks near the pond so maybe you get to see one besides the ones hanging on the wall. The host recommended places to eat locally and when I told her we were going around Lake Michigan and coming down from the Upper Peninsula she recommended places to go on the way day. That was so helpful. My hubby loved it so much he didn’t want to leave lol.
We would definitely stay again."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful, comfortable space. Very peaceful and quiet. We were even treated to a bit of nature in the form of a doe and her fawn by the pond. This place is very close to Big Rapids, our actual destination."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,A+. Wish we could have stayed longer.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,First time staying at an Airbnb where the host lived above. Not an issue at all. Never heard them and felt like we had entire home to ourselves. Beautiful place.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Tracie's Place was what we were looking for. Tracie was a great host, and she always responded to our questions. The place was spotless, and it was very private and peaceful. Great place to stay."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,My first stay at an Airbnb and it was great. The host is able to help with almost everything we needed including having a fire.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place is so beautiful with lots of forests and vegetation around. The place is nice, clean cozy and quiet."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Tracie was very responsive and flexible for our check-in. She was extremely friendly and personable. If in the area, we would definitely stay here again."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"You've found the hidden gem of this area in this listing. I inquired about availability for this listing pretty close to when I need to be in the area for work and Tracie was extremely flexible with my schedule. She was there upon my arrival and check in to introduce me to the space and welcome to their place.
you'll find that this listing has a very comfortable Lodge feel with a lot of rustic, handcrafted details and accents throughout.
The outside location offers a few nice areas to just chill out and relax. A pond setting, fire pit area and immediate back porch area.
due to Tracies great communication, The address and also instructions to make your way to the space that you are renting was as easy as it gets.
I would highly recommend this listing and host if you are in the area. I'll definitely be checking on availabilities when back up in that area for work :-)
Thanks for everything Tracie !"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"beautiful space, wonderful view."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,We went to a wedding in Reed city and Tracie’s place was perfect for us to stay in. Tracie was a great host.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,Tracie's place was beyond what we expected. Beautiful atmosphere in the trees with rustic setting. Pristine cleanliness with all the amenities one could ask for. We were delighted to be staying in such a warm and inviting place. The room was in our own space in the lower with handmade rustic pine furniture. We were in our own special retreat in the woods. Tracie was warm and engaging and welcomed us immediately. We will certainly be back. Great value!
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was the perfect place for relaxing and reflecting. So peaceful and beautiful. The home is amazingly beautiful. We felt blessed to be able to enjoy such a lovely space that was obviously put together with thoughtful, loving hands and heart."

Highly recommend!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"I was warmly welcomed and made to feel right at home. They made some suggestions of restaurants in the area. The space was spotless and cozy. The space was pretty much as depicted in the photos, although there were a lot of deer heads & antlers throughout the space than I had expected. It definitely had the up north vibe going on. The host was super gracious and very responsive."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,super clean. great place to stay.
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,Tracie was an excellent host. Her home is beautiful and she is happy to give folks a great experience. LGBTQIA+ friendly
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"Tracie's space was absolutely wonderful for what we needed. Although there was other lodging closer to our destination, this space was much larger & far more affordable than a hotel/motel. We had the entire lower floor to ourselves. This space looks exactly as it does in the listing. Tracie was very responsive & answered all of my questions. Check-in was also flexible which was helpful. We would definitely stay here again!
FYI - This is a shared space & there is no permanent barrier separating the floors. There is a wall-to-wall curtain at the stair set separating your space."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,Great stay! Tracie was very friendly and helpful. Accommodations were cozy and private.

2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My girlfriend and I stayed here two nights on a ski trip. Tracie went above and beyond hosting us! She is very detailed with information as well as local recommendations! It is a very beautiful home that has been well taken care of.

2022-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"This place is hands down the perfect place. Look no further. The place, the view, the price and mostly the hospitality. We can't wait to go back. Everything you need and the comfortablitly of this place is worth all of it. Tracie is absolutely wonderful and super accommodating. We are coming back in November for sure!!!"

2022-10-01,5,Stayed one night,Awesome stay! Highly recommended!
2022-10-01,4,Stayed one night,"Enjoyable, large space, particularly good for families. The environment is cozy and welcoming, the our hostess lovely. We wish we could have stayed longer! as we were just passing through. There are some small issues with the streaming services as Reed City is a little remote, so we didn't finish our movie. Tracie also says they're going to revisit the wiring, as it was easy to blow fuses (we managed two, alas) by using the mini-plug in heaters. But for when the heat is turned on for the season, this lower level should be just what's needed for a lovely stay near Cadillac."
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Room is clean and quiet!! I will stay again!
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This was a very nice place and location for my stay in the area. Tracie is a very good host and I hope to stay there another time.

2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Tracie was a great host she had clear instructions with what to do if someone is or is that there to greet you and the B&B itself was gorgeous. I didn’t have any trouble trying to find something to do in this area either. Highly recommend.

2022-08-01,5,Stayed one night,Great stay. Few hotels in the area so this worked for four people.
2022-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Very beautiful spacious, comfortable and clean!"
2022-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"This was the perfect stopover on our long drive from North Carolina to the Upper Peninsula. For less than the price of a decent hotel you get tons of space—enormous common room with five (!) sofas and three separate tables for working/eating—plus super comfy beds, lots of fluffy towels, a breakfast nook with island and coffee, and very nice hosts. It feels very private; didn’t hear the homeowners above at all. Do check re the wifi if that’s important; it was iffy during our brief stay, perhaps due to storms. As others have mentioned, there are lots of deer heads—including an entire display of antlers on one of the bedroom walls. We struggled with the door on arrival, not realizing it was sliding. Would stay here again in a heartbeat."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful space with gorgeous furnishings in a lovely setting. Host was friendly and welcoming, and the value was SO much better than the nearest hotel, especially since there are two separate bedrooms (nice when traveling with a teenager kid!). Loved this place!"

We are planning our next stay already!! Thanks ever-so-much, Tracie!! [We did have the pulled pork nachos at The Brewery ---SO good--- but chose the Big Burrito to share at Chase Creek ---excellent! and we were stuffed!!--- had breakfast at the Chuckwagon. . . Enjoyed them all, and so nice of you to have suggestions right in the listing for us!] Truly a FIVE STAR experience! ! !"
2022-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"Another stellar Airbnb experience!
This was a getaway to celebrate my 60th birthday. Communication with Tracie was prompt, detailed and thorough. We arrived late, and she made it clear where to park, etc.
After being greeted and introducing ourselves, Tracie welcomed us in to her lovely home, which is so cozy and homey.
But the outstanding part was her thoughtfulness. On the counter were sweets from the local bakery for my birthday breakfast!
It was a delightful experience staying in Reed City, which I highly recommend to potential guests."
2022-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"Affordable and beautiful. Host was extremly nice, helpful, and great with communication."
2022-01-01,5,Stayed one night,Our stay was very nice. We were greeted by the owners and shown the property by the owner. The place was clean and there was plenty of privacy from the main home.
2022-01-01,5,Stayed one night,A huge beautiful space with gorgeous views of the woods. Just what I needed for an up-north escape!
2022-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful place. It was perfect!
2021-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay and Tracie was very accommodating to my crazy sleep schedule.
2021-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Everything was fantastic. Thank you again.
2021-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"My trip had some problems, but the host actively helped me. And they let us know that there will be a Christmas festival in Reed City, so we had a good experience. The house is clean and cozy, and I want to live in a house like this later"
2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Tracie was great to work with and was very helpful when I had questions! The space is absolutely beautiful and was very cozy to be at.
2021-11-01,5,Stayed one night,Beautiful spot to stay. Working with Tracie was extremely easy. Will be booking again in the future.
2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Our stay was nice and cozy, lots of space for a weekend getaway. The backyard view was especially pleasant, even on a cold, snowy weekend. Hosts were very responsive and made sure we had everything we needed."
2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Being at Tracie’s Airbnb was like staying in a private cabin in the woods!
As mentioned, the space is the whole lower level of Tracie and Brian’s beautiful home looking out on a clearing in the woods with a fire pit and pond. It is very spacious and has an abundance of seating in the living area as well as spots at the counter/tables for eating or playing games. It was immaculate as well.
If you arrive after dark, lights automatically come on as you walk along the sidewalk in front of the house to the stone path down the hill. There are solar lights along the pathway and automatic lights again as you reach the bottom at the patio doors.
The listing is very accurate. Even though the lower level being divided from the upstairs by drapes was not an issue for us, I do believe it probably should be mentioned in the listing.
A few other things to be aware of—they have a no shoes policy (which I appreciate!) so you may want to bring slippers or slipper socks. The space does not have an oven or stove, so don’t plan to make a big meal. They do have a microwave and a double burner portable cooktop that works just fine for smaller meals that don’t need to be baked. The other thing to be aware of is that Brian
must be a pretty avid hunter. If you are really bothered by deer mounted on the walls, this is probably not the place for you!
If you hike or bike, this Airbnb is close to the White Pine Trail that connects to the Pere Marquette Rail Trail and the Big Rapids Riverwalk. This a great, incredibly reasonably priced spot for a quiet getaway."
2021-10-01,5,Stayed one night,Beautiful home and accommodations. Everything is immaculate and very well done.We will definitely be back if we are ever in the area again.
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Exceeded all expectations and was a beautiful place to stay. This was a second visit and hope to come again.
2021-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"Spacious, open, clean, and welcoming space just outside of Reed city in a Beautiful country setting.

2021-09-01,5,Stayed one night,Tracie is a very warm and welcoming hostess. The space is huge and very comfortable. I would definitely stay again.
2021-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,if you do go make sure you go in towards back from the right side.
2021-09-01,4,Stayed one night,"Very gracious hosts.
It was larger than it looks in the pictures.
The trails looked inviting but it rained when we were there."
2021-09-01,5,Stayed one night,Tracie is a very gracious and accommodating host. She was incredibly welcoming and her space is cozy and inviting. Perfectly woodsy! Do yourself a favor and book your reservation!
2021-09-01,5,Stayed one night,Superb host and accomodations. So pleased to have stayed here!
2021-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"This was a terrific and spacious place to stay at. It was very quiet and just a beautiful location. Tracie was quick to reach out, which made me feel welcomed. Will definitely seek this place again"
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was a perfect getaway! We rode the trail to Cadillac and then down to Paris a different day!! We also hiked the state park close by and it was beautiful! We enjoyed our morning coffee out in the sun by the pond. Everything was clean, quiet and comfortable!! Great Hosts!!!"
2021-09-01,5,Stayed one night,Tracie went above and beyond to ensure everything was perfect.
2021-09-01,5,Stayed one night,Tracie was very welcoming to us. We had a nice visit with she and her husband.
2021-08-01,4,Stayed one night,"Very nice place to stay. It's very, very clean, quiet, and spacious. We checked in late, and only stayed one night, so we didn't use the outside area or the TV/LR area. The inside is immaculately clean, and very large! The kitchen/breakfast bar area is perfect for grabbing a quick bite to eat or packing sandwiches for the day. One of the bedrooms had water from a recent hard rain, so we slept in the rear bedroom. It could have been an issue if we were traveling with others, but we were alone. One issue I had was that the upstairs and downstairs are not divided by any wall, or door. Only a long curtain running the length of an open, sideways staircase. It didn't feel isolated to me, and I was a little upset that it wasn't mentioned in the write up. Also, the back door doesn't lock from the outside, only from the inside. You don't get a key, and you must leave the door unlocked when you go out. I've only been in a few Air B&B's so I'm not sure if that is common? It's quiet, and semi secluded. The backyard is wooded, but there's a fairly busy country road nearby. We saw cars driving by, and people walking from the back patio. The pond area looks nice, but we only made a quick walk around before we left. The walk from the parking area to the back door is a good distance. The steppingstones down to the back yard are a little difficult to see at first. We walked around the wrong side of the house by mistake because we didn’t see the path (my bad). Also, the path is also kind of steep and was slick when the grass was wet. It could be an issue for older, or mobility challenged folks. Overall, it is a VERY nice rural home. The amenities are well stocked, we had everything we could possibly need. The furniture is quality wood, sturdy and well made. If you like the cabin or woodsy décor motif, you will love this place! We were traveling alone, but there is plenty of room for a larger group. There’s not much around Reed City, a few restaurants, and a nice little brewery in town. Out by the highway, there’s a gas station and some fast food options. It’s peaceful and quiet, and if you don’t mind the curtain being the only divider between up and down stairs, it is very comfortable. We only met Brian. He was very nice and gave good recommendations for food and travel in the area. I only saw Tracie in passing as she was leaving for work, we spoke briefly, but she seemed very nice. Thanks for hosting us!"
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Come and enjoy a beautiful, spacious and comfortable setting surrounded by a peaceful, bird-filled woods. A fire-pit and small pond are there to enjoy. The rooms are set in a wood theme and the furniture is handmade by the owner. Everything you could possibly need is provided.
Hosts are very friendly, helpful and accommodating. They provide the perfect airbnb experience."
2021-08-01,5,Stayed one night,This is a wonderful place. So nice. And beautiful. I highly recommend a stay here. Perfect. Better than hotels. Oh so much better.
2021-08-01,5,Stayed one night,Bigger than expected! Very clean! Three tables. Would be great for a family get together. Very quiet. Host is friendly and easy to get along with.
2021-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Great place, bigger than the pictures show, very clean, hosts are great. Very good price."
2021-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"Tracie's place will not disappoint. Not only is it emaculant, but she is super sweet as well. I was met with the nicest greeting. Just wish I could have stayed longer to really enjoy her property."
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"If I could, I would give this place 10 stars in EVERY single category!!! Not only does it feel like you’ve found your own little slice of Heaven on Earth, but Tracie and husband are truly like Angels on Earth!
Everywhere I looked, in every direction, things were immaculate, gorgeous, and relaxing. There were divine little touches that most hosts do not think of, like a couple bags of popcorn on top of the microwave, and a variety of k-cups to choose from for coffee. The gorgeous handmade wood furniture is made by the husband of the house, and there is not a single comfort that is lacking!
As if all of this were not enough, I happened to experience a very scary awful life event during my visit, and Tracie went above, beyond, and back again to help me, even after my stay would have been over!
