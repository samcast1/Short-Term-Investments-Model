2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great house, we enjoyed our stay as we were only a mile from
Our relatives home that we were in town to visit."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"When needing a place to stay in Norfolk, don’t pass this place up."
2024-06-01,5,Group trip,"Beautiful, spacious, comfortable and clean. Modern decorations. Beautiful yard. Loved the open layout and big windows. I would easily book again."
2024-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My parents and I were attending a graduation and wanted something more comfortable than a hotel room. This house was perfect for our needs. The beds and linens were so comfortable, the kitchen had everything we needed, the windows all through the home were exquisite, there really was nothing Danielle had not thought of. The furnishings and accents were on point and tasteful. For me the ideal AirBnB is a space that could be your second home. A space that feels like it could be yours - comfortable, well-appointed, and peaceful. This house was all of this."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great communication and exactly as described… looking forward to our next stay.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We loved this home. It provided every need we had for this trip. It was beautifully decorated, the kitchen had ample supply of updated cookware and appliances. The laundry room had everything we needed and same with both bathrooms. The place was very clean and and made me feel comfortable and safe. The bed was very comfortable. I travel with a bedtopper and sheets and did not need them. We loved all the windows and looking out from the hilltop down to the city lights. We also enjoyed walking the neighborhood each day to get some exercise. The one car garage was perfect for our mid size suv. It has a large back yard that we could enjoy with kids or a dog, play some lawn games etc. The host was very responsive and had a welcome brochure with local restaurants and activities etc. We loved this place so much, we are booking it for a family reunion event coming up this summer."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This was my second stay at this house, and third at one of Danielle’s properties. We always enjoy our stay, and appreciate all of the care and details she puts into her properties."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"My husband and I and 2 of our grown children, son in law, and one grandchild stayed during the process of my brother's death and funeral. Danielle was very kind and understanding during this difficult time. The house is beautiful, clean, and everything we needed was there for our comfort. The view out the East top floor living room windows is breathtaking! I would love to stay here again, and will book this house if it is available on our next trip to Norfolk."

This cabin is close enough to town to be convenient, but just far outside of city limits to feel remote. The cabin was spotless with every amenity I could have asked for.

2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Beautiful log cabin just outside town that gives you a taste of country living with convenience. The landscaping and sun room were a beautiful bonus. The home was very clean with a lovely, unique layout.
While it did not bother us, the upper level master bedroom and bath lack privacy - as the bedroom has no door. Walking up the stairs off the family room offers a view of the bed. The bathroom door does not lock and has a sliding farmhouse/barn door. We let our children know to announce themselves before coming up the stairs and really had no issue, but this may be something to consider for some parties.
Elizabeth was fantastic and very responsive. We would highly recommend this property and will definitely be back!"

I travel for a living. I stay in a lot of these types of establishments, and I also bring the entire family to vacation in places like this. NEVER have I had a bad review or had to leave one.
•3 overnight guest in total including myself, but I was treated like we were throwing a party. ( we choose to stay there to ride atvs at the local track)
They watched the place constantly, and noted who came and went.
•They complained about how I left the place, even though I went through and picked up 99% of our mess for them. Including: putting dishes in the dish washer, collecting all dirty laundry into a basket, and left the trash bag outside.
•They also are trying to charge me for surface scratches on a few chairs ( literally the area your butt sits on.) my 2 roommates left after night 1 and I went solo the last night.

2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful log cabin! Nicely furnished and very cozy! I don’t like microfiber sheets, but I brought my own, so if you’re like me, do the same! Also, if you are sensitive to road noise, that may be an issue for you, as the road out front is a 65 mph highway in a residential area."

2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Diane's Cottage was amazing. Super clean and had alot of little things alot of other places don't have. Everytime I came home for the evening I felt like it was actually home. Super host is a well earned name for her!
2021-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Wonderful stay. I stayed here for a month while visiting family and Diane's place was a great value. Great location close to Norfolk (~15mins), comfy home, and beautiful surroundings. It was safe on the property and even though it is a working farm it was relatively quiet. Everyone I met on the property was friendly and caring. I would totally stay here again and recommend to others.
Quick story - I am not from the midwest, so my first week there was a crazy thunderstorm that hit overnight with a tornado warning issued in the area. I was sleeping like a baby when this was all happening, and Diane had the forethought to call me at 1am to let me know that I needed to get into the basement for safety. I was freaking out and she helped calm me down and guided me to find the basement I had not bothered to find previously. All was well and we were safe, but the next day her and her family took care of cleaning up the branches in the aftermath and checked on me. Seems kind of silly to share, but it says so much about a host who not only takes care of the property, but also guests."
2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Diane’s cottage was a perfect setting with farmland all around. It was quiet and peaceful listening to the birds everyday. It was nostalgic for my husband who grew up on a farm nearby . The cottage was clean and equipped with everything we needed for our stay. Diane was also very helpful in suggestions for local activities and dining.We hope to go again.
2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Windmill Cottage is a delightful place to stay. It is surrounded by beautiful trees and fertile farmland and is so nice and quiet and peaceful, yet close to both Madison and Norfolk so that you can quickly be in town enjoying restaurants and movies and parks and walking trails and shopping and more. The house is clean and wonderfully decorated in a way that brings back so much nostalgia for simpler days, while having all the modern amenities you may desire. The value of what you get for the cost is amazing, the host is very wonderful and responsive with communication, and you will find yourself enjoying a very comfortable, peaceful stay if you choose to come here.
On a lighter yet important note: I've never stayed anywhere that was so well stocked with bath towels and face cloths and toilet paper for your bathroom needs. In fact we were all talking about how we always traveled with extra supplies because the places we would stay would be so meagerly stocked. Windmill Cottage looks out for your needs and comforts!
We will definitely stay again and we've recommended it to family and friends and will continue to do so. We can't wait to come back again."

I couldn’t have asked for a more pleasant stay. We all wish we could have stayed longer! My family made such beautiful memories and we have Diane and her wonderful family to thank for sharing their beautiful property and cottage with us. Staying in a hotel will never compare to the feeling of HOME. Thank you so much again.

We frequent the area several times a year and were looking for an alternative to hotels, we chose the Townhouse offered by Melissa. The property was in a very good location and very quiet, inside was the perfect size for our needs. Priced comparable to the Hotels in the area, but so much more space.
Melissa was a great host, and we will be back!

2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,Jessi was very communicative and made us feel right at home.
2024-05-01,2,Stayed a few nights,"So it’s not the worst place. I felt okay coming in the first day but afterwards I felt unwelcome and very uncomfortable. If I’m being honest, it could be because I’m black because it was as if they were surprised and disappointed in accepting my booking. I totally understand that it may have been weird because the majority of the town is caucasian so I’m not upset or anything. After the first day I said hello a couple times to Jessie and she didn’t respond. The bathroom is listed as just for me but it was used by them during my stay as well. Also, no where does it say that she has a pet, all I saw was pets are welcomed but it wasn’t clear that she has a dog. The bed had crumbs or dust on it and underneath the bed was a bag of open chips. So I did my best to avoid them so everyone would feel comfortable and I just did not extend my booking like I wanted to originally. Also, the ceiling in the bathroom is open showing all these pipes, and the waters consistency is not very clean. 4/10."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"My family and I enjoyed our stay at this place, definitely recommend .
Jacob and Jessie are very nice people. Thank you both ."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed over a week,I would say Jessie's place is a great place to stay and I will always call home away from home. Very hospitable and nice family.

2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Jessie's room is as she described it. The room and beds are comfortable and clean. This was a business trip so I was not at the home during the day. I was surprised at how quiet and peaceful it was for being a basement room. The entire family is delightful! I loved meeting the children they are respectful and friendly.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We were welcomed by the host with open arms, family was very friendly and helpful, very responsive, looking forward to staying there again next time I visit."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,Space was exactly like the description/pictures. Jessie’s home was spacious and clean. The guest room is downstairs so the space still feels private. Great value.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Really great place to stay--we slept great, and felt attended to as needed.
They managed to keep all those kids quiet for us, too, which was great.
The kids were the best part--beautifiul home schooled kids who were polite, inquisitive, informative, and just really lovely. My one regret is that we were so late in arriving, and so behind schedule in leaving in the morning, that there just wasn't time to spend talking to the kids like I would have loved to have done. The one even sang to me as I walked through the kitchen to the basement stairs. SO sweet.
Their parents were really easy going, left us alone to get done what we needed to do, found us their clothing ironing table to use, and let us put our water bottles in the freezer for our cooler the next day.
All around, a great place to stay."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,Nice hosts and great communication!! Would stay again

The value we got for what we paid was amazing. Gina was helpful in getting us checked in and letting us know anything we needed to know. She was next door and willing to help at any time. She was a perfect host.
This house is being worked on, so it was a little alarming at first when we arrived, but as soon as she explained they were working on it but the inside is done and beautiful. My kids loved it. Everyone had their own space, and I had enough room to make a Thanksgiving dinner for my kids. Just a super cozy experience!

2024-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We just needed a quick place to sleep and eat breakfast for our family of 4 (kids ages 3 years and 11 months) for an out-of-state wedding. Travis’ place was quick and easy to book, his check-in instructions and communication before-hand were clear and thorough, and his space was well though out for families of small children with minimal clutter and kid-friendly furniture. He went as far as to provide a baby bath insert and baby-specific bath products and had offered a pack-n-play based on our booking details. We were also pleasantly surprised to find out we were able to park in the garage. The home was stocked with some complimentary snacks, toiletries, and lots of other perks we didn’t have time to utilize. It was one of the cleanest places we have stayed. Overall it was very cozy. If we ever found ourselves in Norfolk again we would for sure check for this listing first! Thanks, Travis!"

2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Travis’ rental is a really nice and comfy place to call home when you can’t be home. Also felt very safe. And it’s a quiet neighborhood. Great location, just minutes from anywhere in town. Several places to eat are just 5 minutes away: Tu Casa Mexican restaurant, Sakura sushi restaurant, Franklin’s family restaurant, Godfathers Pizza, Subway, Dominoes, Burger King and McDonalds and a gas station just down the street. The house is cozy. The couch in the living room is SO comfortable. A person could easily sleep there; as a matter of fact, I took a nap there. The bedrooms are nice and big and having a master bathroom and closet is a plus. Something that I find a problem in some rentals I’ve stayed in is water pressure, especially in the shower. Not so much here. The water pressure was fantastic! And plenty of hot water. The kitchen had about everything we needed for a short stay. The patio was a nice place to sit with our morning coffee, which, btw, the coffee was provided. Even met one of the neighbors while sitting there. Everyone we encountered in the neighborhood was friendly and helpful. It was great having a two car garage, too. All in all, it’s a great place and a great alternative to a hotel, in my opinion. Much more affordable and private. Travis is a great host, too, and he was quick to respond to any questions we had. Much appreciated. This place meets our approval and we highly recommend it."

2023-04-01,5,Stayed about a week,Very responsive and attentive
2023-04-01,5,Stayed over a week,"It was so far my best experience on AIRBNB -- the house looks like new outside and inside. Huge TV and brand new AC. Wooden floors in living room and a kitchen, but nice carpets at every bedroom. Great and comfortable furniture with perfectly equipped kitchen. You have everything for feeling like you are at home. Will be good choice for couple with or without children. Location is quiet, 2 minutes from nearest Hy-Vee store and 5 minutes from restaurants. If you are travelling with the kids - the Waterpark is in 1 minute walking distance.
Danielle is a perfect host who was helpful during all our staying at her place. She provides everything you may need - at the first day she asked if anything missing - next day she supplied the every single item I mentioned to her.
I definitely encourage you to stay at this house if you are planning to travel to Norfolk, NE."

This instruction is listed in the “house rules”, but because of all the excitement of the why we were in town, it was inadvertently overlooked. The kitchen was clean with lots of pots and pans, nice dishes and glasses. The beds were comfy and the linens & pillows were clean and soft.

I loved that it was close to SkyView Lake where I walked to and around in the mornings but there are other activities a person can do there too. The place, itself, is fantastic. Gretchen has thought of every detail to make her guests feel at home and safe, not to mention, her impeccable decorating skills. The place is gorgeous. Each bedroom is decorated so uniquely and cute and the bed in the master is the most comfy mattress we’ve slept on in an Airbnb. It may be the most clean Airbnb we’ve ever been in, too. We enjoyed our stay there and highly recommend it. The only thing that would make it even better, would be access to the garage, especially during the winter months. Otherwise, we appreciated the security lights in the driveway."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Gretchen was great, and so was the house! She was easy to communicate with, and made our crew feel right at home! We will definitely stay with her again if we are in the area!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had an amazing stay here! Very clean, modern, and nicely decorated. The layout is perfect for our larger family. We would definitely come back again. Thank you."
2023-04-01,5,Group trip,Great place overall. We will back whenever we come back through for work again.
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Above and beyond our expectations! In a busy traveling for business lifestyle. Sometimes it’s the simplest things that you realize that makes your life go by easier. This stay was it! I plan on staying here again while out for work! Highly recommended!!! Very clean, nice decorative place! Felt like being home!!!"
2023-02-01,5,Group trip,Gretchen was extremely responsive to any requests and always found a solution; including when a wi-fi problem occurred that was out of their control. The house was a perfect meeting place for out of town family and friends from the surrounding towns. It turned out to be the perfect spot to watch the Super Bowl together! We stayed a month in town and I would highly recommend it and will be back our next visit to Norfolk.
2023-02-01,5,Group trip,excellent
2024-01-01,5,Stayed over a week,It was good place to stay.

Only negative was wasn't sure if dishes were prewashed but appeared so. Just my OCDesorder,haha. Overall everything was great. Thanks Ed and hope to use again in the future."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Ed’s place worked exactly what we needed it for while visiting town for graduation. We will definitely be looking into re-booking for future trips.
2023-05-01,5,Stayed about a week,Really comfortable place to stay!!! Great host👍🏽

2023-02-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"great place for what we needed, which was sleep and shower. we stayed when there was still snow on the ground and I was expecting to be cold at night but the rooms were quite warm at 66 degrees. we loved it! Will stay again the next time visiting family"

2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great place.
I had a good time and will be back very soon.
A great place.
I had a great time and will be back very soon."
2022-11-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"We were pleased with the house and it served our purpose well. Thanksgiving with family members at their homes, so we mostly used Ed's place for sleeping and bathing.
There is only one mirror in the house--in the bathroom, so it did get tricky to share one mirror when getting ready. The mattresses are very firm--didn't bother the others in our party, but it did cause me some aches and pains. Overall though, met our purposes well and appreciated the great price."
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We enjoyed our stay! Everything is very nice. Comfortable beds and furniture. Nice and warm too! It is in a nice quiet neighborhood and close to everything. Thank you! Mike and Sherri

2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place was exactly what we needed. Stayed here for a few days while in town working, and couldn’t have found a nicer house."
2022-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,This place was so nice to stay in. The other reviews were right about how clean it is. From the carpets to the kitchen sink to the bedrooms and bathroom- super clean. I really appreciated that. The house is deceptively much larger than it looks on the outside. Checkin/out was non contact and a breeze. There wasn’t a lot of extra rules and that provided for good mutual respect in my opinion. They respectfully cared for and cleaned the home well and I felt the responsibility to respectively keep it nice without all the extra rules most places put on the renter. I’ve already told my extended family about this home as a potential rental option for them when visiting.
2022-07-01,5,Stayed about a week,Really nice communications and they worked with us to get additional nights. Great host

2022-03-01,5,Stayed over a week,nice place to stay. Communication was great.
2024-06-01,4,Stayed with kids,"Love seeing mixed use spaces and being able to walk to nearby downtown districts. Check-in/out was easy and flexible. Host does not supply shampoo/conditioner/body wash so be sure to bring your own. First place we’ve stayed years that doesn’t provide these items so didn’t think to ask in advance. Overall would stay again, but bit of a bummer that we had to go to a friends house to shower in morning."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,A very clean and nice apartment. We had a peaceful weekend in Norfolk. Jade was great! A very pleasant experience!
2024-04-01,5,Group trip,"Very abstract stay (2 staircases in the house), but still amazing. Kitchen came fully equipped and the living room was a perfect place for us to hang out! Jade was a great host and very understanding. Loved our time here."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was a great place for my three sisters and I to meet up for the weekend as we live in Minnesota and Missouri.
Plenty of room for us to spread out and have our own space while being comfortable and spacious to cook meals, play board games and plan our outings.
We enjoyed exploring places our grandma and her family lived plus researching my Dad’s side of the family and their homestead in the Hooper area."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed about a week,Jade’s place was awesome! Very clean and comfortable. Would recommend anyone in the area to book!

2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,Great place to stay :)
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is a great place, very spacious and comfortable. Jade responded to our request for early checkin, and accommodated other needs that we appreciated. Nice decor, comfortable beds.
I sent a note regarding a need on the weekend that went unanswered. The lodging guest amenities you count on, like salt and pepper, Kleenex, toilet paper, microwaveable dishes, were missing or depleted fast.
I’m sure this unit will be a great place to rent for families especially. They just need to ensure all items are available."

2023-06-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"This was a last minute booking, we unfortunately had to wait an hour past check-in time. We booked at 3pm got inside unit just past 5. The lower level is a business and there's an apartment complex in same park lot. It was a nice area, we enjoyed spending time on the balcony."
2023-06-01,4,Group trip,"Jade has a very cute apartment located close to downtown and with easy accessibility to fun things to do. Jade was very easy to work with! Just be aware that if you struggle with stairs, this might not be the best place to stay as there are many of them to get into the apartment and up to the bedrooms. Cute and clean."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,Great place to stay. Right outside downtown with a lot of options nearby. Jade was very responsive made the check in process very easy.
2023-05-01,5,Stayed about a week,Awesome location had some minor issues with the AC but it was fixed once I mentioned it to jade would definitely stay there again
