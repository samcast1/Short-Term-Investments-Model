2024-06-01,5.0,Group trip,"The house was clean, spacious, and well stocked. There was a slight issue with the key code due to a power outage and Renea was very prompt in communicating with us and solving the issue. It was perfect for our family's weekend getaway."
2024-04-01,5.0,Group trip,"The home was even better than the pictures.
It was perfect for our ladies retreat. Home was clean, spacious, and very homey.
And Renea was very helpful and friendly with any questions that we had and made sure we knew she was available if we needed anything.
Would highly recommend.
Thank you for the wonderful stay!!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,Another great stay! Great place to call home for 2 weeks
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,We stayed almost 3 weeks for work and Renea was very responsive and even brought us a BBQ grill once she realized hers was missing. That was very much appreciated!! Place was great and very quiet just what we wanted!
2024-01-01,5.0,Group trip,"Absolutely wonderful home that accommodated our family for a weekend getaway! Great location, very communicative and responsive host, highly recommend!"
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,The Michigan 101 was exactly what we needed. Ours is a large family and we needed all the space. It was more spacious than the photos show and extremely comfortable. Missing the drive once or twice before finding it was really the only drawback. We would definitely recommend it and would stay here again.
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Amazing home near Frankenmuth! We enjoyed our stay very much and the house had everything we needed to have a nice trip.
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,.
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Great rental with plenty of space! The house was clean, in a quiet neighborhood that felt safe and about 20-30 minutes from shopping and Frankenmuth. There are also restaurants that deliver.
This is an especially great rental for anyone with mobility needs including a walker, wheelchair and/or scooter. The house is fully accessible on the outside and inside. The beds are the proper height, grab bars in the bathroom, raised toilet and a roll-in shower. The living room has two recliners that raise someone into an upright position. Entryways throughout the house are flat with no raised surfaces. There is a ramp at the front and back of the house. No one in our party felt left out and could access everything. This rental is worth every penny for these features alone!
We would love to stay again, if we are in the area again, and we definitely recommend this rental to anyone."
2023-11-01,5.0,Group trip,"Very roomy and comfortable, as soon as we arrived we felt right at home. Airbnb was very clean, the photos don’t do it justice. If I’m in the area again will definitely stay here."
2023-10-01,5.0,Group trip,"A perfect place for gathering our family for a wedding in New Lothrup when traveling from MS and NY! Able to cook, comfortable to sleep, nice sitting areas, well kept, loved the 2.5 bathrooms. Thank you."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Other then the vague location from Airbnb, it was great. Certainly not Rennee's fault. Great communication and headache free!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Group trip,"Renea’s place was the perfect spot for my friends and I to spend the weekend when planning a trip to Frankenmuth. Although about a 30 minute drive away, it was the perfect size, space, and price and it was worth every penny and minute of drive time. There are lots of cute shops and restaurants a short drive from the house as well. Very comfortable for 8 people and looked like the photos. Renea responded quickly to a few messages I sent her clarifying some of the rules and was always very nice. Would definitely stay here again when visiting Michigan!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Group trip,"This is a wonderful place to stay, Renae is very responsive, and the Airbnb is extremely clean and very roomy ! 10/10 would stay here again"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We had a Magnificent stay. The home met ALL our needs. Love that it had 2.5 bathrooms. Defiantly stay again.

2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Renea’s place was just what I needed. We had an amazing time. So spacious and clean. I will definitely be back.
2023-09-01,5.0,Group trip,We loved our weekend at this home. Renea was very helpful and responsive! Everything was clean and the description of the home does not do it justice! If we come to this area again will definitely be back!

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,Great stay for us here! we appreciated this charming little house with everything nearby
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was my first time staying at a new listing through Airbnb and I honestly couldn’t have had a better experience! I stayed here with two other adults. The home is small, but it is very efficient, incredibly clean, and it accommodated my family perfectly. The home is nicely remodeled and was outfitted with everything we needed for a comfortable stay. The kitchen and bathrooms were well appointed and you’ll find the hosts incredibly responsive to your needs. The home is located right at the intersection of a main road and it is in somewhat of a sparse neighborhood. However, less than a mile away you’ll find some restaurants, fast food restaurants, and big box stores. Overall, I felt very safe in the area, very comfortable in the space, and would definitely stay here again!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Really enjoyed Meeting the owner. Perfect location to get around as we had some business to attend too while in town. Juts right for a couple {or with 2 kids}or 2 couples . I would stay here then any Hotel listed in Flint! Kyle will have the back yard enclosed this summer and that will give privacy to sit outside. He is doing it right! Thanks so much for the laughter and fun!
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Khirfan and his wife are excellent host! They went above and beyond for our stay! His wife made some delicious cake and they even had toiletries and basic food that was well needed for our trip! We didn’t bring body wash and planned on buying some but they already had it as complimentary stuff. There was a gas station right across the street as well as a Walmart and a very nice dinner called Megas all within 5 mins of the home! They even offered a ride to the airport on our check out date! If you’re ever in Flint and need a place a stay I highly recommend this place! Next time I visit I’ll definitely be staying here!

2024-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Amazing and safe location. Upscale and cozy decor. Very clean! We will look up this location next time we are in the Flint area. Joshua was a great host.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,For a brand new Airbnb this place was fantastic! Josh was extremely responsive and helpful and we loved the new unique little touches and design of the space. Highly recommend!

2024-04-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,The space was nice and clean. The host was also very responsive. Would stay again without hesitation.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This listing worked out great for a over night stay when I listed the area
2024-03-01,4.0,Stayed one night,Janelle’s place was very nice and had all of the necessary amenities. Sound did carry through the home though and music was too loud at times.
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Great place to stay! A lot bigger in person, would stay again! The place was very clean and had everything you needed. The only downside was the dogs barking for awhile. Otherwise it was an enjoyable stay."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Amazing place!
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Janelle was a wonderful host! She was very accommodating and responsive. Would recommend her place!
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"We stayed for a month in Janelle's apartment and felt right at home. The space is very large and despite it being a lower level in her home, it is a walkout with a sliding door and several windows. There are little thoughtful touches, such as an add-on kitchen island with shelving. It came in super handy for storing food. In the bedroom closet, a motion sensor light was very welcome. Overall a very nice stay."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Janelle has a great basement spot that's very clean and looks great. We're from Texas and we visited in the fall, so the bedroom was pretty cold for us. Luckily there's a cozy space next to an electric stove to watch TV and stay warm."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,Beautiful place and beautiful location. Very friendly and easy to talk to host and the place was just as great as it looks.
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This large space was perfect for our stay. Everything was functional with no issues. There was also an air mattress available for us to use. There was easy private access in and out of the building. It was a little cold at times, but there are plenty of blankets available."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Super cozy, comfortable, and private space so convenient to get to from the highway! The neighborhood made us feel very safe. We would stay here again!"
2023-07-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Janelle’s basement apartment was very suitable for we two guests—spotless, appropriately provisioned in the kitchen (very nice coffee maker!), excellent internet and wi-fi, lovely washer and dryer and nice TV with streaming services available. Janelle was extremely responsive to written inquiries, although we never had the chance to meet her. I’d suggest she develop an information booklet for her property that would ultimately save her time and address guests’ questions. Neighborhood was very pleasant and safe; close to restaurants and businesses. Because it is a basement apartment, it was a bit cool for our tastes but we used the electric fireplace to warm it up to the high 60s. There was off-street parking in her driveway. The whole experience worked well for us!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Perfect for what we needed, will book again next time we are in town to visit family!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Janelle’s place is a wonderful place to stay. It is comfortable place in a convenient location. She keeps it very clean. We loved it.

2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great, clean, and spacious !
Host responded quickly!
Extremely clean and comfortable"
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"if you’re unfamiliar with flint, this is in a great, safe, central, location.
walkable to groceries and fast food. drivable to health food, indian food, record stores, guitar center, office supplies, macy’s, a japanese buffet, and all sorts of things.
Place is HUGE. There was a space heater I didn’t even find until the third day. kitchen is nice— but didn’t have a can opener, host graciously let me borrow her’s. She seemed super reasonable and generally easy going. she responds promptly to any issues.
parking was great. easy access and felt secure. there are a lot of stairs, if that is a concern (never bothered me).
great laundry facilities were really nice to have.
three caveats:
1. it’s a half-basement. there may be spiders and such.
2. you’ll hear a train at night. just far enough away to be quaint. i thought it was soothing.
3. the shower stall is seriously small. its maybe 3x3’ or less. the shower stream hits just under 5ft. it’s doable, not the ritz, but i was happy to have it."
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Clean, easy to access, and the host was quick to reply"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This house is great, we love the kitchen so we brought carry out so we could enjoy the house!

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We had a relaxing stay at Julie's Airbnb. Great accommodations. Communication was very good.
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Julie was awesome! Very responsive and friendly! The place is a good get away as well for visiting friends in Grand Blanc. Will be booking again when visiting friends!
2024-04-01,5.0,Group trip,Great location minutes from lots of golf courses and restaurants. Ubers were available and was only a couple of dollars where ever we went Elks club and the F.O.E club. Will definitely stay again when the bowling tournaments come to town
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,This was the perfect space for our little family :) will be booking again in the future:)
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We came to Grand Blanc to spend time with our Oma and family. This home did not disappoint! It was incredibly clean, very comfortable, and provided a much-needed place of quiet in the face of the chaos that is ""visiting family."" It is so much more cost-effective to have an AirBNB for a few days than it is to get two hotel rooms, so definitely worth it in that respect. I have a service dog, and there was more than enough room for her to ""dog"" (chase her ""giftie,""- a ball or other toy) when she was off-duty in the evening. My children were comfortable, everyone felt safe, and even with the torrential downpours on the 14th(!) we were able to enjoy the back porch- and the foosball table! The kitchen was so clean, and had everything we needed! Ultimately, it was the best AirBNB experience we have had, and has quite possibly ruined other AirBNB's for us in the future. This is EXACTLY what all AirBNB's should strive for!"
2024-02-01,5.0,Group trip,Julie was very responsive. Great host. Highly recommend staying here.
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Julie is a responsive host. I was in town for a funeral. So the privacy and quiet neighborhood did me well. With up to date appliances and strong wifi made it even better. The beds where very comfortable as well.
2024-01-01,5.0,Group trip,"The space was perfect for me and my extended family (parents, uncle and daughter) while in town for a funeral. The space was clean and we were very comfortable. TONS of spices to use in the very well-stocked kitchen! Everything you would need to cook great meals . Beds were good, bathroom was clean and had plenty of towels etc. It appeared the host has put alot of effort into remodeling the house and updating it. It was a great value and if we are ever in the are again, we will definitely stay there if possible. (Note: one of the foosball players lost his legs which meant I won against my daughter!!)"
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This was a great place to stay!

The kitchen is very well stocked compared to other places I have rented in the past! Julie was very responsive when I had questions and even provided me a link to where she purchased the amazingly comfortable bed!
I broke my foot 2 days prior to check in and am using a knee roller. This home was not conducive for this so if you use a wheelchair or knee roller of any kind it might be difficult.

Huge backyard was wonderful and felt peace there.
Thank you Juile."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Only good things to say about Julie’s place. It provided us with Comforts of home in a convenient location. Coming back to the house is much nicer than returning to a hotel at the end of a day. Julie was very responsive and considerate.

2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Julie was so accommodating with our late night admission. We came from Ohio quite quickly thinking our daughter was in labor. She wasn't progressing as expected and discharged from the hospital mid contractions after midnight. Renting Julie's ABB allowed my daughter to stay 20 minutes closer to the hospital and provided enough space for the family to support her and get rest before the main event. She even discounted the after midnight check-in. I can't express my appreciation enough! Thanks to Julie we were able to all be together when 9lb 1oz baby, Emerson Joseph came into the world."
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was our 2nd time staying here, Always clean, good location, such a cozy home. Julie is a great host and very responsive. We will be back again."

2022-12-01,5.0,Group trip,"Perfect to come back home and visit family for Christmas but still have a place of our own. We were pleasantly surprised how well the kitchen was stocked. Plenty of pots, pans, dishes, spices, everything you need. The bathroom was also well stocked. The host responded to our questions very quickly."
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Our second trip to this location visiting family for the holiday. Love the kitchen, decor, it's cleaned well and the beds are SO comfortable. Cozy home well equipped to have Grandma come for dinner and rest after long days of attending family gatherings. Love the touches of Christmas decor as well, thank you!"
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great location! Private and clean. Wifi works well! Beds are great! Living area is comfortable. I can’t picture a better bnb… second time staying here. Highly recommend 10/10.
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Julie's house was great! We are a family of three with a four year old. The house was able to stay warm during some snow. Everything we needed was there from towels and extra blankets to muffin pans and a crockpot. Whenever I had a question, Julie was extremely responsive and very quick. She brought over salt and a shovel during some unexpected snow. The house felt safe and was very comfortable. I will say that the heating unit is VERY loud. It was ok for us because our daughter likes to use a sound machine when we travel. It makes a similar nose but very loud. It drowns out any traffic noise though so it did not bother us. If you are a quiet sleeper, it may be a bother. Everything worked well. The beds were comfy. The location was great and we were able to use Instacart, door dash, & Amazon during our stay. Also very close to many local shops and restaurants. We would absolutely stay here again. Both the host and the house were great. Huge thanks to Julie!"

Pros: super comfy beds, clean as a whistle, awesome playroom area, kitchen well stocked, big yard for the grands to enjoy while we relaxed on The back porch.
Cons: no window treatments in the majority of the house including bedrooms and bathroom. Windows were high, but the amount of light coming in made for a very early morning with the children and the bathroom one definitely created a lack of privacy. We needed some more linens to supplement what was there but were told that they were missing since the last guest and hadn’t arrived yet?
We would t cross this cute house off our list but would want to know that it had these two things before we returned."

2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"I enjoyed using the unit more than staying in a hotel. It gave me room to move about within the space so I never felt confined. The new appliances, cleanliness of the unit, and WiFi were great. I was able to work without interruption. There was plenty of storage space for my needs, too.
I look forward to returning to Flint and would definitely stay here again. Thank you for making me feel welcome!"

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great location and a perfect place to getaway
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"The experience was really cool, this was our second time staying on a tiny home and I loved how clean and well structured it was, the place comes with pretty much everything you need for a light camping experience. I would say if you have a hybrid or a tempur pedic mattress, the bed will be a bit uncomfortable, also I would say if you want to spend more time outdoors specially when raining bring a big umbrella or a tarp. We spent our last night inside cause it was pouring but other than that everything was great, communication was excellent and the place was very cute. We really enjoyed it."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Loved the stay and would definitely book again!
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,I enjoyed my trip I can’t wait to book again 10/10
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We had the absolute best weekend at Getaway The Thumb! We were so impressed with the cleanliness and privacy of the houses. It was also obvious how much care and intentionality went into curating the space and making sure we felt special during our stay; the attention to detail surpassed all expectations. I seriously cannot recommend enough—I booked my next stay immediately upon checkout and can’t wait to go back!
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We stayed at the Ohio Gateway and wanted to try the Michigan one. It was all they said it was and more. This one is a little more private than the one in Lisbon Ohio. Would definitely go back.

You will discover many new things by actually spending time here."

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Felt so peaceful and calm. What an amazing little place to getaway to.
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place was clean and amazing. It looked better in person than it did the pictures, the pictures looked amazing. This was the best AirBnB experience ever."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Perfect!
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,An enchanting and modern space to unwind and leave everything behind. Low-key and set up to fully embrace nature at its finest. Great for a couple or the solo traveler.
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The best airbnb! The attention to detail and simplicity of the unit was impressive. Having the campfire stocked with supplies and smores was such a surprise and again, impressed. The peacefulness and beautiful views made it so perfect. You can definitely tell that this place has lots of thought and love poured into it. The property grounds are so pretty. We just LOVED our stay at the Getaway!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great stay! Everything was thought of for us. A wall mounted mirror would make the bathroom even better, comfortable accommodation - highly recommend."

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful and Peaceful
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"If I could give this place 10 stars I would. Absolutely perfect stay for my hound dog and I as it was setup with all the amenities necessary for both human and hound! Beautiful view, clean space, and a thoughtful host!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Really cool spot to just get away for a little while
2024-04-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,Lovely place surrounded by peace and quiet. Great for one night but would be too small for anything more.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Getaway was super clean, had everything you needed and more. My wife and I were so impressed and will for sure be booking again soon!!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,great!
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Was speechless from the second I opened the door. Couldn’t spend the night but will definitely be going back for a longer stay later, was the perfect size and was just blow away by the big window right by the hill and i could even see the river below!!!!"
2024-04-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"It was very nice area, more of a glorified glamping. Not as secluded as we thought. Don't like the idea of having to be in the cabin and having the fire out by 10p. Can't imagine what it would be like in the dead of summer with heat, and not getting cool and dark by 10p. Almost had a really big problem with toilet not functioning (due to somewhere else on site). It was after 8, where apparently they have no staff, despite the property being completely booked. We would've been furious if we lost electricity, couldn't gain access (keyless entry), or something that could've ruined the whole trip (which seemed to have happened to our neighbors). Getaways did offer a small rebate for the few hours that our toilet wasn't working."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We had a relaxing break. Beautiful setting, everything you need, super comfortable bed, helpful staff available online. Can’t wait to book our next stay. We hope this Getaway location will be our place to recharge in the regular!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very peaceful and perfect
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,It was perfect. I will stay again very soon.
2024-04-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,disappointed with the tiny sink was a lot of wasted space for what could have been a bigger sink. also not having an oven was a challenge. unclear rules about having fires. overall loved the experience
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,I'm most appreciative to my host because We wanted for nothing. Get Away provided anything that I could possibly think of. The only recommendations I might suggest for guest is to bring food and your desired toiletries.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,lovely stay and feel very recharged
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Can’t wait to come back it was so peaceful.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Fantastic stay!
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"You've seen the pictures, but words can't describe the serenity. There are multiple cabins. The one they thoughtfully placed me in looked out on pine trees, so I was surrounded by green even though the spring leaves haven't come in yet. If your travel party has one who likes camping and one who prefers hotels, this would be a lovely in-between with the best of both. Utterly comfortable, completely relaxing."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Highly recommend staying here! The use of the space in the cabin has clearly been thought through.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great getaway for my husbands birthday. The night we were going to make s’mores it rained but it was so beautiful that we didn’t even care. Will definitely be back. Beautiful waking trails, so peaceful amenities a great way to disconnect for a couple days. Thank you Getaway for a great getaway!!!!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Honestly, such such a great stay!! Such a cool location, I was impressed by them having everything we would need for the weekend. Perfect experience, not much more to say."

2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great experience and such a beautiful space!
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We had a wonderful stay! The bed was comfy, the cabin was cozy, and the kitchenette had everything that we needed for low maintenance meals. My daughter is 5 and I am trying to slowly introduce her to camping. She is nervous about animals and bugs, so this cabin felt like the perfect place for her to experience nature while also feeling safe and secure. The price felt just right considering all of the amenities. We will come again!"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The Getaway was a dream cabin! It was just as the pictures showed, the view through the giant glass window was gorgeous and it was so well maintained that it really felt like I was directly looking into the woods and the sky! The hosts were also prompt with all the instructions and I especially loved the s'mores kit with vegan marshmallows which I thought was very thoughtful. We had all the supplies required for amateurs to start a campfire and we had an overall lovely experience. Would definitely recommend to my friends and family :)"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We loved our stay there. It was relaxing and peaceful. The cabin was amazing, so clean and welcoming. Absolutely no complaints, we loved our stay."

2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Very nice stay, enjoyed every minute !"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Into the Forest I go,to lose my mind and find my soul... If you want to chillax and enjoy nature,whilst still keeping the creature comforts close at hand, then this is the ideal spot... If you're looking for a quiet getaway... This is it... Would recommend and will hopefully revisit again... Still more to explore 🤗"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Stayed two night traveling through with two small infants under the age of 2 very peaceful, private, and relaxing."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Bring enough water to drink and prepare your food with, the water is stinky up there. The cabin is exactly as described, the map sent before hand was helpful. Nearest gas station was like 3 miles away, the water got really hot for us, the heat works so good! I wish the comforter and pillows were of better quality, the bed has a dense memory foam feel. We had good cell service. The fire pit was easy to use. The pan had dried up, old food and grease, I lost some trust in the housekeeping, cleaned all dishes we used before using them to cook with and eat with. Easy check in and check out."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Very nice place with great amentities. Plus they allow the pooch to come along and enjoy the surrounding woods. Bonfire and share the smores with your loved one and pooch. They provide smore doggie treats!
Its a peaceful place to unwind, calm the mind, and escape the cyber world. Kudos to the owners and Thank you."

They have just what you need! campfire kit, entertainment (books and radio/bt speaker), cooking utensils, basic cooking items(olive oil, black pepper, salt), and some warm drinks ( pour over coffee, hot coco, and tea). We loved our stay and are so open to coming back again for a weekend."

2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"I went with my husband and our dog and honestly I don't know which one of us loved it the most. We brought travel-friendly food to heat up, made a fire, roasted s'mores, walked the trail, and had just the best time despite it being January in Michigan. We can't wait to go again in the summer!"
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,An amazing place to visit during the winter months! Our tiny home/cabin was perfectly located to have a peaceful time away and go do things in nearby towns when we wanted to. When we got into our cabin they had s’more kits for us and bowls towels poop bags and treats for our dog! We had campfire and snowshoes the trails they have there. Everything was also super clean and we had everything we needed for the week to cook supplies there for us! I would definitely book here again and we’ve already recommended it to a bunch of family and friends!!

2024-01-01,4.0,Stayed one night,The Getaway was really Cozy perfect place to get away. Unfortunately our stay was cut short due to power outage. Airbnb support and host helpful with a refund.

It was only about 40 minutes drive to either cities, and we loved having a quiet cabin to come back to at the end of the day. The cabin was very clean, comfortable, and had all the amenities we needed. Everything was very modern and updated, and you can tell the host really put care into making this place pleasant and unique. We would stay here again!"
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I loved every second, it wasn't too far from
home yet i felt like i was no where near it! You cannot hear the road from the cabin we were put in. My boyfriend and I walked the nature trails and they're such a perfect length, not too far, yet not too short. Our cabin went along the Flint River, it was so beautiful. We had a fire each night we stayed; they supplied a campfire kit as well! I will definitely be coming back."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"This was absolutely fantastic! They also accommodated the dog so well! Provided bowls, spare towels, poop bags, and even treats for our furry guest! I would stay here again in a heart beat!"
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We loved the little cabin and the area we will definitely be back
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Perfect little getaway!

2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Second time staying at The Getaway, and it was another wonderful experience. Recommend this place!"
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Cute and private. Away from the hustle and bustle of life. Beautiful views. Clean and accurate description.
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The Getaway was an experience that I’m glad I went through with! It’s a very quiet community, and i love how deep in the woods it was! Waking up with the picture window was one of my favorite moments— extremely serene and beautiful.
The Claudia Cabin was the perfect size for two. The heating/ac controls were easy to navigate, the bed was potentially the most comfortable bed I’ve slept on in my life!
I will say, there wasn’t a single con staying at The Getaway. A very beautiful, much needed experience. If you’re looking to get away from the city for a night or two and reconnect with nature, this is the place! They even have a phone lockbox so you can reconnect with your loved ones and nature without any distractions (a personal favorite part).
Thank you for hosting us! ❤️"
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful. Fabulous. Private. Comfortable.
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,excellent and cozy weekend away!
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Amazing. Nature right outside your window. Nothing beats stepping outside and hearing birds first thing in the morning. Fire pit to use, if the weather permits. Was only able to stay for one night, wish it could have been longer."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Was a beautiful stay a great two days away - had a very pleasant experience reconnecting with my bride of 6 years. The window was the game changer it was like a view to peace and tranquility. Impeccable taste and accommodations makes the experience one that we would to come back to. Thank you again for the Getaway!
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The tiny house was perfect for a short getaway for 2! Everything was clean and tidy. Check in and check out were both easy and smooth.

2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The place was amazing! exactly what we were looking for, for our babymoon. Very secluded and private we will defiantly be returning."

2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Perfect weekend stay. The cabin had everything we needed and the surrounding neighborhood was quiet and walkable. Loved it here!
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very relaxing stay. We would definitely go again!
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,good get away
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Loved this tiny cabin. The huge window made it feel like we were in the wilderness and it had everything we needed. Perfect for travelling couples looking for peace and quiet. 40 mins from Frankenmuth and Birch Rub made it a great place to stay and take day trips around Michigan. Thanks for the great stay!
2023-11-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"My husband and I decided on a cabin for our 22nd anniversary while doing things semi locally. What you see in the pictures is what you get. We only used this as a private place during our stay in the area to wind down and sleep at night, we didn’t stay in the cabin much we were out and about all day. 11am checkout is a good time we didn’t feel rushed to get out in the morning. There is a nice outdoor area we didn’t use but would be great for a warmer time of the year unless you’re one of the people that like bonfires in the winter. Bed is very comfortable and you have good control of the heat.
Coffee being available was nice. Only things I’d take if I was to stay again would be my own coffee pot (because I’m not coordinated very well in the morning to slow poor water), and a larger mirror. It was a little difficult to get ready for our anniversary dinner trying to do my hair and make up with a shaving mirror."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,my favorite airbnb stay so far. cozy feel cabin with beautiful trees wrapped around. everything looked clean/new! coming back asap :D
2023-11-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Perfect for a weekend away! We enjoyed our peaceful stay and will definitely be back!
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"I loved my stay at this tiny home by getaway. It was well provisioned and comfortable. The walking trails were lovely and my two little dogs enjoyed their stay as well. One thing to note, there is no oven, just a stove top. It was not a problem for me, but I had to make adjustments to the food I was going to prepare for myself. Perfect spot for a person or couple wanting to disconnect from the world."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"A very relaxing and necessary natural experience to get out of the routine, a beautiful place worth visiting and enjoying as a couple."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Such a great place to spend your holiday!
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Such a great place! Cannot get enough!
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We had a very peaceful getaway! Highly recommend this if you want to unplug and reconnect with each other.
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Peaceful!
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We really loved the place. Pretty views, total peace, and serenity. Private and quiet. Our dog loved it as well. We fully intend to book this place again!"
2023-11-01,4.0,Stayed one night,Great little getaway for a weekend or night out!
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This place is amazing! It was so cute and quiet and private! Such a great concept! I’m definitely booking again! It was perfect!
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Absolutely loved the environment! the space was adorable! Amenities were misleading in that they were additional charges, and will be better prepared next time for outdoor cooking and having a hair dryer! Otherwise I was completely thrilled with the experience."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Quiet, very peaceful and private"
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Hands down, the best Airbnb I’ve ever stayed at for my own tastes. City Airbnb’s are unique for their own reasons, but nothing beats the peacefulness of nature’s own at Getaway. The small cabins with larger than life views are chalked full of mini amenities giving you just enough creature comforts to survive the wilderness. Check it for yourself, go ahead, Getaway!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Perfect little cabin getaway. We loved it and would definitely go back. Full of thoughtful details and amenities.
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"This was my first time staying at a getaway cabin and it was so much fun! It's a gorgeous space in a cute little neighborhood of similar cabins where there are some short trails to walk on. Cell service was spotty (which is what they advertised as a benefit for ""getting away"") but Verizon still seemed to work okay out here depending on your spot. The amenities seem very well thought out!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Such a great spot! Extremely clean and very private. My only drawback was that the firewood said it was complimentary in the posting but the card in the cabin said it was for a fee so if someone didn’t have internet to look at the posting they may have been confused.
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is a great getaway for you & a plus one! Very peaceful, I had no complaints & I’d do it again."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great stay!
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I can’t say enough great things! All communication was thorough and friendly, the cabin had a super easy check-in and was very clean and tidy, and it was absolutely stunning. If you’re looking to truly unplug and enjoy some peace and beautiful quiet, book it. Now. Hope to return someday!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This was a first for me and it changed my mind totally on what an amazing experience this place offers. I will be back again and again as often as possible
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,The cabin was clean and comfortable and felt very private. The nature path is beautiful.
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Such an amazing place ! So peaceful & relaxing with all amenities right there. Every little detail was thought of.
Would highly recommend & will definitely be ! Very good spot to go for a romantic getaway as well.
Service was also fantastic and prompt replies to any questions."
2023-10-01,2.0,Stayed a few nights,You gotta be careful there is firewood for sale but the price was kind of hidden we almost used the wood thinking it was included
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Our stay at Getaway was wonderful. It was exactly what we were looking for. The place was really nicely maintained and very clean when we arrived. The space and amenities were exellently thoughtout. There wasn't anything we felt like we were missing during our stay. It should be noted though that while we were aware the space would be small (tiny home) when we arrived we found it to be smaller than expected, which wouldn't have been an issue if we hadn't brought our large dog along with us. That being said though, they welcomed us with dog bowls, dog treats, and an extra long lead attached to the picnic table just outside our door. Our pup absolutely loved his time getting to explore the woods and surrounding nature. One additional note, the firewood they provide is an extra charge and we could not find any posting of how much it cost so we will have to wait for our final bill to find out, which is a bit annoying."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We highly recommend this spot! it was cozy, peaceful and in an absolutely beautiful location. Our only regret is that we were only there one night and wished it had been longer. we definitely will book again.....thisnwas the perfect place to relax and unwind."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Super cute tiny cabin with amazing views of the woods! Would definitely stay here again.
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Amazing me and my boyfriend had a great trip together!
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Better than expected experience! Would absolutely book again! Perfect fall/winter get away.
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Our Michigan getaway was exactly what we needed to unplug before our wedding on 10-8-23. We put our phones in the lockbox the entire weekend and totally unplugged! We enjoyed cooking over the fire and relaxing all day Saturday. Our dog, Jax, loved his trip too! We loved the extra special touches that getaway provided for our boy. Thank you for the food/water bowls, treats and doggie waste bags.
Beautiful and peaceful is an understatement! We loved our time away and we will definitely find another getaway again!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We will be back ‼️perfect get away for you and your man /woman,very peaceful and quiet it has a beautiful surrounding you’ll love it if you love nature"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The cabin was beautifully situated in the woods! We did have neighbours but did not hear anything from them. The foliage gives perfect privacy and we did not feel a need to keep the windows curtained. Stocked with all of the essentials you’d need for a weekend. One thing we found difficult was finding the cabin at first because we came at night and there is virtually no lighting, very steep gravel roads, and minimal signage to provide direction to your cabin’s location. We could have used extra sets of towels / cloths as well.
Overall, the cabin was the perfect space to unwind and enjoy nature for a weekend getaway!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My husband and I chose the Getaway for our 9th Wedding Anniversary and we are so glad we did! It was less than 45 minutes from Frankenmuth (Michigan's Little Bavaria), but it gave us that tiny house in the woods peace that we were also looking for! We were beyond impressed with all the little details which made the tiny house ""cabin"" so comfortable to stay in. The picture window made our mornings so romantic and relaxing. There is everything you need in the little kitchen and the whole place is very clean/organized with well thought out spaces for your personal belongings to be tucked away. The teapot spout is perfect for the nifty pourover coffee packets! The rechargeable lantern by the door was such a fun and useful touch! The adjustable lighting was spot on too! This place exceeded our expectations and gave us a very memorable anniversary experience!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The Getaway was a beautiful, cozy place to stay for a few days. The cabin was clean and had everything I needed. The hosts responded to questions quickly. The area is gorgeous with a lot of hiking trails nearby. I would definitely recommend The Getaway to anyone looking to unplug for a bit. I hope to return for another stay."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful setting with every attention to detail considered. Walking paths and walkable open woods for exploring nature was an unexpected experiential treat. Well-marked paths and unit numbers with bright contrast signage by the day and reflective at night made legibility seamless. Even though the secluded and rural wooded setting was among the wildlife, insects, and yeti scat, it felt completely safe. Go ahead, Getaway! :D"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,My friend and I really enjoyed our stay! Exceeded our expectations and was the perfect getaway. The surrounding town was enjoyable to explore as well! Will definitely be back soon 😊
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Amazing stay for my husband and I. We were able to disconnect and reconnect. Will DEFINITELY rebook. The weather and cabin was perfect for a quick weekend getaway!
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Cute place, looks just like the photos. Clean and has everything you need for a weekend trip! Would go back again."

2024-01-01,5.0,Group trip,"We recently had the pleasure of staying at this peaceful, stylish, and charmingly private house rental. The tranquil atmosphere provided a perfect escape from the hustle and bustle of everyday life. The tasteful decor and thoughtful amenities added a touch of luxury to the experience. From the cozy bedrooms to the serene outdoor spaces, every detail was carefully considered. The privacy of the property allowed for a truly relaxing getaway, making it an ideal choice for those seeking a tranquil retreat. I highly recommend this rental for anyone looking to unwind in a stylish and secluded setting."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"The best air bnb I’ve stayed at! The host had everything guests could need and it was perfect for our family gathering. My two year old especially loved the little nursery that was both perfect for sleeping but also had toys she could play with.
Loved that it was 15 min from Frankenmuth and the host went above and beyond to decorate for Christmas. I would definitely stay again!"
2023-12-01,5.0,Group trip,"We could not have asked for anything better. Had a girls weekend away before Christmas and we felt right at home as soon as we walked in. Not only was the place clean and well prepared, but decked out in Christmas as well, so inviting and cozy! The location is peaceful and beautiful and only minutes from Frankenmuth. We had a lovely stay!"
2023-12-01,5.0,Group trip,"This place was so much more than what we could have hoped for. From the time we walked in the house was spotless. They had it decorated for Christmas which all of us absolutely loved. They have so many different kitchen items that you don’t think of but are all useful. It was nice to have a big table to sit at and place card games and board games. It was an easy drive into Frankenmuth and it was an hour and half from Detroit where we went to the Henry Ford Museum. It’s a small town and it’s on a very quiet street. The yard would be great during warm months. The hosts were great and easy to get in contact with. They also a lot of personal items and even some extra Motrin and such for tenants. Have truly thought of everything.
It was honestly perfect. If I had to say one thing, and this is reaching. The upstairs living room couch gave us a few issues. It’s set up in different sections that are just sitting next to each other. BUT there is additional seating downstairs."
2023-12-01,5.0,Group trip,Great Place! Lots of room. Very clean & Stocked. Lynette made you feel welcome & very attentive to your needs. Highly recommended & Definitely returning.
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Our host welcomed us with holiday music as we walked in the door and even made sure she turned the lights on as we arrived a bit later.
3 year old niece called it the cozy house!
Wonderful family weekend, the home was perfect we will most definitely be back!
Thank you!!"
2023-11-01,5.0,Group trip,We have an annual ladies girls trip - decided to visit Frankenmuth and this place was perfect and close our visits of places we had in mind

2023-10-01,5.0,Group trip,"Lynette’s place is everything that it promised. We traveled from South Carolina, Texas and Florida for a local wedding. It was the perfect place for us to come together and relax after busy days filled with wedding activities. The house was immaculate, had everything we would need and plus some. There was nothing lacking. Thank you for your hospitality Lynette."
2023-10-01,5.0,Group trip,"We booked this Airbnb 6-months in advance for our annual family getaway & Lynette was great to quickly answer any questions that I had along the way.
This is one amazing Airbnb. I can’t begin to describe all it has to offer. Lynette & Angie have far exceeded any expectations & are the nicest people to work with.
The house is spacious, beautifully & uniquely decorated, stocked with everything you could ask for & so much more.
The layout was perfect for our needs. Our 4 adult grandkids loved the downstairs apartment as their sleeping & hangout space. It was fantastic that everyone was able to have there own bedroom & TV!
The upstairs provided seating for all 10 of us & the dining room table gave us plenty of space to play our board games. The 2 outdoor areas had plenty of comfy seating for 10, along with a firepit & grill.
This is definitely a place we will be back to in the future.
Thanks again Lynette & Angie…you are the BEST!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Group trip,"This home was wonderful. It was cozy, warm, and we felt right at home. The home was very very clean. Lynnette thought of every amenity you could think of to stock there. From shampoo and conditioner, blow dryers, laundry detergent, the list goes on."

2023-09-01,5.0,Group trip,"Just as described, very comfortable beds, well stocked kitchen/bathrooms, nice outdoor space and plenty of seats around the tables to eat. We were very impressed with this home."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Beautifully decorated and exceedingly comfortable home with everything one could possibly need. Located 10 miles south of Frankenmuth this large but cozy listing is actually 2 complete units both well appointed and stocked with all sorts of goodies. Also includes a well stocked library for any readers out there. Appliances are all high end and functional. Just delightful!
2023-09-01,5.0,Group trip,"House is very nice and close to Frankenmuth and Bronners. Lots of bedrooms, with a full basement that allowed us to spread out."
2023-08-01,5.0,Group trip,One of best places we stayed for vacation. House was clean and had everything we needed.

2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This home is just as described on the listing. We have a large family and there was room for everyone plus a little extra. We all loved sitting on the back deck watching the deer in the field. Very peaceful surroundings but if you want some fun stuff to do Frankenmuth is 15 minutes away. The house was super clean and beautiful inside. Plenty of seating for everyone to accommodate our large family. Three full baths and a half bath made showering a breeze for everyone. The beds are extremely comfortable. Lynette supplied plenty of extras in the house just in case you forgot something. This is definitely a place we plan to return to.
Plenty of golf courses to choose from which the guys enjoyed. We went ziplining one morning which was a blast. We spent a few hours at Birch run doing some shopping.
We went to Billy's bar and grill one night which was very good I would recommend it.
Saying Lynette is a super host doesn't give her enough credit! Thank you !"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Was a wonderful place to stay! After long hit days at Frankenmuth it was nice to gather with family and play games
2023-07-01,5.0,Group trip,We loved the house as it had plenty of beds to choose from for everyone. It felt just like being in a hotel. The location was nice as there was no neighbor on one side and a tree line separated the house from the one next door. Grocery store and some fast food places were within 5-7 miles and downtown Frankenmuth was only 15 minutes away. We had a wonderful time and would recommend it to anyone.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We had a great stay at Lynnette’s. The house was extremely spacious for nine of us and came fully equipped. Lynnette was super responsive and very friendly. We would definitely stay again!
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Wonderful place, beautiful surroundings, exceptional host, abundance of supplies, great location and very spacious! We hope to return someday to stay! The Alexa was an added bonus!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,My family loved our stay! Lynette responded in less than 10 minutes the few times I needed to contact her. The house had tons of space - everyone had their own bedroom and bathroom. It also had everything you could need for a comfortable stay. We spent lots of time on the back porch enjoying the beautiful scenery of northern MI. Short drive to many wonderful towns with lots to do.
2023-06-01,5.0,Group trip,"Quiet side road but close to Clio and restaurants, shops etc.
Lots of sleeping space and room to spread out.
Well appointed kitchen.
Bathrooms plentiful.
Perfect for large gatherings.
Too much space of only for a couple."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,This home is very beautifully decorated with so many extras. I can’t think of a single thing to complain about. It was a perfect stay.
2023-06-01,5.0,Group trip,"Fantastic house. Perfect for large families.
Perfect host, house stocked with every essential. Best bnb, ever rented.
Perfect, does not describe !!!!!!

2023-05-01,5.0,Group trip,The house was beautiful and easily accomodated our entire group. It was a treat to stay here.
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Great clean place would
Definitely book again"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"This location was simply amazing. I don’t think we wanted to leave. Everything was perfect, with several personal touches that made it feel like our home away from home. Absolutely loved the upstairs/downstairs living spaces. When next in this area, I will be checking this location first for availability."
2023-04-01,5.0,Group trip,"I told the host she must be the greatest host in Airbnb history. Absolutely can’t say enough good things about the house, host or experience."
2023-03-01,5.0,Group trip,"The space worked perfectly for us—plenty of room for two married couples plus a handful of teens/young adults to both spread out as well as spend time together. Everything was very clean as well—we would definitely recommend to any large
groups visiting the area!"
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Absolutely loved the nursery in the master bedroom walk in closet for our 4 month old. Great selection of board games for the teenagers and adults. Plenty of technology between the T.V.'s and an Alexa
2023-01-01,5.0,Group trip,The Host was amazing. Very responsive and very nice. The house is wonderful. Felt like at home. We enjoyed the house very much.
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"The term superhost doesn’t even begin to describe the level of accommodation we received staying at this property. Lynnette went above and beyond in every single way. The house is expertly appointed, beautifully decorated for Christmas and beyond comfortable and cozy, made for an amazing holiday vacation. During our stay, a winter storm moved in and upon waking up someone was already dispatched to clear the driveway. As well, another issue arose and someone was there in 30 minutes to assist us. Truly 5 star experience all around!
Communication was excellent and everything we could imagine was provided for our stay. The house was extremely clean and comfortable and the views of the wide open fields with snow falling down was so peaceful. We couldn’t recommend the property or the host any higher!
And if you have a large family, this house is perfect as there are many bedrooms upstairs and downstairs.
We are already planning and eagerly anticipating staying here again!"
2022-12-01,5.0,Group trip,A very beautiful home! The host was so nice! Very nicely decorated. So homey.
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We absolutely loved Lynnette and Angie's place. It was super clean, warm and inviting which made us feel right at home. We were in town for a funeral, heartbroken and exhausted. It was refreshing to find a note of comfort from Lynnette and Angie in addition to a wonderful array of gifts - fruits, chocolates, cookies and a cheese and meat tray. Perfect for a 2AM arrival after a long day of driving and not eating properly. A great location with ample parking. Highly recommend!"
2022-12-01,5.0,Group trip,"This home is absolutely beautiful! The Christmas tree is gorgeous! My In-laws are in their 80's and have never experienced anything like this! My Mother In-law said this a mansion! The finished basement makes for 2 separate living areas! We were 10-15 minutes from everything! We came ro visit Frankenmuth, but ended up spending most of our time in the house watching movies. So peaceful and serene! Lynnette was very hospitable. She did mention she is going to do new countertops in the kitchen and working on a couple of the bathrooms! I dont know how she could make this better! Can't wait to see! We are already thinking we will be back for summer fun!"
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This beautiful home was way more than we excepted!! It was stunning!! Lots of room for everyone to spread out and not be on top of each other, although there was only a few of us. Owner was extremely responsive and left a note and welcome gift!! Everything was stocked well from the kitchen to bathrooms. Medicine cabinet had extras i case you forgot something, kitchen had spices and other things to save money like A-1, mayo, ketchup, mustard. We will definitely be back!"
2022-11-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,The property was clean and cute inside. My favorite was the kitchen and dining area. Nicer weather will permit guests to use the lovely patio. Our host is relatively new to Airbnb’s so she’s learning along the way too. Communication was excellent. Check in super easy. 12-15 minutes from Frankenmuth which is why we chose this home.
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"Everything was outstanding. The host was attentive, and very easy to reach if there was any issues. The house was immaculate. Close to lots of things. Super roomy location I would definitely recommend this Airbnb."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"peaceful area and beautiful surroundings, overall a great place to stay!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place was stunning!!! Had everything we could need and loved the privacy, Chad was also very friendly and greeted us when we got there. Overall would definitely visit again in the future, amazing place."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"A safe and scenic spot to spend my first time in Flint! Chad is a fantastic host and community leader, who took great care in restoring this historically significant Mott Park house. The space is a small area over the garage--with a bathroom that only fits a tub...but so long as you don't have mobility issues then you can enjoy the novelty of a bath. If your space needs are modest, then this is one of those novel AirBnB stays you will remember fondly!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Highly recommend Chad’s place for other airbnbers. The park is beautiful and Chad is a very responsive host and extremely helpful if needed.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"I stayed at Chads place for 3 nights while visiting family in the area. I prefer quiet places, and this provided the perfect quiet retreat to come home too. The space has lots of windows to open for fresh air and the mattress is comfortable. The Ac/hear unit is also super quiet which I appreciated. I felt safe walking around the local blocks and the park across the street. Would stay again!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"This is a lovely,cozy space in an historic house. The neighborhood is beautiful. There's a park directly across the street, and it is close to other places of interest. The host is very congenial and responsive. We couldn't have asked for a nicer place."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Exactly as pictured and described. Chad was very pleasant and quick to respond to questions.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Always a great stay at Chad’s I’m pretty much a regular at this point and highly recommend. Great value and experiences
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Chad was super responsive when we had any issues. I felt at home the entire time I was there. It was one of the cleanest places I have stayed. I am definitely planning to stay here again. It was exactly what we needed.
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Chad’s place was serene and nostalgic. He was a very kind host and welcoming person. As a Flint native I’d 10/10 recommend 100% !
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Absolutely a beautiful little place to stay when in Flint. Felt safe and at home. Thankful he allows pets, and would be very happy to stay again next year."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Always a great stay at Chad’s!
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The stay was great, Chad was a lad👌🏼."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Lovely place to stay in Flint!
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,Absolutely perfect!
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Finding the carriage house loft was a Godsend. Upon walking up the stairs and opening the French doors, my first thought was “I could live here forever.”
It is so quaint and cute and neat (i.e., not a bit cluttered). Being situated across from a lovely park and disc golf course provided plenty of green space to enjoy.
It was conveniently located for me to visit my sister in the hospital, and close to a nice church, both within walking distance. And, it’s just a short drive from stores and restaurants.
Chad is a wonderfully welcoming and responsive host! I will definitely be returning, sooner than later, as I have family in the area. Thank you, Chad, for welcoming me home!"
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Always a great stay at Chad’s place. I’ll be returning multiple times this year because it’s so nice!
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"It was exactly as described! So cute! The neighborhood was lovely and felt very safe. We were walking our dog late at night in the surrounding parks without hesitation. Very pet friendly accommodation. Loved that the Airbnb was separate from the main house… we didn’t have to worry if our dog was crying in his crate while we were out, we weren’t disturbing anyone. So much parkland nearby! We made use of the air mattress, myself and dog in the double bed and my husband on the air mattress. Not a romantic getaway but a wonderful clean safe and inexpensive stay. Will definitely stay again!"
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Chad, was really kind. He cared and looked after if I needed anything. He kept the driveway clean after a snowstorm. Thank you."
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We loved staying here! Chad is wonderful and super responsive.
It's a cozy studio apartment with lots of natural light. I loved the kitchen setup—we cooked up a storm and cozied up to several cups of tea. I personally loved the smaller claw foot tub, and my 6’4” partner didn't seem to mind it either.
I was on a deadline with work while we were there, so I spent most of my time working at the table during the day and most of every evening. I didn't once start feeling that “cabin fever” vibe while I was cooped up, plugging away at my computer. Walks around the neighborhood were also beautiful and enjoyable. I regret not taking advantage of the community snow sled bin down the street.
I would stay here again in a heartbeat if my travels ever take me back to Flint. Thanks again, Chad!!"
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Chad's place was welcoming, exactly as pictured and a perfect space to escape to"
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My husband and I stayed here for two nights over New Years, and we couldn't have asked for a nicer place. It was so cute and cozy, clean, and perfectly met our needs. The building is old so it was drafty and the floors were always cold, but the heater does a good job of warming it up and there were extra blankets so we weren't cold at all at night. We had access to an oven, stove, microwave, sink, fridge, and clean dishes, which made us feel right at home and comfortable. Chad was an amazing host - very responsive and helpful - and we would definitely come here again if staying in the area!"
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"It was my second time staying here and just like last time, I loved it!"
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We had a really great stay. I enjoyed how private it felt and the entire area is surrounded by a local park. Very clean and just the right amount of space for a comfortable stay. We slept well on the comfy bed. I didn’t directly meet the hosts in person as we were really only around at night during our stay. However, they were very friendly in our communication through the app and we felt very welcome."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Such a cute place! Chad was super nice & easy to reach. Definitely would stay again!
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"This space is so charming, comfortably appointed, and has the benefit of not sharing any walls so there's no worries about a playful pup with a squeaky toy. I, for one, am a huge fan of the European tub setup. Chad also provided a great pamphlet of local recommendations."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,A very cozy and comfortable place to stay. Chad is very hospitable and keeps the place in great condition. Would stay again.
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,cute and quaint in a convenient location. very quiet and peaceful.
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,This is the second time I have stayed with Chad and it was great. Super clean and has everything you could need. Chad is friendly and a great host.
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Another great stay at Chads place. Thanks so much!
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Chad’s place is very comfortable and private. Chad is a exceptional host and goes out of his way to accommodate guest! Thanks Chad! You are much appreciated!
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Always a great stay at Chad’s. I try to snatch this Airbnb up any time it’s available and I’m in the area
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Was first choice when i had to travel to flint again. I stayed with chad last year , and well he goes above and beyond what can be expected from most . Easy to speak with , accommodation with a smile . Will always stay here when in Flint"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,A cute little spot in beautiful setting! the nearby park and the history of the place were highlights for me.
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Loved staying here and would definitely recommend to others!
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,We loved this little loft. So full of character and had everything we needed for our stay. Very peaceful and comfortable. Thank you!
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The room was very comfortable and nice. The climate was wonderful, the place very clean, and everything worked as advertised. It did take me a bit to figure out the heating unit but once I got it I was very comfortable. Even though it's right next to the main house I always felt like it was my own space. A very nice place to retreat."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,10 out of 10 💯🤗
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I really enjoyed my stay, I couldn’t complain about anything at all. It was what I needed really peaceful place. I would stay here again"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I spent 4 nights here & had everything I needed. Chad was proactive about checking in once I arrived to make sure supplies & amenities had all been restocked, and I enjoyed the privacy & convenience of having my own space in the carriage house while knowing the host was right next door."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"pretty good, can't complain"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"As always, phenominal!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We really enjoyed staying in the loft. It was cozy and comfortable and had everything we needed. It was perfectly located for all the things we did on our long weekend trip - especially for the Renaissance festival. Chad goes above and beyond to stock the space with all the necessaries and we didn’t need to ask for anything. Would absolutely love to stay again.
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Chad was absolutely amazing! We were able to check in hours earlier than expected which was perfect for us. We felt right at home in the room and it was great we were able to bring our kitties. I highly recommend renting this space if you can. The price is unbelievable compared to the hotels around the area and you’ll have your own little space instead of hotel life. The surroundings are beautiful. Thank you so much again for having us Chad!
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Such a cute and beautiful place. The carriage house is exactly as described, Chad and his wife were super nice and friendly, and gave a lot of options for places to see/eat/things to do. The park across the street was a huge highlight and was a great place to walk my dogs. I would highly recommend staying here."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was the second time we've stayed at Chad's place. It's in a really nice area of Flint, very quiet and walkable. Chad is friendly and very responsive. We enjoyed out time here."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Loved the place. Nice mellow neighborhood and easy access. Zero issues. The one thing I didn’t maybe ready the description well enough is there’s not a shower, just a tub with a handheld shower head. I hadn’t taken a bath in decades - ha ha. Just took a little getting used to, but as long as you’re ok with that, I highly recommend this place."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Chad was an excellent host! The house was clean, the big beautiful yard was very well kept, everything as described, plus pet friendly. We’ll stay there again!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,I’ve stayed at Chad’s place multiple times and it’s always a great stay. Dog friendly and perfect since there’s a park directly across the street. Chad is always responsive with any issues or questions you have. Can’t wait to stay here again
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"The loft was cozy and quiet. With cat greenspace next door, it couldn't have been nicer. And, very close to excellent restaurants! Absolutely recommend."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Perfect place for a private getaway. Chad was quick to respond, even though he was out of town. The farmer's market was amazing...tons to do and with beautiful walking trails. Definitely would stay again. We felt right at home...so much, that we baked a loaf of blueberry in the evening. We'll be back!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Amazing value for the price! It may be priced low due to the lack of shower, but the tub is nice for a soak and equipped with a handheld shower head. Everything you need is there: coffee, French press in two sizes, a cute wall hanging with directions for the French press and was even some wine! Chad gave perfect directions and made access very easy. There was a ton of information about local restaurants and activities. The property is beautiful and located in a lovely, safe, quiet, residential area of Flint. As noted in the name of the unit, it is adjacent to a park with a disc golf course with great reviews. For location, amenities, ease of access and value, this is a real gem! One last thing: I left an earring behind and the host found it and will mail it to me. That is service ""above and beyond"" in my book!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"As always, a phenomenal experience!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Chad was a very responsive host and his place was exactly what we were looking for during our stay in MI!
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Of course their house is on the same plot of land but you get your own area loft (not connected to the house). It was very tidy and Chad was a wonderful host, very cute and friendly dog as well :) (please make sure the loft is tidy before you leave, they dont deserve to have to clean up a huge mess lol)"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We had an excellent stay at Chad’s place! For two adults and a dog, it was the perfect size. Not only did it have everything we needed, but it was extremely clean, cute + cozy, and in a quiet neighborhood. We would absolutely stay here again!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"I've stayed at Chad's place many times now, and will be back!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"I'm familiar with the neighborhood and knew this was a great spot after receiving the address. It felt cozy and private, was on a beautiful property, had all the basics, was clean, and was very convenient."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,Chad was a great host. He was available when I had questions but otherwise not intrusive even though he and his family are next door. His family were lovely and the room was every bit as charming as I hoped it would be. I picked his b&b because of its location-near to my family and close to a public park for walking my dog daily. But staying at a historic property (1926) with a considerate host was an added benefit. I would recommend this b&b to anyone wanting to stay in Flint.
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Amazing stay!!
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,I always enjoy staying at Chad's s place!

2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,I had a wonderful stay at Chad’s apartment. It has everything g you need for a really comfortable stay and it is so cute! I only wish I had learned about it earlier. I’m moving out of state but would love to stay there again!

2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"A wonderful little place in a quiet, safe and beautiful neighbourhood. Directly across from a park and huge green space.
The space was exactly as advertised and check-in was easy as clear instructions were provided well ahead of arrival.
Interesting history of the place. It was built by the man hired to build homes for GM employees in the 1930s.
Chad was a great host and super friendly."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Nice little spot in a historic neighborhood. I loved how it has a big park on two sides, and enjoyed seeing the bright orange sunset over the park. Space was nice and clean. It's compact, like a studio apartment, and was enough space to work remotely and serve as my home base for a couple days. Easy five minute drive to Downtown Flint. Chad was friendly, responsive, and kind. I followed his local recommendations and ended up getting a salad the size of my head at Dom's Diner. Would stay here again!"
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was the perfect place for our short visit to the area. A wonderful example of all that is good about an Air BNB.

2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Chad’s place was perfect for a quick weekend in MI to see friends. He welcomed our dogs which was nice so we didn’t have to board them for the weekend.
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Really cozy nook near beautiful Mott Park & close to so much! Chad was super friendly and helpful, totally recommend."
2023-02-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"A cozy little getaway. Great for a writer or someone who is just looking for a piece of peace.
Chad is a beautiful brother, a great host, which in all elevates the quaint / getaway factor of this little spot.
The bed is hard and you must bathe rather than shower, but this makes you slow down and enjoy this cozy little spot.
Tervaris"
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,The cottage house was extremely relaxing and cozy. Safe environment…Chad was extremely responsive and accommodating! I stayed for two weeks and it would be the first place I would look to stay again! ❤️
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"WOW, we loved the space. The price: A day at Chad's is equivalent to a tank of gas nowadays. How is this so affordable!?! We would've stayed the following week if it wasn't booked. Chad let us check in early. What bonus. Friendly, peaceful, and a pleasure."
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My husband and I were so happy with our stay. Chad was so wonderful to work with, and the loft exceeded our expectations! Would highly recommend to any and everyone, we are so grateful we found this hidden gem!"

2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We’ve stayed at Chads a few times now and his hospitality, friendliness, flexibility, and amazing place reminds us why we always go with his adorable Airbnb. He knows the area well and has excellent recommendations, and he and his family really care about the area and the history. The listing is exactly what you see in the pictures if not better super cute every amenity you could need in very safe Chad goes above and beyond and making accommodations in making sure you’re stay is a great one. Thanks again Chad for another fantastic stay!"
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Wonderful place to stay. Private and quaint. Enjoyed the park across the street. Chad had everything ready with bottled water and the AC running for 90+ weather. I liked the pamphlet with recommendations for different places to visit.
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay. very clean and the host Chad is super nice. It's great for me. I stay there because I live up north but work at Bishop Airport. aIt has everything I need. better than renting an apartment

2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is a wonderful and quirky place that is perfect for one or two people, and perhaps even one child. The space is actually pretty roomy, and very well-decorated. Super clean, and it includes a comfort chair. Windows on all 4 sides, so there is lots of light and air coming in. It's a very good value should you need to stay in the area. Chad is an excellent host."
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was one of the best Airbnb’s I’ve ever stayed at. It was so clean, cozy, and unique. We especially enjoyed the small bathtub and the kitchen (which we used to make pizza!). The host communicated very clearly and efficiently throughout our stay. I recommend checking out Totem Books and the For-Mar Arboretum, and the host included a list of other local spots to check out as well!"
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"My husband, 3 year old, and I loved staying here! It’s small, but has a nice bathroom and full kitchen and even a small selection of kids books on the book shelf. We will definitely stay again if we’re in the area!"
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was our second stay at Chad’s place and it was just as comfortable as our first time. Chad is always so attentive and accommodating and this trip was no different.

2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Loved this place! It was local for where I needed to be. It was cozy, clean, and well prepared. Although not shown in photos, it has been updated and has a tv with all the apps for a good night of relaxation."
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very cozy!!
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Chad is an AWESOME host! He is very responsive and goes above and beyond! Definitely a 5 🌟
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Really great set up. Chad was great to deal with and the location was convenient. The room was really clean and comfy
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We highly recommend Chad's Airbnb. Located in the loft of the garage, this wonderful place is situated close to Downtown Flint and provides a perfect place to relax!"
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Cozy, comfortable setting, quiet and conveniently located for access to downtown, colleges, museums and in my case, McLaren Hospital. Nicely decorated , exceptionally clean, patio table for use, (weather permitting) and beautiful yard with mature trees and a park across the road. Very reasonably priced for the value!"
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very clean I have no complaints. Just small but it was only me.
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"2nd time staying at Chad's. Comfy, cozy, private. A lovely property. All the amenities one would want/need.
Chad could ask for a lot more money for this space. Apparently Chad is not greedy. Unlike some hosts who want to charge $100-150 in cleaning fees.
But I digress. I saw Chad helping out a friend of his and I had a few conversations with him. People like Chad make the world go round. I highly recommend this space."
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great accommodations for a short stay while checking out dining and nightlife in the area! Nice quiet neighborhood, but close to the action downtown (We were able to lyft downtown and Uber back on Friday night for about $8 each way). Much cooler than a hotel! I would definitely stay here again."
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Chad is an awesome host. Communication is great. This unit is just what you need for one or two people. The best thing I can say is that this is my second stay. I look forward to staying again soon.
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This place was a great escape from everyday life
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,tiny home size so if you are tall or require shower probably not for you..otherwise it's just as cute as it sounds in ad
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This quaint little loft is perfect for a weekend away if you are going to be near Flint or the surrounding areas. The hosts are incredibly kind and have thought of everything. It was very comfortable and we enjoyed just staying in the room and relaxing in the evenings. The location was perfect and close to everything we needed to get to. Very quiet and lovely little cottage setting.
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"My brother-in-law was actually the guest, and he said that Chad was very nice and responsive and that the accommodations were excellent."
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Amazing place!
2022-03-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Small and cute
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This place is great! I came back and stayed here again while I was in town! Has an apartment feel but in a studio style manner and with character! Parking in the drive way which is a few steps from the entrance door. Quiet nice neighborhood. And again the stove was a plus for me as I like to cook. Give this place a visit! I absolutely recommend.
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,This was the cutest place ever the host is very kind and it’s a nice cozy place for any trip. I definitely recommend booking this one!
2022-03-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Great little place. And Chad was great with communicating anything we might have had an issue with. Great time.
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Chad's place is gorgeous and so cozy! Mott Park is such a cool area. He is very hospitable and you'll have everything you'll need during your stay. I definitely recommend!
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"All great amenities! Truly like a mini apartment done right for a carriage/coach home. Even though it’s compact it quite spacious. Up a flight of stairs to open French doors that lead into the place. Wood floors and even has a nice comfy chair that feels like a couch. Note that it is a historical home and kept the exterior the way it is. Interior will have angled ceilings and the bathroom is like that. There’s a tub (no shower) that’s underneath the angled ceiling. Standing upright if over 4 feet will not happen. But take it for what it’s worth. They made good use of the space and the tub is neat. How about taking a bath instead! There is a shower head attach that able to extend to reach over head. Overall has basic amenities for kitchen that you will need. Loved that there was an oven to use!! There’s a t.v. and a small book shelve for any reading material. They also left a pamphlet with info for any near by restaurants or other things to try out.
I recommend. Good for two people."
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Another great stay at Chad’s place. It’s a quiet cozy place to stay. I’ll definitely be booking again my next time in the area
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The first word that comes to mind when I think about Chad is: thorough. There was nothing he didn’t think of. Even tho the loft is on the small side (it’s a loft), it’s incredibly comfy and Chad made great use of the space. Not only was the loft super cute - with many of the furniture pieces built by Chad himself - it was well-stocked and even featured a full (albeit small) kitchen. We didn’t eat in much but if we had, we could have made anything we wanted as we were equipped with most every standard kitchen tool. And speaking of, I loved the French press and the instructions! I’ve never used one before and never knew how simple and delicious French pressed coffee is! I’ll definitely be adding one to me coffee bar at home. There are two sizable closets in the loft that I didn’t notice when I booked that came in handy for unpacking (I don’t like to live out of bags even when traveling). We had one super small issue during our stay and, even tho it was late, Chad corrected it right away. We lost power the first night and before I even noticed, Chad sent a message to check on us (which is how I even knew about the loss at all). I really can’t say enough about how accommodating Chad was. I absolutely plan to stay here again when I’m in town!"
2022-02-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,This place is very cute very reasonable was good for what I needed to use it for. The owners are very sweet communication was great and the price was very reasonable. The only thing is that it seemed bigger in the pictures it was smaller than expected but still very cute
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,loved the stay here
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place has lots of space only complaint would be that the shower is only a bathtub
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Hidden gem in Flint, beautiful stay, super clean, we will be back!"
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Everything was clean and great instructions on how to operate everything. We loved the location and how close we were to everything.
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"A compact apartment hidden away in its own standalone brick building in a historical neighborhood. It has comfortable furniture. A kitchen with all necessities and a cute little bathroom. The neighborhood stands out in the looks department, there's a big park and walking trails."
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very clean and beautiful. Chad is a wonderful host. Very informative and understanding.
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Great stay. We visited crossroads & went on a train ride while we were there which was a ton of fun. The bathtub is an amazing claw foot tub & is miniature sized but gets the job done. Very clean & hosts were very nice. Loved our stay!
2021-12-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,"Nostalgia is the best way to describe this place. My family stayed for Christmas weekend and we did enjoy our stay. Although the bathtub isn’t plus size friendly, it was our only hiccup. Would definitely stay here again. Great location and great communication from our host."
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great hospitality but not in the way at all!
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Chad is a great communicator and made himself very accessible. Check in was extremely easy and the value was great. Really cozy spot for a short stay :) They provided suggestions for great coffee and things to do in Flint. I was in for an in town wedding but if I had a reason to be in the area I would definitely stay again!
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Awesome! Incredibly clean. Perfect for my needs!
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great place, great value. Chad was an awesome host. He's quick to communicate, and the place was clean and ready to go when we got there. It's cute and quirky, and is good if you need somewhere to stay for a couple nights.
I'll add that the bed could definitely be upgraded, it's far from great. BUT at this price point, it's not something to complain about."
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Exactly as shown; wonderful experience in the historic Mott estate
Highly recommend."
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Chad was a wonderful host. He was quick to respond, kind, and gave us great local recommendations. The value of the Airbnb could not be beat! I loved that we were able to bring our dog and walk him in the beautiful park across the street. We are planning to return on our next trip to Flint and Frankenmuth!"
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great spot in Flint! Clean and cute and Chad will make sure your good!! Thank you!
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place is a small jewel.
Very clean and very simple.
The fresh ground coffee and french press were a very nice perk."
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great location for me and the dogs since there’s a park literally across the street. Chads property is well lit at night which definitely provided added ease at night since you could see everything around you while outdoors. I’d definitely book this place again when in town! Chad is also very responsive and quick if you have questions. Thanks again for a great stay!
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Quaint, small, and very cute, surprisingly private space in a great location, easygoing & communicative host 👍"
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,For some reason the keypad was not working. Ever time we would leave the door wouldn’t close all the way.
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I had a wonderful experience staying at Mott House. Owner, Chad, has answered any questions I had prior to arrival in a very timely manner. The loft was clean, bed and pillows very comfortable. Fully stocked kitchen. The space reminded me of a small studio apt. I asked if I could book two more days and luckily the loft was available. Chad was quite amenable. I highly recommend the Mott House for your business or vacation stay."
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Highly recommend this place! Super cozy and easy to find, plenty enough space for two people, and all in all an extremely relaxing place to get away for a bit. Not to mention absolutely beautiful this time of year!"
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,I had returned to Flint to help a family while their dad was passing that was dear to me when I when to college here. It was exactly what I needed for short amount of time. Highly recommend. Chad was very accomodating and the place was lovely.
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"When I pulled up to the place, I was amazed at how beautiful the area was. Being from Arizona, it was amazing to see so much green! When I walked into the Airbnb, it was one of the cutest places I’ve ever seen! So cozy, and welcoming. It felt like I had my own little apartment for the weekend. Very clean, and had everything I needed. Chad responds very fast and was extremely accommodating. Would love to stay there again!"
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great place. Enjoyed it. No issues!! They are going to mail me something I left, so they’re really helpful :) place is cute and comfortable."
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very nice place for a weekend away. We recommend hiking at For-Mar nature preserve.
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Awesome place- very easy and a great location. The place had everything you would need and Chad is a wonderful host
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Chad was the perfect host: polite, responsive, and attentive to our needs. We loved the carriage house, especially the charming extras (the bouquet, the books, the dining recommendations) and can't wait to return."
2021-08-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Well, this quaint little loft as well as house was the nicest thing about the neighborhood. I only heard three gunshots during my stay. You would definitely want to lock your car and secure any valuables inside as for the type of neighborhood it is as recognized by their air conditioning unit being chained down with a heavy chain and padlock. It is also fair to this is not a one bedroom with two beds as advertised it is more accurately a studio with one double bed and roll out single available in the closet. This is a nice little loft for a quick stay or place to crash would even be perfect in a safer location. Take note of both keypad codes on the app as one of them is inaccurate. Chad is extremely welcoming and friendly with thoughtful touches throughout the loft. Enjoy!!"
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Always a great place to stay.
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great hospitality and very welcoming environment!! Will definitely book again! Highly recommend 😁😁

2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"if you want a feel for what Flint this is a great spot. it's centrally located and a few short minutes from downtown, freeways. everything was as expected.a cozy spot to stay and a good price too! Chad was a great host, would stay again!"
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Chad is a super host.
He is accessible, helpful—made everything extremely easy. And, still this is a little private space, nostalgic — peaceful.
This little carriage house is so lovely—cozy, unique, clean and comfortable. It reminds me of a little Paris mini-garret. Bed, kitchen, armchair and a simple bathroom—European style bath with a tub, cool.
We came to visit family and needed a quiet refuge each night and this was perfect.
Five Stars...plus"
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Chad was a great host, and it was the best first bnb experience we could’ve had. The loft was pretty and kept neat. The location was lovely, quiet, and close to anything you could need. The self check in was nice, and we hated to leave."
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Ideal location, charming spot, great host. Chad has thought of everything- the place was spotless, the kitchen had everything we needed, and the place was adorable. It appears to have been built along with the house, which is so cool! My husband is from Flint, so if we ever need another place to stay, we will definitely stay here again!"
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Perfect spot for a weekend getaway. Close to birch run, frankenmuth, and many fun flint experiences. Clean, comfortable, and exceeded all our expectations. Communication was fantastic. Will most definitely be staying here again!"
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Chad was very personable, and the space was very comfortable and as described. While the bath situation was an adjustment, it was fine for a brief stay.

I'd definitely stay again!"

2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Overall this was genuinely the top of my best stays. She has an exceptional personality and her property matched. From communication to cleanliness, my experience was a cut above my previous stays. The floors and furnishings were immaculate. There was a wide variety of cooking amenities and even nice touches like faux-gold spoons for stirring next to the pod style coffee maker.
There are an abundance of plugs for all the devices in this spacious loft. Just felt like home!
The host included all the need to know information in the communications prior to the check-in. She was available for all questions.
It was truly a pleasure to complete the check-out list.. as you could tell that this quality of stay comes with a beautiful give and take.
Mallory is a 5 star host."

2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Great place to stay! Very convenient for a place to stay that’s also relatively close to the flint airport, outside of the buildings are a little sketchy but the inside of the apartment is beautiful and very up to date. Would definitely stay here again if in the area."
2024-02-01,5.0,Group trip,"Stunning!! Once you’re inside, the place is immaculate. Exactly like the photos. We very much enjoyed the Nespresso machine with all of the syrups, and the beds were very comfortable! I would stay here again in an instant, best Airbnb experience yet!"
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Was a great place to stay, the host was responsive and always answered. The only thing I did not like was I had to park across the street during the night. Not a huge deal, would rather have parked on the side of the building or behind it."
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Would highly recommend!! Don’t let the outside of this place fool you! This home has everything you need!
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We were so impressed by this loft! We had a wedding about 10 min away and were worried we wouldn’t have a place to stay, so this was perfect! Super cute layout, loved the decor and all the space!"

2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The pictures do not do this place justice. It felt like our home away from home! The personal touches to the easy instructions.
We were blown away and would highly recommend staying here! Worth every penny. The people in the community also had amazing things to say about the owners.
Don’t be fooled when you pull up to the place. Once you are upstairs it is like a whole new and beautiful upscale world!"
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Our stay was amazing , check in and booking was so smooth and easy , Mallory’s home was spotless and exactly as the pictures show. We will definitely be booking again. We really enjoyed our stay!"
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We had an incredible stay at Mallory's lovely home! Every detail was perfection, from the spotless rooms to the delightful espresso machine with a variety of flavors. The well-equipped kitchen and thoughtfully chosen decor created an inspired ambiance for our trip. It's truly one of the nicest homes we've experienced.
The location was ideal, with safe parking across the street, a convenient grocery store, and multiple food delivery options nearby. Mallory's hospitality was exceptional, making our stay even more enjoyable. We can't wait to return and experience it all again. Thank you for everything, Mallory!"
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The place was incredibly modern and cozy. Exceeded any expectations and had a ""luxury"" vibe. Mallory leaves great directions, is responsive, and was kind enough to give a ""heads up"" to an event that may have affected parking and travel. Definitely will stay at Mallory's place again when I'm back in the area."

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Mallory’s place was a vacation in itself. Although her place is an apartment, the property is very spacious and clean. The kitchen is well equipped with all utensils and electric equipment - blender, toaster, coffee maker, etc.
The bedrooms were beautifully designed & the couch was very comfortable. Upon check in, Mallory informed me that the WiFi was out but she did what she could to make it right.
The traffic was a lil noisy, but not a big issue. This property was just like the pictures - beautiful.
As long as walking up a small flight of stairs is not an issue, I would recommend this property to anyone.
If ever in the area, I would absolutely stay at Mallory’s place again."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Don't be put off by the location, buildings or entryway to this location. Once inside it is beautiful. Very comfortable place to stay.

I would definitely stay here again."

2023-09-01,5.0,Group trip,"Mallory’s place was above and beyond what we could have expected. I booked the house for my bridal party and i to get ready at the day of my wedding and it was absolutely perfect.

She made it overall an awesome stay and easy process."

Will definitely use this location when we come back!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Book this Airbnb! Don’t question it 🙌 I travel to area often to visit my young adult son. We enjoyed the most comfortable couch and watching movies on the huge TV. The coffee station was my personal favorite along with a pretty cool book collection! Also, the salon directly across the street, The Parlor, is amazing too! If you have time ahead to call and book a service there during your stay, I highly suggest it."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We stayed here for a simple birthday getaway and wanted someplace closeby to Frankenmuth. Only about 20 minutes from Frankenmuth. The apartment is super cute. The neighborhood is not the most up and coming or anything, but the apartment itself made up for that haha. It was exactly like the photos. All the rooms were very nice, and we really loved all of the amenities that were available, especially loved that they had a portable fan in each bedroom! The apartment was so cute, loved the aesthetics. They did an awesome job. The only thing we noticed were couches smelled sooo strong of febreeze or some other spray, it caused a few migraines. Just wanted to note it if others are sensitive to strong smells. Other than that, we loved the space and we would come back. We ate at Roma's pizzeria nearby and it was delicious."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Fantastic rental option! Impeccably clean and appears very recently renovated throughout. Comfortable beds and furniture, a spacious living and dining area, everything you'd want in a kitchen plus a gourmet coffee bar with all the extras for a great coffee or tea. Full laundry room with iron there if you need it. Lovely space! We were in the area for a wedding at The Pine Tree Farm which is just a short drive away."

2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I am one of those guests that thoroughly read reviews prior to booking stays, as I find them very helpful with what to expect. So I had read all the positive reviews of Harold and Michelle's guest suite and I knew this was going to be a nice space, but it was so much nicer than I expected!
The suite itself is very large and well-appointed, decorated so it feels warm and modern without being cluttered. They've given a lot of thought to their guests' comfort and it shows. I was surprised again and again by thoughtful little details. The rooms were spotless, bed (there are 3 but we only tried 1) was very comfortable, water pressure was great, no clogged drains (a pet peeve), plenty of hot water (just give it time), fresh newer linens and towels, very responsive thermostat, plenty of closet space. I definitely give it a 5 star, without a single reservation, one of the nicest places I've stayed in."

The kitchen basics are like those you’d find in a hotel (mini fridge, coffee maker) plus an electric kettle for hot water for tea/hot chocolate, cabinet space for a few items, a toaster and waffle maker, and a nice butcher block countertop. More living space by far than in nearby hotels. Pleasant back yard with lounge chairs. We could hear highway noise, but visually we were at the edge of the woods."
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Harold and Michelle's guesy suite is perfect for a fun relaxing getaway. The suite was very clean and worked great for our girls trip.

It rained nearly our entire stay, but we were happy and cozy watching movies under the blankets!
We found things to do in nearby Frankenmuth, and we were pleased to be so near to the farmers market. We’d recommend driving a short distance into Flint, and walking the grounds around Applewood, or checking out the Flint Institute of Art & their delicious cafe!
Thank you, Harold & Michelle!"
2021-10-01,5.0,Group trip,"We stayed here for two nights with 5 adults and Harold & Michelle’s place was great! We were able to use the fire pit to cook some delicious pizza pocket sandwiches.

2021-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Harold and Michelle were great hosts. The suite was very clean. They responded very quickly to questions that we asked. My grandsons enjoyed playing with the toys and games that were left in the suite. The only minor suggestion that I would give is to have a vacuum available in the suite.
2021-03-01,5.0,Group trip,"Amazing decor, comfortable beds, and great amenities."
2021-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Sparkling clean with many amenities. Harold & Michelle have thought of everything and have small touches that makes staying with them such a wonderful experience.

2021-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We loved our stay at Harold and Michelle's place. The space is beautiful, new, and very clean. The sleeping arrangements worked perfectly for our family with small children. They were kind enough to place a pack-n-play and high chair in the apartment before we arrived. They also provide toys, games, and even sleds for our kiddos to sled on their hill. We were in town for a funeral, and they made our stay so welcoming during a difficult time. We were grateful for the breakfast items and snacks provided for us. A very thoughtful touch. We would definitely stay here again."
2021-02-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,This place is extremely clean with a super homey feel. The bed and pillows were amazing. The owners gave me complete privacy but answered any questions i had almost immediately. I stayed for 3 wks while doing medical treatments in a nearby town. I felt extremely safe and never had to worry about snow since the owners made sure every flake was shoveled off. I very much appreciated that. Its a roomy place to stay even for a family. I would stay again if I ever found myself back in Michigan.
2021-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Wonderful place to stay with our 7 month old! Everything in the suite was very updated and clean!

To anyone looking for a nice clean apartment in Davidson."
2020-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This Airbnb was perfect! There was plenty of space for our family of 4 and lots of things to do (games, tv, snacks, firepit). I especially appreciated the extra touches (waffle maker, Christmas tree, extra toothbrush). Also they shovelled the snow on the walkway in the morning so we wouldn't slip. Very thoughtful and comfortable stay!"
2020-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We had a lovely stay at Michelle and Harold’s home! The pictures and description accurately represent the space, and they went out of their way to make us feel comfortable. We had a quiet stay with plenty of outdoor space to wander, and the apartment was sparkling clean. The kitchen was even stocked with breakfast food and coffee/tea to help start the day. We will definitely look to stay again if we are in the area."
2020-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Harold & Michelle had the perfect place for our girls weekend! It was so cute and comfortable! Definitely will be trying to find an excuse to return!!

2024-01-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"We were visiting my in-laws and wanted an economical place nearby with enough room to spread out. This place was absolutely spotless! Not a speck of dust anywhere, even on the baseboards (I checked. Lol!). The kitchen is beautiful with everything you need. Beds and furniture were all comfy with enough throws to relax while watching the bowl games. The instructions and micro site they shared made everything super easy. The hosts were very communicative and helpful. The only feedback is the tiny master shower. If they knocked out the wall with the stackable washer/dryer and made the shower longer, then this place would be perfect. Thanks for a relaxing time!"
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful home! Came for the weekend and it was perfect in every way! Close to where we needed to go and felt like home! Highly recommend!! Thanks Katie!

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"If you are staying in Flint, Michigan for any reason. This place is perfect for a group of 4 people. The rooms were very nice, and the living room and basement were very spacious. The backyard was wonderful with a great space for hanging out outside.
Perfect place surrounded by great restaurants that are just a few quick turns away.
Definitely will stay again, Thanks so much!"

2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,Great place. Much bigger in person and the backyard area was perfect for a family.

2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,We love staying at Crapo Manor. This was our second stay at this home and will choose to stay here again on a future trip. Affordable accommodation close to everything.

2023-09-01,4.0,Group trip,wonderful place to hang out with a small group of friends. cozy living room to hang out in at night.
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,AJ is a great host with a nice home. I will definitely stay again.
2023-08-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"This house met the expectations for the price listed. It was renovated - the floor was nice. The finishing touches were not done professionally…. Paper hiding under the dishwasher (the same paper that covers the window - no way to tie up the window ones, so you can’t see outside) It provided us a cheap place to stay while my husband was doing a medical school rotation at a hospital in grand blanc. The areas in flint are a little sketchy, but with the cultural center & applewood just a couple blocks away it felt safe enough. While visiting, we learned of the city’s thriving times, and devastating times. We chose to view the city through the eyes of hope and met people who were very nice. AJ was a great host - very responsive to our questions before traveling there. Even provided a brand new charcoal grill! Then once we were there I asked if there was another key so we would have 2…in the morning there was an extra key dropped off at the front door! Thank you for being so accommodating!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,A beautiful home. We fully enjoyed our stay at Crapo Manor and will trying to book it for our next trip to Flint in December. It was so nice we were able to relax and visit with family and not paying the high prices of the downtown hotels.
2023-06-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place. Quiet and tucked away. The place was dusty but I dont mind a bit of dust. Worth the money.
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Thank you very much for everything!! We'll be back soon! Regards
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This place is a major bargain! Also beautiful, clean and on a quiet street, close to many attractions. AJ was very easy going and responsive to messages. We would love to rent here again in the future."
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"A.J was an amazing host, always willing to help with my changing plans. Always accommodating. I will definitely be back when i see availability."
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,Great host always responsive and no matter what the problem always calm and helpful.Would definitely recommend to everyone.
2023-01-01,3.0,Stayed over a week,"The stay was good to the point we had it extended. Good quiet neighborhood, low traffic.
Home was a bit chilly for the season and could not find the temp controls to heat up. Understanding the need to make a profit at such a low cost to stay there, we did not ask the host to correct."
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Flint can be a dubious area, but this home was located very close to the highway intersection which made it easy to get to. It is close to the police station, public library, children's museum and was remarkably quiet and peaceful. Some of the homes look a little run down in the area but there are also a lot of nicely renovated homes. This one is one of nicely renovated homes and was very nice and comfortable. AJ was prompt in feedback, provided easy instructions and gave great recommendations for food. We would certainly stay here again if we come this way again."
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,AJ’s is a nice place to stay. Very close to cultural center and the highway. Three rooms allowed us to stay as a family of four very comfortably. They also gave us very clear directions and proactive communication. Recommend if you want to stay in the city.
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Great value. Responsive host. Comfy beds
2022-09-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,"AJ was very good at communication and answering questions. The home was clean. The beds were comfortable. I loved the large downstairs closet where we could have our clothes so that they were out of the way and not laying around the bedroom. There is a kitchen, but at the time we stayed there were no utensils provided to make a full meal so we had to eat out the entire time. The location/neighborhood was run down with several abandoned and dilapidated buildings. Unfortunately, we would not return to this location."
2022-08-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Came in town for a girls trip . Had a very pleasant stay there .
2022-07-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Great value for the price! We enjoyed our time there.

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I loved Kay's place! The home looked just like the pictures, it was peaceful, and clean. I would definitely go back✨"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The house is as cute as can be! The location to Kettering couldn't have been better. There was a missing remote after the previous cleaning...one text about it and it was fixed right away. If our son chooses Kettering we will be staying here any chance we get.
2024-04-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Kay was great and the place was very comfortable!
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Kay’s place was beautiful bright and clean! Thank you so much!
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The place was beautiful, comfy, and great backyard, I will come back again and again. The house is top notch ( and close to all the dispensaries and liquor stores)"
2023-08-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,Okay place.
2023-07-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,"Nice space, great fenced yard for our dog, hot tub was broken which was a bummer, but Kay was very understanding and provided a refund. Little noisy but not noticeable inside."
2023-07-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,"The home was very clean and nicely rehabbed and decorated. Bed was very comfortable (2 beds but we only used one). Neighborhood was quiet and we had lots of options for long dog walks. The hot tub was out of service. Wasn’t a deal breaker for us, but if it is important for future bookers, best to ask if it’s working before booking. We were only notified as we were driving to the home on our check in date. Otherwise fully fenced in back yard was really nice and it is great to be able to park inside of the fence/behind a gate. The largest tier of the three tiered coffee table in front of the couch was broken so there wasn’t much room to put things down while watching TV. Kay was very responsive when we couldn’t get the TV to work at first - we eventually realized we needed to replace the batteries in the remote - and she directed us to where there were plenty of spares. Nice welcome basket and note upon arrival!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Great place!
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Had a great stay! Kay was always accessible and very helpful with whatever we needed!

Thank you so much kay"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Nice clean house!
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The place was super clean and quiet. The house is even more beautiful than the pictures. The host responded quickly. I will definitely be back.
2023-04-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"House is nice and fairly manageable with some perks, and a few shortcomings. The backyard is awesome, (the fire pit my favorite spot), and would be more so if/when owner gets hot tub repaired/up and running. The living/dining/kitchen open space is comfortable and easy to manage activities, but no need for excess tabletop decor -we needed to be move to use well (dine/games/etc). Same for bath-there’s only one shelf -we needed for toiletries, so excess ‘stuff’ crowded the space. The bedrooms are nice enough- one had a comfortable pillowtop mattress, but the other had quite a firm (hard - not too comfortable mattress -at least to my taste). A downfall of the bedrooms is there’s no real place to put a suitcase to access clothes etc. If there was a dresser in the one room, that would be an option, but travelers like to open suitcase up- we had to finagle things in order to do so. Biggest shortcoming was lack of electric outlets. Bedrooms and bath had only one each. Overall good stay."
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Kay is a great host!!
I accidentally locked ourselves out of her house, and she came by within 10 minutes to let us in.
She is a very nice woman and will be staying there next time we come to Flint."
2022-11-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,This was a very nice place. Very clean & quiet. Enjoyed my weekend here. Didn’t have any issues checking in. Didn’t need to contact host for anything as she provided everything we would need. Close to Walmart & other stores for necessities. I would recommend & I definitely would stay here again if I ever come to Flint
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Nice place!
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very nice place I will be coming back❤️
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We just returned from a few week's stay and we’re very pleased. The house was very spacious and well stocked. The host was very flexible and pleasant to communicate with us! This was very much appreciated! The neighborhood was VERY quiet at all times of the day. The house is very close to a few restaurants and a small university…made the stay very easy! We have already discussed returning next year! Thank you Kay!
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Kay's place is a beautifully redone older home close to downtown. It's very comfortable and Kay is a great host. We'd definitely stay again!

2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Everything went smooth for such a last minute booking! The house was great for my weekend trip. Clean & comfortable. I would definitely book again!
,,,"Would not stay here again. It is very loud when it rains. They present things that look as if they are free but have a hidden charge card for them. The shower doesn’t even stay cold for a single shower, and even after waiting 2 hours for the second shower, it had less than 30 seconds of hot water for that shower."
