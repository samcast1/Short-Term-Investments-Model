You’re about an hour away from Holly beach which is a great shell beach, 45 mins from the wetland trail and if casinos are your thing tons of them around.

The apartment was very spacious and cozy and well equipped with everything we needed for our 2 week stay. We enjoyed the backyard view of the bayou and the singing cardinals. It was a quiet neighborhood and we felt very safe staying there.
Local parks and beaches made great day trips, golfing was good, grocery store only a few blocks away. Lots of great waterfowl viewing at local sanctuaries.
Although Westlake is very industrialized, we found nearby Lake Charles' historic disrict lovely to tour."

Check in and out was so simple. She even provided a few perks to make our stay special and welcoming. Now the place. In WestLake right on the bayou! Incredible sunsets and sunrises from the upper deck on the back facing the water. Super cute little years with chairs and a spot to fish. Extremely well taken care of. We felt like we had our very own house on the bayou. Close to one of the best Burger (Round Top Burgers) places in town and some incredible soul food not far away as well (Biscuits and Jamz). We were here for a baseball tournament but recommend for families or couples. About 10-15 min to the Lake District but close to Cajun trail and lots of wildlife and gators you can see south near the gulf. Can’t say enough how good it was."

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"All I could say is wow!! My family and I were in Lake Charles for a church event, and we really felt like we were in our 2nd home! The area was very nice and quiet, and remotely close to everything in Lake Charles. It was perfect for our family of 4, and comfortable and spacious enough for others to come and visit. They provided us with many accommodations such as towels, trash bags, silverware, etc.
The host was very responsive as well. She answered any questions/concerns that we had in a timely manner and was so polite. If you are in search of a nice and comfortable air bnb in the Lake Charles area, look no further! Very satisfied!"

Inside - beautiful, spacious - the bed is soooo comfortable - little treats and water in the fridge. I enjoyed the presence of Martha, the ""shared"" neighborhood cat. Spotless, everything you need for a perfect stay. Lake Charles has a lot of great restaurants and things to do, but you might just want to stay in with this little gem of an AirBNB. I came for McNeese's graduation, but enjoyed the quiet and relaxation of a few days away from it all. Thank you, Carolyn!"

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The house is so incredibly cute inside, very romantic stay for two.

2023-09-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"We enjoyed our stay. The home is small but cute. Well renovated and decorated. I loved the little touches of water in the fridge, the toothbrushes/paste with the little Qtips.
There was a cat that lives on-site that scratched up the hood of our car. It liked to sit on top of the vehicles. The back door felt very unsafe with the deadbolt so low and I didn’t love how there was a door to the front of the home in the bedroom but other then that it was fine for one night"

2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"One of the most charming places we have stayed. This was our second time here and we enjoyed it very much. The hosts have thought of everything.
Keep in mind that much of the charm is that the property is not perfect-it has some lovely quirks, since it is an older house and neighborhood.
We love everything about it and had everything we needed-including a complimentary bottle of wine and a sweet treat in the fridge when we arrived.
The decor is unique and extremely cozy and felt like home to us. The covered parking is a wonderful perk as well.
We have recommended it to everyone we know.
Thanks for a great experience.
Emily and Paul"

While we’re excited to move into our new home, we will definitely miss Petit Maison!"

2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,It was 100% perfect. We will be staying again when we come to town.
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"It’s the details for me. What an amazing experience, from walking into the room with the music playing and the fireplace going it takes you from Louisiana to somewhere else completely. Opening up the fridge to a chilled bottle of wine and sweet cupcake, was icing on the cake (or cupcake, haha). Then, can you even with the handmade soaps in the bathroom?
Carolyn is extremely responsive and provides amble information for you on the desk, including a coupon to a local coffee shop.
The only thing unexpected for me was the location. It’s so close to downtown, an easy drive or Uber ride (unless you really love to walk), but it’s in a neighbor that’s currently being “refurbished” so there is a mix of remodeled homes and some rundown places that need TLC. However, I think this comes with being so close to a downtown area and no fault of the owner of course, we just thought it was important to note.
Thank you for a wonderful visit! You nailed it with every detail."
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Very clean
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Carolyn is an amazing host. She puts detailed touches that make you feel at home. She has lists of attractions and personally sends a message with something to do that you may enjoy based on your profile. We were greeted by a lovely flower arrangement and a small chalkboard that welcomed us by name. The fridge was stocked with bottled waters, a nice bottle of white wine and a cute cupcake. Very nice touch. You can tell she cares very much about the guests comfort and experience."

2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"For our first time at Lake Charles this is a Cute little getaway spot. Small and spacious for a couple needing a some R&R. close enough to the casinos and Ryan St. but able to get some quiet time away from the crowds.
felt very welcomed as soon as we walked in. clear instructions on how and where to park as well as suggestions of where to go. appreciated the detail Carolyn has given in this little one bedroom.
if opportunity presents itself will definitely come back."

2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is such a cozy place. Carolyn and Joel thought of everything: homemade soap, a sweet treat, wine, beautiful decor, comfy bed, little extras you might forget to pack, and thoughtful touches like charging stations! It's a good location--close to everything you would want to check out in Lake Charles, and there are even coupons for different restaurants. The check in and check out is super easy. At one point, the guests next door were loud, and it's a duplex, so you can hear them, but Carolyn talked to them, and the next night was quiet. We would stay here again."

The home is adorable and the hosts were so incredibly nice and helpful. There were so many surprise personal touches that really made this stay top notch.
The home was in a great location as we were able to walk down to the lake and downtown to grab some breakfast. If you have kids there is an amazing park down by the water as well.
I hope our travels bring us through Lake Charles again so we can stay at this awesome home!"

2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We enjoyed everything. The styling and size of the unit was great and it happened to be a mile from the wedding venue which was perfect. The coupons, cake and soaps were a nice touch. The parking is less than ideal for someone in a larger vehicle but the road construction was really the issue, as parking on the road would obstruct traffic. Such a minor thing though and it’s temporary. We would definitely stay again."

Everything described and more, thanks to the host’s amazing attention to detail.
All of the little thoughtful touches were wonderful and we had everything we needed.
Having the covered parking spot just steps away was very convenient, as the weather was quite chilly during our stay. And the location was perfect for attending an event at the Civic Center, as well as visiting various friends and family around town. We found plenty of great restaurants nearby as well.
The host is a delight to communicate with and it was a pleasure to meet her in person, as well.
The cottage is beautifully decorated-a very cozy and romantic setting that soothes the soul.
We will definitely come back!"

2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Words cannot adequately describe how lovely our 10 day stay was.
Even though we have family in Lake Charles, their home was not suitable for accommodate us as my husband is extremely low vision and the steps.
However it was very important for us to have a home that “Gran-Mimi” could cook and have our family over.
After a thousand plus mile drive, walking into Amor was next level.
Extremely clean, stocked with a basket of goodies and a sweet welcome sign.
We were not encumbered with a million “to do’s” as in past experiences from hosts.
Let me express that when you look at the pictures of this lovely home you are looking at exactly what you will be staying in💯
I can’t express how many times we’ve been disappointed because obviously the previous places were shot with a wide angle lens!
And the master bed!!
Absolutely the most comfortable bed we had ever slept on.
In conclusion, you can find less expensive or more expensive but you’ll never regret staying here."

The house has so many different rooms and hallways…discovering everything was so much fun…almost like a treasure hunt, because each room is a true find!! This is definitely THE house for cooking, relaxing, reading a book, playing pool, hanging out with friends and family, and enjoying Lake Charles. Jamie has thought of every detail and personal needs in each room/living space. Just bring your clothes, friends/family, and throw some lasagna in the oven!!
Unfortunately due to the weather we couldn’t enjoy the lovely pool area and grill…but, there’s always another visit in our future.
The only concern we had was the close proximity to the interstate.
Thank you Jamie!! See you in the spring!"
2024-01-01,5.0,Group trip,"Perfect NYE & birthday weekend trip! Everything we needed was available in the home and all the amenities were great. It was too cold for the pool but had fun learning to play pool inside.
Especially loved the living area, being able to watch TV in our down time and also play pool all together was nice.
The weather was amazing and we even were able to BBQ some steaks for lunch.
Not a huge gambler but the casinos were only a 6-7 minute Uber ride away. And the local mall was only 5 minutes away! Win-win for all.
Thank you Jamie for everything and especially always communicating prior to our stay and anytime we had a question.
We will return this summer!!
Gorgeous, clean and roomy home!"

From the outdoor charcoal pit to the kitchen we had everything we needed to make some amazing meals! We spent most of our time in the pool and were pleasantly surprised to find so many pool floats to use. I do recommend bringing a life jacket for littles or weak swimmers as it is a legit pool and gets deep. The kids loved that it had a diving board! AMAZING! The game room was such a great place to hang out together as well! The couch in there is so comfy and spacious, not to mention the whole vibe is very cozy also. The pool table was a hit as well!

Coffee pods, creamer, lots of plates/kid plates, pack-n-play, etc. The host was wonderfully responsive and very easy to work with throughout the stay. Only a couple things to mention, no blinds in any of the bedrooms just sheer curtains, so if you have kids it may be an early wake up call. The pool isn’t heated and literally looks/backs to the freeway. There was a fair amount of road noise outside but didn’t bother us inside. Overall it was a very pleasant stay and I would stay here again."

Hosts stopped by the house to turn on the porch lights and a few lamps on the home, which was so appreciated after a long drive. The home is in an upscale and beautiful neighborhood and we always felt safe. The location of the home is within walking distance (around the corner) of Prien Lake Park, and we enjoyed daily walks with our dog along the numerous walking paths around the lake and park. The beautiful sunsets over Prien Lake are a must see!
Inside the home, we had everything we needed for our stay. The kitchen was fully stocked, the rooms were spacious, and we loved the open layout of the kitchen/living area.

The air conditioning was locked at 70 which kept it around 74 in July so keep that in mind if you are in need of a lower temp for sleeping. 5 stars for this venue!
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,What a perfect place to stay while visiting Lake Charles. The house was well furnished from kitchen to bath and super clean. The smart lock feature added to the feeling of safety...having the code changed for each guest is great. Having lamps with accessible plugs and usb connection made charging devices so easy...no looking under the bed or behind the dresser for a plug. Hopefully for our next visit the temperature outdoors will be a little cooler so we can enjoy the patio which is so well set up. I was surprised how quiet the nieghborhood was...you can hear the birds calling early morning if you venture outdoors. We will definitely plan to stay at this lovely home again.

The decor was so chic and the living space was absolutely perfect for a night in after a long day in the car. I had my infant twins and their Pack and Plays fit so easily beside the bed and we still had plenty of room! All in all, I loved our stay and I would stay again! Shylah’s small touches really make it perfect. Thanks for a great stay!"

2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We really enjoyed our stay at the Bayou Chambre. The location is convenient for access to Lake Charles where the mall and plenty other stores are. Being on the water is very peaceful and calming. Every amenity listed by Shylah is available and she provides very clear instructions and plenty of listings for restaurants and things to do/ places to visit. If you’re in the area I definitely recommend either of Shylahs locations and you must try The Max!! The food and atmosphere is unmatched!

2023-12-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Place was clean. Very small one room loft. Neighborhood was not the nicest. RV trailer park is right next door. However, the place is quaint and host has provided many extras. Love that it has a washer/dryer. It is very loud so start the washer when you’re leaving for dinner etc. I loved there was a full coffee pot and many herbal teas to choose from. We would stay again for sure."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Highly recommended.
2023-12-01,4.0,Stayed one night,Just stayed for the night on our way to New Orleans. Nice property. Room is below another AirBnb room so it was a little noisy hearing other guests. Had good ventilation and was cool in the Louisiana humidity.
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We had everything we needed at the Bayou Chambré. We enjoyed sitting at the bayou’s edge and watching the birds. Would recommend Shylah’s place for anyone traveling to the Lake Charles area.

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"5/5 ⭐️ - Shylah is a wonderful host! You can tell that they truly love hosting. If you like farmhouse feels, you’ll love this one. The shower was older to
me but throughly clean. Ideally location to the casinos!"
2023-10-01,4.0,Stayed one night,My stay was quick but I did appreciate how easy it was to find the space. It was clean and look exactly like the pictures. The only downside was the slow WiFi which just usually happens when you’re in a woody area. But other than that I would recommend you all to stay!
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Shylah was great. Response timecwas wonderful. She even let us check in a little early

2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Shylah’s Bayou Chambre was beautiful, we wish we could’ve stayed longer! If we’re back in town that will be where we stay. Her family made too much catfish, so she brought us some over."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I made a few errors, but nothing that was the cause of the owner or property."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This was our first stay but most definitely and hopefully will not be our last. The place was perfect. Quiet and cozy. Very peaceful. Everything you needed was well thought out. probably one of the best places we have ever stayed in for the price for sure. We will definitely recommend to anyone. Looking forward to our next trip to LC!

2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,I only got to spend a single night here since I was just stopping for a place to sleep in the middle of moving to a new state. I wish I was staying longer and could take the time to really enjoy the bayou and explore the area! It was such a great place to relax and rejuvenate before my next long day of driving.

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,we had a great stay! the bed so so comfortable that I fell asleep with my makeup on lol
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This was hands down one of the best air bnb experiences ever! After driving 16 hours in 2 days I wanted to get out and walk around, and rest. This place provided both of those things for me. The property is beautiful, right on the water! I was able to kayak and walk the property. The bed and space was so clean and comfortable. Fresh flowers and a hand written note when I arrived. Everything was perfect and well thought out. This is the only place I will book when I pass through Louisiana!!! Thank you Shyla!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great stay!
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Felt right at home. Everything you need for a weekend stay. She literally thinks of everything. Would definitely recommend and stay again!
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"The cottage was perfect for my 11 year old and myself. He would fish every morning before I even woke up, he even took the kayak out by himself! I was too afraid of the alligators to go with him!
The bed was comfy, all the dishes and pans you’ll need for cooking.
One thing to note was the smell in the room was pretty strong with diffusers, especially for such a small place. So if you’re sensitive to strong fragrances you may want to ask them to remove all the smelly things a day or two before you arrive.
Also, there are no doors or windows that look out into the water, which would be nice, but nothing they can do about that. But not a big deal to walk around to the back of the house to get to the water.
Overall it’s a 5 star cottage. We would stay there again."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,we loved the beautiful touches of this quaint place..private and easy to find..a great place to relax..we will share with friends and plan to return soon
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,great places lots to do
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Shylah’s place was fantastic! One of our favorites by far. The accommodations were spotless and inviting, and Shayla was an excellent host. She provided us with several local cafe recommendations that were spot on (The Bekery and the Village Coffeehouse are 10/10!).
I wish there was a Bayou Chambre in every location we visit!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Had an amazing stay in the Bayou chambre. The location is incredible, with the view over the water unbeatable. Shylah had everything on hand we could possibly need and even more than the description.
Would highly recommend to anyone wanting to visit the area!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,The sweet little note and flowers for Mother’s Day was a very kind thought. My mama passed 2 years ago & my daughter & I try to do something every year together since. It’s so nice to have a great place to end our weekend with. Thanks so much for letting us check in early. We took advantage and just relaxed in the wonderful comfy bed.
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This is my first review ever and I’ve stayed at plenty of Airbnbs. This is place is perfect for a solo or couple get away to Lake Charles. You’re just a few minutes away from all things you came for but for half the price. The place is super clean and cozy. Not very often do you find a Airbnb that has EVERYthing you could possibly need stocked up free of charge. Paired with a great host that is very friendly and accommodating this is great place to stay.
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Came to town for a wedding and this cozy retreat was nothing short of spectacular. Great location, super close to great restaurants, breweries and local spots. Would absolutely recommended!"

The surrounding areas and water are beautiful and made for a relaxing environment during my stay. Highly recommend staying here!"
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Thanks so much for hosting us! We had an amazing time and hope to be back soon. The location was wonderful and the crawfish festival was amazing. We loved your food and entertainment recommendations. Hope to stay again!

It also had an amazing backyard with tranquil views of flora and fauna and the option to canoe the waterways. Overall it was a fantastic stay and one to remember.
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Shylah went above and beyond ! My friend and I were there for a wedding and couldn’t get our hair stuff to reach the mirrors we asked about an extension cord if there was one by chance and there wasn’t and she had one to us within a short amount of time. Highly recommend and would most def book again ! She was very communicable and prompt. Very clear check in and check out. Very nice place and environment. Can’t say enough good things ! Even had homemade cups cakes waiting for us !
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Wow! We have been lucky enough to stay in a number of airbnbs and this is the best we have stayed in. The location is beautiful! The kayaking was fantastic and the scenery was wonderful. We loved sitting out enjoying the last of the sun in the evening. It is peaceful too, we slept so well! The place is well equipped and we were grateful to cook our own meal. Shylah’s instructions were clear and we had no issues checking in. Thank you Shylah for a wonderful stay - the cupcakes were delicious too!"
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Quaint and quiet. the space was perfect. lots of small touches that made it perfect. would definitely recommend to anyone.
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Shylah is a fantastic host, and her place was amazing. I was looking for a place to work remotely for a few days while I hit up the casinos at night. This place perfectly fit the bill. It's clean, cozy, and convenient to everything. She knows the local food scene, is super responsive, and goes above and beyond. I'd love to come back when the weather is suitable for kayaking on the bayou!"

2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We really enjoyed our night at Shylahs. It was cute, comfortable, and had everything we needed. She even provided laundry detergent so we could do a quick load of laundry before heading back on our road trip cross country. I loved the relaxing vibe and it smelled wonderful! The doc was so nice to sit and enjoy our morning coffee and I had to sit for a bit on the swings under the trees because it was too inviting to resist. Shylah recommended a great restaurant so we could try authentic creole cuisine. She also made us delicious cupcakes for dessert. She goes out of the way to make your stay special. My only regret is we couldn’t stay longer."
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great host. Essential needs were fully stocked on arrival. Great little space for a couple lookin to explore lake Charles. Cupcakes left for us were fantastic!
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"It is a cozy place with great view and all required amenities. Shylah is the best host I've ever known.

2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Bayou Chambre was a great place to stay. Quiet and peaceful within a beautiful setting. We had everything we needed. The bed was exceptionally comfortable also. Thanks so much Shylah for providing a great place to stay while visiting with family. See you again soon.
2023-03-01,4.0,Stayed over a week,"Two complaints, first, the check out tasks. I disliked that the host asked to leave dishes clean, remove sheets, etc. Especially because I was in town for work. I would leave at 5am everyday, and get off until 7pm. I don’t have time for that. I barely have time to sleep. If I’m paying a cleaning fee, I’d think that’s what it would be for.
Secondly, there was an upstairs unit. Since, I was waking up at 4:30 am everyday, I really valued every hour of sleep I got. With the upstairs unit, you could hear absolutely everything.
Other than that, the host is absolutely great. She was quick to respond. Literally within 5 minutes. Resolved any issue I had. She’s great. It was so clean, smelled great when I first walked in. Ac is super cold. The washer and dryer was a great amenity. The backyard is peaceful. The area is very safe. Parking is inside the property. I would book again."
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The inside was decorated perfectly, everything has a purpose and it’s not cluttered whatsoever (the automatic light in the bathroom was a perfect touch. all appliances are full sized but perfectly located to not feel cramped. Overall 10/10 would definitely stay again."
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,My husband and I had a great mini-vacation! Shylah's place felt like our home away from home. Will definitely keep this little gem in mind for the next time we need a break from our daily lives.
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Comfortable stay, had everything you need. Full sized stove and refrigerator, washer and dryer. Parking right in front. Clean and no clutter. Definitely worth the money."
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Will definitely stay here again! Adorable, quiet, comfy little suite. Shyla is very responsive. She has stocked both kitchen & bathroom with all things a traveler might forget which is priceless to me!"
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Every detail that you could imagine was there. To name a few: water filter, coffee, toothpicks, toothpaste, soap and dryer sheets for the washer dryer and the list goes on. Very comfy. I didn’t need anything but she was right in the area and all I had to do was ask."
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Wow, what an amazing airbnb!! Shylah was absolutely the best hostess. The home was so cozy and comfy! We loved the decorations and special touches she had at the Chambre. The cupcakes she made for us were delicious. She made a list of Cajun food we needed to try in the area. I highly recommend this air bnb for a quick get away vacation to Lake Charles. We can’t wait to go back!!"
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Shyla is an amazing host. She made me cupcakes and asked me what kind of wine I like (too bad I am doing a Dry January!). She has impeccable taste in décor and textiles as well. I loved how she had anticipated every need, from well stocked kitchen to a cup by the sink for my toothbrush. I felt pampered staying here. I will be back next time I am in town for sure!"
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Cute, comfortable, & stylish! Shylah was so responsive and had a nice personal touch - the handwritten note & bakery bread was heartfelt. When we come back to Lake Charles, we will make sure to book here!"
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"What an amazing place and location. Right on the bayou, beautiful dock, kayaks, and all the amenities. Not to mention the hosts were absolutely amazing. These people make me want to host Airbnbs. They made it fun and personable. Very well decorated, great price point, and super clean!! We’re coming back for sure!!"
2022-12-01,3.0,Stayed one night,It was okay.

Sometimes it's the little things that make the biggest impact. May God continue to bless this place, and Merry Christmas from Texas!"
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Shylah is a perfect host!! Her home is nicely decorated, and cozy with a VERY comfortable bed. She checked on us several times to see if we needed anything. The one time we mentioned something, she and her husband quickly took care of it. In fact, she went above and beyond, and did so within the hour. When we returned, Shylah had surprised us with 2 more cupcakes (my birthday was the next day), a package of their local boudin (which was my first time to taste it ... and it was delicious), and a Christmas movie playing on the TV (because we had trouble with it the night before). Although the reason why we were in the Lake Charles/Westlake area kept us from sightseeing, we appreciated the brochures of attractions. Thoroughly enjoyed lunch (fish and shrimp tacos) at Steamboat Bill's before heading home. Thank you, Shylah, for your kindness! We hope to return one day!
Merry Christmas!!"

Her little personal touches did not go unnoticed; with the binder of recommendations, fresh flowers, cupcakes, a free car wash and a hand written note; we felt extremely welcomed and would come back any time!"

2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I cannot say enough good things about this place. Shylah went above and beyond to make our stay a special and memorable anniversary weekend. The attention to detail is comparable to any five star resort that I have visited. I would highly recommend having coffee outside by the water. It was such a quiet peaceful place. My husband wanted me to add that the bed was super comfy and the a/c was superb even with it being 110° outside.
We will definitely be back."

2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Though away for the weekend, Shylah’s communication was impeccable throughout the entirety of our stay! She was extremely accommodating and thoughtful, leaving zinnia flowers, snacks, a candle and some detergent and softener for potential loads of laundry. The space is super cute and in a peaceful neighborhood. It was nice to sit by the water and see the ducks and heron come in the mornings to visit.

The bayou is perfect with her little deck to have morning coffee or a glass of wine at the end of the day to watch the sunset. She provided a BBQ Grill for me to grill. the swinga are an added touch. This little place is the perfect size and great for any special occasion. I recommend this place 110%. One of the best Air BnB's I have rented.

Beds were so comfortable! Like sleeping on a cloud. Decoré is beautiful just as depicted in the pictures, with high quality linens and products throughout. The property is so peaceful and private.

The hosts were very easy to communicate with and quick to respond. There was a storm while we were there, which knocked out the power - we weren't there at the time it hit, but we received a message right away asking if we were ok and if we needed anything. Once we got back, the power had already been restored but the AC was still out. We contacted the hosts and they were able to get the AC repairman out quickly and he was able to replace the blown fuse from the storm and get everything up and running again. We were surprised at how fast the repairman came, we can't get them to come that fast at our own home! The hosts were very apologetic and offered to reimburse us some money, even though the storm was completely out of their control and was no one's fault. Very sweet of them to do that! We would definitely stay there again - very cute, cozy and clean place."

2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,WOW - I have stayed in many Airbnb's over the past few years all over the North America and Mexico. This is the best AirBnb I've ever stayed in. The place is superior in cleanliness - you can smell it when you walk through the door. The small details in this place make you feel like you're at home. The bathrooms are set nicely with amenities and plenty of towels! The couches are so comfortable and great for relaxing in the evening. The beds are amazing! I slept like a baby and had the best sleep I've had in a long time! There are lots of windows for natural light but they all have curtains so you can block out the sun and sleep in. I dined on the delicious food in LC so I didn't cook anything but the kitchen has everything you need for eating in. 5 stars to Kelli and Joe on their place!!

2018-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,I stayed with Kelli and Joe for just the night but the hospitality was amazing! Kelli greeted me at the door and offered to help bring in my bags.

2018-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I previously stayed with Kelli and Joe before, and loved it so much I stayed again. Kelli is just the sweetest and so accommodating. I stayed with them for a bit while working in Lake Charles and it was such a great place for me. First and foremost, the place is very clean and safe! I've always been particular about cleanliness and not many places meet my full expectations. As far as safety, I got off work late at night and never felt unsafe. Kelli is also very up to date with the new technology on home security and has it in her home. Secondly, she has great taste. The house is very homey, comfortable, and well decorated. My bedroom was so cute and nothing felt cheap. The bed was super comfortable with quality pillows, sheets, and comforter. As far as ""feeling weird being in a random person's house"", I quickly got over it. Kelli and Joe are so friendly and I could talk to them for hours! They felt like friends right off the bat. I never felt weird using the fridge or doing laundry. My bedroom and bathroom is in a section away from their room/living room area so there were times I never saw them. It's really up to you how much interaction you want with them. I definitely recommend Kelli and Joe's place!"
2018-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I would rate Joe and Kelli’s place 6 six stars if I could. Our room was so clean and comfortable. Their house is super cute, clean, and homey. Kelli met us at the door and I instantly liked her and Joe. They’re so friendly and hospitable. This was actually our first experience renting a private room in somebody’s house and we enjoyed it. We even hung out with Joe and Kelli just talking and watching tv. You kind of feel like you’ve been friends with them for awhile! Definitely recommend this place!"
2018-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Here for work. They were extremely nice and accommodating. we didn't get to talk much because of my work hours but in the short time I really enjoyed them. Their bed was so comfortable. The bedroom and bathroom were clean. Take note they keep it very cold at night. which I enjoy but if you don't like it that cold they will accommodate you with extra blankets or turning the heat up.
solid stay. would stay again"
2018-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Joe and Kelli are incredible hosts. They are so welcoming and hospitable. The rooms are well decorated and they add nice little touches to make your stay more comfortable. I came in to find a cold bottle of water and a York peppermint patty on my nightstand, as well as a google assistant and a binder with details on local restaurants and things to do. The location truly is just minutes from the casinos and was a great way to save some money. I highly recommend staying with Joe and Kelli to anyone visiting the Lake Charles area."
2018-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Anyone will be hard pressed to find a more welcoming, comfortable, and personalized stay than you will at Joe and Kelli's. They are true hosts and offer a homestyle quality that is above any others around. Enjoy!"

2024-06-01,5.0,Group trip,"Trip to Lake Charles for McNeese graduation. Plenty of room for all 6 of us to sleep and hang out. Two sitting areas made it nice to stay quiet when the early risers were up. The back yard and porch are fantastic. You’d never know you’re that close to downtown. House was well maintained and furnished and there was nothing we needed or wanted that wasn’t there.
Some have commented about the noise/music from the bar next door but it never bothered us at all. Overall a great location, especially to downtown shops, walking around the lake, restaurants, bars, etc. 10/10"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Jason by far has been one of the best hosts we have ever had the pleasure to work with. He was quick to respond and very helpful when we had a stressful situation come up. He was there to help when he didn’t have to. We would love to stay again the next time we have to be in the area.

The host was respectful and efficient in responding and quite kind. We would definitely stay again. The kitchen was fully equipped although we did not use except for great Kerig coffee pot and dishes. So much good food at OB’s right next door
We arrived right after horrific storm and yet everything went smoothly. I thank God and Jason for their kindness and compassion. We want to stay again. Thank you."

2023-12-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"This house is decorated beautifully. The Christmas tree was gorgeous and I really like the house. However, the host is not responsive and there is no blow dryer in the house and no reception for the TV although there are three or four TVs in the house none of them provide entertainment Only one frying pan in the house so definitely needs more pots and pans. Lots of other dishes though."

2023-10-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"Very lovely home. Clean, cozy and great set up inside. Our only complaint was that the next door neighbor is a bar. It was extremely loud, especially 12-2 am. You’re in down town Lake Charles so if that is what you’re there for then it’s great. But I was there with my family. But otherwise beautiful space and home."
,,,We loved Jason's place and will definitely stay there again. Beautifully decorated!!
